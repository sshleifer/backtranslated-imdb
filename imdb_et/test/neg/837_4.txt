The film begins with Dandy gunfight, where three bands are quickly beaten by a bounty hunter - a bounty hunter who carries Clint Eastwood's trilogy more than just a superficial man (FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, FOR FEW) DOLLARS MORE and GOOD BAD and UGLY). <br /> <br /> Immediately after that you will see this man in a gold train full of Union soldiers. Of course, the shipment is being attacked and soldiers are fighting like blind guys so they are quickly neutralized. However, one of the wagons, one of the bandits beats the gang leader (Gilbert Roland) and drives off with gold. Soon Roland will come up and find out where the gold is hidden. But at this very moment, the army will rise and kill the betrayer. But a person who doesn't have a name thinks Roland knows the treasure and maybe the key is the medal given to Roland by the bearer. The strange banker is also mixed. All three want gold and all three look pretty macho. <br /> <br /> In general, this is not particularly special for the West. Much of this is a plot, some of which is that George Hilton (Uruguayan, despite America's sounding name) is not as interesting as Eastwood or any other major West Spaghetti star, but most of it is because the soundtrack just sucks. So often music doesn't even match the actors and it seems almost randomly added. Plus, it's not just a very good thing. This is not clearly the work of Ennio Morricone, the musical master of the Spaghetti genre. <br /> <br /> Generally, just a passerby - and not a very good start.
