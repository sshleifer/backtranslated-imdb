Class C cast and badly moved scenes, along with terrible actions, have also made me believe that it would make a good TV release, such as the FX outfit. But in my local blocking, there are about 9 copies on the shelves, none of which was on the title (I don't know why ...) this title was not, but the title was "ridiculous" the director was almost ridiculous. was going on. The number of deaths at the bottom of the screen was sometimes completely inconsistent with the plot, for example, when the chopper went over to Angola and the subject was the speeding speed of 23â€“24. (maybe several hours or even a day, or after the chopper has landed), the dead count is also pushed back in the chopper area. The films ended up with a huge whole of the whole plot and God knows no one is waiting for a sequel. Anyway, don't rent it, but I suggest you look at it only if you got the headline without any financial loss, and you're in for a moody cheesecake.
