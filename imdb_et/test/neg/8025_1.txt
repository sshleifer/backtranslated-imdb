After hearing that some people were involved with the low-budget flop "Terror Rock'n'Roll Önsjönis" and "It came from space ... and things", I decided not to see this DVD. I wish it wasn't. The other films were funny, tongue-cheek, and stupid. Although Kraftverk 3714 has no humor at all. And it's so pious that I just think about it. The worst participants are possible, the worst possible script, the worst special effects. And the most rude sex sex ever. Uhhh. And the whole thing goes on for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Please never make another movie.
