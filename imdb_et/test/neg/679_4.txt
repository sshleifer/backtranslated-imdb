Tamara Anderson and her family are moving again when her traveling painter's father pursues her next landscape. Fifteen years old, he is in his rebel phase. Already angry with his father because of their frequent relocation, his anger aggravates when his mother is confined to the tuberculosis sanatorium. The absence of his mother causes Tamara to seize his father and the faith, the comfort of a neighbor, Rusty, and the spirit of a dead teenager who lived in his rented house. <br /> <br /> The story is modest. This is a strange pace and even during emotional scenes there is no tension. The older actors are good. Alberta Watson is incredibly charismatic as a sick mother, and Maria Rossa is a particularly effective mother of a dead teenage guilt. But Katie Boland, like Tamara, is too amateur to wear a movie. The dialogue is very natural and Boland can't pull it out completely. He has his moments and, if he hits them, he may be good, but he was too many times when he came out uncomfortably. We see her thinking "ok, that's what my line is, and it's the face I should do" instead of actually responding to others. He is not the only one, Kevin Zegers as Rusty and Megan Park, because his sister Brenda also carries a sting, but at least they have fewer scenes. <br /> <br /> If it was done correctly, the scenario would have been a film that influenced him. And it also has moments, but much of it is hidden in leadership and flat management.
