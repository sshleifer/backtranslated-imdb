I don't expect much from ghost stories, but I hope the story makes a little sense! Does it require too much from the scriptwriter and filmmaker? How bad a boy, maybe just a homicidal maniac just because a bunch of crows are gonna catch him, then I have a problem with spending $ 9.00! Alfred Hitchcock spins his grave. Has anyone learned anything in their college movie 101? Good movie roots are an interesting story! <br /> <br /> Here are some of the ridiculous messages in this movie: if you have desperate financial problems to move from Chicago to Central Dakota to the sunflower (I'm not your child!). If your toddler has serious neurological problems as a result of a car accident, get away from some of the country's best hospitals and speech therapists in an isolated small town with a community-based hospital at best. Rent a blue color to live and work with you, without checking any references if you have a teenage daughter, wife, and toddler. (I'm glad they're not my parents!) <br /> <br /> In a city where everyone knows everything, there would be no problem in the absence of triple killing, just outside the city. And, of course, blame the man's embarrassment for bad sunburn! (Nothing else is growing in North Dakota?) A few days after you have bought your rundown house, where big vines grow everywhere, it reminds you of Jack and Beanstal who are from X-Files, the Smoking Man, (I'm glad to see that cigarettes didn't get him, I think he won't breathe!) Just suddenly on you when you work to offer you your home sales price, plus 15% more, for some reason! <br /> <br /> I think you get the picture. I've seen so many godless fearsome movies in the last month, it's just blowing my mind! Is it so hard to make a movie that doesn't treat an audience like an idiot? I'm glad that at least this unfortunate film has a few brains! I wish I could say the same for someone who thinks they will make money from such a cellulose bin!
