EXPERT on Jeff Speakman's head is DULL !!! <br /> <br /> Dull, characters, dull states, boring direction, dull actors, boring cinematography, dull music. <br /> <br /> I don't understand this movie. Should this be an action movie? This is almost the same as Speakman wanted to be in a serious movie, but the EXPERT operating and writing level is below your average TV drama. And there are some typical "Speakman pummeling bad guys" scenes here and there, but the main aspect of the movie is based on some plausible drama that is totally wrong for Speakman or is so badly targeted that it just doesn't work for a star of action. After all, this confusing film seems very vague and horrible. The worst aspect of the expert is music. Composer is Jerry Goldsmith wannabe, who has his own pompous and melodramatic score that just doesn't belong to such (boring) film. Just as manufacturers know they have a very dull product in their hands, they asked the composer to make their scores more sensitive and dramatic, making the film even more confusing, softer, and fader. <Br /> <br /> Don't waste your time looking at it even if you're a Jeff Speakman fan.
