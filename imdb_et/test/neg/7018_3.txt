Lucille Ball can't sing or act or dance. This makes your MAME's performance even more terrible. He is not allowed to make a small eyebrow stroke that made him hit the TV so he has to rely on building a character. Unfortunately, Mrs Ball did not manage to learn this skill because none of the successful moments warmed up. How does he really feel about Patrick or Beau? We never believe what he says. The release of this release, Mrs Ball, requires us to convince her that she is emotional, but there is no chemistry between her and Bruce Davidson, Robert Preston or Bea Arthur. For this reason, every scene it has is flat. <br /> <br /> Moreover, when Mrs. Ball opens her mouth for singing, we are immediately aware of the reason why the studios duplicated their voice with every other music she played in her career. It was reported that he demanded the use of his voice, so it is both an ego and a management mistake. It is getting worse when it sings in a voice and it has to "act without time". Who thought it would work, forgot who played Mame. <br /> <br /> I understand that Rosalind Russell played a role in the production and film AUNTIE MAME. I am also aware that Angela Lansbury won Tony's performance in the 1966 Broadway musical. Neither of these women was well known for their song characters, but they could both be better than Lucille Ball. Why did they go with him, is the thickest messy mess. <br /> <br /> The only person who goes unharmed is Bea Arthur. He is great and wonderful, clever and in all the right quantities. Unfortunately, you are expecting to take off this movie and invite you to have fun. But the film never does and you can't. Someone besides Bea Arthur seems to have fun. <br /> <br /> Another bad review goes to director Gene Sax. Sax is known as an award winning director for musicals and performances, including Broadway music. None of this skill and experience is helpful here. The bad editing and storytelling of this movie is under his caliber director. This remarkable mistake in making a movie is not Mrs. Ball.
