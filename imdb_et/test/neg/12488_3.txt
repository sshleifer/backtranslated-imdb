What happened to earth on RGV? There are so many things about this movie that you have to stop and decide where to start - the first and worst - music. Every scene was accompanied by this pretentious background music that spoke to you, quite pathetically, adding. Secondly, lighting - do we really need such dark scenes where we don't know if the projector works? And finally - if you intend to bring an attacker and godfather into India - realize that much of us has seen. I have seen similarity both in the company and in Sarkar, and although RGV Ab Tak 56 was excellent, these two films want to. People are no longer affected by corrupt politicians and a lot. Perhaps RGV should see Maqbol good enough to be RGV!
