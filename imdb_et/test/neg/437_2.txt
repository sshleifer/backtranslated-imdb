AWiP tries to be funny, scary, tense and romantic ... and fails in every sense. Action is the best, but mostly stupid. Special effects are not enough to make up for the fool's plot equipment, and the chemistry * sign * ANY * is a minor. <br /> <br /> If you don't want to be angry, don't pay money to see it.
