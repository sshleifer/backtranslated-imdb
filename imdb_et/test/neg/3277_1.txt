Although I agree that this was the most terrifying film ever made, I am proud to say that my copy was just because I and my friends had additions (mostly in dance club scenes, but also some others. This movie was Bolo and Enter Dragon the captain's signed potential, but if someone who was most prepared every day, I can tell you that Robert Clouse was an old and confused person, at least at the time of making this film. a lot of it wouldn't have come in the Morning Calm studio fire.I was sure, but it would be nice to think I was really surprised that it was ever released, and that someone like Bolo added him the name without a fight. Scott Levy, AKA Raven, was his journalist in Portland ... a nice man, very smart.
