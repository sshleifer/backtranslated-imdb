You can't hardly call it a good movie, it's not even close. But I have to say that there were some things that made me ... not laugh, not strangle, but something like that. Resovoir Dogs parody was one of them. The rest are not important enough to remember. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I was disappointed with this movie. The plot sounds like an idea, but it quickly fell to the ground. The whole thing was just dirty and actors who weren't good for the characters; most of them are just exaggerated. There was also a whole host of unnecessary sequences, that was the whole film residue. I understand that this would make the film shorter for about 20 minutes, but that would make it better. <br /> <br /> Now, with good and bad things, let's conclude: two out of six toilet seats for it.
