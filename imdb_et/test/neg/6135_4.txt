The army's private sector, Gene Kelly, who is also a talented trapeze aerialist, will come under fire if she makes bold tricks without a net and alienates her high-wired cohorts; Meanwhile, the Army's soldiers and staff have a wide camp exhibition and the entire M-G-M studio has shown itself to be fun. Mickey Rooney plays M.C. (inaccurately) introduces actions such as Kay Kyser and his orchestra, Bob Crosby, Benny Carter and M-G-M dance girls (who seem to be dressed as rice). Red Skelton makes Donna Reed and Margaret O'Brien a little bit cute, but other comedy bits are likely to suffer from performers and supposedly living audiences in a vacuum (they are terribly silent until the editor clips over them). Judy Garland is singing an inappropriate song at Carnegie Hall (probably accompanied by classical pianist Jos√© Iturbi, Judy called "hep"). Production is shiny, but mania energy is wrong, made. ** from ****
