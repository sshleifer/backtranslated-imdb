One of my favorite "bum" actors, C. Tom Howell, stars in this WOTW dirty remake. He runs around a lot, while the CGI-based spider machine kills everything. Its budget was probably quite low. It was also one of the shelters. Have you seen them? Yikes! I'm not sure why anyone would have done it, while the Spielberg version with a big budget killed them at the box office. And when the truth is said, neither version is so hot. George Pal's version of the 1960s is still H.G. Wells' new, primitive special effects and all the best representation. Perhaps because Gene Barry was more convincing in leadership than Howell or Tom Cruise.
