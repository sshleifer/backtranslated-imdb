This movie is fine, fairly silly and light. But what I can't stand for is the numerous heroes and the commentary from this boy ILLEGALY SENTIMENTAL: "Look, they all look the same". Is it far from a good taste standard? I thought it was disgusting, as well as the heroic and selfish acts of some of the people in this movie. I am not saying that this would not happen, but would increase all such courage as it does in my belly.
