My Ratings: Acting - 3/10 Temporary - 2/10 Adding Character - 1/10 Drawing - 2/10 Developing Characters - 2/10 Overall - 2/10 <br /> <br /> This exhibition sucks very officially. For me, CSI Miami is the best, CSI NY 2 and CSI 100. I don't know, in other CSIs you look at, look. But you can't get into this episode, no matter how much you try, so I don't think this exhibition is worth it. I know people have different opinions and I respect it, but for me this is not good enough for CSI. So if you like temporary, actual functioning / performance, good plot, direction, character development / attachment and overall good show, I suggest you look at CSI Miami.
