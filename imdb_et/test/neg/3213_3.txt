As a smart marketer he is, of course, Jess Franco is also forced to temporarily temporarily psychedelic, as Mario Bava finally sensational "Danger: Diabolik!" Franco is the ideal person to shoot a similar movie because he could freely enter as many sliding, narrow landscapes and absurdly grotesque plots as he wanted. And he understood this in part very well, because "Rio Girl" turns to a man's angry organization, led by funky dressed lesbians, to plots that make all men obedient slaves! Unfortunately (at least for them), the devilish plans contradict the boss of the scared criminal syndicate played by George Sanders. All the right ingredients are well presented, but it is a surprisingly weak and insatiable adventure movie. The plot has a lot of imagination, but it seems to be only on paper, because it is quite annoying. The film is also very colorful ... but not too bright and especially shocking was the complete absence of a vicious circle. Certainly there is some nudity, but according to the usual Franco standards it is too little. All the characters are sick, so the least I expected (or hoped for) was more perverse undertones or scared subjects. Franco probably had a bigger budget than usual, and I have to say that he is spending that money on a more convincing set of talented and talented cast members. Especially the veteran actor George Sanders ("The Devil's Village", "Psychomania") is one of the best players ever to appear in Franco's production. Too bad even if he doesn't save the "girl from Rio" to make it a huge drop. The legendary Euro-smut filmmaker, like Jess Franco, would have had to do more and more with this concept. Shame, shame, shame ...
