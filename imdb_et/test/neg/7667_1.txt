There is a special heaven for people who make the world laugh. Alongside Chaplin, Stan, and Ollie, Marx Bros and ..... (to fill their special favorites) room for everyone with "Airport 80 - Concorde" movie. In particular, Robert Wagner surpasses all expectations that give life-long comedy performance. I would never have thought she had it inside her. The only way he could have been funny would have been wearing a red nose and a rotating bow tie. British filmmakers know the Cannon and Ball fat, who claim to be a Russian athlete, a nice trick if he could have pulled it out, but he couldn't do it tragically. I have a 14-year-old Labrador sporting and almost as funny. George Kennedy - blessing him - is a part that requires him to speak and move at the same time, and his goodness he triumphs, makes him wrinkle with effort, he says timeless dialogue, lovingly polished Coward-like glow of every word. Only once every twenty years, a Hollywood film like "Airport 80" appears. All year round and fighting, sweating, tears, lessons from Lee Strasberg, born in the trunk, etc. It is a work of art that lasts as long as there are films and machines that show them. I think I'm ready for my medicine now.
