It was only looking at one of the dogs that I would say, "Never!" It is so deeply unmemorable that I had to read the reactions of other people before I remembered anything more (1) than it was terrible, (2) Connery should have gone when she was ahead, and (3) the movie included Gross through a bit of portable retina scanning through the harshest (not to mention terribly ineffective) means that I've never really understood why anyone would even prefer the best Connery Bond movie even the worst Moore or Dalton tours. Or for Lazenby, Brosnan or even David Niven. Personally, I found that Octopussy and Moonraker are much more entertaining than other "canonical" bonds, and probably for the same reasons why others lose Moore bonds, namely their humorous humor and their willingness to pass on the entire core bond market.
