I found the code 46 very disappointing. I thought this was a good concept, and so it had a great potential as a film, but found that it didn't. Code 46 had no idea and structure and the story didn't flow well. I thought Tim Robbins's character was not well developed, eg. I thought his family life should have had more information and thinking and that it would not have been completely ignored because I felt it was. When they first violated code 46, it was suggested that they didn't know they could have been genetically related, but all the technology was available to them, it took a fingerprint and therefore genetic data to investigate the fraud. I had to constantly wait for something to happen, and the story would develop, but it never did. I felt that the film had great potential for intellectual stimulation, but it turned out to be the opposite. Code 46 tried to be too clever and finally ended up with a lack of imagination. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, the only good thing about the movie was that it was relatively short.
