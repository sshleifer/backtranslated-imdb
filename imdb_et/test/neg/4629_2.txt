Sex is the most remarkable aspect of existence. This is probably the most interesting activity between birth and death. LE DECLIN DE L'EMPIRE AMERICAIN examines human sexuality in a dry and boring way. In fact, worse than just boring, 40-year-old naked eyesight is uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> I think there is some shocking value when adults are as old as our parents talk about sex, but after that, twenty minutes, it's no longer interesting. Perhaps if the characters were all 20 years younger, the film would be more appealing. <br /> <br /> LE DECLIN DE L'EMPIRE AMERICAIN is not worth the time.
