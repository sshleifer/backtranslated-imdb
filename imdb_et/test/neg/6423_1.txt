In the US recently released on DVD; just stay away from it. <br /> <br /> I usually give plenty of room for stupidity in fiction films; I will solve almost everything from a distant, supernatural, horrible or even vaguely interesting concept. It just bounces. I knew there were problems when Sara College's "best friend", who had a big screen time, wasn't even under IMDb credit! I wasn't surprised that he didn't know any actors, but that character ("Daysha" or "Day-Glo" or whatever his name was) probably didn't exist! <br /> <br /> I'm so embarrassed that I actually paid for this garbage; deeply, deeply ashamed ...
