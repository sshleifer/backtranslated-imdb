I'm a big fan of Auntie Mame with Rosalind Russell. He was really the perfect actor to play this character. <br /> <br /> I've heard that Angela Lansbury was very good in the "Mame" stage, but it's hard to imagine anyone adding Rosalind Russell. <br /> <br /> Lucy was such a great comedy that her comics were saved in this movie, where I think she was unsuccessful. Indeed, they should have duplicated their singing voice - hearing their songs at a faster pace and with strong voice really changes the whole effect. I just saw the revival of the Washington stadium, and I think Christine Baranski was very good when Mame, Harriet Harris, who was a nasty kink smoker, played Vera and she was particularly good. > <br /> Both would be a good show for this TV show. Perhaps, if this production leads to Broadway, they will consider it for filming. <br /> <br /> I also think Tracy Ullman would be for Agnes.
