While I'm not a woman, I can enjoy a chick flick if it's good. But this is not bad. You have the story of the book, the girl is divorced, the boy with problems appears. The magic of BOOM happens and its demons are lost when it realizes that his life is a new goal. <br /> <br /> Now that I believe this might happen, there is no idiot. This would not happen on a geriatric rumpy-pumpy weekend, it will take time. But here the manufacturers know that they only have 1 hour and 30 minutes, so they force the changes to happen twice, I think it might be enough to catch the evening and spend the night with the grams and grandmother's dogs as you believe that the novel the novels were the gospel ... but most people don't. <br /> <br /> Now, if that's not enough, the manufacturers remembered that the chick flick needs a cry for the viewer. Well, they tried to call you with two older citizens who failed through it ... so how could they beat you again? Why do I know to kill a single character at all without a good reason, except that accidental death will definitely bring a tear to the eye ... and now lets her daughter's daughter magically tie her heart to a broken mother for no reason besides being nice (totally unreal) but who cares). <br /> <br /> So you have this ... girl finds boy, boy finds love, death finds boy and mother cries ... what movie - NO.
