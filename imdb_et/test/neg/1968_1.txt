The failed sequel (.. absurd idea that a killer snowman is in a rampant island resort where there is no snow or cold weather) brings back the spirit of the psychopath, returns thanks to a scientific experiment that offers foreign elements that re-establish life on its molecules (.. it's the best , which I could do to explain this superfluous concept). <br /> <br /> I could go deep about how he's going to the island to kill a lot of tourists, but I just can't find any reason to worry because it would be so tiring. Anyway, filmmakers think it is wise to kill beautiful girls not ten minutes after their arrival (.. I mean seriously why worry even about introducing them to us if we can't enjoy our candy anymore?) <br /> <br /> " The Snow Alley 'murder picture takes a cake. Ice-shrubs stretch out of the sand from the coast so that the victim can fall on them. Oh, and the other girl is worshiped by a couple. <br /> <br /> See what comes to me as I sit to watch the killer snowman movie. So ridiculous supernatural poet is tickling your funny ("Oh, it's so admirable horror movie!") Or pondering why hell you waste time with such nonsense. Jack Frost has the ability to freeze water (.. how did they send him on the first film?) And cause the island to snow. One section is the freezing of Jack's pool water, under which there is a swim pattern that results in his drowning somewhere to escape.Oh, there is also a "stayed-on language" holiday "Christmas Story" ("Cowatonga dude!"). <br /> <br /> I have to hand it over, even though they are real troops trying to make this wretched material fun. Christopher Allport (maybe unreasonably) returns to Samina to cope with his old nobility, as does his wife Eileen Seeley. Attempts with oral humor (at least for me) gradually fell, but cast soldiers tried to take advantage of a very difficult situation, in desperate performances they do their best to rise from a surprising assumption and a shameful dialogue. <br /> <br /> There is a development that increases the risk that Jack is still confronted, his genetically modified water molecules allow coolant / anti-freeze to be tolerated by the introduced foreign bodies, and worse, he can reproduce ... , Jack hacks up, which seems to be snowballs that hatch to expose little snowballs with black eyes, mouth and sharp teeth! Later on, snowman clothes and small snowball dolls can make you laugh on your belly if you have the mood of such shenanigans, but I found this junk as a hockey (.. that's the goal behind it, I think it's cheap. Snowball offspring is a clear respect Gremlins, where we get a bar where the little bastards celebrate the resort's victims of terror. A weapon against them. It was explained that when Jack went to kill Sami in the first movie, they both fell into the bed of an antifreeze truck. when he pushed them out of the window to the truck bed, and I think that when they were captured by an icicle, Jack inherited Sam's banana allergy, or that is what we believe!) and so "joined" in some ways. > Phew, such a movie, because it violates a simple explanation, it is so terrible that the presentation is pleasant because of the many drawbacks.
