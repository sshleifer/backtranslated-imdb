Most other posts won this movie and earned it. I just started talking about the technical failure of filmmakers. It would have been nice if the director had been at least lunch with someone who knew what a weapon was because he had no idea. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD !!! YOU ARE Warned !!! <br /> <br /> Embellishment: <br /> <br /> Spec Ops team gathered from various military units whose members never met each other before. <br /> <br /> Perhaps two people in this unit were weapons using the same magazines, parts, ammo, etc. The Sniper school teacher uses a conveyor (a pistol caliber), not a rifle, which we assume would be more dominant. One poor crew member's night vision optics weighs more than rifles. You can say if it is handled, it is seriously overwhelming. <br /> <br /> The team leader sends the crew member a "challenge" to the skeleton when they first come into contact with him. Challenge a 200-year-old reanimated Native American skeleton with a long spear and attitude that drives a dead war horses with severe nosebleeds? I think not, Bubba. (A few people have already mentioned this.) <br /> <br /> The "air support" of the crew consists of a common "black helicopter", only that it has a few sidewalls rockets that are under control. No one forgot to say the skeleton man wasn't driving, and they're all over America's heart, where there's no enemy plane. They should have aired instead of missiles. <br /> <br /> Helo's air-ground plane consists of a semi-automatic AK-47 (or 74?). Needless to say, it only hurts dirt. There should be a light weapon fed with a belt. <br /> <br /> Later, the door gun will discover that the grenade grabber is also pretty useless. not under helicopters, Mr President. <br /> <br /> I couldn't take this point (about 30 minutes) and gave up. You need to drill morphine seriously to carry out this flick, it's just so painful.
