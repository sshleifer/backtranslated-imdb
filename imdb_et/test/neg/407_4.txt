In some ways, you must respect Arachnia. This is clearly meant to be a tribute to the big films of the fifties, and although special effects are terrible; at least the film does not contain CGI. On the other hand; you can't respect the movie too much because it's a waste of garbage. Action is terrible, special effects (as mentioned) are impossible to take seriously and once you see that one giant spider is blowing up; You've seen them all so it gets boring pretty quickly. The plot is followed by a number of people who are unlucky enough to be crashed after a meteor shower. They go to the only house in the area; what just happens to be a house where a person has a huge spider he used as a circus attraction. At the same time, the meteor shower has caused more giant spiders from the ground. All the characters in this movie are bad cartoons; none of them have anything similar to the third dimension, and they will soon begin to carry you thoroughly. You have to know director Brett Piper because he obviously didn't have much work for this movie; but it does not make Arachnia a devil, and generally the giant films are better than that, and that is why Arachnia does not receive a confirmation certificate from me.
