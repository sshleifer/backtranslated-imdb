Desperate attempt to make a "film-noir" sci-fi thriller, but the film remains a little. It doesn't have a credible plot, some key people were a joke (NO Lars Bom, he's cool!). However, I liked the "access restriction to maximize bandwidth". I finished it basically, but I went home feeling I lost two hours of my life ...
