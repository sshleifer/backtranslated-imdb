Don't take this movie seriously, rent it to some people who want to play Mystery Science 3000, and you probably laugh at your butts. The bad guys are not that scary, it's funny, it's like some guy from the seventh grade, where sarivits is a scarecrow. Action is fun. I occasionally love torture myself with a bad horror movie and it really smiled at me. I recommend it on the basis. Of course, recreational drugs also improve the experience. Oh, there is a naked group swimming scene that allows some asterisks in a 5-star system. A black man with a bad sign gets badly, but continues to joke, and the injured body part uses it quite easily. Enjoy this complete and complete shame on movies.
