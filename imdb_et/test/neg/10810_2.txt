OK, I saw this movie through Mystery Science Theater 3000, but I saw the movie so I thought I'd leave a comment on it. I just love how Joe stuck in the deadlock when his brother and nephew get the Oscar winning roles left and right. Soultaker is technically what you would call a movie that was supposed to be good. It seems that the director and the actors took this film very seriously and had a very fragrant effect, a story that didn't make much sense, and not to mention quite a mild performance. This is one of my favorite MST3K episodes, easy, because the many they mention are what we mean in the movie and explain why. <br /> <br /> Natalie and Zach are a couple who cut off and are trying to work on things now. But since Zach is in the upper lower classes and Natalie is middle class, it just doesn't work. But when they go home, they and Zachi's friends get into a car accident and now the angel / Soultaker is killed for them to fill their explosive cache. But it also seems to have some other life relationship with Natalie and it just doesn't seem to move on. So now Natalie and Zach have to fight five million times in succession to save their souls and lives. <br /> <br /> Well, I think Zeppelin was wrong when he sang the staircase to heaven. I don't know if Black Sabbith was wrong either, lol. Basically, in such films, there are lots of plot holes, as no one sees this sign and can't kill them, but can they still push the buttons and open the doors? The angel of death had a very strange face and was a little confused about the story itself. Soultaker was just a weak film that had rushed and made you just as bad as Joe, a discounted Sheen / Estovez brother. <br /> <br /> 2/10
