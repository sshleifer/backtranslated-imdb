It was claimed that director William Shatner had a lot of "darker" films when he came to "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier" but Paramounti suits, looking at the huge box-receipt that his predecessor filled with his humor, demanded that the new film also have lots of laugh. So what we get is supposedly the weakest and the slimmest film in the six Star Trek movies with the original. There are bad ideas and some good ideas, and if you are a charity, you might want to look at The Final Frontier in the same way you would be in a TV series episode. On the plus side, Laurence Luckenbill is a beautiful actor and is one of the best "guest stars" on any Star Trek, a large or small screen that sits directly with William Windom's Commodore Decker. The portrayal of Spock's half-brother Sybok constantly raises the film when it threatens to sink, which happens too often. Charles Cooper is also good as the old Klingon General Korrd; too bad his role is not as great as he is. If the story of Shatner's intentions is true, I would owe him an excuse, because I was ready to blame incessant stupidity and non-very convincing scenes on his director's feet. The reason is that I have always felt that from all of Trek's regulars, Shatner was the least "tuned" of everything that makes Star Trek work and makes it special for fans. Having read his Trek's memories, it is very obvious to me that he considered this example to be another series of adventures that just happened to scientific literature. He preferred Gene Coon's vision of Gene Roddenberry; Coon was known for his work in the popular West Wild Wild West series. Shatner also mentioned that his favorite Star Trek episode was "The Piece of Action", a silly second season episode made by Coon. So, finally, did I get the chance to lead a Star Trek feature film, would Shatner follow her instincts and bring out a flick filled with action with lots of language-hitting humor? Well, someone did it because it was the "Final Limit". Shatner himself is definitely turning to The Great Ham and, as Leonard Maltin recalls, the film's bad case cutes. In the opening phase of Yosemite National Park it is difficult to say what is worse, super-cheesy special effects or godawful dialogue. The company's malfunctions have been shifting everywhere since the "Khan's anger" and after that the Trek movie is already on the ground. So is the idea of ​​a "skeleton team". One new development is the obvious romantic relationship between Scotty and Uhura, and it is enough to say that there is no burning of passions between them. It's a pointless sub-block and it doesn't add anything. The climatic scene in which "God" is in contact does not bring much; Whether it was a good idea or not, is debatable, but the scene itself doesn't make sense. ("The powers of God's creature seem to vary depending on what is currently needed.) About half of this is tired of restarting" searching for Spock. " Leonard Nimoy succeeds in rescuing Spock's honesty, even if he draws similar features to Un-Spock as "Get grip you yourself, Doctor." And DeForest Kelley, as usual, crosses both Shatner and Nimoy; he really came as an actor in the final Trek movies. So this Trek break is not terrible, it just isn't very good. Before the baton passed to the "next generation", there had to be another original cast Trek movie and it was a much better task than "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier".
