It is often difficult to decide what is the best movie you have ever seen, as it may differ from the genre, the preferences of the actors / actors, or even a certain day's mood! Having said this, I think this movie has ever seen me !! I thought it was terrible (was it?), The plot was just idiotic and the props were completely fake. Could you create a low-budget production without an amateur product? I do not belive. Even the friends with whom I watched the movie, that was the worst video we ever rented, and still funny when we saw this movie.
