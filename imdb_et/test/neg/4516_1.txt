It's really exhausting. I just got "Disco Beaver From Space Space" after I heard good things, and I have to say that it was just so unusual and bad, it leaves you numb and mystified how it ever came. /> <br /> What was it? Is this typical humor of the 70s? I do not belive. It's just so bad and believe me, I don't mean so bad is good. This is a set of very inconvenient skits, as you would watch cable TV. Of course, this was the HBO program and believing it might be daunting is scary. <br /> <br /> There's a little pretty girl in it and there are some old NHL movies from NY Islanders hockey team that are fun to see, even though I'm a lifelong NY Rangers fan. But they are even confusing because they try to bring out humor from two ice hockey hockey players as if they were "dancing" and even worse when it reverses the videotape of two hockey players fighting to see them look like they are sex. Oh, funny! In a somewhat intelligent way, an interview with a hockey player called "Chico" reminds me of NY Islander goalkeeper Chico Resch, but they even hit it by wearing a Rangers jersey! Well, maybe it was deliberate who knows. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that "Disco Beaver" is just so horrible, so incredibly bad, you will definitely feel after watching it and cheating for almost an hour. your life. You don't know what the garbage makers think they have something funny about here, and you don't know why these skits don't get even on the worst Saturday night. Unbelievable. Just incredible.
