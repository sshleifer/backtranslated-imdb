Crazy Six is ​​torture, it must be Albert Pyun's worst film. Even Blast and Ticker are better! I can't believe this movie is boring! How was it even green? I saw this movie about 3 years ago and the only thing I remember is how bad it was. It's not a good movie, it's just bad, bad, bad, bad, bad film. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 (½ out *****)
