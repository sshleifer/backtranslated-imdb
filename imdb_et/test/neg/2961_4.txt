I've seen Shallow Grave years ago and * it was one of those films I kept in memory for a long time. It was intense from beginning to end and with plenty of unexpected twists. But all these thoughts were meaningful. <br /> <br /> I can't talk about the same dead body. The title is a title that says it is "even better than a low grave". It's a big lie. <br /> <br /> Dead Bodies loses strength and becomes much less convincing during the movie. <br /> <br /> Two supportive characters, for example, turn out to be much less innocent than they first seemed to be. It may work as a surprise, but it did not surprise me. I saw it a few minutes before, and * that * is a big difference with Shallow Grave. The other thing I have to mention is that the characters in this movie often do not match very realistic. They do so more often when the movie ends. <br /> <br /> It would be much more interesting if some characters were to remain completely innocent without knowing what was going on. For example, it would have been better for Tommy and his friend to carry a huge secret with them. <br /> <br /> But no, for some stupid reason, the makers of this movie decided that all the characters should show their dark sides. It doesn't work in such a movie. <br /> <br /> The end seemed like an open tip. It left me feeling unhappy. I waited much more for this. <br /> <br /> At first, I would have given six stars to this film because it is not a bad movie. I liked this look. Most of the time. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, however, I saw some really bad and unrealistic scenes, and this time I get four stars because of the disappointing open end. And since it turned out to be a mistake, I spend my time and money on him. Unlike Shallow Grave, I will probably forget about Dead Bodies very soon. It's not just such a special movie. <br /> <br /> Creators would have done much better work on this movie. It's a shame that they didn't.
