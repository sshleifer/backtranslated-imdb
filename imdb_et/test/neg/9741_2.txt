Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold) and his wife Joan wanted to sleep in bed with their heads under their covers and their feet in pillows. They have two equally contested children, Buster and Petunia. One day, Mr Stupid notices that their garbage has gone again. After the waste disposal, he goes to the roller blades. When he finally reaches the dump, he is astonished to learn not only that "other people's garbage" has been stolen, but that the landfill has a secret organization. He seems to have decided to destroy the world's trash bins. Meanwhile, Petunia and Buster are visiting the police station and Chinese restaurant in search of their parents, because Joan has also disappeared. Do they worship their problems? It's just a stupid, stupid movie where the culprit is a terrible script. The books of Allard and Marshall are hysterical, and only a few of the books come to this film. Arnold is actually pretty nice when Mr. Stupid and other cast members try to make the movie very, very hard. The production values ​​are very high when the dog and cat belong to Stupide, adding a little oomph to the film. But it's all empty, because the plot is misleading and weak. Maybe one day someone will take a very funny screen of Allard's books. So, if you love to laugh, rent something new when you expect a new production, and in any case, get books. But being away is a fool, because anyone who looks at the end of the movie can hardly be called intelligent.
