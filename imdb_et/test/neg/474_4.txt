I enjoy B-movies. I think Bruce Campbell is a very observable actor. I love how he delivers his lines. "Evil Dead 2 and" Darkness Army "were great movies, I liked the runtime, but I don't know if I'll ever watch this movie ... and I bought it. Now, after saying this, I bet the comments and special features are This movie is just too many holes to really enjoy, even if it is a cheap movie. First, Ted Raimi was annoying, just tortured. His badly behaved / written character had nothing that hadn't been done a thousand times before. unfortunately, subpar and choice of techniques ... yikes.I am not expecting Woody Allen or James Cameron here, but Campbell could not. <br /> <br /> I did not buy this idea that it was an Oscar movie like 'Annie Hall' but i'm still .m disappointed.I'd be happy with Mallrats or Rhino Brothers.I have a lot less. At the end of the movie I had no scene that pulled out with me, no dialogue resonating inside me. Even "Hostel" was classic line pete for the sake! does not recommend this movie.
