Perhaps this film was actually intended for satire, such as "Airplane", but it was not as unhappy as it was "thriller". I do not understand why they would not have been able to pay the actual pilot for a few hundred dollars for technical advice. Hell, I would have done it for free! This magical plane managed to break from 757 to 767 per hour to 747 and the force was back. The dialogue sounds like it came out at the back of a child's phone game, where everyone spoke in different languages. I really turned around TIVO and looked at it a second time to see if it was really as bad as I thought. It was.
