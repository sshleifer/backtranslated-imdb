There was nothing remotely funny about this movie. It makes fun of various sports movies and clich√©s, but nothing is far from funny. Most of the movies they don't fit in the parody are not even suited to the movie and are really just so they could be in it. Not. The main actor was well cast, but it is really the only good thing about this film. The various fires were also cool to see, but I have no idea why they would waste their time on a piece of rubbish. Thank you, I spent just $ 4 for it, because it's not worth the money. Make sure you don't have anything to do or want to waste time and 30 minutes.
