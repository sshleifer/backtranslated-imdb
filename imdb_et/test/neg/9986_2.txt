Like an old film fan, I had heard a lot of controversial movies about CALIGULA, which was evaluated ambiguously as one of the most realistic ethics and one of the most reluctant porn movies in the world. I decided to see it in the whole uncut version to evaluate it myself, hoping to find something positive that would bring justice to many of the accusations against the film. I sat down on my chair one autumn night and started watching. The original quotation of the New Testament shocked me a little and raised the first contradiction ... why to include Mark in the Gospel of the Gospel? But the foreboding pastoral scene with the young bare couple (Caligula and Drusilla) who run hopelessly through the meadows seemed rather sentimental. The music that sounded memorable, while the credit gave me a positive idea. But the negative feelings rose quite soon in me, especially when Tiberius died. Cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality was exaggerated. But it wasn't awful in the middle. In the second half of the film, I felt that I was watching no historical epic, but very nasty porn. Finally, I said, "This is one of the films that can really hate you ..." I know the film may be controversial, but I had never expected CALIGULA to go far enough to remove all the flavors. I hate this movie for several reasons, but especially one. <br /> <br /> CALIGULA is not meant for the purpose of an ancient epic (which he claims to be), but the director and founder of Penthouse Bob Guccione is aiming to combine pornography with pornography. This is, in my opinion, the most serious thing the film can blame. Film is an art that should be tasted, messed with, epic glory, while this movie kills all the limits of good taste. CALIGULA shows the most emotional side of a person in the most evil and decadent ways. Some scenes are so nasty that I don't think there are people whose psyche doesn't affect them. Some say that Rome's Caligula reign was so cruel. Yes it is true. Corruption flourished at that time, with many sexual abnormalities favoring Roman citizens. But I do not think it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make it important to the ancient epic. I believe that this rather proves the strange psychology of the producers and their strange trends ... <br /> <br /> LARGE HISTORICAL PUBLICATIONS: Gore Vidal's manuscript is known for inaccuracies. For example, an historical indicator of the Roman Senator Proculus (Donato Placido) is observed. But the film shows him as a simple soldier, for whom Caligula forces his most decadent methods of torture and rape. What's more, Livia was not the bride's wife, Caesar raped in her wedding. What about changing stories from historical figures into stories filled with incredible vulgarity and violence? Another example of historical travesty is the depiction of Caesonia depicted by Helen Mirren. She is Caligula's wife with her sister Drusilla. In fact, Caligula married Caeson long after her sister's death. His new wife's sexual abuse in the temple is a fun scene with no historical basis. I also hated the kill machine - the pure imagination of the director, which has nothing to do with historical facts. <br /> <br /> TECHNICAL ASPECTS AND REASONS: From a technical point of view, the film is not special. Cinematic art cannot boast exceptionally well, and kits with costumes are also not outstanding. But the only strong point in the film is performances, especially Malcolm McDowall as Caligula. He does the perfect job in the main role of Emperor's madness and cruelty. McDowall raises the value of the movie. If you are all disturbed by CALIGULA, you can at least admire your admiration. I also directed Helen Mirren as Caesonia and Teresa Ann Savoy Drusillana (the film, however, is based on Sueton's fame that Caligula loved her sister). Sir John Gielgud as Nerva and Peter O'Toole are also memorable as the old Tiberius. O'Toole does his best, acting in the order of Capri's grotesque, which depicts the decadence and exhaust of the old emperor. Yes, I admit that the only thing I like about CALIGULA is performances. That's why movie 1/10 is not rated. <br /> <br /> LAME CONTINUATION: The historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs with poor continuity. Let's analyze the beginning: Caligula comes to Capri Grotto, where he sees the terrible pleasures of old Tiberius. Then, after about 15 minutes, the activity moves to Rome, where the black bird near the bed of Drusilla and Caligula is a bad sign. And now these characters are back in Capris, where Nerva (John Gielgud) dies ...? First of all, I do not recommend CALIGULA to anyone. If you want to know this story, read Robert Graves' proud novel I, CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD, or see Herbert Wise's mini-series with a great performance by Derek Jacobi. CALIGULA is a sick film whose most serious crime is the destruction of art. This is mostly a porn movie that should never be called epic. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are truly artistic and sharpening the beauty of people, <br /> <br /> there are movies that are average entertainment; yet they have something to offer, <br /> <br /> movies that show extreme violence; however, they still carry moral, <br /> <br /> but there are movies that show disease and decadence for their own sake and hence damage people's thoughts, <br /> <br /> CALIGULA is unfortunately the newest Group
