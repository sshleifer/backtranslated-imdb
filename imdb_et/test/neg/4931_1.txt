This movie is stupid by stupid people. I think the scheme I think works enough for a horror movie, but the activities they take are strange STUPIDs! Like, incredibly non-sensual stupid Nth degree! Basically, the whole movie consists of the four idiots that have been caught repeatedly, despite having many, many opportunities and opportunities to overcome their captain. It doesn't make any sense of reason and is not fun. Gripping eyes is more rational and probably more fun than watching. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS **** The end is fun! The only good part of the movie! Finally I almost laughed! This all-foolish movie, and it ends with a fool that he'll be sent out of the box to white slavery in Asia! Fun! I thought it was a fantastic ending for a really good movie.
