At the beginning of the film, Ramgopal Verma says "Sarkar" is his respect for Godfather. It seems more offensive. This is terrible compared to Coppola's classic. Although no one expected Ramgopal Verma to fill Coppola's shoes, the film created a lot of expectations and buzz. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan plays "Sarkar", which automatically characterizes comparisons with the Indian political party Shiv Sen Supremo Bal Thackeray. Abhishek Bachchan plays his son Shankar, who returns from abroad and gets into Sarkar politics at home. Just like Al Pacino's original godfather. <br /> <br /> Like most Bollywood fares, incidents and characters are obviously simple and have no solid foundation. Fast phone calls and sudden announcements make the movie one way to another. Abishek connects Mumbai to the underworld of politics and crime, as the duck goes with water. Amithab Bachchan like Sarkar should probably be big and powerful, he just reaches the old and helpless. Most of his actions are constantly on the lookout for different things around the film set - the actor in front of him, the floor or some other casual direction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But Kay Kay performs very well as a missed older son, Vishnu. So Zakir Hussain like Rashid, a Dubai-based smuggler who wants to get his base in Mumbai. This actor has a fantastic screen presence and he can send his backbone to his spine just as he sees it. Now, when she enters the screen, you want to hide under the bed and hide it. <br /> <br /> Not all of its obvious drawbacks endure, the film worked well at the cashier. Buzz and the big star obviously helped. Vermal also manages to keep an interest, though slightly towards the later part of the film. In fact, he does what I am sure it is the same price.
