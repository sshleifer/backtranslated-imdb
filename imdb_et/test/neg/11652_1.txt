The Disney Studios "snowball release" is not as dated as some of the outputs of this era. There are no hippies or hot roders, just Dull Jones, from the deceased relatives ramshackle hotel / ski resort. When Jones and the family get into the sleepy city of Colorado, the people who give them directions - like the Deliverance extras - are curiously vague about the hotel (we expect it to look like a single room), but actually the accommodation is very nice. Jones's teen daughter sees her face healthy (which doesn't stop one of the local yahoos from playing her) and of course the clumsy pop Dean Jones is a regular drum that drives a lot of workouts in the tail. Perhaps this square scenario may have been some magical fear, because this script is frozen rigid. * from ****
