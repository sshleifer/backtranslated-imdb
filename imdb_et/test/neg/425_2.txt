Oh, I thought it should be a good activity, but it wasn't. Although there is nothing to watch Jeff Speakman's star. Only two struggle for about 1.5 hours, yak.Many talk and everything is so artificial that you couldn't believe it. The plot is clear from the beginning. If you want good action, don't rent this movie.
