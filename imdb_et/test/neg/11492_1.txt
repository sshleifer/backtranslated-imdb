The film is a complete disaster. I don't know who writes scripts for such movies, but I definitely would like to meet one of them and talk to him a bit. maybe script writers don't know * t the situation in foreign countries in the current or recent past? or they just don't give a damn and write everything they think is interesting. <br /> <br /> The big and eternal formula with the mad dictator + 1 lone hero (of course America) may seem like a good idea, but come on! we had a tyrant in milosevic who made a lot of bad things for his people, but I just can't imagine he screams "shoot, shoot them" with a barbaric passion like in the Middle Ages. maybe they wanted to show how evil it was, but it was a stupid idea. a much better impression would be if he just did it in cold blood like real monsters. <br /> <br /> The list of janitors is too long, but the most fun thing is: no matter how many TV channels there are in Russia, the Russian president looks at US SNN (CNN) news? OMFG! <br /> <br /> Let me break! <br /> <br /> Burn this dirty piece! <br /> <br /> ONLY!
