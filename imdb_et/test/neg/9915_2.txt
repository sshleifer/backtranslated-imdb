Stripped effort. The surface has this typical catastrophic film: we are involved in the lives of some who remain in the Big Event. At the same time, the script is so terrible and there is so much in the dialogue to explain the background of the characters that we feel they are being treated with mores. Even Sesame Street didn't explain the origin of Mr. Snuffleupagus or how Mr. Hooper died: we can do it. Someone thought the insertion of "Enron" into the script would give it a currency when discussing financial companies. Action is great and exciting, except for the older performers (Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy), and after the first hour I didn't care about who came out of the storms. <br /> <br /> But maybe there are special effects to watch. Unfortunately no. Even on a 20-year-old TV, I saw one tractor and a trailer were computer-based? Perhaps there are budget restrictions so I can forgive it. The shots from the landed plane seemed pretty real, but I told myself I saw it before. This site confirms this: it comes from the earlier film Nowhere to Land. <br /> <br /> To sum up, the only good bits come from another movie and when you see the best sequences that have been compressed 30 - the second online campaign makes the 6th category pretty good. My Tip: Rely on your network to make good 30-second video clips, watch them and save two nights.
