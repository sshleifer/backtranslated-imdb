Well, it has to be called. Mainly thanks to the ridiculous and stupid use that the director hardly calls the symbol. It wouldn't surprise me when I found out that it was A) one of Lea Pool's earliest efforts and B) at least semi-autobiographical. It turns out that A is wrong, although I don't know B. I bet he was in the boardroom and had a pretty terrible sex of the same kind in SOME. This is the message that this movie pulled into our throat and the short film that I did not remember. <br /> <br /> The character formation was in any case cumbersome (Who introduces himself by saying what his name means? Someone.) The symbols were about as fine as any glass elevator that was full of teenage girls, losing the cable and falling eighty times. Whole speaker. Frankly, when the horn shouts when Perabo announced he was a raptor, and jumped on the table? It was ridiculous for the parody. And this was just one of the many symbols that were meant to show even the most stupid viewers of what he thought was. And it was that he had a dirty childhood and felt the need to make films about it, Vincent Gallo, instead of seeing a therapist, all of us who get on with our lives. There was nothing gentle, anything sweet, or anything in this movie. It was a badly-fitting trash and the actors could not record Brett Ratneresque on top of "HEY THIS ON MY POINT THIS MOVIE" using film techniques, writing and showing. Sorry, but it was terrible.
