Coach Preachy or Straight Sappy. This is bad writing in combination even worse. You can choose this particular Gatorade drink after school, but I didn't even motivate it in the 20th century Toby Robbins / Islander philosophy. It's too flattering to be fun and not enough content to be informative. I respect the trainer and the program that this film has inspired, but the movement itself is terrible. As a person who has played rugby for almost 20 years in countries where I was hoping for a better rugby film (even one that is loosely tied to the rugby). And I can tell you that Haka, performed by a bunch of Haoles and Islanders, is not scary (like all Blacks, seriously boys, everyone has seen it, it's time to put it down). If you want a real intimidation, a row over South Africans (real imprisonment). It's a fake and badly made movie about a real and good person.
