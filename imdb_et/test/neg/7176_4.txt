I admit it's not a great movie. It screams practically with a "small budget", but strangely I found myself happy with the film, because although it lacked quality, it was a lot of energy. It was like a small engine that could and did join the movie! <br /> <br /> The film is on the radio and touches on some of their low-level employees - two pages (one very fast and one dirty and one wuss) and a new receiver. All three have a vision of radio stardom, but we now have to fill our low jobs. <br /> <br /> This story seems to be a murder that looks somewhat blue. I didn't know it was a mystery film of murder and it was a little surprised. But like most B mysteries, policemen are lamebrains and this is the task of our tight hero (Morani) to try and save the day. Throughout this time I had a hard time deciding whether Moran was unpleasant or loving. I'm still not sure! <br /> <br /> There is a moment in the film that is high on the "blunt factor", and that is when two pages try to play the role of radio comics. They appear on the black face and make the third or fourth degree impression of Amos n 'Andy. Besides being very sensitive, it wasn't funny either. Fortunately, it seemed that the producer of the exhibition they tried was the same. <br /> <br /> In general. skipping this movie is easy and I won't blame you if you do. However, the strange and crazy pace of the film seemed to compensate for the artistic shortcomings of the film and I am glad that I saw it. Good movie? No. But that's still worth the old Bide fans. <br /> <br /> By the way, maybe I just don't have a very good taste, but I thought both female singers were really bad voices despite the fact that all the people in the movie are in their captivity. Listen to yourself and let me know what you think. I just couldn't believe he was allowed to sing the movie - even if it was just a little for Monogram Studios.
