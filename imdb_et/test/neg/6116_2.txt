The worst Wrestlemania ever. <br /> <br /> It didn't need to see races and many. It was in Las Vegas, and WWE made it like the gods of Egypt! They even changed the name of Howard Finkel to Finkus Maximus, which probably doesn't mean anything. Seeing Jim Ross in this terrible dress also gives me today's nightmares and I'm 21 years old so you could imagine it when I was 7 years old! But Bobby Heenan was funny. <br /> <br /> The races included The Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzales s * in a bad game, The Headshrinkers vs. Steiner Brothers in a useless match, Doink vs. Crush comedy game and boring game Razor Ramon vs Bob Backlund. Hulk Hogan joined Brutus Beefcake to fight Money Inc.. You can clearly see that Hogan had a black eye. Ted DiBiase and the IRS beat Hogan when he played poker or something in a casino that is a bad storyline, but actually Macho Man Randy Savage has hit Hogan because Savage thinks he's like Hulk) is not a wrestler but the character of the film. <br /> <br /> The main tournament was Bret 'Hitman' Hart, who faced Yokozuna's very dueling main match. Mr. Fuji threw salt in the eyes of Hart and Yoko, but not until Hogan stepped down and shattered in 21 seconds. <br /> <br /> Overall ranking - E
