This is a rather simplified romance. Girl finds boy, girl loves boy, girl loses boy, girl finds boy. Colleen Moore is a prominent ingredient in this recipe, offering a great variety of dramatic / romantic performance, which also deserves Oscar nom. There are also special effects that fight the air from the air. <br /> <br /> Moore plays a French girl whose mother has taken over at the British airport during World War I. She is a "regiment's daughter" who loved a little sister. This blend comes with a filling bladder designed for downfall, Gary Cooper. First of all, they hate each other, they love each other, then the whole team is sent to a suicide mission. Cooper returns, but the village and the red cross disappear. Moore is looking for her, she's being told in a hospital where she's dead, she's on the streets until she calls the hospital window and they're reunited. <br /> <br /> It's a nice little romance, but hardly any more. Recommended for fans of Moore and Cooper
