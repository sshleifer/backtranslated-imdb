I've seen both the MST3K version and the uncut version. I enjoyed it rather. In both cases, this was not a bad film. Of course it was a little slow from time to time. I liked this. <br /> <br /> As far as MST3K is concerned, they only made the movies they got the rights to. Not all the movies they were breaking on the bad movies were just that easy. Take the SoulTaker, for example. I couldn't take them seriously. It created a unique feeling. <br /> <br /> Vivian Schilling did a great job with the script. Today, 95% of the world is a garbage in theaters. His role was well played. Not too hairy for the masculine but just the right one. The camera loves her in this movie. I would have played this role after the script was ready. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie deserves a little more credit than it has been given. See the uncut version when you see MST3K. It deserves so much.
