I looked for the first 10 minutes and it missed me for death. So, I'm going to the end to the end. This movie must still be the worst in the lowest budget sci-fi category. Bad Behavior, Cast, Instructions, Lara Craft Custom Imitation, Story, Plot, Everything! Throughout the film, I think maybe only 6 to 7 people all cast, but only two of them started the whole movie. I was expecting something from the Starship Trooper, but it wasn't something like that. The movie title and the picture on the DVD cover are cheated. Don't waste your time watching this boring and bad movie. Come to think, I don't know why they even worked out bad movies like this?
