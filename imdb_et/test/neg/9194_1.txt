Is there a firefighter clich√© that hasn't been used in this movie? From the opening line "I'm getting too old for this" firefighters "antics", "worrying wife", and her best friend's firefighter loss, the fallen brothers' final funeral, this movie looks and sounds like Disney's marketing department ("Our research shows the audience likes that's when ... "and then they shut down). <br /> <br /> There is nothing original here. Any emotion we feel about their boys is the admiration and sensation of our firefighters. Look at the Rescue if you want to see true heroes: Everyday boys who have mistakes that don't think of anything like a burning building to save strangers.
