Black White Madison Avenue Advertising Agency Satire. They are led by Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) who has decided to change things. However, he turns out to be even worse than his white predecessors. It is about as original as it gets. <br /> <br /> I am sure it was considered bold and shocking in 1969, but it seems stupid today. Jokes are either inconvenient (president is dwarf. HOW is this funny?), Cruel or obvious, and the film is full of improbable characters. It's done in a very experimental way that makes it even more complicated ... or understand. The film is getting stranger and more surreal. The end comes out now. To make it worse, the only exception is Johnson, everything works bad. Antonio Fargas (regular in such films) is particularly annoying as Arabic. It gets three stars because the commercial parodies (in bright colors) are fun and here and there is a rare good line. I heard it was a cult class, but it's more interesting than good. Skip it ... if you're not in the experimental 1960s movies.
