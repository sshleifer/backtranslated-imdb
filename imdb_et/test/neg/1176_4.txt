I was quite confused about this movie. I'm not sure if he was trying to be a terrifying story of a Rob Zombie-type case or an investigation into real events. <br /> <br /> In both cases, it was left unchecked. This is not particularly historically accurate if the characters are cut and modified for the sake of the story. <br /> <br /> The performances were not overwhelming or bad. For me, I would have preferred a more psychological approach, and this film would have easily kept that path without damaging the overall effect.
