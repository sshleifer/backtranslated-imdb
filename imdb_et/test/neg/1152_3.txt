I had never heard of this movie until it came to DVD. I was immediately interested in this: actors, title, cover and especially the author. Arthur Miller, you can't go wrong with him? Yep. I haven't read the novel, but I think it was much better than film. I had great hopes for this movie. I like Macy and Dern, and it seemed interesting. Unfortunately, this movie never really rises up on cookie-cutter messages about racism and major problems. If you have never seen any other movie on this subject or you have never known that America is based on hopefulness, then perhaps this movie is for you. Others will probably find it predictable, outdated and general.
