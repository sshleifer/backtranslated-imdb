I believe this movie was a terrible waste of my time and I know I watch it 5 times in class. this movie does not show what happened perfectly at these times. no one can really say that these things were written. if anything were the only good part would be the actors, even if they were really very beaten. they read the script without expression. pretty boring. I'd rather look at the play school. so I'd definitely see this movie ever in my life. it is a complete waste of time if you do not want to waste your time and want to see an unrealistic picture of the 1981 case.
