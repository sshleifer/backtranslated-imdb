I saw it in a preview and I have to say that this documentary is the biggest burden I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Totally uncomfortable, low budget, boring, garbage, terrible action - The whole audience (young and old) sat through the movie candy without most laughing ... there were literally just 2 places you laugh at Many in the movie <br /> <br /> Many people left halfway - Can't blame them ... I missed thinking that the movie is picking up, but never did and I wish I left. <br /> <br /> Humor was really flat and I'm surprised that it did it on the big screen. I'm not someone who is offended by the adult content of this movie - it wasn't just funny. The people who made this movie don't deserve their money, so please don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not even funny to show on television, not to mention the cinema. .. <br /> <br /> I wanted to give 0 out of 10, but the system doesn't allow it ...
