First of all, I am surprised that this movie has been rated 7 on this site. I initially thought that IMDb could be logged in and the rating could be industry. but after looking at the rotten tomatoes and the fact that this film has something 76% approved, it seems that suddenly people have once again been mistaken to confuse indignation. This movie is just terrible. acting is just terrible, but the rest of the movie is worse. at least acting for some (involuntary) laughing. <br /> <br /> The plot has a teenage skateboarding boy who will be asked with his friends about the murder that happened in the park where they skate. and that's it. the rest of the film consists of the terrible, terrible dialogue, human walking, human faces, skating, often for music that does not fit the scene. maybe it was done to be "cool" or experimental or hip. or maybe it was in the hope that it would make people think it was deep, but it didn't work. nothing in this movie. this is terrible garbage. I can't recommend it enough.
