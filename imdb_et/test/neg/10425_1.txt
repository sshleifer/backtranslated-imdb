"Wired" should be considered as one of the ten worst films I've ever seen. Writing and direction show fantastic imagination, and I'm sure most of the participants are still cringing when someone mentions this movie. <br /> <br /> It does not work to honor Belushi's unique talent or to give an accurate picture of your short life. <br /> <br /> Nonsense nonsense without redemption.
