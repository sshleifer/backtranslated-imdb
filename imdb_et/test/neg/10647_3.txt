By the time the Hellraiser franchise was reached, it is a little movie. Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsey) is a future scientist whose prisoner is once again telling his ancestors (all who Ramsey was playing) had for the first time built a puzzle box for evil Lament that puts the world in evil. and how his blood vessel later dealt with that box. Film is the lack of continuity of other films and the lack of unity. Yes, this may be due to a combination of rewriting, large cuts in the original version of the movie or what you have. But I look at the movie as it is, and not what it was or could have been. And as it is now, it's a mess. Of course, the franchise continues directly with the DVD tracks, but it was pretty much a death-nail chance that he got a new message that appeared again. <br /> <br /> My Class: D-
