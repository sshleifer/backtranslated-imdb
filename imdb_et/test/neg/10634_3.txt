The big theme, the director and the cast somehow adds a really abysmal film that is spoken in such a flat, half-document style that was so popular at the time of making this film. (And hello, it's not a movie-noir!) A dirty, too complicated, crowded story does not contain an arc, focus point, little excitement and staggers from one scene to another without a noticeable purpose, except for the alleged and highly suspicious cooperation between the valentine and the American and Mexican governments on illegal immigration. <br /> <br /> The scene that made me hate this movie is when Montalban and Mitchell make their prisoners escape, they are expected to compete for rescuing a Montalban injured partner when a goon kills a farm. Machines in Montalba say something like this: "Quick - we have to try to save him" but instead they place on their stomach and watch agony in about 5 (!) Minutes of screen time when the machine is on Murphy and finally runs over (or we assume the machine just stops, the second goon detects the presence of two "rescuers" and lets them down again.) Scene over. The whole thing is so horribly filmed and completely antichromatic. Nothing is worse than the main character (seemingly in Montalba, though he's more than half of the screen in front of the movie) who doesn't even try. Jeez, Ricardo, make SOMETHING! <br /> <br /> I know this is Anthony Mann, but hell, not all of his movies are classic, people. How bad old movie should be here to get something lower than 6 rating?
