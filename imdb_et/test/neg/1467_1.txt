If you want to see the worst movie, look no further. Some bad movies are traceable because they are unintentionally funny. Unfortunately, the American film does not have any understanding, unintentional humor, just the ridiculous feelings of its leader. <br /> <br /> For those who liked this movie, I suggest you watch Kevin Smith's "Clerks" -like tones. In Clerks you will find creativity, meaninglessness and pleasure - all in the shoestring budget. This should forget about this terrible effort.
