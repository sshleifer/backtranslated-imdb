OK, so this movie works well. It has a good direction, but it is simple that it undermines what all gay and lesbian people are fighting for these years. A straight guy who decided to be gay, and a gay man who decided to be straight, enjoyed it until the last 20 minutes, after that I got really offended. As these films usually take place, the direct actors play the main parts, and the foreign actors play secondary straight roles. The wires are played by beautiful men, but don't let it interfere with the fact that it is a movie that leaves you unrecognizable. Not all romance and the relationships you hope will happen. If you're not a priest, bless the god straight woman who heals our homosexuals.
