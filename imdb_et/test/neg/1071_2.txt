I don't understand what it's hard to hit this movie! I don't understand why high school kids should watch it! I do not understand why it should have thought of anything at all! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * <br /> <br /> If an unnoticed girl is on the road to suicide, am I the only person to rejoice at her? The classical music classics, long tracking shots, the melancholic emotions of the film at this stage were the opposite of what was meant. I would have been happy only when he walked into the room and all the cast was there with his scissors to cut their wrists on their rings. Why? <br /> <br /> Why I went to high school ... and frankly, I've seen a movie after watching a movie in Australia, where teenagers are the only one based on terrible clich√©s. I've been waiting for a younger person to be able to write a movie that is capable of associating, and this stereotype-based emo garbage is what I got. It was like a dark dark version of the heartbeat that needed a predictive ending. <br /> <br /> Why are all teenagers in Aussie dramas depressed or have really strange problems that they just don't believe? <br /> <br /> On the plus side it was more funny than "Blurred". And I needed a good laugh.
