This film has some drawbacks and most of these errors are something that happens. Perhaps the biggest film that shows the directness of Fly-Over Country is the Rolling Kansas movie, which doesn't happen and you don't care about anyone. Like life, it begins, it moves and then ends. There are some humorous measures, but everything goes very flat. Sometimes the viewer remembers that they may waste their lives by doing something other than watching a movie and one rock song they bought and used on a case-by-case basis. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and watch a good movie. It's free and often repeatedly in Comedy Central because no one has seen it, no one wants to see it, and it's a little better than dead air. Not fucking with a faint praise, but one of the rock songs in the movie is worth listening to. Too bad a film is not worth watching.
