Self-evident begins in Los Angeles with Jim (Roger Cline) and his wife, Alice Fhelleps (Tamera Noll), who claim they are riding in a painter, unfortunately Jim runs the car and his daughter Heather (Leigh Silver) ends when Alice turns to wheelchair-related vegetables. Because of his daughter Jim's death, she destroys the visit of prostitutes, and then kills her because of her voices. Erm, it's really. <br /> <br /> Written, staged and directed by Chad Ferrin I hate the indescribable as a movie. There are some movies you occasionally see to move "gate posts" as it was after you look at it, some movies are so brilliant that everyone else judges, while others are, for example, inexplicable that this is a new cinema low. This is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I'm surprised at IMDb's largely positive comments, although I'm not surprised if the overall rating on the main page is low, I'm not sure if I missed something, but it's not starting unspeakable plot, it has no story and much seems almost random. There was nothing that was expressed in the wording to preserve your interest or entertainment, and as a result, I got trial confidence to reach the end. The film strives to be shocking when the priest is somewhat uncomfortable with the sexual abuse of a hiring boy, there is a scene where a disabled person craps himself, splits on the floor, and his angry sister begins to feel his dirty genitals, legs and underwear. If anyone can find such fun entertainment, then I just cut my wrists now, some of the worst character I knew, but the dialogue is fun bad. porn worst. It doesn't work as a horror because it's not the least scary, it's totally fun and honestly offensive to claim that it is trying to be a serious drama, that someone is suffering a big loss and is trying to cope with it and in general I mean it's pointless, dirty, badly done Troma piece. <br /> <br /> Films by Ferrin director like some badly made documentaries, special effects are terrible and are "pouring tomato ketchup on the face of our actor and the audience is convinced that they died of a dead death variety, no graphic violence after suicide where someone puts the knife in his mouth. Considering the number of prostitutes in the wordlessness, the level of nudity is kept to an absolute minimum ... <br /> <br /> Obviously, the unexplained budget was about $ 20,000 and all I can say is where all the money went? A quick note to the filmmakers if you want to record the sound in life, make sure you don't have your actors over your lines to the top of the way half of Los Angeles rises up. period. <br /> <br /> The unknown is, in my opinion, a complete mess. This is probably not the worst I've ever seen, but it's down there and I don't remember that terrible movie recently. One to avoid if your masohhist or insomniac.
