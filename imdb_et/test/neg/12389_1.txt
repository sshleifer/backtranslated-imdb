I find it amazing that in an age when spiritual fulfillment and fulfillment are unknown, and we are all scattered throughout the spectrum of possible beliefs, the Gurdjieff caliber (charlatanina) karlatan and fraud are extraordinary; It is a pity that he abused this, but that his wounded ego, which was in his career and in his appeal and in front of him in admiring the frightened sheep, may encourage such extreme detention and credibility. This film depicts Gurdjieff's own largely fictional and fantastic view of his formation and "awakening" (which I would rather describe as his discovery of how much he can influence the thoughts and will of certain types of sadly disturbed people). See if you dare to have an unpleasant eye-opening on how unfortunately we have true religious leaders, as far as a Gurdjieff-like clown can inspire such a commitment - and be careful that your blood pressure medicine is at hand if you are one of those who hope Still, the ruins of Christianity are beginning to develop into a healthy religion as the highest example of cinematography in the service of the entire room and the pretense of an insecure cult.
