It starts with a couple of nasty sex comedy gags, but soon it will reveal its true colors: it wants to be a "death contest" clone. I say "wants" because the script becomes more and more ridiculous when it comes to looking like an absurd "Death Wish" spoof! From a love scene in a room that is inexplicably filled with candles, "heroes" who dress up as messengers and wobble their machine guns because they don't want to pay attention to themselves! lots of ridiculous items that fit in the list. Another big problem is that you can't separate most characters; of course you know who is Borgnine and Roundtree and even James Van Patten, but all other roles could have been played by different actors in different scenes and you don't know the difference.
