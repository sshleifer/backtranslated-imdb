The first twenty-five minutes stand out as the worst of a modern British film. Director / adapter William Cartlidge has dealt with Wilde's original with the respect that he seems to have completely ignored the needs of a cinematographic audience. Fortunately, the quality of direction and editing will improve significantly after the first half of the year, but by that time the damage will be done. Prunella Scales and Robert Hardy wiped out the rest of the actors every time they're on the screen. The other exceptions are Jonathan Firth's Arthur and Karen Hayley Mabel, who are given enough space to give their lines a true comic meaning Wilde intended. The show leaders, James Wilby and Trevyn McDowell, are fairly clean and clean. Obviously trying out a penny with a small budget out of each penny, the game has been nominally upgraded until the 1990s, but with the original script, the effect is more on the TV drama of the 1970s. The real moments of comedy are little and far away, but when they arrive, it's a lot of fun - a sign, perhaps, that a more reasonable pruning of the other games could have led to a better pace, a more consistent film.
