Pinocchio revenge is not a good film. Nor is it terrible. <br /> <br /> The actor was at least Pinocchio in wood. The doll had all 2 phrases. most of them were pleasing up. <br /> <br /> Its special effects are pretty "B" and as I said before, the doll really slept. <br /> <br /> The 2 best scenes in the movie are a knife out of hand ... it seemed pretty good, I think they spent about 1/3 of the budget on this ... and the shower scene ... WOW ... I guess that they had to spend the other 2/3rd of the budget talking to the actress who did this scene to do it. <br /> <br /> Seriously this is just below the average "b" horror doll ... rent Chucky if you have the desire to see the dolls kill. <br /> <br /> The story was an interesting idea enough to keep me going.
