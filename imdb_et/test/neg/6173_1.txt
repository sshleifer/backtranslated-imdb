Truly terrible waste. I and my friend tried to look at this film but had to turn it off after about 30 minutes. And I can read the movies I've turned off before on the one hand. <br /> <br /> The script and direction are leading and deeply uninspiring. I would not be surprised if they had found the script since 1983 triggered by scripts. I mean seriously. The police beat her doors in minutes. Scenes and events are just like you in rivers. The real thrust of the film is hard to understand. Between the characters, the narrative slips seem seemingly random, breaking down pathetic attempts to build signs. Oh and what "characters" they are. The main character who played Rourke is terrible. He could have taken it out of cardboard and stayed in bed. After 60 or more minutes of the film, I made absolutely zero for this sign. He is not compassionate or angry. Just a hidden dummy from a shop window bounces through every scene. His motivation cannot be understood at all by mumbles and emotional events. Is he happy? Is he sad? Angry? There is no clue. Just the same dead eyes that looked at you. And the local American theme is just terrible and pointless. Good guys are at best unlikely. Bored white collar stereotype and repetitive neurotic ex-female stereotype. Cue archetypal a woman with a shotgun face off a bad guy, "you are not going to shoot me" that is so tiring unoriginal and annoying. <br /> <br /> The character of Richie nix seems interesting at first, but soon the irritating one-sided psycho character will fall. This seems to contradict the seeming intention of making bad guys somehow sympathetic or at least realistic. <br /> <br /> The character of Robertoario Dawsons begins with some promises, but will soon fall into the gangster sick and child parody. Jackie Brown's Chick Scenes. You really want me to believe his character was Rourke interesting? Worse still, he is just a cozy one who sleeps with everything that moves? Realistic female characters FTW! All in all, the movie is a complete mess. Desperate Characteristics and Performances. Leaden and hackneyed script with uninspired direction. And ultimately extremely boring. He is not even a comedy. Laughing Rourkes haggard's face gets old after the first 15 minutes of the movie.
