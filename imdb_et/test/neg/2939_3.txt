I'm quite surprised that someone found it by touching or moving the film. <br /> <br /> The main prerequisite for this film was, as a great, provocative idea of ​​a rare relationship about the film, but one (if I can judge it on the basis of my real examples) is extremely deep and loving. <br /> <br /> But the film has been written in an inexpensive way - poorly written - and although it has a number of very beautiful pictures, it didn't find anything special. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest problem is that it is too short and poorly prepared to give your audience enough time to invest, emotionally, characters: we don't care about them, so their tensions and obstacles do not touch us. <br /> <br /> I think it is up to the REMAKE scenario because of the development of some really good writers - it can be greatly improved. It is instructive to compare this film with the Brokeback mountain range that the screen writers took far beyond the scenario author - screen writers who were clearly aware of how to write a classic tragedy and perform their task with care, planning and excellent finish! However, people only seem to have movies that don't need it! You won't miss anything if you miss it: I found it very disappointing and it only saved me with 1-star because this sensitive topic has been filmed. .
