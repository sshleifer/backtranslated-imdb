Now I remember what "indie" filmmakers were hanging on before Pulp Fiction. That was David Lynch, right? <br /> <br /> I took this thing to look at Kyle Secor. What a great Baylissi waste. It was so painful to look at her as if someone you love was terribly ill and there is nothing you can do. <br /> <br /> Clich√© of almost every book: wilderness, psychic, peculiar mob boss, biker, Tracy Walker (who luckily was in only one scene, but I was expecting him to appear again and say something weird and deep, like " If a man wants to know where he is going, he has to look at where he has been, or some garbage like that. I have a theory about why so many Indians are very short in the desert. I think that because they can save light. <br /> <br /> If you want to hurt, find this movie and give it a look. If you're a fan of Kyle Secor, check the trial of the trial on the court TV. If you want a good, unique thriller, check out Wild At Heart. <br /> <br /> There is a reason why nobody has heard of Delusion! My God, which is a waste of a good title.
