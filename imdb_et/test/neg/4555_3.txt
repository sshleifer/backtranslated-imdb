Dean Cain, Super-Man, plays Max Hooper super-thief. He can break into any company and steal at the right price. Unfortunately, his last boss stops in a high-rise building where someone else has put the fire to hide his attempts to steal the product. Now the thief must be a hero who saves everyone in the building. Unfortunately, the other thief is still in the building and F.B.I. & C.I.A. is outside the waiting Max. <br /> <br /> The film is hardly satisfactory. Dean Cain is a fun actor and has made much better materials, but here he has a weak scenario and a pretty bad direction.
