A truly wonderful cast and a very talented technical team wasted their valuable careers and equally valuable leisure time, disturbing this completely predictable and simply formal commercial advertising. The film is based on a really good and very topical idea, but both the producers and the director simply used the usual Hollywood "disaster movie" formula and thus destroyed all possible values ​​from production. <br /> <br /> The unusually high tide and very strong hard conditions create a record high storm surge that exceeds London and most of the floods in the Thames Valley. In the middle of the plot, there is a heroic scientist (Tom Courtenay) who warns the authorities of the danger and ultimately saves the day, a glamorous female police chief who heads the entire exhibition and intertwined Prime Minister David Suchet, who is trying to see the important. <br /> <br /> But all this is so unrealistic that it seems that after a 30-minute longer distance. A young glamorous female police chief requires full authority in the emergency declared by the military and gets it (like!). An experienced general is simply left as a complete moor who must stop his boots because of his obviously good power. The problem is that the domination of our women, who is now responsible for millions of lives, is worried most of their time about the fate of their two daughters who have taken a trip to Southwest London and have not called, saying they are fine. So our mighty woman puts her workers in search of them and decides that the only priority for all the army and rescue services must be Northwest London and no other district. Of course, the Minister, the Army and the whole companion will undoubtedly accept setting their priorities. It can be assumed that they all had property there. When his children are finally found after the endless reports and efforts of their employees, our male hero says, "Thanks to God they are safe, this is the main thing." Don't forget the millions of others and all the other responsibilities he had to check; as long as his own children were safe, everything was fine. <br /> <br /> This movie is another excuse to push the same old female kinistic sexist stapler that women are smart, attentive, caring and clearly capable leaders, while men are nothing but physical bravery, meaningless strength and highly professional knowledge. And another simple command he could give to the people; namely to go to the nearest tall building and calmly go to the 4th floor or higher and wait for the instructions when the water returns, never given by this female super hero - or anyone else. The whole problem was so easy to solve and millions of people probably didn't just think upstairs! Pathetic garbage.
