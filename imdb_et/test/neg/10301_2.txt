I work at Memorial Hermann Hospital (TMC) and also worked at Allison's Texas Children's Hospital, Women's Hospital and West Houston. First of all, hospital pictures are unfortunately suburban. Texas Medical Center has a daily population density similar to Wall Street! There are large high-rise buildings and hospitals. TCH was the largest children's hospital before doubling, TWICE! The method, with its 1,500 beds, is one of the world's largest hospitals. The Texas Medical Center silhouette is larger than Memphis. But the best pictures of Hollywood can accumulate in the middle of some fucking hospital somewhere in the middle (in addition to the actual picture taken by the hospital decades ago). They also combined several real characters and depicted them all in one (superhero). I really know the medical technician (s) who work in the blood bank. Two, who actually worked, but there is only one pregnant MT in the movie. There was a pregnant MT and another MT who took the valuable patient's rolodex (research "allo-antibodies" for more information). I do not mention their names (privacy). The real life labis was not a sister. Hollywood combined these two techniques (most likely to save time and money). In the film, military helicopters (true) had to hand over their children (NICU and PICU) to UTMB until Galveston! Why can you ask if we have the biggest children's hospital on the street? Because Texas Children's Hospital refused to take them. You're reading right, they're affirmed !!! Having used them, I was ashamed. Needless to say, I am no longer involved with this facility. All other comments would be repeated by those who have already lived here or lived through experience.
