I think it was a HORRIBLE error in the Disney part. First of all, Kuzco does not have to become an emperor of the Emperor! It has never happened before. Second, the new voices do not sound at all. Very bad again. And when I adored the movie "The New Emperor's New Moon", the new school is just stupid. Like all jokes are the same, and many are in the movie. The plot becomes superfluous, always Yzma (that's how you write it right)? Trying to get the Empress, Kuzco by stopping him, etc. Or Kuzco to learn for a better person. I think Kuzco is disturbing his constant complaints and questions. He's corrupted and it disturbs me. I don't think it's worth five minutes of your time, much less than half an hour.
