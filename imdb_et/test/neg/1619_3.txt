It may not be as terrible as Raymond Wallace's absolutely dreadful work! This man is so bad that it wasn't even funny! The film needed his character, but why did he choose this man beyond me. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for high quality Chinese movies ... ... I could recommend "Raise a red lamp" .... "Qui Ju story" .... "Red whore" ...... < br /> <br /> Something but it! I was surprised how many people appreciated it! Really ... the action of this Wallace loser is so bad that it overshadows the other good parts of this movie. It was agreed by all 6 of us who watch this movie last night. <br /> <br /> Leave this trash ........
