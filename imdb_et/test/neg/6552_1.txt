This garbage belongs to the basement of some form of old manor, where he never sees the light of day. The only thing that was scary about this junk was the entrance price. I was just having fun when the run-out credits started running and I was free to release the auditorium. Which unmitigated hole? one and a half hours of waste. When I die, I pray I can come back as a ghost and give a fever to the poison who threw this gibber.
