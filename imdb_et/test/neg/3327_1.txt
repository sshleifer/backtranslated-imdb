My daughter liked her, but I was amazing that the character of this movie smokes. As if it wasn't terrible enough to see "product placement" actors like Bruce Willis who smokes in their movies - at least kids' movies should be more discerning! I don't know if it was deliberate? Is a big tobacco in the movie? What does it take to prohibit the smoking of films? At least movies for children and adolescents.
