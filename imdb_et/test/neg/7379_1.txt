As Anthony Bourdain said ... "I wanted to catch my head in a bucket of bread, pull out my eyeballs and jump out of the shore." It summarizes my feelings about the wasteful waste of human activity. Artless, self-conscious, thoughtless and just bad. Bad understanding. What else to say? If you're lucky enough to be in an area where this idiotic trash is playing, please, please, please heal the soul and avoid it at all costs.
