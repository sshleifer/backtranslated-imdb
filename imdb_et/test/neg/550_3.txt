The last installment of the Karate Kid series is predictable, malfunctioning, and so bad that it is limited to enjoyable. But not quite, it's just bad. In this regard, Ralph Macchio is not a Karate Kid who has already been in too many episodes. The new boy, played by Hillary Swank, is a teenage grandchild of one of Miyog's WWII friends. Her parents have recently died and her grandmother is trying to raise this young hell. At the same time, Mr Miyogi is right. According to the formula, there are a number of neo-fascist tempters, called the Alpha Tropics, to be placed over them and the new karate movement, called the prayer murder. As I said, this film is confusing and should be avoided.
