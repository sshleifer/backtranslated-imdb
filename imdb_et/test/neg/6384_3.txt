I've seen this movie and, frankly, it was quite disappointed. And I don't think this film has a heart. To be honest, what did happen to the incident at the end of the film was not interesting. <br /> <br /> There was so much that they could have made the movie they didn't do because they were so talkative, trying to be hidden and making some deep comments about life or trying so hard for characters and story were completely lost. I've seen another picture by this director and enjoyed it well enough. But I felt that the film was not otherwise crazy and heart, and I thought about what it was or if the idea of ​​the movie was that it didn't make sense. To be honest, although I didn't feel my hair a little while during the film, I regret the sad time of the little movie. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that some people love this movie, but frankly I didn't.
