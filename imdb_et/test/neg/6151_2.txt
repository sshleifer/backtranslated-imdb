I saw this movie when it first appeared in the cinema. We all expected Mark Hamill to restart his career, but we came out wishing we didn't bother. Many people went out in about half an hour - I wish I would. The main premise seems to be fine, but the plot was ridiculously involved and embarrassing and runs through half. Its completely unmemorable, and not the movie you want to pay for the money to see. If you are really bored and it is on television, it will help you kill (or help you kick off!) A couple of hours. 2/10
