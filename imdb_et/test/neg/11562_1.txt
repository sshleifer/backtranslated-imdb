The Mystery Science Theater 3000 would not have been able to show any quality of redemption in this "pearl". <br /> <br /> This is like a cheesy pirate copy of the 80's porn that could have been bought from VHS 42st. before Disney bought the whole smash and closed them all down. <br /> <br /> But wait - all sex scenes are cut. I'm challenging someone to find a worse movie. This film can replace water collection as a humane interrogation method. <br /> <br /> No, I'll take it back - I'd prefer a ride. <br /> <br /> The only credit that this film could earn beyond being the worst film ever made would be to threaten your Middle East problem by hurting the movie.
