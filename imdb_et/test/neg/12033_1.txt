First of all, let me start by saying this movie SOUNDED is very interesting: a serialist who copies Edgar Allan Poe (who is one of my journalists) works. Sounds good, right? Yes, certainly not. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Never. And it's not an exaggeration. I've seen a lot of very bad movies. It takes a cake. And I was even ready to go into the bad movie before that. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the writer would have had to investigate some law enforcement procedure: if you have the name of the killer, the history of his life, the record of the offender and his address, where is the first place you should look? Hmm. . . possible. . . his house? What ?! NO! It's a pointless idea, Anthony! How could you do something as obvious and flat as going to the bowling hall? * Spoilers * Honestly, sometimes I can forgive a movie if the writing is good, but it works badly or vice versa. . . but it was just all wrong with what you could find. <br /> <br /> I think my biggest pet bark was how the police / FBI acted. <br /> <br /> For example: Black FBI Agent: "Okay, endangered woman, just sit in the car in an empty car park when I enter and look around for a potential crime scene where there should be a serum killer. Moronic Female FBI Agent:" Yes , it sounds good to me. Go straight ahead. I can't focus on my surroundings or at least control the perimeter. "Black FBI agent:" Great, I do! "Frankly, if you want to be in a law enforcement agency, rent this movie so you can learn how not to act ... or if you are a person and you want to learn the same. <br /> <br /> 0.5 / 10: Half-point only for film making and in stores. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
