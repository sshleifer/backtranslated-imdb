If this film won the Lumiere Award for the best French movie, what garbage will come from France these days? <br /> <br /> The topic is important - how African economies are the international organizations that should help them, namely the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. About 40% of the budgets of several African countries pay the debt of the West, while their people suffer from illness, dehydration and illiteracy. in a way that a human drier can imagine as a Sahara that surrounds the state of Mali, where this film takes place. More monotonous and incomplete than any documentary I've ever seen (and I'm a fan of the genre), one "witness" after another appears in this "trial" that is "stuck" to a film condemning the World Bank and the IMF. Some critics may set aside colored visuals in the film, but they were in place and had no additional soundtrack during the screen. They were better in the coffee table than in the movie. Everything in the theater laughed. Did these people read our thoughts on the screen? <br /> <br /> Danny Glover was short on this film. It is a television movie "Bamako" and it was set in Morocco or Mali. It was also more ridiculous than any spaghetti I have ever tried to avoid. The only redeeming part of these five wasted minutes was where a Caucasian bad boy threw an African child accidentally carrying a baby and did not show any resentment. Perhaps it was a symbol of the unknown of the World Bank and how he accidentally kills Africans. <br /> <br /> And one last technical departure, the subtitles were hard to read so many bright colors if not. enough black sketch for subtitles. <br /> <br /> I've already made a movie for you. Don't be fooled by the fool. No need to see this movie. You can't get these two hours back in your life.
