Hi, today I was watching this movie because of an average (5.6) IMDb rating. I thought it was worth a look. Here, too, the comments were silent, but after watching this movie, I realized that this movie is still not close to 5.6! Its just boring. You can also describe the movie in a few words with the story of just a standard horror movie that includes all the usual scenes of horror movies. I don't know why people like such movies still like it, or why such movies are better than 1â€“3 IMDb. Just a few examples <br /> <br /> People who come somewhere or go / travel everywhere. They meet somehow on their journey with strange people, but hey they are just nice to spend with them. Then there is a very important scene for every horror movie "Oh my cell phone doesn't work oh oh my too .. is that weird but we don't need them so our ride ..." uhhhhhh our strange person is strange psychopath better than we we all sit back and scream for a while until he begins to cut us or kill some of us. After a while, they can get a gun or a chance to escape because they never think they run or even kill the psychopath when they have the opportunity to talk about what to do until the psychopath gets back with a few tricks of the usual tricks they got in these films and all running back as usual ... screaming ... more killing ... oh and finally it can really get out, sometimes a bad guy sometimes wins some victim. great movies. ... OK, if I never saw a movie I would say it is a movie that can be viewed, but if someone sees some sort of movie, it should be just a boring waste of time because almost everyone in the movie you know before if you watched it because every time it runs like a usual horror film shematic. .... mmm maybe there is a windows program? Horrormoviemaker 2.0? Just drag some of the adjustment buttons and get a new Shuttle, Saw45674, Jeepers Creepers movie.
