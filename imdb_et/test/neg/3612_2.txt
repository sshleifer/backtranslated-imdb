After an unfortunate accident with his boat, Snake Island has left a group of tourists. They are forced to spend the night and, as you probably suspect, are not called Snake Island, because it's just so much fun to say - it's a history that has disappeared one by one because of the big wormholes, which is what happens to the foolish souls of their poor. This is a very boring and typical movie with tons of off-screen snake attacks and bad performances by NOBODY actors. The only somewhat entertaining scene was the totally unnecessary and forced track that nothing to see on the PG13 movie. If you are in a snake movie like SSSSSSS, don't torture yourself against this mess.
