I saw this movie when I was in France and I have to say it confuses me. This is the story of a jeweler and a young singer who both come to Morocco at the same time and come together and form a community. Easy? The problem is that it is such a film that has both a chronology (the movie is not played in full order) and reality (whether what I just saw really happened or was it just a dream?). Given these parameters and the bilingualism of the film, it was really difficult to follow and I wasn't sure what happened at the end. I think some deep artistic types could better understand this film than I do and it may need to understand more than one view.
