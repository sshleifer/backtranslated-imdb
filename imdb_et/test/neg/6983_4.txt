Yeah, I know his character was supposed to be drunk, and he can just be silly. But something says this criticism that Mr. Pleasence really drink a lot and was intoxicated during his scenes. Basically everything he says is quiet and often incomprehensible. Or maybe the values ​​of poor productions ... were hard to say. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the Yankee Zephyr competition is a movie that just doesn't work. This is also a shame, because the film has a terrible opening and a generally interesting plot. Ultimately, the production values ​​are too small and this activity is too small for this New Zealand adventure to deliver goods. The story is about a US military platform full of gold, money and medals that hit Lake New Zealand during World War II. The plane will be lost for about forty years or so as to somehow wash the shore and drunk (Pleasence) literally stumble. At first, he collects all purple heart medals and tries to sell them in the city, actually getting them $ 75! He has little to know that when he sells them, the local jeweler will get his phone and try the information about the plane. Before you start blinking, all the attention to the city will be given to the wealthy scumbag (Peppard) and his henchmen, and they will try to force the old guy to give up his plane quickly, because they know there's much more than medals. The old drunkard business partner (Wahl) and his daughter (Warren) then fly out to try and succeed before the bad guys get it. The resulting action is not just as fun as you hope it would be. <br /> <br /> Operation is quite terrible, except for Pleasence. George Peppard is trying to make some (guess) Australian accent, but it's hardly convincing. Lesley Ann Warren is not too bad, but Ken Wahl is really bad. He basically makes his best impression of Michael Pare on his worst day. And it says something. Hopefully, he made enough money for this movie to fix his foreheads, which seemed a bit crooked. I don't remember if he'd straightened them up when he got to Wiseguys. The rest of the majority is pretty unattractive. Probably mostly local people who never did much more. I think the biggest problems for me were the lack of making big films and the lack of danger. Roisto is too nice and silly to be taken seriously. And to be honest, there are no helicopters in the movie that look like a DVD cover. And none of the boats on the film have their teeth painted on them. <br /> <br /> The film still has its strengths. The beginning, which begins as a newspaper and then becomes a story, was a nice touch. Brian May's score sounds a little too much like in Mad Max 2, but he added a nice little ride to some scene. Looks like a big refugee! There are some clean helicopter stunts and a big boat ride that probably killed three stuntmen during filming. The landscape, despite its grainy appearance, is still pretty beautiful. What you remember most is the drunk of Donald Pleasence. He was almost enough to record this movie. Almost. 4 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
