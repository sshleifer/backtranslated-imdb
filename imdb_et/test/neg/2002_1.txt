Please do not waste your money as an excuse to get the movie. The only way I saw someone looking at it is if they are a hard fan of Erika Elania, but you would be better off surfing the internet than watching it. I'd rather look at the color when I look at it. <br /> <br /> They attract you to Casper and Erika and believe that this is a sci-fi Dracula movie, but it works fast to be Van Helsinki's great farce (show point) grandson, ironically one of the last shows and Dracula between. <br /> <br /> The film also attempts to make a political statement if I think none of the characters in the future know who God is, that they have not been taught of him, and they do not understand when they see the cross. Much more could have been done with this idea. It is a shame that revealed how it did.
