This movie is a very disappointing book. As Rafael Sabatini wrote, it was a pure battle against piracy in the Caribbean and it would have been a great initiative. It would also have been very easy to do. All operations take place on the ship and abandoned island. Unfortunately, screen writers took a title from Sabati and threw away the rest of the book. Even the name of the headline changed and the personality of his screen was completely different from the person described in the novel. This is a sad loss for those who love a good sea story.
