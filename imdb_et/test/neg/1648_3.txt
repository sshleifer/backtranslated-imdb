It amazes me that someone finds Pauly Shore entertaining: he is basically one joke that is hidden * real * fast. She has her small "California" jerk vocabulary and basic stock jokes. Mainly he is just unpleasant. <br /> <br /> That means I was watching this movie because I was sick and there was literally nothing other than infomercials, otherwise I would have turned it off after 30 minutes. Anyway, the film could have been OK if Pauly could have turned off his spiel and just played this comic as an actor, not well, Pauly. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm sure Pauly fans like that - but if you're not a Pauly fan, stay away from this manure. <br /> <br /> I had to leave this comment saw that another user actually gave this film the 10/10! (Maybe it was Pauly !!) Personally, I gave him 3/10 because they had no mike-in-frame frames, the camera didn't fall and the support cast was pretty good.
