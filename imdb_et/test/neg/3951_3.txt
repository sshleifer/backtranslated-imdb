After the mysterious death of an old friend, a group of teenagers Stay Alive, a horror survival video game based on Erzebet Bathory, is known as Blood Countess. The group will play the grisly game and soon they will be murdered one by one by the same method that is played in the game. As the line between world games and reality disappears, our heroes need to find a way to win a blood cell. "Stay Alive" is an incredibly poor teen slasher flick without any doubt. Writer-director William Brent Bell has no idea how to make a horror movie. Jumping fears are irritating, blood / gore levels are almost non-existent and the story doesn't make sense. Dialogue is totally bad and the actions of all involved are embarrassing. "Stay Alive" is easily one of the worst mainstream horror flicks of 2006.
