Some people think negatively about Sweden: too clean, too clean, too serious, too organized and too north. A person tortured by his religious destiny and history, which sometimes leads to depression and compulsive heaviness. This does not seem to be a problem for the filmmaker because, for example, late Bergman has shown us what a cinema is possible under these conditions. Bergman used his identity as a starting point and did not explicitly explain this identity as such. <br /> <br /> Andersson does the opposite: He only comments on this identity by subtracting his people from the bone. Sweden is equal to hell. But he doesn't take it anymore, and for me it's not just art, it's just a note. Despite the extraordinary time it took for the filmmaker to make serious restrictions, he cannot obviously step down. <br /> <br /> There is not much progress compared to his previous film Sånger från andra våningen / songs from the second floor. The goal was to make it more accessible, but the difference is minimal and the few scenes that try to please the larger audience are not the best in the movie. The same absurdity and minimalism are still applicable, the camera has a single camera position and its absence (lack). Yes, the photos are well done, some scenes really work, and coloring and positioning are amazing. But does this make an interesting movie? Thinking negatively, this cinema has stepped back. <br /> <br /> Andersson's background as a creator of ads seems to be in a complicated setting, but I find that his films are as empty as those ads. There is a message about humanity, but it is trivial and without deep depth.
