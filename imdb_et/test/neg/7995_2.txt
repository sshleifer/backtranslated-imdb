A terrible action film, where Franco Nero exchanges his cowboy hat, armchair and coffin he dragged in DJANGO (1966), for white white Ninja clothing, which includes all the snazzy accessories that come with it! Despite virtually no stoppage, the film is completely sleek and inadvertently funny - with a campy wool to walk, Christopher George. Susan George (no affiliation) is an attractive woman with a washed husband, Nero's warrior, who is being killed by the villain to crowd his oil - but the latter is not counting on Nero's martial arts (and stunts) - heavyweight gymnastics. The solution to these problems is to hire a similarly qualified Ninja, who, as it happens, turns Nero into a deadly enemy (played by Sho Koshu, who appeared in two more queues and is currently working on another!). The climax takes place in the arena where one man's army, Nero, removes George and has remained in his gang during previous confrontations; how he sends out his nemesis is actually done.
