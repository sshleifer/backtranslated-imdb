Well, I looked at some of my friends to see this movie, we went an hour before the show started. So if you think we left this movie :). But this excitement soon turned to horror, this movie is a complete failure, just trying to be funny to be sad, the script is poorly written and hard for participants to do ... <br /> <br /> The only good thing to do in the whole movie, Stefan C. Schaefer, who was great, was a weak plot and even "funny" scenes felt compulsive and unnatural, given that the main actors are some of Iceland's best comedians that is very special ... <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone because it tries hard and never offers.
