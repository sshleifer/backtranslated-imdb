I have little interest in seeing another terrible movie that doesn't have a whole new creative or funny, abusing the National Lamp. How ever he captured something about this movie. I see Danielle Fishel's name as a big boy who meets the world! But the movies are terrible. More than a fan of what I do not pay, seeing his terrible movies with a naked breast. So that's my question. <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen this movie? And if so, is Danielle Fishel nude? I'd save me 2 hours of my life, which I'd never look at this terrible movie. Thanks
