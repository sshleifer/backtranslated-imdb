Dead Man's Bounty is a classic Italian western look and feel. Cinema, costumes and kits look great. The harsh, not quite the face, is cast. At first I made a pretty cool movie, but what I finally saw was an absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The script was absolutely terrible. There was no tension or very little action or valuable drama. <br /> <br /> Despite the magnificent view, (in English) the heavy European accents, which were often incomprehensible, spoke. <br /> <br /> The final nail chest was a widespread pretentiousness that painted most of the picture, focusing heavily on the character of the barmaids, who have been experiencing a couple of very uncomfortable sexual scenes. Also close to the end of his speech was rather reluctant! <br /> <br /> The only novelty comes from Val Kilmer's stunt election as a dead person, continuing his latest DOA performances!
