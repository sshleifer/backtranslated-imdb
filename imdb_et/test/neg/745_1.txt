The filmmakers were clearly drugs. This is the only explanation I have. How else would you explain Jane Austen's adaptation to the travest? The Northanger Monastery is a Gothic novel parody. But this film was made as if it were a Gothic novel. Strange musical and dream sequences show me drug-induced hallucinations rather than a naive, innocent girl with an overwhelming imagination, like Catherine's novel ... <br /> <br /> Catherine's acting actor is just around the bug-eyed all the time . Peter Firth sees at least 10 years too old to play Henry and he seemed to me a bit on the gay side. I don't see the attraction between him and Catherine. The depiction of John Thorpe was rather strange, but Isabella wasn't that bad. But nothing saves this CRAP movie! One more thing - this film presents a character that is not in the book, General Tilney's French friend "The Marchioness". Why did they add that he was farther away from me. There should be drugs. He's a scary and incredible white face, red lips and black lines that are randomly painted on his face (dimples?). this is good quality, but unfortunately it is not. It's just BAD.
