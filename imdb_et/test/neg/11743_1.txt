A daunting film, badly designed and crude. The behavior of Anne Heche and Vince Vaughan in the original version is as low as Perkins and Leigh. There is no reason to take this picture, which only highlights how the Hitchcock was achieved and brilliant and how impressive it was. There is also a film that is not in the first film sliding and widespread insensitivity. Hitchcock Psycho was scary and shocking, but everybody, even the bad Norman Bates, can really feel. There were moments of sin, irony and fey humor. One of the best things about Hitchcock's film was his incredible and intuitive depth and nuance, when to cut off and when to show something, whether to use a close neighborhood or a long fire, to make an actor sympathetic and when to scare him, etc. Transformation does not have any of these qualities or even catches them. This is an idiotic exercise that I am surprised to even get rid of.
