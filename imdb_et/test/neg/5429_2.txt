This is one of Crichton's best books. Karen Ross, Peter Elliot, Munro and Amy characters are beautifully developed and their interaction is exciting, challenging, and fast paced in this impressive novel. <br /> <br /> And about 99.8 percent of this disappeared from the film. Seriously, the scenario and management were terrible and clearly made for people who couldn't understand the novel. I can't blame the actors because, frankly, they've never been able to do this turkey according to Crichton's original work. I know that good novels, especially those with the edge of science fiction, find it difficult to bring the screen to the original. But it can be the absolute worst difference between novelty and screen customization. The book is really good. The film is just terrible.
