Some of my co-authors have covered the elements of this film, so I will stick to some of the cuff notes ... <br /> <br /> 1. It's fun - but not for the reasons you think. It's cheesy, but somehow traceable. <br /> <br /> 2. Tamra, Daniel's love of interest must be around thirty. A Christian girl whom Dan ignores is a visa. <br /> <br /> 3. Muriel stole his shirt from Mr. Spock. Also, if my guardian angel looks like Muriel, I have to ask for a transfer. <br /> <br /> 4. Okay ... so obviously ... Dan is responsible for his parents divorce! What a terrible guilt trip? Muriel says it was Dan's prayers that kept her parents together. I thought it was completely ridiculous. Listen, I can pray for my parents as much as I want, but the only way they stay together is if they decide they will. <br /> <br /> 5. I repeat the atheists' comments about how this film depicts non-Christians. Obviously they are all cunning bully. <br /> <br /> 6. Something good - David White is a decent actor. He gives the film some credibility, even if he is the only one. He keeps this movie alone.
