Of all the films in the movies, I can't imagine anyone sitting and saying I want to spend X dollars (or pounds) to make this flawless classic movie "The Breeders". Many stories have become films that touch the meteors that come to Earth to hide something blind. Why not put your money on making this remarkable 3D remake instead of "See Came from Outer Space"? Why look for a nudie flick that only existed to show off rubber kits and some nude moths? Was the 1986 Breeders script so inspirational that these producers felt it had to be done again and again this time? When you come to this, the only reason this film exists is the Britcom cutie at Samantha Janus. But if you begin to slip your skin and use Sam Janus, it would be better if you got him more naked than that and naked if you wanted to succeed. <br /> <br /> Meteor lands. .. monster escapes ... coeds duff your clothes ... monster eats people ... and another "what if?" Frankly, I never thought I'd ever recommend an original "Breeder" for any other film, but that would be the second place.
