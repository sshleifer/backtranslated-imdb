This is a relatively observable film (+1). After UKM viewing: The Ultimate Killing Machine looks good. There are no obvious technical gaffs, although the vampire teeth seem odd. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't make sense. Let's see. American GI fights with vampires. Back to the countries and restored to see ... Vampires. His commander is the aunt of his former wife. Who happens to study the biodiversity of the South American region, where vampires are. Ah! Do not pile too much coincidence. Who cares about the head vampire? Or his daughter? Or any of this movie? The only originality is that most myths about vampires (allergic to crosses and garlic, can't get out of the day) are wrong. But they cannot be killed, except by killing or wounding the heart. Yeah, of course. It is obvious that they just did not want to film dark films because it was made for a TV movie. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice for the viewer to hire some actors. Oh, they have a Lynda Carter (TV Wonder Woman) and a big, black dude with a huge deep voice spitting correctly to show their vampire denture. But otherwise they would never know they had actually paid for reading the lines.
