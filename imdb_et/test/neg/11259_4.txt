If you've ever listened to James Lee Burke's book on a tape or CD and the reader was Will Patton, you can agree with me that Will is personalizing Dave R. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones is a native Texan (or so I've heard), and no one represents Texan's better IMHO, but he's not Cajun. His delivery is wrong. I lived in the country for several years and I still hear the strange sinus that Louisiana's accent contains. TLJ has nothing like that. <br /> <br /> I thought Marry Steenbergen was a good choice for Bootsy, but I miss seeing Cletus (who plays this role? Rock? Mickey Rourke? she must be big). <br /> <br /> In general, I thought this film was just 4 years old - the plot was bursting like a fish out of the water and it didn't have the usual interesting but not linear continuity that the book usually has. <br /> <br /> Hopefully Hollywood will try another JLB book, "Last Car to Elysican Fields" would be a good choice. We would see some of JLB's best crooks.
