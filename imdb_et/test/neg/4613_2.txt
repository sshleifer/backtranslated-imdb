In the 1970s, the classic horror film Carrie after this offer is like Ford following Mustang with Edsel. This movie was terrible in every detail. It would have been called Beverly Hill 90210 meets Mystery Science Theater 3000, but both of them far surpass it. This movie was barely a horror movie. I timed about 3 minutes of gore and 90 minutes of flat high school hazing and ritual. Wow, what a surprise, Carrie's strange friend makes suicide! Wow, Carrie understands the interests of your love affection! Wow, the crowd creates Carrie! Leaders have a race with a sexual rating! What this film needed was tea and much less tired teen clich√©s. This movie is completely invisible.
