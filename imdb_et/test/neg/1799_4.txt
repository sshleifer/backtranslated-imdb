The Heart of Darkness, based on Joseph Conrad's 1899 book, is one that has little detail and has an almost schizophrenic line. When you read the book, you know that little or no meaningful story was put into the movie. There is so much in the book that imagination stays and I feel it is part of what makes the book what it is. For example, if Marlow spent hours and days, even rabbits waiting for the moon, and the whole scene was out of the movie. Again, once you read the book, you would know that this scene in the book is one that almost describes the most important, nullity issue. Finally, I feel the film was too cut and dry. The original text was not set up enough and how it did what it is today. <br /> <br /> If you have not read "The Heart of Darkness" (preferably Norton Critical Edition), do not belt your time or buy a movie. But when you read the book, I think you value the book much more than you decide to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Eric 2007
