I really feel bad about watching this movie because I wish I had looked at it as a concept production. The pact seemed to have been truly original, but unfortunately they lose an excellent idea when translating the screen. <br /> <br /> The story follows four (five) teenagers who are descendants of families. that started as the survivors of the Ipswitch City Salem Witch Processes. They are also part of the secret sect called "contract". Their power needs to be used sparingly because it empties their vitality in small amounts and is highly addictive. Theoretically, it would make a pretty good sci-fi movie, or at least be interesting. <br /> <br /> But there were just too many striking downs that prevented the film from reaching its full potential. This operation was not good, the soundtrack was mediocre, and we found many unnecessary sync problems. Certainly the biggest problem is poor editing. The film has little or no single stream and makes one fight with the spiritual timeline or feel any sense. <br /> <br /> The film has moments, but in general it was a little disappointing. Witchcraft 4/10
