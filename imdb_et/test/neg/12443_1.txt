My mother brought this movie to me on DVD. The landlord suggested this. But in fact it can be the worst film I've ever seen. You know, I didn't expect much from this movie, but it didn't have a good story, it wasn't even funny and it was pointless. I was waiting for Christine Lakin in this movie because I loved step by step. Even he was a big disappointment. The story was completely unreal. One of the guys in the party is dead (he wasn't really dead, he woke up later), the house looks like a bomb exploded and there are 2 men who have 3 hours to get through. But then there will be a homosexual, cop ... Until the end there is complete confusion and the guys were able to get up and all in 15 minutes? Come on, be at least realistic. Waste of money. Really ...
