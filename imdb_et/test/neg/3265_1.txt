This film is so pious that it was literally a watch. I wanted to throw it out of my vcr and throw it into the room, but I thought (foolishly) that it would finally be funny and then everything would be fine. "You lose, we win, yes!" This movie should be watching everyone who, even once entertained, thought Jackie Mason was funny. After that, they beat the head of the film until the tape breaks. And if you even consider it for rent (or worse!), Then I have one thing to ask you: didn't you even look at the cover? I mean, such a mess as you can just say, how bad it is! "Oy vey!" This movie was sucked.
