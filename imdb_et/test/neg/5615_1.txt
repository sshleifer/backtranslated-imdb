Despite the great soundtrack and the ever-increasing presence of Rappaport and Woods, this is one of those moral comedies where New York throws itself at the hero on behalf of a writer and / or director to show what the place is. Yes, there are other things in the movie that suck, but that's important. The trend of the independent filmmakers in New York seems to be "I don't have to be talented, I have NEW YORK!" Okay, to be fair, there are moments in the movie. A little funny, why one guy called Wacky Jack was pretty fun. A script is not a story or plot, it is a set of non-good scenes that are related to one another in the same nature. <br /> <br /> One of the worst things is that there is no motive for what characters are. Uncle Sam is a boy with drugs, why? If so, why didn't Sam do it himself? Then there is a token behind his scene scene, where nothing can lie. A man falls in love with an airliner who has no reason to fall in love. Characters are a bunch of pawns to allow the writer to move around to see if he can do anything. If you are watching bad mainstream movies, check out this. If you want to see what a good, light-hearted criminal movie is, see Takeshi Kitano's Brother. "Kicked In The Head" is a great example of why so many people hate amazing indie movies: a lot of them are sucked. And a remark for the director: Don't be afraid to awaken, entertain, enlighten or entertain the audience now and then. Bored being doesn't make you a better filmmaker than those who interest me.
