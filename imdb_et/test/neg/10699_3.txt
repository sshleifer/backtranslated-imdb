Most of the time I thought this movie un commented, but the last 10 minutes prompted me to write. You see, right, we learn (SPOILERS ... if you can name them), that the damn emperor has no chance that her captain can prepare the world supremacy properly because she is not competent in martial arts! "Prosatanos" has for centuries been a ghost, waiting for "human greed" to let go, but was defeated with a simple one-off game with 54-year-old former karate champion Chuck Norris! Imagine what would have happened to him if he had taken Jackie Chani ... (* 1/2)
