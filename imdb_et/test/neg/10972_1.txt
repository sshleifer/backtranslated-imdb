I can only think of one reason why this movie was released. Take advantage of Guy Pearce's upcoming fame. This film has no value at all and the memory of Errol Flynn is in the trash. Homosexual encounter was pure speculation. The contempt shown by Flynn in this film is felt. A simple five-year-old actor died of libel. Terrible and embarrassing. Very disappointing. Don't waste your time at this perfect trash. Look at my evil evil ways if you want to find out about this fine actor or read his autobiography. This movie is not so.
