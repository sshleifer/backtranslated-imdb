Why is it that every time I mention this movie to anyone, I have to hear 10 minutes of praise. I have come to the conclusion that every film that has a twist is "a genius" of anyone who watches it. Is this really a movie? Or is it that every time someone says "Wow, it's so cool", everyone has to agree and have no opinion? How this film is rated 7.5 is a disgrace to the film industry in general. It has also become another film that needs two sequences for it, so I have heard about this terrible franchise for some time now. <br /> <br /> Now the movie and why it's so bad. The original concept is not really so bad because there have been no good serial breakers for some time. Writing this movie is both terrible and fulfilling. OK, so it's a low budget movie, but it shouldn't change the story or write. The participants could not worsen their efforts to make this fear of fear or just the fear of this film. So they go out and get a big name in Danny Glover, but his talents (whatever they are) disappear, because ATTENTION IS A PUBLICATION. Why was he even in that movie? What was his whole struggle at the end turned out to be useless and misled what the audience believes. This is, of course, the intention of the filmmakers, but it would not have been possible to do it better without looking at the garbage. And then the "big" twist (this was the third or the fourth?) And the whole audience is shocked and walks out of the theater like it's a masterpiece. Of course, the movie tells the story and not, but it wasn't the only mistake in the movie. The direction had been trying to be too creative with what he was working on, and the kickback sequences were only used as a shock effect. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, even if you enjoyed it, go back and watch the movie and you'll soon understand why it's not worth the praise it gets. For an amazing series of killer movie watch Se7en if you haven't done it. That's what this movie wanted. I have received more arguments about this film than probably others and I continue to argue against it. Please do not support this franchise not only for you but also for me and everyone else. Hollywood has to find a good horror movie, not a 1000 remake, sequel and "shock" feature film (like this one). Oh yes, I saw the 2 tag line seems really promising: "Oh yes, there's blood." Yaaayyyy !!!! Sweet! blood, does that mean good law? Leave me alone. We apologize for the fact that anyone who loves this movie, but bad writing, flashy direction and bad behavior will not make a good movie.
