This is one of the most irregular, climate change movies I've ever seen. Even if you did not like the predecessors of this movie, "Bad News" and "Powerful Ducks", they are bound to do the better job. From the moment a new teacher welcomes and tells her class: "Don't worry about us, we're all losers," you see everything that's 20 miles away for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> All ordinary suspects are here. In addition to the dirty teacher, we also have a group that should be hopeless children (they are brats, yes, but not so much loved ones), the slow-minded sheriff of the small town they love to torture, the rival team winning the arrogant chief organizer, and so on. Only Olivia d'Abo as a new teacher shows no similarity. I've never taken much care of Steve Guttenberg and his execution as a sheriff doesn't change things. Jay O. Sanders is a capable actor, but his character, a rival trainer, doesn't let him do anything. We hope that the writer / director Holly Goldberg Sloan will come up better next time.
