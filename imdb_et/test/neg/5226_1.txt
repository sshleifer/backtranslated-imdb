Wow, this is an anti-Christian advantage at great time! It is based on Stephen King's novel, and he wrote such prejudices before and then Hollywood exaggerates it. In this film, we see a Protestant servant and a Catholic priest who acts like fools and at the same time be prophetic. Of course, the devil has taken over the city, so maybe his influence on these men, but these are typical Hollywood images. They never show a minister who talks and acts like Billy Graham, your local minister or priest. And - the second "given" - they make Satan's character the most interesting of the film. <br /> <br /> Max Von Sydow plays the devil and makes him a nice guy. Ironically, Von Sydow has played many of these roles after depicting Jesus in 1964 in The Greatest Story Ever Told Ever. You don't know why the participants are so twisted? They do not know if they are God, Satan or someone who is in between. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris, who has played many unlikely roles in recent years, has been properly cast in this story. He and the rest of the average spiritual characters in this movie don't make it fun. <br /> <br /> It has been heard that the king's book is even darker and more sick than this hate-colored film, but better designed. Frankly, who cares. The King and Hollywood deserve each other.
