A whole host of teenagers gather to discuss their fears, but an uninvited guest has appeared and kills everything. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst horror movie of the 1990s, Camp Blood (1999), is the only movie that can challenge this title, with some dumb characters and situations that are ever loved by the TV screen. The "end of the surprise" is terrible, as is the rest of this film. Bad entertainment is a good level. My rating: 2 out of 10.
