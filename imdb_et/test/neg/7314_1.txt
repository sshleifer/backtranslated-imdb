Gross Misconduct was one of the texts published in Australia in the early and mid-1990s to investigate the alleged victimization of a privileged heterosexual man in the era of feminism. This creature only needs to look at a pretty young subject and is accused of sexual harassment and his life is destroyed. Fuck those female libbers! Grrr ... <br /> <br /> As my tone can say, I do not buy any such feminist BS and so did not enjoy this movie. "GM" makes sexual harassment and relationships between teachers and students important. Sexual harassment is here the Confused Young Woman's imagination and the professional boundaries that teachers have to preserve ... well if the teacher is a charming and beautiful family man (and is played by Jimmy Smits!) T worry about them. <br /> <br /> A sexist trash and even reviewing it will give it more time than it deserves.
