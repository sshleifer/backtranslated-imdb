This is a technically extremely competent film. The camera's work and direction are excellent, and the actor is fine, especially the fine by Daniel Auteuil. I really thought there were no problems with these aspects of the film. Instead, I was a little annoyed about how the Marquis was depicted because it didn't seem to be honest and seems to be a very revolutionary view of history. In fact, in recent years, the marquis has undergone little transformation as a defender of freedom with a great idea, not the sado-masochistic rape of the fat he actually had. In a sense, it resembles the white cleansing given in the international LARRY FLINT, where these men have become heroic. Even if you do not believe that the marquis perversions were not all that bad (they included rape and extreme violence), his portrayal in this film as a "sexual social worker" seems quite silly in this prison. Instead of a violent and selfish Sade, she spends a lot of time caring for a young virgin and slowly helps her explore her sensuality. What a nice and kind man. In fact, I remind you that this performance reminds me of Maurice Chavalier in GIGI (but without singing) - a lovely older man who loves women. I doubt that the real life of the Marquis de Sade would have recognized this character at all. <br /> <br /> The film has no surprising nudity, although what it shows is extremely clear. Only a maniac would let his children see it because it is a very adult drama. It's very well done and pretty fun - just not all that is true. The director admits that the film is largely fictitious in the interviewed DVD. So go ahead and watch the movie if you want - understanding isn't just historically very good. In the 18th century, sexual freedom was accepted in France because they were quite wide-ranging, so despite what the film shows, it wasn't SEX, it was violence and rape, which was (and still is) a problem.
