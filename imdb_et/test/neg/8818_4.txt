I have to give this movie to 4 because of a couple of things. <br /> <br /> 1. What do I call "foolish victim syndrome"? If you have a killer on the floor and you have a gun - please let him know. If you're a policeman and your shotgun referred to the killer's back - shoot him. <br /> <br /> 2. If you have a high stress situation and you have a finger to trigger a weapon - your first instinct is to squeeze. This is one of the first things they teach in handgun training and because you do not put your finger on the trigger until you are ready for a fire - ask every hunter or infantry. If you have a power failure, you should also agree on your muscles, without changing your finger. <br /> <br /> 3. On the floor it is quite difficult to put 2 more people - one of them a doctor - who will not notice that you are not dead. What's more, if you probably die of a brain tumor and stayed in the hospital a few months earlier. <br /> <br /> 4. Technically the killer killed one of his victims - the man he injected into the poison that was supposed to get the antidote. If you poison someone, it's a murder. <br /> <br /> 5. What was Adam's lesson to learn? Yes, the doctor was supposed to be there, but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I just forgot something. <br /> <br /> Other than these things, I would be a higher class for this movie. The plot was pretty good and the ways the killer killed his victims were very resourceful. I can even forgive the doctor for the terrible terrible - the scenes with his family were sick enough. The cinema and the soundtrack were very good, but the end result seemed viable and just didn't work for me. Thank you very much for not having paid for it, or for having called for repayments.
