I totally agree. It's a "Pitch Black underground" and a well-worn plot. The best scenes I thought were the caves that discovered the caves, going through impossible underground passages, some of them being heartbeats. The terrain was great. Had they been released from the alien CGI badboys, the film would have been much better. All they had to do would never show any monsters, but they all wonder and follow Jack's going crazy, and that could have been a top-notch hockcock-style thriller, perhaps a prize material. Operation is not bad. But these rubber bats just reduce it to the normal price.
