I remember it in my local Blockbuster and I started doing it because I was curious. I liked the movies of mythological creatures. I like movies about werewolves, vampires, zombies, etc. It is based on a half-box, half-human half-leopard creature that would catch the African people. <br /> <br /> The movie is terrible! Participants are terrible! No script! It's all improvised! The whole thing is filmed at night because they say it's the only time you ever see it. This is an obvious bull * bleep *! They're filming at night to make it scary. But they didn't scare me. After killing the first person, I put it back and took it back to Blockbuster. One of the most boring films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now you have probably said that I have no right to review the movie if I have not finished it. Well, this is one of the movies that doesn't deserve it all the time. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10.
