The Italians are undisputed masters in the questionable "art" of ripping and imitating films. What they do is take an innovative, money-shaping and foreign concept, maintain a basic piece and simply add a whole host of activities, capture and political injustice. But what if the non-Italian original is already a reputable infamous film and quite difficult to overcome slop and controversy? Well, I guess you just ignore everything about building or styling a story, and you focus entirely on doing something that is practically a porn movie! This Italian turkey was inspired by Richard Fleischer's successful slavery-sledgehammer Mandingo, which appeared a year earlier, but since the makers were even too lazy to think of another title, one should not expect anything that is far from narrative in depth. characteristic drawings, an uncomfortable atmosphere or thought-provoking statements about intercultural relations. "MandingA" is a pure and simply sexual exploitation, where the plot develops only in the last ten minutes, in other words, if you have a long history of maintenance. The characters in this film are the collection of despicable bastards, which is naturally to be expected when it comes to wealthy and reluctant white people who lead plantation in South America. Elderly and ultra-gentle locals are the widow (who probably also won a couple of "must-of-the-year" awards, who use and long whip slaves. His lover, who, if I understand correctly, is his cousin (?), Is a real woman's wife who enjoys provocative arguments and reprimands the house overnight to copy the crucified slaves. When the son of the plant owner returns from Europe after about 25 minutes of purely wasted running time, the plot will eventually develop itself. A beautiful young man is a few times sexy with his wife (even in front of slaves, supposedly "demonstrates" how their masters do it?), But eventually he falls in love with the cherub preacher daughter. His romantic preference makes obviously an angry wrath on the angry woman, and she draws a terribly cruel revenge that makes life in the plantation forever. Hey? I just realized that the short description of this plot really makes "Mandinga" an amazing movie! Well, it is not and I apologize for raising someone's expectations. It's an incredibly boring and outrageous movie to fight, but definitely the "Mandingo" mentioned above if you like them. This film is more of a darker history page of human exploitation than a truly insightful portrait of the disease, and it was also a properly produced film with real actors, great music and an impressive filming location. "Manding" has nothing to offer.
