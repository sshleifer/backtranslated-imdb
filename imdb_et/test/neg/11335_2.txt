This film is probably the worst title ever dreamed of. Somewhat suitable, taking into account the actual 15-minute content. <br /> <br /> I can do without "Shemp A.D." but I admit that I have some moments of LOL from Moe and Larry's two-maned comedy in some new film material (and the defendants to the men who tried to give it, given their position they were forced to do) even in the manufacture of their dogs). <br /> <br /> Another bright spot on this and the latest AD blasting "Burning in the Ocean" has decided that there is no time behind Joe Palma and his head. There are no attempts to talk to him or to fold his hands like a chicken (see "Hot Things"), may be worth the additional rating point. <br /> <br /> 2/10
