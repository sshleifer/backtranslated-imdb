I am sure that the people who made this film think they are doing something wonderfully politically correct because they can criticize the US wars in Afghanistan and especially in Iraq, suggesting that the US is doing the war well, but will not clean up later, so the seeds will be sown future. In addition, they do it without making Islamists an enemy and without Republicans, because they are Republicans who are in office and are supposed to do a huge thing, bringing the Soviet Union covertly into supplying the war with Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> But seriously. . . do we really want a movie that repeatedly says, "Let's kill some Russians!" Like this is the biggest thing that red bloody america can do? And should we find the divine of this congressman because he surrounds women with big hair and revealing clothes? Even her supposedly smart assistant, who is always dressed professionally, looks at Charlie as she is just the most wonderful, handy and biggest guy. Like he would be Nancy Reagan to his Ronnie. Julia Roberts strikes in her role, but in principle women are indeed violent in this film and it was really annoying.
