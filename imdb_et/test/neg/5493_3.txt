Best around the middle when most symbols shine and go after no one has ever been. This is about the point that we see the majestic breasts of Susan Sarandon (even through the veil). Oddly enough, Beverly D'Angelo, who is nasty about nudity, but Aida Turturro? of all people? no. At the other end of the spectrum, the less talk of Walken, who plays a homosexual, the better. The film has a little plot; Theatrical dialogues and "normal" dialogues often cross, and this is not the kind of thing I think of as a good idea. Life in the theater: who cares? Sometimes there is something in the dialogue, but the film pulls out.
