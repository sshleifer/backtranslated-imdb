The three stars are for Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Nothing else and anyone else in this film deserves even a star smile. Well, OK, Amy Adams deserves a smile, but the geometry does not seem to work, so I'd stay with 3. Tom Hanks ... nothing. Julia Roberts ... nothing. Mike Nichols ... do you see the trend yet? Aaron Sorkin ... OMG, not an option. <br /> <br /> I can deal with a number of points about how Charlie Wilson's war went over history, morality, legitimacy and so on, but I don't think any of these clubs could consider the exhaustion of Aaron Sorkin fans. Take the rest of your movie money. <br /> <br /> However, if you are looking for a nice comment, here is mine. You can put a hot fudge sauce in the trash, but it doesn't change anything. Garbage is garbage and so is Charlie Wilson's war.
