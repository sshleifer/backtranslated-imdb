"Ernest Saves Christmas" is a specialty movie by Ernest Christmas. In this movie, Ernest has to find Santa's successor to keep Christmas going. On the way, he meets a young girl who is a thief and who can steal something very important to Santa (I won't tell you what it is, you just have to look at the movie for yourself). Like most Ernest films, many hits are involved. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably one of Ernest's best films. It's funny and has some important lessons to learn about friendship and family and not to be afraid to show love. It's not the best Christmas movie, but it's good to be a Christmas event. It's a little sad that the film is a bit late.
