The heart of darkness was terrible. The novel was quite difficult to understand, but if the production company decides to freely release the film on that basis, it just mixes up. Not only those who were responsible decided to change certain characters and others to eliminate them, but acting was terrible and the general impression that I got the movie was that it was a complete dud. I looked at the novel to better understand the novel somewhat better, but it just threw me and my fellow classmates completely. I think the film was a waste of time and I was disappointed when I saw Tim Roth in such a disappointing movie, especially when he was under his belt with fantastic cocks like Pulp Fiction and Resivior Dogs. The same is very cool with John Malkovich.
