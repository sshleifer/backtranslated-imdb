It looks like it can go somewhere, then the main characters quickly lead to a three-ring circus with a remarkable stupidity that permanently destroys all the characters. I'm a big movie collector, but that's something I don't consider valid. Bong Water is the trash bin of the deepest areas of the waste bins and I wouldn't have died with it on my shelf. I am actually convinced that this film was created in partnership with a drug free America. If you are a fan of Jack Black, I would say that you may think that 5 minutes of movies are OK because Jack Black continues his legacy to sing songs. I can't really say anything bad about this movie.
