The "40-foot" giant mutant squid with five tentacles, razor fangs, and the ability to recover their cells, terrorizes a small Florida city. Different marine biologists, doctors and policemen can kill it. Meanwhile, a human monster named Miller is taking advantage of people who discover "Devilfish" is a man-made creation used for the greed of some evil physician! Miller attacks a female researcher, strangles her, drops her into a bath, throws her hairdryer, then hangs her panties out of her dead body! <br /> <br /> When our heroes Peter, Stella, have a lot of false alarms, Janet and Bob presented a high-tech (high-tech 1984) "Seaquarium" boat to catch a creature that is often seen in a close or fun apparently accelerated movie, that seems more dangerous. And only a fire can destroy it, leading to a flame burning mechanism and a water beast finale. <br /> <br /> This JAWS deposit is pretty annoying (except for the foot and decapitation), but the tremendous and rewarding Antony Barrymore score and decent (again 1984) monster design are traceable. Luigi Cozzi and Sergio Martino wrote the original story. <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
