Big Oul Brynner, who won the "Oscar" and who among many others marked "Ten Commandments", finished his remarkable career with cheap setbacks like this, Sartana, and such. Indeed, unfortunate. It would be a shame if you see that he is doing his best to stand up to this idiotic thing. There were days when he was surrounded by Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Eli Wallach, The Magnificent Seven and walked under the famous Elmer Bernstein soundtrack. Sometimes it is difficult for an actor to live.
