A few weeks ago I saw a movie poster (2004) labeled "The Latin Godfather" in the movie theater El Padrino. When we're flat, I thought Latin was just Mexico? Let me remind you that any Latin is from or is associated with Latium, in Italy, so that the original man of the godfather is more of a Latin than a Mexican godfather and therefore: we are called Latin people because we speak Spanish, a language that is based in Rome now in Italy. So, to put the bridge on a movie poster like "The Latin Godfather", it's not just ignorant when we try to associate this movie with the original godfather, but desperately and creatively trying to get credit for copying the title to the classic of the movie. Now, about the movie, I just hate it too much, so 1 to 10 is the most 3.
