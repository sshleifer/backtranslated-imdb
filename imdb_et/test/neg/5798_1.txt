I can laugh at almost anything, but unfortunately this smell is not found !!!! I looked at this movie honestly and didn't even smile. I'm shocked that Sandler, Schneider, Spade, etc., put their names in it. Worse than the worst that ever came out of the worst of SNL players. What else to say? How could such a tasteless, extremely unforgettable power source come from such a collection of visible talents !! Maybe I have lost my sense of humor (not likely), but I can't remember a movie I don't like for a long time. Which 2-hour waste I will never get back.
