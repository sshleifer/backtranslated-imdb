First of all, this movie has any movie I've ever seen, and unfortunately I had to see it. I went through the channels one day and hit the film for this harsh apology, and it confirmed what I was talking about for a long time. Carrot Top is not an actor and is not funny in any way. He acts like a big comedian and thinks he is drawing the attention of the viewers. Frankly, he has a 10-year class clown that has less than a 10-year-old ability to compare them with a carrot top to violate their good name. This movie is trying to be funny using an eternal liner, all of which seem to have been lifted from 50 cartoons. Finally, I would have done something to erase the memory of this movie, but unfortunately the memories remain with me. The only thing I can do is to warn others to never watch these movies. But this proves that true rumors of Carrot Top can't be worth anything.
