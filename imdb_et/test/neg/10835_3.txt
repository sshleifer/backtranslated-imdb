What a terrible movie. The effects were bad, especially because of today's standards, but it was forgiving. What was unforgivable was the terrible transformation of every flood / dam that interrupted a disaster that was ever made in this trash. Action was terrible and I mean completely. The story of Michelle Green stopping to save the dog from upcoming torrents was fun. They see water approaching and running for life. (By the way, if they had to find a very old fat dog that Mrs Green wouldn't become inappropriate). They can overcome water for some time before refuge. What speed! Later, the speed is not fast enough to escape the torrents. God, he and this dog ran fast! If you want to see a good movie about dam break - that's not the case. Porchlight entertainment turns out to be good movie films, but this time they missed it.
