Some may go to such a movie, but certainly not. David Norwell, a professor at the College, suddenly gets adopted. She takes pretty much the first child, a bad choice called Adam. As it turns out, Adam does not have any paddle in the water, which almost immediately causes Dr Norwell to remain stressed and confused. This stupid story played one problem after another, all focused on Adam's impossibility and seizures. Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor, as the adoptive child never explained. On the way, a good doctor was able to lure the spouse to share in hell where it was. Personally, I think both were one beer that was short of six packs. Switching.
