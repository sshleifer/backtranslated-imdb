Talk about marketing. "New Twenty" poster / home video broadcast by Wolfe Video with a half-naked man. For those who know gay-themed movies? it transmits "must-see". (I loved to read one reviewer (from another site) saying they were "deceived" to see "Sodomide" movie. Are you serious? The name of the tag is "gay". The Lord gives you eyes, but you don't see?) saying, in spite of the number of homosexual characters, stereotypical, not less (see: lonely gay, AIDS gay and closed gay) are more long-term friendships and characters that are divergent. In fact, if anything, there is more (here is one for Christians to complain) heterosexual couples having sex outside of the spouse! Not to mention backstabbing, drinking over and using drugs. I see it more for a TV-Logo or Showtime movie than a big-screen effort. Of course, I loved cinematography, some actors might have acted, and I always love to see a great group of friends who actually act like they've known each other for years. But we've seen it before. There is nothing new "new" here. Hardly an original idea? hence brings back the same "no" i have AIDS, deal with "a good part of the movie and the store is our friend's serious drug problem, but does not do it until it is almost too late. It is (USA)" Queer as Folk " and the "Broken Hearts Club", respectfully, the film deals with a group of fellow friends who have now grown up (not in the minds), who must finally grow and each try their best if it fails, strangely enough, as in most of these independent films, most interesting to me at least, Ben, he stole every scene, but again there wasn't much to do.
