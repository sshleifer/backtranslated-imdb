In 1989 here NZ wrestling was a somewhat mega-hype phenomenon, and who led the star ship at the top was orange goblin himself, HULK HOGAN (one of my uber-heroes at that time), so now it seems obvious to me why I honored this movie in 1989-90 when it came out here. HULAN HOGAN A.K.A Terry Bollea is a shockingly bad actor and Zeus A.K.A Tiny Lister is worse! The story is followed by the WWE (then WWF) standard about 88-91 stories that culminates in a normal good guy, beats off, and then beats the story again to see that a good man calls his inner strength (vitamins, prayers, etc.) to epic install it back ..... Pretty standard formula here. Worth seeing only remember your youth !!
