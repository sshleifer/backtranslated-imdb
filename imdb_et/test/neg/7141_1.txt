Okay, first the good thing: if you saw a trailer, you know about 100% of the movie's "frightening / jumping" moment. And yes, it is good because you should just stick to the trailer and not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I understand why Sarah Michelle Gellar did not live in this movie for a long time, not wanting to associate her name with this production. I wish him the best "Return". <br /> <br /> You have to follow 3 different tracks in this movie and they are all open (time and meaning) to the end. And even then it's a very bad climax. And God even forbids the door to continue. <br /> <br /> Yes, in this movie, "Rage and Fury" is on the move. It is no longer necessary to visit the house, just close to someone who is inside and you're ready. It's no longer a curse, it's like a virus. Go inside the house, scare, go back to the US and spread your joy in your apartment building. <br /> <br /> It's not that hard to follow, but you just don't care about anyone. The plot line is not empty and you have a lot of scenes in this movie where you just laugh and shake your head ... Milk someone? I saw last summer at the Fantasia Film Festival Ju-On 2, which is completely different, but much better than that. This is not a remake, but this time they would have just had to redo ... <br /> <br /> If you need to see it, wait for the DVD.
