Max. Neither title reflects the actual content of the series, "Fighting the Nazis in Morocco" (actually Iverson's ranch). There is only a plot to fill the bones between the fistfits. The package has more than 40 "fist meetings" in 15 chapters. It's at least three chapters! In addition to being thrown into French in French, Duncan Renaldo is looking at how much furniture is canceled, crushed, thrown, burned, or blown up, that's what this series is about. When the main characters start to fight, you can bet that everything in the room is there. So, the temptation of the choreographer who is the real star of this series! <br /> <br /> Two Positive Notes: Characters sometimes lose their hats in the fight, and best of all, we have a girl's kick (often a journalist like she's here) who actually takes part in chaos, mostly by shooting and killing bad guys. However, Linda Stirling has killed the manhunt of the main mystery "Mystery Island" (1945). On the negative side, it is just too much to jump on how to escape - before the car goes over the cliff before the fast ship explodes before the building explodes before the truck hits you, and so on. <br /> <br /> It is said that this series was partly "inspired" by George Lucas to make the first Indiana Jones movie, but it is an indirect concept rather than the actual story or series of developments. > <br /> Rod Cameron "shines" as a moving stone, the role he played in all his films. In spite of all the furniture collapse, there is actually nothing here compared to other series with fewer struggles, more story, better actors and more advanced characters. <br /> <br /> I'll give it all 3 furniture crushing.
