I rented this movie because the DVD cover looked like it was a ridiculous college comedy, like a van wilder or a zoo. I took it to my friend house to watch a movie night. We finished it in 15 minutes after the movie and looked at Copper Mountain. I don't know if any of you have seen Copper Mountain, but it's not great either. But I have to say that Alan Thick Jim Carrey Duo made it more enjoyable on the clock. <br /> <br /> Later I finished Puddle Cruiser. This film was slow and humor was forced. This film reminded me of some of the stinkers I saw in some of the college's previous production hours. I was wondering, "was that the movie that enabled the Broken Lizard to make Supertroopers?" Also, how does this film suck so bad? Supertroopers were good and Club Dread was decent. Don't look at this movie!
