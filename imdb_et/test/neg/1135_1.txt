This movie was terrible. It focused too much around Eddie, the brother of Clark Griswald. Eddie works much better on changing good plaques, such as "Christmas Holiday" and "Holiday". <br /> <br /> I really don't understand how such a movie is given to thumbnails. Now, don't get me wrong, I like Randy Quaid, but I just felt that this movie was totally wrong for her and her character. This film leaves much to be desired and really needs bigger names.
