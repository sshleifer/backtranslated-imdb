This movie is only recommended for insomniacs: it alleviates them in sleep. Five years old can enjoy it. But for someone else (including genre fans) what it is! The "old" chart resembles a "dragon return" and this movie is the same inert, but Nero is not Bruce Lee, so "Enter Ninja" is even worse film. So far, this is the second (offensive "first film" of the "comedy" "undergraduate" I gave 1/10).
