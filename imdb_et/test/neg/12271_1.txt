For those who don't remember movies - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120/ - it came out in '79 (I think enough time has gone so naturally that Nunzio thought he could just be back do it and say he wrote it - yes, right!). <br /> <br /> The actor is too far away - "harsh boys" walk with their shoulders to give the impression that they are bigger than they really are, "the hero" seems to be passionate about sniffing and rolling his eyes error-mesh way to express nervousness / anger to the celluloid eye. <br /> <br /> A racial message from this Sicilian point of view (keep in mind that it is about the third generation line ... the original "wogs" arrived in OZ after the war and in my childhood - yes, I'm Aussie. -iness "is diluted a lot - they even look like a true blue Aussies - not a" dago accent "trembling somewhere (there's another slang for ya, Nun!) <br /> <br /> Maors with barrels (sunglass s) at 4: 00 - must be blinded at night in the middle of the sun and look like Redfern ... this is the annoying end of this movie Nunzio tried to copy the taste of warriors, but the story was too much. How would it happen? <br /> <br /> Warriors were baseball hands-on baseball, where the white face makeup drove to the heroes' train station and fought with them - Nunzios gang reaches the river station to hold the boys wearing the white face mask. The soldiers were wrongly accused of shooting / murdering another gang member - Nunzios gang is wrongly accused a great Maori gang rape of a superior sister. Soldiers are attracted to space by girls who attack them - Nunzios crowd wants to crash into a house of friends where girls' colleges are located - soldiers are almost too much to keep I'm sad that people don't want to see other moves from OZ because of this fear - how is Mad Max - The World and Master? Not all movies are being performed by actors who are so bad they have to finance their films. <br /> <br /> As for the other actors, they seem to have taken their "Nun" layer because they are all as bad as each other - don't worry about this movie! I can't get my money back - so save my own!
