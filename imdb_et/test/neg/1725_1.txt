Peter Crawford discovers a comet with a moon during a crash. But if the government doesn't believe him (stupid fact # 1). He builds a refuge in a deep area and draws a lot to see who's going. Plus is ready to kill to save humanity (stupid fact # 2). With millions of dollars in technology, how could a civilian see what NASA did not get? Plus, the ending justifies the moral of this story is just WRONG! This film is unlikely and absolutely unbelievable. What ran through the thoughts of these people, why hell are these piles like this green light? Sometimes I don't know who's going to have **** in this **** movie.
