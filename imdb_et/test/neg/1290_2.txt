Although the dog was cute, there was no movie. It was not a problem or topic. There was great potential for humor and sin. The theme is worth it. Helping other people is more important than collecting wealth. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the divine dog is a unique prerequisite and theme for badly acting, inclined dialogue and amateur filming. <br /> <br /> Even my youngest child, sitting almost all, gave up before we were halfway. How many times can this dog go down the same corridor and down? I can't ruin it because I never saw an end. Just wasn't worth a look at the end.
