As other reviewers have pointed out, this film is cross (ie stolen) between the stories we've seen before. Specifically, it looks like Clint in the Eastwood High Plains Drifter, which is inserted into Mad Max. Remove the Clint Cigar and replace it with a cigarette; remove his horse and give him a high-tech motorcycle and voil√†, an updated drift. In this movie, the "hero" is even bolder "Savior" than the High Plains Drifter. Now our hero has long brown hair, suffers from the left side wound, and his entry into the city is preceded by a call to "rescue" the surviving city people - a fairly transparent reference to "the second coming". I watched the movie in the hot and humid morning. Sleep was impossible, and after 4:30, there was nothing else on TV. So the purpose of the film was. While a primary student whose characters are almost comic, the movie is still fun ... at least at 4:30 in the morning.
