I mean something about this movie: First, it's really a bad movie. It's really "Superbad". The film seemed very promising in trailers, but fell flat ... Maybe the original idea was good, but between bad script and bad behavior, the film became boring and empty. My advice is to waste 2 hours of your valuable time. You have been warned. This is the first movie I rated on IMDb.com with 1 star ... Second, no characters are pleasant. You really don't care about what happened to them ... Third, the villain is very easy to identify. The grandson kills his father, sodomizes the son of a friend, gets the girl's girlfriend, smokes his grandfather ... As the UN says, "If you like evil without accusations then this is your movie". Nothing more to say ...
