For most people, I know I saw the movie and the comments I read that it should have been a very entertaining thriller to be seen by more people. I did not expect this film to beat me, but I certainly did not expect to find this film to be the best of what it is. <br /> <br /> I'm not a stranger to French films, being both French and student studying, so I'm aware of clich√©s and corn plots that English / American audiences can't notice. There are some great French films that should have provided extensive international release, but that is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Initially, the plot has been pulled as far as complicated and too clever to be fun so you really feel every 2 hours and 5 minutes of driving every minute and when everything finally comes out then you are out of maintenance. The main character himself does not have any real charisma or even talent to keep your attention fixed, mainly during his and his trip, which is close to the mess, so that by the time you have to swallow even the main plot twists, you have started to be your own wasted time! I remember that before the movie climatic meeting, the credit was actually turned off - this was the point where I was sure I was almost wasting my time. <br /> <br /> Film is not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it seems completely overrated. For example, I read somewhere that it would hit all the Bourne Identity films or even that he had a "wall-to-wall tension". I can say for sure that some people are jumping in this honestly boring movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10 is a generous attentive review of this movie, and since I've seen some full and perfect smells, so I save them in 1s, 2s and 3s.
