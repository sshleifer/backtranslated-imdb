The look and feel of this film is for many "fresh" leaders (close-ups and focus on the emotions experienced by participants). The film's point was presented from several angles and was well expressed by a relatively inexperienced cast. The point is "to believe in Jesus Christ and the Church of Morman" Oh, and if you read or hear something that contradicts the teachings of the prophet, it's just Haterade. (Fuel for anger)
