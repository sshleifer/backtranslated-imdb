Even before this movie, it is clear that Ali G has got the exact character he put on the parody. However, I am not a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's character, but was curious to see how little a talented man can convince the studios to fund a one and a half hour feature film for a 3-minute joke. <br /> <br /> A thin piece of paper is just a torrot of penis and marijuana, and I have to admit that I saw such prisoners as Charles Dance and Michael Gambon so low that they were unemployed. Saying I have to admit (even if I'm ashamed) that I raised the title more than once, but that bad film was never boring and never considered turning it off (mainly thanks to the excellent Rhona Mitra). Looking at it, watch this movie only if you are a teenage boy aged 14 to 17 years and you will find a dick funny fun.
