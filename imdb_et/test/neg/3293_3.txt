This exhibition drives me crazy. This is inconsistent with everything the family should have, even if it is for comedy. The exhibition is expected to follow Dave and Vicky Gold (Michael Rapaport and Anita Barone) as they raise their three teenage children: Hilary, Larry and Mike. A good space for comedy yes, but that doesn't mean it's a good play. <br /> <br /> I don't think I've ever heard parents talk to their children and vice versa. The only talk that seems to be in the exhibition is the control of the children by the parents and the sex. I know that sexual intercourse is usually a topic often discussed by teenagers, but it has grown up in almost every episode without making sense. One episode I was just looking at touched the parents who gave their daughter Hilary a car, not once you think they are interrelated anyway, how they talk to each other, and how parents talk about how Hilary is like their slave. "<br /> <br /> The exhibition fails at the most comedy level. I haven't laughed at this exhibition repeatedly at the many times I've tried to watch it, and I'm the person who gave films like The House of Doom and Dumb and Dumber. Michael Rapaport is a very good actor and why he decides to destroy his career by making this dirty show away from it. Parents, make sure your kids are never and I never think about it. Teenagers, you can probably laugh about it just for blatant sexual references, but it doesn't come out and after that you feel quite empty. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2/5 stars.
