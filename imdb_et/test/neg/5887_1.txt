At least some of the endlessly infused sitcoms from the US are honestly bad. However, this junk represents "heart warming" parenty attached to the clothing horse. Ridiculously "learned" glances and phrases "I am so important and thin and beautiful". In an episode where I just sat down, someone's "work" was in danger simply because my colleague "put" a phone call, slagging out his abilities ... !! In fact, it is the lowest of the lowest. What kind of damage it causes to the masses being seen, seeing only the "glam-bag" of people who parade "working". Completely ill. When the headlines rolled over, I thought it was job creation for boys. You know who you are.
