Something strange is happening on the periphery of the Arctic. The air force weather station is broken, its inhabitants are missing. The village of Eskimo is destroyed. The fishing boat disappears. There are curious spoils on snow. There is a four-legged living organism near the destroyed plane. The piece looks like half a giant Alaska crab. The military (Craig Stevens as Air Force Officer) and its experts are confused. A renowned scientist (William Hopper) and his real assistant (Alix Taltan) are invited from New York. Hopper concludes from this inconvenient evidence that they are dealing with a monster prayer. He's right. A pretty assistant gets out of the office window and sees a frowning face where her sore eyes look at her. He falls what he carries, grabs his hands on his cheeks and screams with fear. to switch buses and eat people. Military weapons do not affect this much, but in the end Stevens hits his jet and kills the beast that arrives on the ground and is on the Manhattan tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey. <br /> <br /> Stevens, after being in contact, takes his crew to the tunnel and kills a big mistake with the "3RG mines" despite his fierce appearance, intimidating behavior and earthquakes. Stevens and Taltan kiss in front of the body while Hopper laughs and takes his picture. <br /> <br /> Jumps. inciting the air, flying around, looking for people not for people, but for something new, fresh or original. As it is, they ignored one clich√©. Hopper should have rushed to Super Duper DDT, which alone can overthrow insects. This should have been done by 3GG mines, not the usual risk of explosion. <br /> <br /> Modeling is pretty good considering the budget you need. Nothing else would have cost anything else, because everything else is quite routine. Craig Stevens is a face and style for TV. William Hopper feels right - long and silver haired - but his instrument has only one note. A pretty assistant is quite common in his role. Some require Joan Weldon or Laurie Nelson. They were also unable to act, but carried with them light but clear embarrassment. Something would have helped this fagged-out movie. no lungs. I don't mind if a monster died in a tunnel. The praying mantis is a graceful insect in its powerful way and is great to keep them in the garden because they eat robbers and not. But when you get down there, they're not very tempting. The male jug is smaller and weaker than the female, as well as the human, and when the couple is almost copulation, the woman bites the female head as well as the human. But at least a person feels when to stop. Male mantis continues copying for several minutes, although he is now headless. We humans have no arbitrary men who replicate targeted women. Are we?
