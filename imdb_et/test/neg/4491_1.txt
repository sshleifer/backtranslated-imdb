I suspect that this board will soon be full of emotions that are overwhelmingly emotional people who praise "Dear John" as "pearl" and "roller skater" and all the other intermediate words that this film's target audience usually uses. <br /> <br /> I'm definitely not the target audience for this movie, but I also don't like romantic dramas when they're well done, so here's my goal to take the flick. <br /> <br /> It's not good. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie either. But the plot is curving up, development is where it should have moved forward (exactly in the middle, exactly), and as it ends ... it almost seemed that they would run out of ideas, so they suddenly said, "Listen, we're filming the last real quick we'll put it on the scene, put some sentimental string music on it and stop it. " Even Amanda Seyfried's beauty could not save her. Channing Tatum also gave a good result, but you can do so much with a faulty script. <br /> <br /> Speaking of music, it's unpredictable and kitchy. From smoked tuned, irritatingly highly female singer schtick (definitely chosen to appeal to most college-aged girls who go to this movie) to overused the "shimmering strings and piano" combo, it only irritates anyone paying more attention to the film as a whole rather than his own "feelings ". The film has a good start and a big conflict that leads us to another act, everything was promising. So it was part of another activity, as the story unfolded. Then the film just hit the ball. Besides that, I have to give spoilers. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" is not a bad movie, but it doesn't work as it should. If you want to see a truly moving movie of long-term love that awaits reunion, check out the Notebook, which was really great.
