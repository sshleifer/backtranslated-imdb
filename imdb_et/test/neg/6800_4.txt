I could have liked it if I didn't like Diane Arbus. <br /> <br /> Not really catching Arbus' unique visual aesthetics (as Stanley Kubrick did "The Shinning", twin girls in the corridor, direct respect for one of Arbos's most famous photographs, and one of those with haunting qualities is not on any of these films) , and certainly none of his characters (outbound), resemblance (thin and Jewish, not hitting Queen Kidman) or some very superficial similarities in life, he was a fashion photographer who later photographed "freaks" and "outiders" among many things. This film focused on the "freak", a symbol of artistic and personal influence, in a truly low and predictable form. Outside this could have been an interesting movie about middle-class fetish, but I was too annoyed to take care of it. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the name of the Arbus was left behind, it could have been less annoying, but it wasn't in the title, where there would have been nothing to do to see me first. Abandoning the "secretary".
