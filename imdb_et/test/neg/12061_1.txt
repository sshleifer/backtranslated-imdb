First of all, I must mention that as a group of friends, we often find entertainment in movies that are known to be comedic, so rent our Camp Blood. <br /> <br /> Camp Blood was the first movie that we would have rented to come to a camcorder, and it was such a waste that it wasn't even funny. <br /> <br /> The DVD was returned and a refund was required, adding a recommendation of a sort of quality control applied to prevent such famous garbage storage. <br /> <br /> Don't do what I did and give curiosity to you, it's so bad that it's not even funny.
