I saw on French television today and was most disappointed! The film begins quite well, but nothing is explained and, finally, we are not further from the beginning. As for the man's vision of his wife's murder, it is not just plausible. You need tangible evidence of conviction and minimal evidence. In this case, there is nothing at all, so it's just not plausible. Remember the old message "innocent until proven guilty". The fact that a woman has disappeared without traces does not prove that her husband killed her. So I really don't know what point this movie is trying to do. The result is totally illogical and incomprehensible, no accusing evidence is disclosed to the spectator. So to be honest, watching it is a waste of time. After all, the movie must be fun ... it's completely wrong with it, and I suggest that it be sent irrevocably to the trash where it belongs!
