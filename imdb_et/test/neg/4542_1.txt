Well, I like watching bad horror B-Movies because I think it's interesting to see fool and creator incompatibility for a really good movie shoot. (I always compare these films - for example - some of Spielberg's work and again do not understand the big difference in what I see.) I like Ed Wood movies because it's so inaccurate that it's very funny. But people !!! "Cooling" is not funny and not even "interesting". This is an extremely frightening horror movie with nothing to make even bad movies traceable. There is no action, no scenario, no direction, no excitement or no blood. This is a surprising amateur movie. This is definitely a WORST movie I've ever seen (and I've seen many "worst movies" - believe me). I warned you !!! 1/10
