This stupid, environmentally friendly wannabe "jaws" is sad, pathetic, boring, poorly duplicated and stupid. There is nothing redeeming about this. <br /> <br /> The plot has some shark / octopus creatures-things that appear on the coast of Florida and kill some people (including a boring, stupid couple with a small wife and a quiet spouse) who for some reason hangs with a fork). His rise to the surface is always represented by a vague side that is uncomfortable over and over again. It doesn't make sense, it's terribly boring, and this conspiracy is wonderful. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the camp that can't be ignored: the same boat in a couple of opening sequences THREE TIMES; the doctor grabs the dying patient's breast twenty times with the diffractor without stopping, although he is clearly dead; porn-esque soundtrack; shot a couple who loves the beach, with three different themes ("To Us!"). an ancient computer that sounds like Kermit Frog; The beer-jerk scientist screams "I know!" by Smith Dr. Smith; the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Oh, and at least thirty bears (Mike and "Bots" will notice it a lot) in the movie. . <br /> <br /> The MST3K version is their best episode, but it's definitely better than the movie itself. "That's how I like fishing, boys ... with a flashlight and a flame." - Crow <br /> <br /> One Star "Devil Fish"; for seven MST3K versions <br /> <br />
