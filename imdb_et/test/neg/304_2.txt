I wasted enough time to actually watch the movie, I don't want to write a big review anymore. I never made so many smiles. All the jokes were boring, forced, and lacked any sense. I said, "Where's the punchline?" Almost every character was an unpleasant stereotype and all situations were clich√©s and half a time there wasn't even a solution. Things just happened to the next scene. During my lifetime, I don't understand how it got so many good comments as it did. If you like a closed actor and a poorly prepared movie, then Fat Girls is a movie for you.
