In this film, Gary Oldman plays a Defense Attorney who was formerly a prosecutor. He's a little tortured, but he's playing a normal man, no figural or grammatical monster. The funny thing is, he doesn't pull it out. I don't think it's going to be quite normal. Kevin Bacon was scary enough. The park scene was too long, so many false fears. And a couple of sex scenes with Oldman and Karen Young seemed to come from another movie, although the rest of the time Miss Young did just that. This film suffers from strange attempts to overcome predictability. And not. Do not worry.
