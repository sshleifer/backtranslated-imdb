A boring walk through the Mormon prehistory bananas. Finally un-funny. To testify to the widespread theory that humor in the bathroom is funny, it must necessarily be vulgar; it also confirms the claim that a close relationship with Jesus does not make you funny. For more propaganda than film, don't worry about having good social issues after dinner. The sustained grace of this film is its exact portrayal of young Mormon women as particularly attractive. Oh, it's $ 7.50.
