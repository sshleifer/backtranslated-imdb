Again, it's not bad enough to make it enjoyable. In fact, it's just boring. This is pretty well done, although the script is bad, the effect is OK and the running average is. (In addition to James Mason, who's always great but not used) <br /> <br /> I think it's hard to write anything about this movie because it didn't cause me any reaction that was ever the case. br /> <br /> Bored, boring, boring, boring, boring.
