When the Underdog cartoon debuted in 1964, I was immediately at the age of 7. He was the best dog in my book (to be prescribed) (ie, to Batman for the first time on ABCs a year). Even though it was clear that Disney was going to make a live-action version of one of the popular Saturday morning comics, it was as clear to me that it would be a piece. Even reading the reviews in the documents seemed to confirm this. However, I made it a point: a) never try to write a review if I haven't seen the movie from start to finish; and b) never spend one red cents on a film that I'm almost sure I hate. <br /> <br /> Thanks to YouTube I: a) I am fully qualified to write this review; and b) it cost me only 84 minutes of my hard-earned time. <br /> <br /> It also proves my position, namely that this movie is not just a piece. It is a steaming pile of dog stools. It only resembles a TV series, even though they got almost the best for Simon and Cad. <br /> <br /> All in all, Underdog is a huge waste of time and money, which fortunately I didn't do. You don't have to spend. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * *****
