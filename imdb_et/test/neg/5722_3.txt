Okay, I admit that I like Brigitte Neilsen in an unhealthy way, I only have 6 'high women with swords. Then I said that. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the movie? Almost every mistake you can make. You're taking a successful movie series (conan) and dragging that mud through a bad script, bad casting, bad results and the worst things ... you put the child in a comic relaxation. Such a thing was killed almost in the Indiana Jones series. Cute kids are Disney movies, not real movies. Neilsen took the film at least seriously, although it seems that no one else did it. On the plot, Schwarzenegger repeatedly pulled out the red Sonja fat from the fire and dropped her character significantly. The soldier's wife doesn't need a guy to get her in for a mess, it's her job! The reuse of Conan's character in this film was a crime. Kalidor? Sheesh. The film never set the right mood, and its pace was rather divergent and sloppy, unlike Conan, who was a barbarian with several stories flowing gently. When it comes to fantasy movies, it's okay for costumes, its okay to be a Harryhausen-style animation, it's okay to have foolish exaggerated kits that don't make sense, but the terrible script is unforgivable. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been classic, but the script seemed to be written by a 12-year-old.
