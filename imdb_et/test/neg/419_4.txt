I went to watch this movie today, trying to keep open. I had hoped to enjoy a movie that would hopefully be different from the book. There were significant differences from the book, similar to the changes made in the DiVinci code. I went to the DiVinci code to look at the same thinking process and I was able to film, even though they have changed. It was still enjoyable, full of action and the deciphering of symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating. Unfortunately angels and demons deceived at almost every level. Symbols are quickly found and explained throughout the movie without the interest of the viewer. They blow the different Immuminat symbols so fast that we didn't have the chance to see them and evaluate how they work. The final Illuminati symbol, which was the most interesting and creative in the book, was replaced by the symbol of the crossing keys. In my opinion, this was a missed opportunity to focus on symbols and spend a little more time under the character of Langdon. In general, this film is a very bad interpretation of the book and does not attempt to be a feature film / thriller. 4 out of 10
