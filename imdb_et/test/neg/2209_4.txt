MELTDOWN is quite interesting in SCI-FI. No big budget, very few special effects; enough action and a story of global punishment are enough to support viewing. The asteroid rubs into the atmosphere and draws the Earth closer to the orbit. Global warming is rapidly becoming intolerable.

Pressure is to save mankind from this solar disaster; as well as protect his daughter, sister former wife and TV reporter girlfriend.
