Not a terrible movie - my 10-year-old boy loved it, and he would be a demographic target, so I think they hit on the spot. For a very adult, it's pretty boring. <br /> <br /> Difficult to associate animated lego characters, even mod high tech. <br /> <br /> I thought there were three Bionicle great virtues the world was a bit strange - unity, commitment, and destiny. Am I the only one who thinks these sounds are a bit fascist? Especially fate. But freedom, equality, justice, etc.? Well, it sells Legot. For an unknown movie, but not for a 74-minute ad. It could have been a lot worse.
