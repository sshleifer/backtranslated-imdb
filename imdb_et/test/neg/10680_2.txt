The main "character" of Lillith Silver is to say "you know f ** k all about vampires". It is obvious that this statement was directed to the cast and the team, who create a very bad picture of sucking all the favorite blood. According to the misleading driver, all vampires are white foundations and closed with latex, similar to a shrink wrapped piece of meat. For Bannana-like and asthma-bad cases, our main character, Lillith, creates a "modern" vampire cartoon. <br /> <br /> The plot consists of a piece of paper from a 9-year-old playstation collection, and then mixed together to make this horrible story. Lillith our pale main character is the Vampire Bounty hunter who lives in everyone's favorite culture, the Illuminati! Instead of incorporating the classic mysterious mystery and precision methodology, Lillith hurts through an open window and then goes blank before shooting with a pistol, if they don't let the ball openings through dirty continuity). PC Plod is then set to solve the murders, it reaches grizzly, but it is obvious that Lillith is actually a vampire and he is trying to hunt him with the usual vampire mission tools, including cross, garlic and sharpened wood. . Meanwhile, Lillith, who has become a habit of beating her boss, is disappointed when the old nemesis gets her hand and requires Ransom to personalize. As you can imagine, it doesn't go according to plan. I'm not going to carry the pain of the next scenes, so I'm going to finish. Lillith and his "nobleman" are a showdown, and after Lillith wins, it turns out that someone is told that they have cancer, that the two are century-old lovers and the whole plot was a twisted game. Yes, this ball was the end of the movie. In my eyes, it is a joke about the latex-coated cake and the seals of this movie "Never Look At This". <br /> <br /> In cinematic art, the film just doesn't bother to create any style. The director tries to save her from the disaster, throwing some close-ups and some multi-angle shots, but this is not the movie you need. <br /> <br /> You can scream, but it's a B-movie to be crap! "But I don't care. I've seen some B movies, like the dead 2 and Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter, and that's why it's not a shame to hide behind the excuses. The budget was low, it's obvious because of the location and the lack of good players. but if the director were more creative and spent less money on making make-up and counterfeit blood, he could have done a decent attempt to do something wrong. Gender sexual scenes are in no way useful and only gave me a few foolish feelings that are obscene behavior. If I want to watch a vampire porn, I would have bought Muffy The Vampire Layer. <br /> <br /> Bad, the story is worse and the consequences are terribly fake. the film had some potential, but its poor undertone and the embarrassing image of the classic horror was just a fall. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh at some friend, I suggest you look at this mockery. If you are looking for a more serious vampire strike, try Blade or Underworld to calm your calming blood.
