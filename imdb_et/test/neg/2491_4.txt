This movie is final. I remember when it came to theaters that a friend said it had never hit, because the Americans didn't want to see movies from history, especially movies that were more of an idea than an action. I don't know if this was the reason why FMLB didn't do it well, but now, finally, I can add some of my observations. <br /> <br /> First of all, Dwight Schultz has been a star in Star Trek and A-Tea as the leader of this movie. I waited for him to call Jon Lovitz a "I am ACT-ING!" He spelled out the tone of the voice, as he tried, to be ACT-OR, at a stage where he had to emphasize strange words and phrases. Secondly, I enjoyed Paul Newman's character manipulator, who tries to carry these cats (scientists) every step of the way to reach his goal. Thirdly, the moral impact of creating the A bomb and whether the US should use it was discussed. It is probably not enough or deeper than it is justified. <br /> <br /> Finally, the dramatic effect seemed to have thrown a lot of turns. I don't know how many of the events in this movie are alive, but things like slipping a test bomb in their chains or a laboratory crash caused by a leaked coffee pot (and the resulting killed scientist) stretching the limits of credibility. Maybe it happened, or similar events, but it seemed that the different scenes were only added to the dramatic effect that undermined the whole film's tone and purpose. <br /> <br /> FMLB was OK. I need to read more about actual events to find out if it was up or just mostly accurate.
