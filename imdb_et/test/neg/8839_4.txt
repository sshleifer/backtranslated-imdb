Lone Star Productions sure they pulled them out in the 1930s and Star Packer feels faster. John Wayne is a US Marshal John Travers, studying a curve slope known only as "The Shadow", responsible for cattle stealing, productions, and the like, and giving orders behind a fake wall. Yakima Canutt is a reliable Indian sidekick from Traverse, which is appropriately named ... well, "Yak". <br /> <br /> Early on, we find that Cattlemens Union leader Matt Matlock (George pre-Gabby Hayes) is really Var; the dead giveaway is when she offers to buy her (expected) niece Anita from Matlock Ranch because "it's not a place for the girl". Like Anita, Verna Hillie doesn't have to do much in the movie, though at the comical moment she can use six shooters to break a frightening attack on one villain at night. <br /> <br /> The film has little curiosity - one, Wayne's character alternates between the white horse and the dark horse in the first half of the film. If it could have been a clean device, the hollow knife used by the eider directly in the middle of the street is located. Finally, the movie does not really live by its name, because sheriff Travers never carries a character on the film, ie a packer of stars. <br /> <br /> Horse rides, robbed stages scenes, rocky stagecoach (another curiosity, horses stepping on the stage comfortably) are pretty common things. But John Wayne fans want to see the charisma he showed at the beginning of his career. For those who are more critical, the white stoppers worn by good boys can only mean that they all had a headache.
