A lucky household will have a gypsy girl who is played by Myrna Loy. Her amazingly wild hair and voice that sounds very high and strange is hard to believe that this is Loy !! He has no resemblance to the refined and funny Nora Charles, whom he played in Thin Man films. Instead, it is so bad that you almost miss yourself in Ed Wood. What a tremendous difference in quality films made over a few years and his ability to act !! In addition to the stunningly silly character, the film does not succeed either because it is not just interesting or exciting - it is very, very static and stupid. The only thing this is good about is the Vitaphone sound system - the sound quality of this turkey is the best I've heard since 1929. Heck, it was even better than most of the 1930 movie, so the sound technician has at least something proud - everyone else, forget it. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that even Turner's classic movies call "guilty of joy" because the movie is so bad! And after I have seen it, I don't agreeâ€¦. The film is just bad.
