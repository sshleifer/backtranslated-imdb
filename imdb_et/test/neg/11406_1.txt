Demon Wind is about as fun as breaking the legs. This is definitely a terrible example of a movie. So terrible that I don't even consider it a movie. I describe it more than a thing ... a monster. The thing that needs to be stopped at all costs. My friends and I discovered this ... thing that was buried under my big video tape box in my friend's house. It was late at night and we had nothing better to do, so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies (unfortunately, we chose it.) The point is literally pointless. It's just a cheap, poorly made dirty Evil Dead. The whole "story" seems to be more than a boy who wants to break his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting the demons cut them. I have predictions that writers wrote this story when it was filmed. I have seen bad movies before (Manos, Troll 2, HOBGOBLINS !!!) (a little bit). I have to say that Demon Wind could definitely fight these films with stupidity. See it only if you enjoy funny stupid movies. <br /> <br /> A fun fact: this movie is like steroid cockroaches! Like the ouija table, every time we try to get rid of it, it always seems mysterious again. Is it scary?
