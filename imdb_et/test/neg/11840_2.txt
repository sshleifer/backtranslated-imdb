The story of this film is a clich√©, and probably it has been ripped out of Jurassic Park. The filmmakers didn't even try to hide it. It seems that there was not enough budget for making dignified dinosaur dolls so that the viewer can see some robot-like toy dinosaurs (cheap toystores) that move in a very unnatural way. But it's funny because it's so bad. Operation is almost as unnatural as dinosons. Nobody really seems excited to be in this movie (which I fully understand). Especially the last half hour is very boring and it is almost impossible to watch without falling asleep. One positive note I would like to make about "Raptor" is that it doesn't take a full 90 minutes.
