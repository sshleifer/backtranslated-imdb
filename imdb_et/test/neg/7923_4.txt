Such films do not need a queue. Part of what Don Bluth is driving away from Disney is that he did not suffer the aftermath of his endless video game, badly animated banknotes. But probably it was someone's brilliant idea to make a sequel to "All Dogs to Heaven" so we get it. <br /> <br /> Charlie Sheen replaces Burt and is not really that good. Most of the movie is just a bad pretext and it is not nearly as dark, different or entertaining as the original. <br /> <br /> I am sorry for future generations who have to endure endlessly Such sequences will never know what time Hollywood did not rely entirely on successful films as a crowd to free the banal mess. <br /> <br /> Please no longer follow the children for movies that are not needed.
