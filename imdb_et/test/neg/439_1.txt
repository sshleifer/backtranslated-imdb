Well, what can be said about "horror comedy" that does not contain horror or comedy? There are no signs in the movie, but too many plot features - everything is underdeveloped and mostly redundant. Creatures created by a computer look bad, a bit like Disney versions of large rats without legs. Walking is the biggest burst out of the title, they look like dead in Land's movie, but are far away. They just look like bad actors in the blood of plastic and bull. <br /> <br /> Two plot lines really brought some promise (love story and "company" story), but failed as poorly as the director, writers, SFX department, production and participants.
