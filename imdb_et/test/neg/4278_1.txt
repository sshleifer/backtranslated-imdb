to anyone who has read this book, Fanny Price asks her wife, a beautiful woman ... in the brain. Le Touzel looks like he has drugs. Terrible action, he destroys it! Henry is a little tall for his character. She's too feminine. Mary Crawford is great. Edmond is a little too old. Mrs Norris is hysterical - OK, this casting decision works. Rushworth is also perfect. Yates looks too feminine. But Le Touzel is just terrible. It's not a good character for him. Poor Fanny! I recommend this movie only because it contains an almost complete textual report of the language used in the novel. The 1999 version is much more fun, but terribly incomplete. If they could better match this version with an actor suitable for Fanny, it would be great!
