Two LAs are competing with a serial man "Family Man" who has destroyed whole families and when one of the police officers' spouses takes a deep month, questions are raised and it turns out that the serum killer is not responsible, but rather mobsters. The idea of ​​Seagal in the serial number movie is an interesting concept, it can indeed be seen that Seagal plays a good serial number, but makes him a policeman with a ridiculous prayer for prayer beads and sharp razor-sharp credit cards come fooler than fools. The running joke also includes Wayon's enjoyment of eating powdery penis penis and well this dirty material is totally inappropriate. Not to mention the beginning of taking the hostage because the boy was broken by his girlfriend. After the neutralization of Seagale, the girlfriend talks to the young boy that she loves her. Now it's just a lesson, if you want your girlfriend to be taken back, taking a school hostage can get you back. I myself think flowers or old-fashioned phone calls could work, then again, I'm old. Besides who I am, to put someone else in a shining conciliation plan. <br /> <br /> * 4- (bad)
