I caught it in the HBO in my "guilty welfare" category, and I agree that I felt guilty (and gladly) looking at it. One, it's a trash can and really a messy trash. Two, the plot is slow and predictable, and when you learn "who did it," you think, "What?". However, I have to admit that there are enough men in a chauvinistic pig who wants to sit through what is obviously a bad film, if not for any other reason than to see Peta Wilson, which is several times totally naked. Do I feel I've been watching it? Yes, yes. Am I sorry that I watched it? So, there is a contradiction between a good movie lover and a female anatomy lover, even if it's in a bad movie. Sigh!
