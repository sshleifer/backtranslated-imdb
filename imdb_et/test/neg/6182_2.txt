Great disappointment. CLASH BY NIGHT is a lot of talk and stagnation, and dialogue with these characters may not be right. It's a melodrama at its top. Action is indeed up and very unrealistic. Only MARILYN MONROE and KEITH ANDES support this movie. I want them to have more. I'm someone looking at the details of the movie. Two big questions ... 1 Who watches the child all day when Stanwyck and Ryan are together and Douglas is running, then break the fight at the bar where the father is? 2. When Stanwyck is packed out of the city, why did he see his brothers packing where he hasn't lived for at least two years? Also, when everyone goes to the theater projection room, who takes care of the child again? Such details irritate me and give movies much lower ratings. What were the writers, directors, and everyone else involved in thinking about the film? Nuf said.
