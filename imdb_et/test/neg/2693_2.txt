I have been a Shakespeare lover since childhood. I'm also a Jew. The Venetian merchant is anti-Semitic through and out, no matter how hard scientists and lovers of literature try to interpret it again. <br /> <br /> In the game, Shylock is demonic and cold-hearted, and has no forgiveness, not warmth, love, except money and cruel revenge, while Christians are kind, moral people. His motives in the game rotate in money (he starts from the beginning with revenge, based on the damage caused to his business as well as to the blind racial hatred), not to the superb ideal or racial pride, because this film wants to believe you. And this characterization is given to him by Shakespeare himself, not by other characters. The ultimate proof is the happy ending where the Jew loses his money and is forced to turn to Christianity. <br /> <br /> I confess and move on. It's part of history and I know Shakepeare nevertheless. That's why I hope the movie based on this game will play it directly. I'd rather see a job adapted to this rich language and storytelling without any cremation. <br /> <br /> But many of Bard's artificial nuances and playful characters have disappeared in this movie. For example, in the last scene, where men discover Portia's secret work as a man who took away his rings, instead of playful words and misunderstandings, as the truth itself shows, it becomes a medium-minded game where two women women play cruelly with their soon-to-be husband. <br /> <br /> That's why we have only cool detailed kits, rich language fragments that are poorly interpreted, poorly cast, with one intense courtroom, and the truth is, I think it would be much easier to find a story of anti-Semitism and move on if it stayed the same. Despite the fact that the makers of this film pulled out all their hats, there is a lot of hatred, but now people can apologize and pretend that depicting Jews is no longer so bad. <br /> <br /> And finally there is another problem because most of the participants have failed. Pacino is the way out of his league and the language is very uncomfortable, not to mention the terribly fake accent. Fiennes as Bassanio is charming and inconvenient in language. Irons are reliable as always, but do not do much with their role. Portia is somewhat OK, but unlikely and covered with a bad guy like a movie.
