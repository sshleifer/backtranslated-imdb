This extremely favorable basement floor, the Blaxploitation / Kung-Fu hybrid, was exempt from the questionable DVD label in my country, which usually speaks just about transferring pure nonsense to the disc, so it was not exactly a favorable listener. In the same series, several other titles were published, such as "The Black Six", "The Black Gestapo" and "The Black Godfather", and none of these low ratings and negative ratings have any of the 70's Blaxploitation hype elite, as well. "TNT Jackson" is a pretty tough film that does not have a completely significant plot, but where there are too many ridiculous fighting scenes and terrible action to compensate. Apparently Roger Corman? is never too embarrassing to make some simple money? he was assigned two of the most loyal acolytics to quickly develop a simplified story that would appeal to both fans of Oriental Kung-Fu films as well as modern trendy Blaxploitation clips. The result was Cirio H. Santiago and Dick Miller came out with "TNT Jackson"; story of an ass-whooping black child who travels to Hong Kong in search of his missing brother. He quickly discovers that the network of drug smugglers was killed and swears to deliver him. Mrs Jackson penetrates smoothly into the ground and encounters macho-pimps, useful secret agents, crowds of Kung-Fu fighters. Only one thing is certain; they all want a piece of TNT in one way or another. I sincerely doubt that the concepts in the movie will become more elemental, but ?? unfortunately - all other aspects also absorb. The battle scenes are too long and moreover they are probably staged. Jeannie Bell and other poor suckers are really trying to look at the tough hostile views and the tough position, but in the end they can hit all the air and jump foolishly over the room. Cinema is terrible, sound is very disappointing (what happened to soul music?), Few dialogues are poorly written, and exemplary performances are worse. Speaking of this, Jeannie Bell is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, but she still can't keep Tamara Dobson or Pam Gry's candle. TNT Jackson has only one really good and memorable scene, namely the famous hotel room battle, where Bell, completely naked, except underpants, turns the light on and off repeatedly, putting hell out of some goon. Amusing the scene ... I have not yet realized whether it is due to the discovery of a light switch or a perfectly shaped breast of Bell.
