I really don't think it's necessary to write a review of a movie that has a title like "Snake Island," but even within the abstract boundaries of its genre, it hit a new low, so my anger must be known. The only reason I even looked at this incredibly bad movie is because I knew it was bad, it was really late at night, I couldn't sleep, and in the past, really bad movies woke up. me and make me for a long time. Very soon it was very soon that this film was terrible, but it was even below those expectations. <br /> <br /> The film was directed and written by Wayne Crawford, who also marks the stars of the film. a tourist guide on the African River, which reaches a remote island, called Snake Island, until the second boat starts to pick them up. They are hanging, drunk, and then subjected to the poisonous snakes who are on a mission to clean their island of people. <br /> <br /> If your jaw has fallen in the last sentence of my second paragraph, don't worry about reading it again, you have it for the first time. Frankly, I prefer the qualities of my beings when the creature (s) attack the foolishly vain people, not because they have a mission. These are not mutant snakes. They are not like "Anaconda." They are just ordinary, everyday African snakes, such as mambs and vipers, they only have the brain to form armies, start the causes, work with people's traps, understand our language and even dance! Did your drawing fall again? Well, it falls even further. The amount in the midst of this terrible B-film, the part where I have already given up, the human characters are going to drink around the campfire, and then they suddenly break into some orgy. And while they dance and dance, they all hunt down and stick to it. The combination of this scene and the scene in which we discover that snakes, some of the most abominable beings on the planet, have created a union against people for some unusual reason is too much for my poor brain. And just when the filmmakers couldn't bring it even lower, the snakes started to sing. <br /> <br /> People in the movie? Well, let's just say it's never rooted before the creatures kill everyone so fast. I just couldn't stand it any longer. <br /> <br /> I really don't think I have to go on; you get the picture. If there is something that makes "Snake Island" different from other competitors, it is that it does not dare to try to be even unpleasant and it is not a free achievement. Why am I just leaving myself with these very bad movies, I think I never know. But "Snake Island" hits a whole new low. It's an inexpensive and tricky excuse for the movie that makes Anaconda, a meaningless snake film, so brilliant and challenging and exciting as Steven Spielberg's "jaws". You have been warned.
