Yes, Edward G. gives us a retrospective for the world of criminal protection. First of all, he is an overwhelming prosecutor who sends the wrong man to the board (played passionately, though briefly by DeForrest Kelly), so he is so full of indignation when his only consolation is a bottle. Throw a rotten romance, a really quick descent into exhaustion and no punishment for who it protects, and the next thing you know - Shazam! Black Leg Lawyer (the god I love this phrase). She sees the light just in time to save her jaded on the beloved chair. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Indeed, courtroom activities are pure melodrama. Look at her to catch a witness, look at her drinking poison, see her claiming passionately when she touches the bullet holes in her chest. Get ready for melodrama. <br /> <br /> The movie is still Jayne Russell. When curves make gravity laws more difficult and IQ approached zero, he has something to see. Even sings a little.
