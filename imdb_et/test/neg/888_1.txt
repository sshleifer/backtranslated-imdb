I've seen a lot of bad movies in my life. Date movie. It was bad. But that's ... it's just ... it's not good. House Party 4 is the worst film. It's that simple. This is basically Ferris Bueller with black people. Oh, and it's not funny. It's terrible. So terrible. Chris Stokes may be a BET superstar, but he is an idiot. He can't write comedy. Or horror movie. I like to call it a blacker, lesser-known Uwe Boll. Except Uwe Boll's movies are funny when you know what I mean. You can invite some friends, put yourself in the dark alone and have a good time with your friends to laugh and eat. Chris Stokes is like this unless you invite friends to watch House Party 4 with you, no one laughs. Not even a biased symbolic black boy or illiterate jock. I'm serious, I didn't laugh at all this movie. Action is terrible and the film looks like a bad indie movie. What was the budget for this movie? 5 fucking dollars? I mean, what the hell? This movie sucks easily; don't waste your time on this mess. This is horrible.
