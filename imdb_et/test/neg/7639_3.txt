This film shows that character development is incomplete. Valeria Golino's character, Grazia, looks like a bipolar personality, but hurries fast to a caricature and seems unrealistic. Other characters are thin, probably not the writer's guilt. The only exception is Filippo Pucillo, the younger son of Filippo: his energy and bravado are funny and convincing. <br /> <br /> I think the small-scale cruelty of children should contribute to the atmosphere of darkness and emphasize all-inclusive primary alcoholic beverages in the city, but for me, free cruelty is superfluous and contributes to the overall boredom of the film. Some scenes were amusing, but not necessarily intended, for example, when abused dogs become fat and healthy and look like they are ready to show. Pretty cast and setup makes an attractive trailer, but can't carry the whole movie.
