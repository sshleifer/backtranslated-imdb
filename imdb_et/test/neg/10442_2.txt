Now everyone has seen the shark in this cake! The plot was good, but the excitement later became nervous. Jr. Antonio Sobato plays an excellent role as a son looking for his father's dead shark. Megaldon is one of the largest and most dangerous sharks. The view of Hail was indeed scary in some corners, but the effect was blurred and the scenes were somewhat weak in some places. With miniature weapons, there would be shark sharks there. It was great that the son would get an exact revenge for this monster, even though it would cost him his life. As they say, is the price of revenge, but was it worth it? This answer could go on and this film was a big backlog. The beginning was good and at the end it went like a Titanic. 1 OFF 5 STAR!
