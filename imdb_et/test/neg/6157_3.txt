The story and the characters really need work. The idea of ​​the world is pure, but nobody bothered to develop it through exposure or plot. Despite the creepy comments at the beginning of the movie, it makes sense that you don't use the exposure because no one is new to this world. And yet, when Matt Owens (Bill Paxton) and Byron (Bob Peck) are mistaken and mistaken and introduce the wind worshipers and fat, lazy, rich people in the museum, we don't get a real idea of ​​who these people are, or why we should make them care. Smart movies have the opportunity to develop it simply when the characters live in the world. Simple things like ordering a drink at a bar or talking about the past - these are the things that make the film world memorable, not endlessly infinite for endless planes and look for someone with a cheap CG effect if it's too hard for you, here's a small place with multiple locations. When everything breaks apart because you often pull up, stay one place for a while and take a little talk. All the excess mess must be removed. Get rid of all the winds of events. Free the people of museums. Get rid of all the dirty flying if you can't keep the wind going. Is the whole thing on a big plane or something. Just tell people what we care about. <br /> <br /> Hi, release Bill Paxton. Let the movie center around Tasker's character and his relationship with Byron robot. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the biggest problem with a movie is that we don't care about anyone because no one takes the time to explain their motivation or get deeper into their characters. We do not like Matt (well, because Bill Paxton plays among other things). He's a fool who won't let himself out, except for android, Byron. And the meaning of this measure is the least meaningful of the three main points: <br /> <br /> 1. Byron is a murderer. 2. Byron is indestructible. 3. Byron can leave at any time when he starts well. <br /> <br /> We try as Byron, because there is a certain sin there, but it is largely developed. Everything we have left is a tiny, glass-eyed robot boss who acts one moment at a modest and woody level, and practically emerges. We don't know why or how he develops emotions, but we know he was murdered. We do not know why he murdered someone or the circumstances of this terrible event because it was not developed. We don't feel sorry for him if we don't know the story. All we know is that he is murdering people. And she likes Bill Paxton. <br /> <br /> We do not hate Tasker enough (partly because he is played by good man Mark Hamill) because, though terrible and merciless, nothing is common in his character - an apocalyptic peace officer. Of course he kills Montclaire (Robbie Coltrane) and his team, but they are drug dealers who grow as a poppy for heroin. And they shoot him first. He doesn't kill anyone who doesn't do the road or who doesn't try to harm him first. This also applies to the museum's final confrontation. He uses the brutality of the police against lazy dilettants (Murray Abraham is wasted in this role) and all others are pulling his weapon. <br /> <br /> I really don't understand what Belitski (Kitty Aldridge), Tasker's partner, is doing. After only 10 minutes with Matt, he is ready to change halfway, despite his loyalty and despite the fact that Matt talks to his trash, and kills him. If this is love, I choose hate every day. <br /> <br /> Really. Paxton's "True Lies" or Pvt. Hudson "foreigners". Does anyone fall into these films? Not why? Because he's an idiot and loser. Why put him in the board of this movie?
