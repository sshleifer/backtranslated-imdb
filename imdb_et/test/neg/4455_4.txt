It is disgraceful that such a flat plot should be hung in such picturesque places where some documentary style reports are moved to an extra length. A shorter film may have been a little more tense, and a more charismatic lead may not mix your lines so much. The female driver could not do enough, which resulted in a real but boring thing. It is based on the end, but the redemption of the leading actor himself is too late and should have appeared in the film before. Not terrible, but sorry. Unexpected, but nice enough to love early hours TV shows.
