Sideshow is a good example of a fundamentally interesting idea that went very, very wrong. As for the influx of horror films and especially teenage films, the film is based on a teenager participating in a mysterious fan show, something that you could enjoy very much. <br /> <br /> But the writer decided to make a very straight, very boring, very ordinary story of the five young people who are part of the exhibitions, when the depleted dwarf Abbot Graves transforms them into freaks using some pathetic machine that mutates them into wild animals. <br /> Five teenagers are selected one by one until the last man is left, his "punishment" is that he cannot join his friends and thus "be alone." What a garbage load! <br /> <br /> "Actors" are really poor, this movie has no comedy (and it could have been so funny!), no gore (and it could have been so funny!), no action and fear! (and it could have been so much!) <br /> <br /> The director has not been able to even try to look at it. His experience with the soft core has obviously denied any creativity he had ever had since all the shots are the same, with very little change and little movement. Quality is generally poor. <br /> <br /> I usually don't like nudity in movies, but believe me that the only high point in this movie was a couple of couples.
