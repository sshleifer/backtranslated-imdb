My friends and we rented this movie erroneously for what it was about skateboarding. Watchin Steve Guttenberg acts as a hero of fun. The film is so incredibly predictable and top notch that it was a laugh fest. Even if I gave this 1/10 this movie should be seen especially if u manage to catch it on television everywhere.
