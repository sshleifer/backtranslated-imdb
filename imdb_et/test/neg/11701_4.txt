This film gives a new meaning to the term "uneven", giving us some intriguing testimonials, compensated by a cumbersome plot based on some well-positioned needles to provide most of the excitement. The plot touches a group of men who have a mystery that has caused the curse that they have visited as a ghostly female image that causes death. He can also seduce his sons. <br /> <br /> It is quite remarkable that all the remarkable veteran artists are on one movie, but unfortunately they are not particularly convincing, especially in the scene where Melvyn Douglas goes deep, asking others to listen to him. Then there is no shock that the actors who play these same characters in their youth are terrible, especially rattling Ricky. They give the worst "gee-are-we-all-drunk" scene I've ever seen. in this movie) and Alice Krige's exciting performance as Alma / Eva. I've never read the novel that this movie comes from, but I'm going to read some other comments on this page. You do not have to read the book, however, to understand that this is only a shadow of the original story. There is a good story here, but it seems that somewhere, in the middle of the exposition, shows that men have nightmares over and over, and making vague references to what they all share. <br /> <br /> As of now, it seems that about half an hour of material, especially near the climax, has been removed from this publication. After all ... how is it that Fred Astaire can dig the pond so quickly? What did Gregory Bate and the child do with Eva? And while we're in there ... what the hell was he? Why was he brought out of the car, that the revelation disappeared? If it were a manifestation, how could it be sex between two men and they don't know them? <br /> <br /> These and other questions can never be answered, at least not with this movie. If some restored material is not discovered, it will probably remain an eternal curiosity for some relaxing makeup, create scenes and nudity, and some attractive performances.
