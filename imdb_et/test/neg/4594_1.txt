Where to start with "Speck" in the 1960s, the real story of eight sisters killing Richard Speck. Director Keith Walley has worked on a very low budget Full Moon Releasing movie (such as Birth Rite) and here is a full-moon regular Don Adams from the script (at time). Unfortunaly although the film seems like an exact idea of ​​a scary crime script is not great, maybe because the real Speck's ramblings were not terribly interesting!? Despite the diligence that has been done to make this authentication, a cheap income from cinematic serum killer films from the same period (eg, Ed Gein) is emerging. In a movie filmed in black brown, not in sepia, mostly and commented by Doug Cole, the film does not have a horror of crime, because storytelling is irritating, the story is distorted by color and the crime, though frightening and disturbing, is just that editorial is not It seems to have happened, which is an event about a very poor quality camcorder. Specki's motivation for life and life is not really studied, but it is a cheap look for an evil crime. The little evidence given by Full Moon shows the better output of Full Moon here, Charles Band ignoring his own rule that his films have fantasy killings (eg dolls, monsters, etc.) and not quite well known what to do with this new reality. Incidentally Band introduced the special label "Shadow Entertainment" for these films. The band has said he regrets the full-moon production period with Tempe Entertainment (whose creation by J.R. Bookwalter and regular Danny Draven are also very bad about Charles Band). In the era of tempe, unified Apple Mac editing and brutal handheld camera shooting are very similar to home video. Speck retains these qualities, and since Witchouse 3, for example, was able to use them well, Speck is just bored and gross.
