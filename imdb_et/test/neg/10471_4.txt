.... OK, small town, helpless sheriff? Check it out. Sheriff's hot daughter? Check? Isn't Sheriff's hot daughter hated by a sheriff? Check it out. Corporate land developer who earns people profitability? Check it out. The developer rank and file unintentionally opens the original monster, then pushes it to cover it? Check it out. Natives who warn against mass death and destruction if things are not returned as they were? Check it out. Amateurish CGI special effects that could have been produced by a Commodore 64 computer? Check it out. Virtually all of the clich√©s of your typical Sci-Fi original film are put together in classic, so bad-good movies. The only thing missing is a scientist / expert who is trying to pass on his knowledge; there is a paleontologist for three pupils who get their Bone Eater shut up relatively early, but these are basically movie additions. And I can honestly say I predicted it almost all; the right one who survives and who is not (though I have to say that I got one trait with the wrong actual death time in about an hour). I swear I could have made this movie myself when they gave me all the characters. However, watching a movie is fun, for some other reason than playing MST3K with your friends. If you are somewhat pointless for fun, this is a great movie I look at, so I'm going to give this film a surprisingly respectable 4, though all the intentions and goals deserve much lower ratings. But then again, wouldn't you tune in to the SciFi Original movie if you were looking for a real plot, a character or a good special effect movie?
