Dark Harvest is about a group of friends going to the farm (it belongs to one of the friends' relatives or something) to escape. But there are murderers there (there was something curse, but I forgot what it was). <br /> <br /> The action of this movie is terrible, I don't know what the director was thinking when his actors and actors were. The script is the same story that works "terribly" (this statement is very obvious, but ..) if it had better functioning and better script, it would have been "okay". <br /> <br /> The board also collided, I can't see any potential in this guy in the future. After all these negative elements, this film still retains a funny factor that pulls it up to two. The last plus is that they don't use CGI! My general thoughts on this movie are bad, real bad, but so bad it's "fun" so it gets 2/10
