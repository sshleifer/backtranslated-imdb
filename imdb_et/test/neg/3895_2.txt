I admit that I did not pay full attention to what is going on in this film, but to be honest it does not believe it is important. Basically, the local commissioner Sidney Fiddler (Sid James) persuades Firecombe's incompetent mayor Frederick Bumble (Kenneth Connor) to organize a beauty contest to improve the city's reputation. They face the opposition of female liberalist Augusta Prodworthy (June Whitfield), which is trying to sabotage the competition, but they have a public representative, Peter Potter (Bernard Bresslaw) and Palace Hotel owner Connie Philpotts (Joan Sims). Soon, young, beautiful wannabe models will appear, including Hope Springs (Barbara Windsor), Paula Perkins (Valerie Leon), Dawn Brakes (Goldfinger's Margaret Nolan), Debra (Sally Geeson) and East Downs (EastEnders' Wendy Richard). When girls fight against the cat, she pulls out the regular residents, but after quite some time, if they're not so funny in the innuend, and William (Jack Douglas), who has too active jerks, eventually gets to the competition and it couldn't be disturbed right after that . Patsy Rowlands also plays as Mildred Bumble, Admiral Peter Butterworth, Joan Hickson as Mrs. Dukes, David Lodge as Police Inspector, Angela Grant as Miss Bangor, Arnold Ridley as Commissioner Pratt, Robin Askwith as Larry, Patricia Franklin Rosemaryna, Jimmy Logan as Cecil Gaybody and Dad Army Bill Pertwee as Chief of Fire, Charles Hawtrey had apparently left Carry Ons, but where is Kenneth Williams? I think I see Babus and the young, beautiful Pauline Fowler in bikini, but it fails for the value of comedy, and the excessive use of butterfly whistles just goes on the nerves. Pretty bad!
