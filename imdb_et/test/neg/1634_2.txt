Another Conan wannabe in the long line that is tired of the success of this movie is that Italian monstrosity is about as bad as they came. You know that this is a bad sign if your heroes are fighting with invisible enemies, because the film was made so cheap that the money was not enough for special effects or real people. I don't even bother going to the plot if I don't want to follow it and understand the logic. Maybe this is the TV channel I watched, but I can't imagine that each version would be so much better. It seems so random to me. Evil witches, caves, giant snakes, medieval castles, grenades and hangers? none of them fit together. It would be like the head of Joe D'Amato, who had the epileptic suitability of cave-dwellers (or dozens of other names in the other half) and threw everything he could think of on the screen, no matter how unrelated it was or how it fit into the plot of the film. Operation is bad enough. Miles O'Keeffe could never get out of a wet paper bag and she proves that this movie is once again. The rest is equally cruel. Then there is. . . Well, you get the idea. It's late, I'm tired and I've been wasting a lot of time on this garbage. Take my word? Avoid Cave Dwellers (or whatever you call it) at all costs.
