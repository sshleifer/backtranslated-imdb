What do you get when you put Lou Diamond Philips, Todd Bridges, Barry Corbin on the bad toupee and alien train? You'll get a very bad movie called "Alien Express" or "Dead Rail", which would be more fun with Comedy Central's old series "Mystery Science Theater 3000". You name it, the terrible movie you suffered in the areas of exhibition, plot, storyline, and special effects. In fact, the shots of the outgoing train saw the manufacturers using a common HO scale model in front of the painted background! The rest of the special effects move down there. <br /> <br /> The plot is very predictable and resembles two 1970's "Horror Express" and "Cassandra Crossing". At least "Cassandra Crossing" was a better cast, an interesting story and real train scenes. <br /> <br /> If you want a "B-Movie" party to laugh and film, look at it; otherwise, "Alien Express" went off the rail before leaving the station!
