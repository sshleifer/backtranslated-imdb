Normally, I don't waste time reviewing the film "Human Pork Chop" (2001 version, not to be confused with the earlier title of a title that is probably better known as the West than "The Untold Story"). "), but since reviews here are rather vague about what it actually consists of, I thought I'd give something more detailed so that no one would actually be tempted (as I was) to buy a movie. mystic. AWAY. <br /> <br /> **** MAJOR SPOILERS is below **** <br /> <br /> "Human pork", I was expecting to be like China's interpretation of popular Japanese guinea pig films. There is a strong sense of humor - you can't look at the ridiculous ridiculous "He never dies" and "Making the guinea pigs" is a fabulous turning of the whole thing, proving that it was just done. , with gorehounds of fairly good character, all GP films have punk-rock, DIY, video-aesthetic, occasionally genuine artistic flash ("Mermaid in Manhole"), angry political agenda and twisted, robbed zeal that put them in their own league <br /> <br /> "Human pork" is not one of the above. <br /> <br /> It is photographed with 35mm film (unfavorably good value for money), it is 90 minutes long and is completely without any redemption. In the plot, he talks about Grace's systematic torture, death and final crushing, a heroin-dependent street warrior who has been kidnapped and kidnapped by his pimp and his henchmen when he steals money from him when interviewing the suspects. br /> <br /> Despite his short efforts to be a moral game, the film has a self-evident, inhuman feel and no one can help but live in the minds behind it. Although Grace paints as an innocent victim, the average spiritual nature of this scenario and the constant, malicious dialogue of the protagonist in a shocking, totally unwanted direction "deserves it!" that makes the whole thing almost impossible. Much more time is spent in detail on Grace's deterioration, and if his imprisonment is finally found guilty and imprisoned, it seems to be quick after thinking about the writers who have long stopped taking less care. <br /> <br /> What makes it amazing why anyone wants to watch such a movie is that even people who are really hopeless and sex-abused have been seriously lost. Torture is just a constant stream of strokes, strokes, verbal abuse, psychological abuse, and then an increasingly strange exposition on behalf of the authorities, using Grace's heroin addiction to make their offer. And when I say that, don't get my mistake. Unlike the "guinea pig", which has a frequent nudity barrier, which gives an almost teenage look to the procedure despite ultraviolet, "Human pork" has no such sexual hints. There is no real nudity in the film, and the criminals (who see the movie early when they fill the dog's bags and beat it with brick - not worry, not the real, just inexpensive special effect!) Are behaving in an unpleasant way. <br /> <br /> The only real bloodshed in the movie is when they demolish Grace's body, and boil the bones, all very bad FXs (somewhere "near Guinea"). The level of pork) and at this stage you already seem too unhappy and sick to take care of what is happening. <br /> <br /> The film is depressingly gloomy and uncompromising with a similar line of Buddy Giovinazzo's "Combat Shock" and I think it can even be compared. Both films deal with the gradual physical loss of the individual in a horrible environment that lacks any social or morally repayable character, and both films culminate in a particularly visceral way with the inevitable, inevitable, doom of man. <br /> <br In law, "glamourise" does not violate this (given that it can easily be blamed on a "guinea pig") but cannot help but do not know where that place is. In many real points, he is not able to make such brutality and cordless pace, practically non-existent plot line and the absence of the above-mentioned entertaining value from his brutal performance, I just don't understand what encourages anyone to look at something like that. I only finished it to be able to review it fairly ... which I hope I have done now. <br /> <br /> Overall: 0 of 10. Welcome to the bottom of the barrel.
