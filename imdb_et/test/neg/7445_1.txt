I really do not understand to whom this film is directed. Just its absurdity, not to mention the ridiculously bad action, the cheesy dialogue, and the fact that the kid is a kid, I assume it was meant to be a children's movie ... but I think there may be more swear words than Pulp Fiction, not to mention the constant references to drugs and general chaos and killing what demography wants it to do? This movie is too schizophrenic as trying to combine Country music with Heavy metal, and eventually nobody likes it because it is a bloody paradox. I recommend this movie because it's so funny (badly) unless the actors are so obviously intolerable that I wouldn't want to say otherwise. <br /> <br /> I'm totally serious when I say I couldn't watch it for more than 15 minutes. Terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiible
