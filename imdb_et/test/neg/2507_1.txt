The opening was stealing from the "Eight-legged Freaks", which is not all that. Cropped and pedestrians are the words that apply - with others that can't be repeated ..! Drifter type returns to their home (?) City, meets old friends, etc ... normal annoying child, single mother, local loudmouth and so on .. very special effects, alien ship, atmospheric disturbance, (hey, no director can't see "close appointments" ?). Good action? Good story? Good camera angle? Good cutting? Not here! Don't rent if you don't share the cost and you have a lot of beer. Don't watch TV, go and drink a lot of beer - you will enjoy more!
