I've been a fan of Jane Austen for several years. I've never seen this adaptation, so when I heard about it, I came here and read great comments. On this basis I ordered it with Netflix. What a cruel disappointment! They have taken one of the finer and brighter comic novels and made it boring. Each character seems to be divided into one facial expression, which is one tone on which to base its definite signs. Although this customization seems to have used every word that Jane Austen wrote, it seems that they are random characters. Although this customization took the form of a miniseries, it is confusing and confusing as it would have been as a weekly movie. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bennett is too harsh, Mrs Bennet just a roaring bush, Mr Darcy's inanimate as a nutcracker, Bennett's girls are almost indistinguishable, and Mr Wickham, a man whom no one can see twice - hardly an appealing frame! I'm pretty out!
