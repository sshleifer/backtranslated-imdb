Travolta, Thurman, Rock, Vaughn, Keitel and so on. It should be assumed that the stars of the big actors could really warm up this movie, but not. Travolta takes on the role of Chili Palmer again, but this time we have already seen a gangster trying to make his luck in a difficult world that is no longer funny. This is usually a problem in Hollywood, they think that if the first was good then the other is twice as good, NO, the first was original, the other could not be, Hey Hollywood is trying to understand originality. Give us a new twist, not just the same movie that has been made for a bigger budget. I always found myself hardly laughing when I watched this movie, but still got many cool actors like Harvey Keitel, James Woods, Vince Vaughn and The Rock and just for that! <br /> <br /> 4/10
