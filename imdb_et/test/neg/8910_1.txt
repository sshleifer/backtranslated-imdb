Really? Is it necessary? How can anyone make such a movie? Nasty !!! Seteven Seagal funny hair and fat like elephant. Stunts all the time, cars persecution with annoying soundtrack. Not to mention the end. Totally crap in the presence of a little girl. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal wants to be Robin Hood !!! Well, at first the treasurer meets something, no one has asked for it. Seagal woman has nightmares and she sees the future. They're having fun. Steven Segal goes out after the persecution of the car and I know he can't act. It was terrible. Nothing saves this movie. <br /> <br /> I lost my life for 90 minutes! See you
