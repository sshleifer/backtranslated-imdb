Well, it's about 1000 years in the future and we've finally broken the distance between galaxies !! But unfortunately we still use weapons that shoot bullets, black men still call each other brothers and get high, stoned, fighting, etc. Frequent stereotypical black men are still running short! Babes with dense black rubber trousers that look like they are from Baywatch share their loved ones with jail and team. Disappointed people still need wheelchair movement, fictional treatments, implants or robotic legs. Dracula still looks and acts gay. The need to go ... In short, this move has been made with the usual sci-fi set low budget props, actors and real special effects. The beginning, the middle and the end were pathetic. I have to go and shoot myself.
