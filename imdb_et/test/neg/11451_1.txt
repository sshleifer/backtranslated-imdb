*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** There is not much to say about the flick of this early-age era. (I'm a hesitant "Cimarron" for "movie" because I feel that this word is too esoteric.) But what can be said about it ... mainly speaks against it. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the poor people of indian depiction. In one scene, the flick's leading boy - overflowing and over-ambitious family man who wants to create a newspaper business - plays just outside his father's office. India kneels in front of the child. "Hello," says the boy very politely to India. India gives her feathers, stands up and walks. <br /> <br /> Yancy Cravat, Jr. Excitingly running in the office. "Mommy! Mommy!" he cries, holding an Indian gift. "See what India gave me!" <br /> <br /> "How many times do I have to tell you!" he clicks on the boy. "You've never talked to those dirty Indians!" <br /> <br /> Yancy Yates, Sr. (Richard Dix) comes over as a man who speaks fork languages. At the beginning of the story, he seems to have a definite plan to give his family a better life. But we will soon discover that he is not big as achiever - a much less moral minded man. His slave child, Eugene Jackson, is one of its lights. <br /> <br /> The first track of the family on Sunday morning - one <br /> <br />, curiously, Cravat must give a sermon - Isaiah is trying to come, dressed like Cravat, a long tail suit, a wrapper, a gun and everything. Cravat tells her to go home. "Ya" doesn't want me to come with the church? "Isaiah says with a hat. <br /> <br />" No! "Cravat fixes her, hitting her shoulder." You don't understand! I want you to stay and watch the house. And if anyone comes at all ... you shoot him dead! "<br /> <br /> Characters - not to mention the actors - in" Cimarron "they could not, despite their obvious efforts to get out of their coffee packs. Simple: Incomparable Edna May Oliver, also known for playing the Queen of Reds in Alice In Wonderland, published in 1931, can actually look good by pulling out her imaginative old woman, which she is the best - known. , well ... <br /> <br /> Yancy Yates hasn't been popular in the city for the first week, <br /> <br /> and one of the illegal laws decides to shoot Cravati's white hat because she and her husband (Irene Dunne) Despite being angry with the man who fired the ball, Cravat takes it all the way. <br /> <br /> Not only was this story a "realistic shooting", it was very <br /> <br /> missing several in key areas: eg the Cravati newspaper is never really visible. (Bulletins and posters, yes - but no newspaper.) Maybe the strangest thing is: it is in a small town, <br /> <br /> People. Yancy Crava is, however, dead for some reason. <br /> <br /> Call your paper "Oklahoma Wig-Wam." <br /> <br /> Truly good Westerners have always been very little and far from - the only exceptions are Clint Eastwood's so-called "spaghetti west" from the late 60s to the early 70s. The Cliche westernid, on the other hand, is a little dozen. <br /> <br /> If you like the cliche western, "Cimarron" will make you proud - but like me ... it made me embarrassed. <br /> <br />
