The Lassie film that should have been "put to sleep" .... VERY. That's how I describe it painfully from the film's time. So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a boring, uninteresting mess, it's one of the most forgotten movies I've seen. It's not even an achievement as "so bad, it's good" or "so bad it's a memorable" movie. The idea of ​​Lassie's bad ideas is intriguing, but so little actually happens and so slowly that you feel that your life slides while sitting there, watching non-participants who read their lines when they wait for their tough paid checks. <br /> <br /> This is an empty, hollow shell of a movie. Seriously, it's not worthy of you or your child's time. If you are not so strongly treated. That's all I have to say. <br /> <br /> Avoid, avoid! It drives you for barking mad! Hahahah, is that? ATTENTION! Hahahahahahaha! <br /> <br /> Sorry, I had a hard week.
