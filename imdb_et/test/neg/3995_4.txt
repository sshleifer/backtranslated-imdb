Non-fans call Dario Argentot a lot of bad things to master the Italian horror. And it deserves absolutely no setback. In fact, every time I hear anything bad about Argento, I think they're actually talking to Michele Soavist. He just doesn't get as much attention as his films were never so successful in theaters. In fact, his best film - the 1994 cemetery man - was probably his least successful. Or she just didn't get the attention she felt deserved because after that she left the movie and headed to the TV. He's never gone back. So people really don't know how lower their other films are, because they are already fans of Italian horror aesthetics. That means you have to accept the fact that they do almost zero and are usually very attractive films. This is where the church looks out of the package. For visually, it's so cheap and with an ancient look, you can smell the dust. But his charms, though, are few. Camera-work is really arresting and the music score is very complicated and great. <br /> <br /> Since Argento is the reason why people have seen Soavi's work, I don't know anyone who gathered before Argento's suspension and Deep Red. Soavi is a little cage. Like Italian Mick Garris - the ultimate example of a director who prefers style over matter. Church errors are constant and many. The film opens up with a somewhat interesting prologue that shows that white horse knights are loaded through a peasant village, similar to what you see in any Robin Hood adaptation, some long time ago. These scenes are intense, energetic and quickly reach the point. Then we cut to the point where the film's style takes over. Yes, this movie is fine. And after about 35 minutes, in the 1980s, where everything is in Italy, this movie is interesting enough to reach us in the slowly revealing fear elements. Now we know that the purpose of the film is to build this horror. And this is usually a decent design. But when the film approaches halfway, we understand film management and ... nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple. I'm thinking. Two people working in church, one as a book catalog and the other as a wall art restorer, discover the scrolling / scripture that the man thinks leads them to some buried treasure or invaluable artifact that he can sell and get rich. So he follows his "card" only to expose the force under the church that he has him hallucinate, while he slowly becomes a demon who does all the other hallucinates. So when he does his demon work, somebody who has reached his demon went to kill himself in a way that catches everyone in the church when the demon "contagen" spreads to everyone, leaving the preacher of the black preacher and the little girl. The church every night to go to the club as the only 2 people who can stop the spread of plague across the walls of the church. Apparently it sounds packed and Soavi's style is much more lethargic than Argento. But I've never seen a surreal event that is filthy boring. I'm not doing you. Nothing happens in the whole movie! I've seen expressive (or impressionist, I'm not a film school super-grad) movies, but most of them actually show things (for John Carpenter for Halloween). <br /> <br /> In the footsteps of Lamberto Bava demon films (from Argento co-production). We are shown a place where people gather, one becomes a demon, everyone else is isolated, that a person infects everything except a few survivors, then the demons either infect the world or survive when demons die. This movie puts all these same elements in place. Unlike Argento's work, nothing happens. Okay, some things happen. But only one odd sequence is Lamberto's much more fun demon movies. The daemon is using the garden part that it pulls out of the floor to displace the casual woman's neck. What's strange, you don't know? It's about two dozen people. What are they doing? Something. He dies, head to head bleeding. But not all of these people even notice it, although it happens normally and not less than 8 meters away. Maybe 4 people will notice that the demon is running up so that he can get someone he gets when he drives him so they dive. He has been killed and after his death everyone is just sitting down, being quiet when the boy is playing a saxophone. I'm not doing you. It happens. It's more than logically inconsistent - it's a common fool. <br /> <br /> The scene shows the woman just disappears and no one saw her death. They're all just up and forget. And this 15-second thing is absolutely the only event that takes place in the movie. I'm not saying it's the only violence, gore or murder we see. This is not. It's just the only thing we can say. For example, in one scene, a beautiful woman sees herself in an old and ugly mirror. He starts to look at the skin, but when he appears again, he doesn't scratch. People eat fish and their faces are squeezed with forest cars. But later, they become a completely unspoiled member who has conquered culture, a scene that makes the ultimate fear of heresy by copying the famous scene of Roman Polanski's 1968 masterpiece. Even if Argento had done that, I'd be furious!
