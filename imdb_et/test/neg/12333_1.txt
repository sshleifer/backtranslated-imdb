The worst movie I've ever seen. The sound quality was bad, scoring was even worse, and above all it was not logical and had no speed ... <br /> <br /> First I thought, "Oh no, I don't want a trail that proves poor Patrick was an innocent killer, but it turned out to be even worse. Usually in this American movie you get a super hint or hints at all. I want very small small clues that will guide you to the killer. Audience is not involved. And now, if I don't get any clues at all, you can expect to end several 's-is-the-killer' and that's not all. ah ... It's hopeless, it ends ... <br /> <br /> In short: disgusting .. <br /> <br />
