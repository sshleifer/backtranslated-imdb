What a terrible movie. I can't believe I actually sat down and watched it. Very, very, very, very, very, very pathetic, effort with no redemption qualities. Hateeeeeeedddd ittttt! The so-called "racing" sequences are ridiculously terrible and the plot was so bad I have forgotten it. Part of the film was made at the Spa-Francorchamps course in Belgium, I think 1988, during the actual Grand Prix. I was there and I'm glad I didn't show any paddock scenes in the movie. It could have been good ... sorry.
