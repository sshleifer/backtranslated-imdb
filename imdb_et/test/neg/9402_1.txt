Please don't look at it. I made several smiles along this film, but they were all due to involuntary comedy. <br /> <br /> There were only three characters in this movie, so it was amazing how bad the character was. Pacino played Pacinot again and made most of the time more difficult. The scenes in this film seem like the ones the really poor editor put together from 20 other bad movies. There is no consistency and I found myself wondering why I didn't leave for 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> I would ever recommend seeing a movie directed by D.J. Caruso. It was really terrible.
