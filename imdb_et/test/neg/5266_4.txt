This movie is really quite strange. It is clear that certain * events * represented the main protagonist as a Dublin criminal known as "General", but almost everything else is wrong. We are not talking about the distortion of ancient history, but about the complete distortion of undisputed, documented facts. In fact, the question is why? Garda is shown on the last day of Keystone Cops, her gang as a non-threatening and male self as ... living with Kevin Spacey. Almost pure fiction anyway, why barely try to give realism? Having said all this, this is a bad exercise * how to look at it. No one's worth the time.
