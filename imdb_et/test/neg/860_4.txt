There is nothing special here, the animation is outdated and the plot is a typical futuristic era. This movie has an original story, but if it doesn't have the original plot or characters, I think it's not worth seeing. I'm not saying the movie was bad, it was just a typical anime story and I thought I was watching this movie a thousand times. So if you are looking for something original, look at the other thing.
