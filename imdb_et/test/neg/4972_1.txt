I love Jurassic Park movies, they are three of my favorite films of all time. <br /> <br /> And I hate this game. br /> <br /> How can a classic film game be too terrible? And to be the worst, I was scared of this game when I was a child. <br /> <br /> If it was, but when I played again, it was the boy when the game was first. /> The game in this game is just strange. One minute it's a game and then it's a shooter. What's wrong with the world is to remember when a video game is made. <br /> <br /> The sound of the game is just terrible to listen to. <br /> <br /> Music is just too ill listening. <br /> <br /> Game controllers don't work most of the time. <br /> <br /> Jurassic Park is just a waste of time and money and not classic. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs
