Stay away from this movie. Far. Phil Fondacaro stands for Freakshow's demented leader. Each performance is flat and unknown, except for Fondacaro. The plot is simple and follows almost all the clues of horror movies. A group of high school kids go to a carnival, see a side show and get over their heads. <br /> <br /> Fred I Ray fans must be warned, it's not like any of his other movies. This was lacking in all departments (humor, sex, horror, etc.) other F.O. Ray movies are great. <br /> <br /> I also saw a version in which the director makes comments like "We had a limited budget" and "our limited schedule" that speaks of how much Charles Band was caring for this movie. Instead, rent a "Droid Runner" (Fred Olen Ray) or "The Dead Hate the Living". Full moon should be ashamed (and it says a lot after seeing "Killer Eye") <br /> <br /> Grade: D-
