this film made me Paul W.S. Anderson's AvP1 and enjoy it! I'm not even going to dream of comparing Requiem's ​​foreigner or Predator series movie, it's HORRIBLE TEACH B-HORROR FOOTAGE SET in small places in America without any care. <br /> <br /> AvP1 at least crafted handmade artwork carved into movie sets, it had never seen any eye candy bags in its original film - but it was broken by persuasive characters / action. <br /> <br /> Requiem takes bad action to the lowest level possible and in all other departments as much ... it's holiness to add garbage to alien and predator costumes.
