I tried to like this movie. I love Kevin Spacey and I knew another guy about his role in Big Brain in Brad Pulp Fiction. But I just don't care about the characters at all. Kevin Spacey is clinging to the whole movie, and even some terrible things that happened to him, I didn't like him. Particularly ending --- which made me even more hate. It was like a bad car wreck. Spacey played well (he does it well) but would not recommend it.
