The first user comments are very detailed for a very vague movie. Don't say I disagree, but this summary can be written with a few sentences. To get to the point, it's pretty much the same when you really look at making a bad amateur porn flick. There are some funny points in the film, but in things that are happening in today's youth, it is so flat in everyday life. The main actor of the film is the pompous jackass and both the guy and the girl in the movie are too modest to be in such a movie. DO NOT ATTENTION your money on this film. The only reason I gave it to 4 and not 1 is that they used at least a somewhat attractive girl in the movie, and finally you have to see the girl almost full of nudity, that is, the only thing worth seeing. end
