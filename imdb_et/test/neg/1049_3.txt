Kite Runner began as one of these "important" films that most people failed because they were told that they should, if they wanted to be among the elites, quickly fell into an idiotic absurdly extreme movie with extreme proportions. /> I have never read a book and have never felt the need because I don't care. I'm sure I'm called informed but I don't really have any interest in just another "pull my heartbeat, copy all other story lines to get the reader's novel emotion, even if it's set in Afghanistan." > That is, I was watching the movie. I heard good things about this beauty and how it touched and decided why not? As it turns out, there was a very good reason why not. The main character was completely atypical (I got it, he was young and it's a movie about salvation, but frankly he was terrible. I hated him and not in this good "anti-heroic way", he was just a boring, idiotic, self-absorbing character that I didn't know) but the rest of the story was so completely absurd that I couldn't believe how all others were about how beautiful it was and how they shouted and moved them .I'm sorry, but I feel only moved as it seems realistic k, Sci-Fi is known to me, fantasy moves ... but is it? Please. It surpassed many other films for pure absurdity! Hassan was the biggest when Amir's brother ... really? Are you sure you didn't kidnap it from a thousand other wildlife? Is it positive that this particular tidb is not just added to try to pull out more of your audience (you know what type of people are looking for a cry during the movie)? I was rolling my eyes when this "twisting" appeared, knowing that it could only go down there (not to mention Star Wars "Amir, Hassan is your brother" "NOOOoo, it's not true, it's impossible!") Oh, and it certainly did. Fill up to the edge of the climate and just plan on stupid storytelling. As a "good boy miraculously flees from a bad guy with all sorts of actions to help a brilliant boy who, despite being maliciously indignant and having no idea who you are, is ready to help with a comfortably placed weapon that has a special meaning for you". Ooh and don't forget that such an idiotic "end up getting revenge on a child who teased you, if you were little, surprise surprise, has become a psychopathic adult" (trust me, I like you want to live through the movie but it never happens. you know that boy who was teasing you in high school ... he is not a terrorist, he is probably an accountant.) <br /> <br /> Oh, and I have to mention the kites of CGI dances! I think they were equal to "Matrix" movies and "Transformers" bravo you guys! BRAVO! <br /> <br /> It seems that this film was made for the western countries who need to take care of the Middle East (hey too emotional story of friendship works!) This is one of the lowest films I've had to see, it is so profoundly good ... but when you get to it right now, it's not something special. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the core of the American audience is what they are doing and saying "It's about controversial material, so it must be good!" mindset.
