I looked at this example first, hoping for a few laughs, good action and a good plot. Unfortunately, I got none of these things. <br /> <br /> First of all, this exhibition is completely unrealistic. How can someone go to a schoolhouse that is super hip, awesome location and barely rules? Plus sushi bar. SUSHI BAR. No school has a sushi bar. And what is a huge, very cool, ultra-hip dormitory? It doesn't happen in internships! Everything in the show seems to be perfect. Zoey, looks perfect, has perfect friends, never has to do homework and is very popular. Sounds more like a villain to me! I hate how they use so many clicks in this show, for example: Dana is a skater chick. He's totally unaware and wearing nervous clothes. Jokes are old, so old! I will not look at this example if I were you, it is one of the most terrible shows I've ever watched and I hope it will be canceled soon! Rating: 1/10
