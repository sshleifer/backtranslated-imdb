It's really a two-party movie. The first detail describes the life and friendship of the two boys (one privileged pashtun and the other one dropped by Hazara) in Afghanistan well before the USSR invasion. Young actors are turning to convincing performances and seeing Afghanistan, because this time repeats the current situation as a harsh relief. <br /> <br /> The real problem comes when we move to the later stage of this story where we join Pashtun as a man living in America. The ancient debts of his young friend bring him back to his homeland, and that is indeed at that moment. The central character of an adult is probably obviously sympathetic, but in fact it comes to self-evident clergy and stops. It's really hard to take care of her and it can't be helped, but the feeling is that what we don't see is a really interesting story - her boyfriend's friend. <br /> <br /> When he returns to Afghanistan, he gets into a series of coincidences. The most remarkable thing for him is to meet his childhood enemy almost immediately (even if he is not looking for him), despite the time the country has consumed. This allows him to cope with earlier demons in a way that is just too convenient to be trustworthy. The narrative resolution also goes through the terrible, mawkish sentimentality that undermines all the really serious points that the film can try. <br /> <br /> Although it is possible to start seeing signs and their abuses as the world's symbols that have been torn by world politics, it's hard to really see it as a film that deals with wider political debate. Instead, the narrative decreases to one sign of the emotional self-discovery and healing path. Unfortunately, this character is so boring and surrounded that his story is hard to deal with, while the chances of making a truly interesting film about Afghanistan itself are wasted.
