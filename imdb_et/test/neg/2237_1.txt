I went to watch the movie because my boy was driving, how much he wanted to see it and how his friends were already and loved it. So I came with a neutral attitude, not really the worst. Unfortunately I got it. I could write a 15-page paper on why it's just the THE WORST movie I've ever seen. But for your benefit, I draw attention to the shortcomings of the pros and end of supply. First, the actor was very good, especially Christopher Waltz and Melanie Laurent. There were also some lines worth laughing and a couple stopping the scene. Unfortunately, there is good action, little humor, and a place where good points end. The whole story could have been great. The Jewish girl's family is polished, she hides in hiding, later meets the man in charge of her pain, and then hopes for a great plan for revenge. Sounds very good. But the film would not be so "satisfying" for the Americans and the Nazis. I have no problems with WWII movies or Nazi killing; I saw Defiance and like it very much. But this is the way and the attitude our heroes want to kill. I will give you an excellent example of what hypocrisy is about this film. Our hoodlum gang is capturing a German unit and killing / scaling all of them except Sergeant and two other soldiers (so far, no problem). They ask the sergeant to publish information about another German unit. When he "refuses respectfully" for betraying the lives of his fellow citizens, they despise the baseball head, swinging and swearing as if they were playing football. They took this Nazi head off yaaay! Now let's look at hypocrisy in this scene. Here's a hypothetical situation: the enemy has been attacked and imprisoned by a group of American soldiers. The same scenario follows and the American chief officer dies rather than betraying his soldier. The enemy puts a lot of need to celebrate. It would frighten the audience if this scene were in the movie. This American soldier was a hero who put his men up and brutally murdered these barbarians! But the Nazi Sergeant? Well, he's a Nazis and deserves to die for the cruel death, right? By chance, the Nazis felt the same for the Jews. See hypocrisy? Celebrating the Nazi butcher, we place ourselves on the same sadistic level. <br /> <br /> Main hypocrisy # 2: Nazis make a propaganda movie about a German sniper killing nearly 300 American soldiers. The film comes out at the end of the movie. Hitler and his cohorts are joyful when they watch the American soldier drop off the window and break into the fountain. The Nazis, as a soldier, are delighted with the sniper skill after the soldier falls. It should forgive American viewers of this scene. These evil Nazis are laughing at the death of our grandmothers! Well irony is it not what we did (or had to do) all the time we look at Inglorious Basterds? We laugh at the pain of others just because they were "bad guys". How would we feel when native Americans somehow made a hit film, where they pursue blood revenge against American settlers? Or what if black made a movie that respects Nat Turner's rebellion? Let's have enough hypocrisy shortcomings. <br /> <br /> I'll take the other reasons for the 1-star rating. 1) There were admirable signs throughout the film. Brad Pitt even tortures a woman by grabbing her finger on the wound because she suspects she will betray her. He's a good man? 2) Scenes are dragged longer than they needed. 3) Brad Pit's southern, allegedly Tennessee accent is HORRIBLE and thoroughly annoying throughout the movement. I finish now because I'm 700 words. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the population doesn't seem to think anymore, they just want blood. And that's why this movie got so high. I recommend this movie to the ignorant or if you are a Jew and just want to see a nice "fantasy justice." Personally, when I finally got out of the cinema, I felt that I had been scalped (or I would have had no more than 2 hours of mental rape).
