The animated live hybrid version of Gulliver's 1977 trips (or rather Travel, as he only gets as far as Lilliput) didn't get much excerpts and it's not too hard to see why. Michel Legrand comes up with some memorable stories, but they just inspire Lyric to Don Black: "One simple fact / Nobody here is suffering from growing pain". Richard Harris repeats his passion for excessive makeup, putting too much ground on the eyeliner at this time, trying to hide the fact that he is at least 25 years old, but at least he (perhaps inappropriately) reduces his vital tendencies resulting mainly from patronizing whispering. Belgian animation is just a bit better than French children's television, but Peter Hunt's film is not nearly as bad as it sounds? The animated character's actual model set reveals Max's and Dave Fleischer's 1939 version, while a few moments of the Swiftia satire remain - although it is definitely aimed at the youngest children.
