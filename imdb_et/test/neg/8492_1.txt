My wife received tickets for our family to attend the premiere of this movie for free. I only regret the price of the popcorn and its two hours wasted on this waste film. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed my original mask DVD and enjoyed it very much. I waited for the remake not to be close to the original in production values ​​or writing. But it wasn't ready for this vulgar trash. Weak functioning, a bad plot, a bad CGI-baby, passing through the gas and urinating in hypermascopic mode. My eight-year-old son loves movies like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Star Wars. After that I asked him what he thought. His exact words; "I hated it. It's like a movie by Scooby Doo. They take something good and have to put all these coarse things." My twelve-year-old daughter and wife hated it too. My wife later told me that my son would call him twice if we could leave. He has never done it before. I'm proud of her. Why do you think I have a certain degree of puritan, dances and laughter that I heard in the theater, I think most patrons agreed with me. <br /> <br /> This movie represents everything from bad children to entertainment today, and all positive reviews must come from people financially involved in the film.
