Klutzy's young man returns to West after having trained his business in Boston; She quickly learns to meet her friends in Spanish colonized Old California, waiting for her dead father's shoes - a romantic thief known for her female victims when they rob. In color, but silly, M-G-M has a lot of talent in front of and behind the camera, but it will never disappear. It may be a fun, second string for Abbott & Costello, but Frank Sinatra seems lost and embarrassed. The combination of heavy comedy and musical intermediates is hampered by poor performance (Sinatra is photographed at one point on the mirror, but does not focus so much on your performance that you notice when the odd symbol is reflected in this way!). Kathryn Grayson is the governor's daughter who falls to Frank, and her high soprano trilling makes singing scenes an independent parody. In addition to Robert Surtees' cinematography and decent art, this "Bandit" remains unchallenged. * from ****
