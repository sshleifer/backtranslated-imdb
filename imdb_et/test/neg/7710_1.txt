oh man to even start ..... <br /> <br /> fall down your weapon to get a hand to fight against the zombie, holding the bitten soldier down to shoot him with his b4. he rotates and bites a person who holds him, turning his "fallen" zombie, constantly shooting on his chest and seeing that it doesn't work, so they shoot the chest even more, taking the idea that the boy fell behind the table blood coming out of him from the mouth, it's okay, playing football like nothing is wrong, then suddenly noticing that the zombie football team is doing what's in the middle as they wouldn't have seen. ... <br /> <br /> I could go for a few more hours, but you get a point ..... childish writing and dialogue, bad directions, terrible special effects, really sad and undeveloped storyline (zombie infected campus, must get a virus host then lose it .... twice), the only plus i find it does not contain the actual game clips ring "action scenes" .... <br /> <br /> id say don't waste your money, but id needs to be more disturbed by the waste of time, i saw this cable and wanted 2 hours for my life
