This is perhaps the worst film I've ever seen. I gave him one letter just because it is the lowest possible score. Who thought the flood could ever be a good movie? The director and the cast should be ashamed and then fainted at me, so that all of this could be part of the Shamboo intimidation tactic. Only propaganda can be bad. <br /> <br /> The redeeming feature of Flood is that it is terrible and disgraceful that it is funny. If only the depth of the symbols was the same as the hope of the flood itself, then they will sound a bang of sound biting without an emotional response. <br /> <br /> The sad thing about this movie is that it could have been so much better, more informative, imaginative and tense. Flood is an amateur drink that is found in many recent British films, where more targeted use of resources would have made for better entertainment. <br /> <br /> Where was Smithee?
