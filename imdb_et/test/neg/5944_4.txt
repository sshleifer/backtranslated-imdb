Withdrawal: A band of five young American men, all who have been hit hard during World War II by the Ardenne attack, sending this task forward and looking for enemy action. They are both physically and mentally in a very poor condition and think they are nailed when their outpost is abandoned, but never in a mansion full of food. But after some time there is some enemy action and it is very strange. Not hostile, but odd. There seems to be a German team that is in an equally bad condition that doesn't want anything more than to give up. <br /> <br /> Comments: Based on the novel and my assumption that the novel is much better, but the story seems to fail to translate very well on the big screen. Indeed, it is a different war movie, much more about spiritual pressure during the war than fighting and fighting. But I can almost feel that scenes, which must be full of tension, full of uncertainty and unknown elements, just fall off in the film. It is not tense, simply different and in many ways absurd. How many times do people just act crazy and the reasons are unclear or at best hinted. <br /> <br /> So when this spiritual pressure does not come through, I thought the whole story was over. It wasn't good, it wasn't interesting, it didn't leave me on the edge and it didn't really send the message. In fact, it did nothing. <br /> <br /> Cast is interesting, many young actors who then became stars at the beginning of their career. Action is good, but not a star, and some characters also fell into the absurd zone. Much of this I feel, too, because this story, these characters, need time, space and pace given in the novel that they can't be given here. And half-way definitely isn't good enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
