Unfortunately, it is not as good as any other film that Jim Carrey (producing and starring) and Brian Grazer have worked with, but it is definitely worth laughing. Basically, Dick Harper (Carrey) thinks he's being promoted to a better job. Until the Dynocorpe company sinks and closes. Now Dick and his wife Jane (TÃ©a Leon) and their son are naturally in the money. Whatever they try, they can't raise the money they really want. So they're gonna take a couple of places to rob. And then they decide to rob Dick's boyfriend, his former boss Jack McAllister (Alec Baldwin). I think the most ridiculous bits are when Carrey is in the elevator singing "I believe I can fly" and a bit when he links someone in robbery and speaks with a voice changer (he sounds like a crap robot). Okay!
