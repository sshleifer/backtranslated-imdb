The script of this movie is indistinguishable from others, especially The Core, another bad film. It is quite clear why Luke Perry doesn't get a lot of work, but Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) left something that is just sad to see a beloved leader. <br /> <br /> I really don't think of a plot twist that is not a few miles away. It's not an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> Special effects are very bad even on TV standards. The stage's stream started at the beginning of the film, signaling a future global catastrophe, things start at a very hobby level. And that is no longer better than that.
