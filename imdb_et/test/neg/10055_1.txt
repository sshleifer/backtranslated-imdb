Veteran-TV director Ted Post treats us to the burning, confusing, and ultimately meaningless story raised in the B-column of Harold Robbins' big books book. Featuring a stylish Phoenix silhouette, Charlies Angles Jaclyn Smith takes the "woman whose eyes are mysteriously hidden all the time", while JFK's transformer James Franciscus is around the cabin. <br /> <br /> Mannix goes west, monkeys are abused, classic car models are modeled and Sybil Danning is constantly refreshing until the giallo-style wrapping brings the whole excuse for the bitter end. > <br /> Yes, and Bob Mitchum is there. Nowhere.
