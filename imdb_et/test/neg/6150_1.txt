MOST IMPORTANT I can say that I remember it as a 16-year-old boy in the cinema (see how it remembers painfully). Mark Hamill was the older generation of Skywalker and it wasn't great at it, he was worse than that. Plus, there is a dim sound made by Jericho AAAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHHHH. One cinema is as bad as I saw in the cinema Arthur 2 cinema. Funny, how is this question "What is the worst movie?" is easier than "what is the best movie?" Finding Nemo, Pirates of the Caribbean and Moulin Rouge, which also varies from Italian work (original), untouchables, casino, things to do in Denver, Goodfellas (get the meaning of what I like?)! Please never watch this movie or it will remain in your memory!
