One of the last living horror screens - Conrad Radzoff - dies and his body is placed in a mausoleum where cuts made by TV on the big Conrad before death are greeted by visiting you. Unfortunately, for her and her prisoners, the body of Conrad has "borrowed" the gangs of four boys and three girls and was taken to a large mansion where they drink with him, roast him, dance with him, laugh and laugh with him, and then put him in bed, which just happens in the room upstairs. The lost body news reaches the Radzoff widow and his friend (who happens to be a magician) and has some kind of ceremony that brings Conrad back to life so he can "keep an eye out for the tooth tooth." Well, Frightmare is interesting " bad "movie. Of course, it's cheap. Sets look like they were borrowed (which I'm sure they were). Special effects and blood and courage are done freely and with little confidence. The action is, on average, below average with some exceptions. Jeffrey Combs of Re-Animator has been drawn to fame, but in fact, in this rather ungrateful role, he makes an obsession with fear, which must steal the body of a dead person. None of the "kids" except the real girl who plays Megi is good. Nita Talbot plays with "Radzoff" friend "with a nervous interest. Also look for the big-i mean big-guy who's playing the police. This is Porky himself in Porkys fame. But fortunately we all get one presentation above the material. Ferdy Mayne, an unnoticed German actor with the characteristics of Christopher Lee and who was a vampire of Vampire Vampire Killers, is doing more than a commendable job as an icon of an aging horror in public life and a real human demon in private life. Conrad Radzoff is a bad person in life who lives only for his own enjoyment and we see that he kills twice before he is even dead (obviously not at the other side at this point). Mayne can look very foolish, speaks very elegantly and carries a slight risk. If for some other reason you should not see your fear. I do; However, I believe that when they showed the Radzoff black and white staples that they used Christopher Lee's material (someone thought?). Anyway, one might think what will happen, and it really is: Radzoff goes out and goes after the children who disturbed his peace. Again, the formula is wrong and excessive. Most are anemic and the direction is so ridiculous. But Mayne gives good intuition at sea. Certainly it is worth a little peek. Watching Mayne during the opening of her mausoleum screens brought her lips smiling at any time.
