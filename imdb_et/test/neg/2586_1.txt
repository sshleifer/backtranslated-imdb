I saw this movie last night and came online just to see if others thought it was as terrible as I was. you're one of those people, good luck to you. But I'm a patient. I've enjoyed very long movies. But this was a torture exercise for me. <br /> <br /> I honestly thought it was one of those little irresistible movies and it was a style rather than a matter - but also a style that made me feel like tears in my hair. Pretty much something interesting about what happens in the movie is going on OFF-SCREEN. It's like a deliberate attempt to make a movie completely out of the way - the bits that are usually reserved for the deleted scenes of DVDs when they were shown to the public. <br /> <br /> Don't even end up knowing what the main character, Francois, is. I had no sympathy for any character in this movie except maybe a violinist and his goat, and an old man who believes that octopus live to 300 because they're really smart. Seriously I was glad when he cut Francois, who held a gun with his head. I felt so ripped when even his inevitable suicide turned out to be boring. <br /> <br /> And where was the editor? Also smoking opium? I swear I cried almost every time I had somewhat subordinated anything except maybe someone who wanted to go back and forth, and then the last scene ended very sharply and this would be LAST YEAR, and WE HAVE POSSIBLE HOW THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, and all were still SAME BLOODY clothes ....!?!?! ??? <br /> <br /> All in all, I liked it - great. But this review is meant to be an anti-awakening "love this movie when you love cinema", which I've posted here and elsewhere. (See? I hated the movie and I STILL contained a rather striking reference to its content!)
