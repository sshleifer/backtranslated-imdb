*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** What's going on here? <br /> <br /> Barbara Hershey, decisively unsexy - as if she had stolen her grandmother's backpack - puts convincing results as a woman who kills a man's wife has had an attitude of "self-defense" after forty-odd times in the ax. <br /> <br /> Like Lizzy Borden, she is acquitted, but the most convincing argument ever put on the jury by the allegedly innocent defendant I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Lizzy Borden took the ax and forty his father when he saw what he did - he asked for self-defense. <br /> <br /> I don't think this is to blame for unbelievable image screening and who has no choice but to release this movie out of 10 (which would have been lower, but with some good previous behavior) <br /> <br />
