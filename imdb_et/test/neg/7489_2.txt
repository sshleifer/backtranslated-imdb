I watched this movie on television last night, hoping for a realistic understanding of what could happen if there were some very transferable diseases. I was disappointed and I think the film was garbage. It didn't seem to me real. Some of the actions were terrible, especially in the hands of a doctor. He was about the worst I've seen. The whole thing was like CNN's 'worst case scenario'. Even the obligatory bits of interpersonal disaster movies didn't seem sincere. I've seen some catastrophic films, especially those weather conditions that are really so bad that they're fun. It's almost as bad, but it's not even amusing, it's annoying and boring.
