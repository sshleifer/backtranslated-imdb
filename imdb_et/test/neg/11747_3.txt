Do not be fooled into thinking that this is a remake, because during this year the New Age is based on an earlier film. This is not because it is useless to re-film. This is the director who has used the original camera script, which is similar to the "remake" of THE GET AWAY, a few years ago. The scenes are identical to the original, the dialogue is identical to the original, the corners of the camera are identical, no attempt is made to decorate or reorganize the original script (but, as we should be grateful to Van Sant, he is definitely not Hitchcock), maybe even right, saying that costumes can be the same because the private eye carries pork pies. Didn't they go out of fashion in the late 1960s? <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Avoid
