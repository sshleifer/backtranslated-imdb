I'm a fan of Judy Garland, Vincente Minnell, and Gene Kelly, but this movie was cold for me. I had been waiting for another American Minnell in Paris, so maybe I waited too much. <br /> <br /> The film was short with songs and short dance songs. I was impressed by the very expressionist Kelly dance like the Mococo ship. I was also impressed by Nicholas Brothers Be be Clown, too bad that the song was so annoying. I also liked Judy, who attacked Kelly with bric-a-brac. Check out Lorna Luft's autobiography for interesting information about this scene. <br /> <br /> Cole Porter is actually the most annoying song, especially Nina. Also Judy and Gene are constantly shouting like funny kids. <br /> <br /> The piece is thin - it is parallel to the musical course - but it is not recorded with impressive dance numbers or memorable songs. I suspect that the best parts of this movie were on the floor of the cutting room. Please, find a movie restorer, find these movies and show us what the movie might have been!
