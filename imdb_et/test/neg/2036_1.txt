There is a reason to call it a teen flick. From 100 possible points I would put it somewhere for teenagers. It is predictable, action is terrible, especially small roles, and above all it is superpredictable. The end is so good that I should have left early and maybe it would have passed. By the way, could you invite a man to lead a pervert? I bet if it really happened, somebody in my school would have said that. Finally, in a school where I grew up, even though there were over 1,000 students in the middle class, we could have chosen like Josie as a scam and we would have brought her out of the crowd. My last word is to save you time when you watch something better on television, such as stock quotes.
