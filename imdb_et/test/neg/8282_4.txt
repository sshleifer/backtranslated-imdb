First of all, I want to target a large and medium-sized finger to the Troma DVD distribution team, who were actually stupid enough to reveal the pivot-killer identity of this movie on the back of the cover! The synopsis simply mentions who is the person responsible for the massacre on the day of graduation, for Christ's sake! I don't care about how terrible or predictable it is in the 80s slippage; just mentioning who destroyed it all! So, if you buy a Troma double function that includes "Graduation Day" and "Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell", don't you? repeat DO NOT? turn the box around and read back! Watching a movie is already a painful experience, but reading the back would ruin everything. <br /> <br /> Like the real movie? Oh boy! Personally, I am a fan of the work of Herb Freed's film. Actually, I don't really know if I should admire him? All Herb movies are pretty bad and amateur, but at the same time you can say that her direction is sharp and full of good intentions! Unlike "Haunts" and "Beyond Evil", he followed the modern popular genre trend and tried to get into typical high school movies. Just to offer minimal originality, all victims of "End Day" are promising athletes and members of the same train from George Michel (fantastic name! I think Herb Freed is "Whami!" Fan). During the opening credit we are witnessing how a young girl dies dramatically in the field, moments after winning a 30-second running win. The debate about whether his coach and his teammates did not move too much of their physical boundaries has been raised, but one particular person goes a step further and begins to sadistically kill everything he deems responsible for Laura's death. With a demented little movie! The script must be one of the most controversial things I have ever seen, with plenty of red herring and sub-drawings that go absolutely anywhere and the sequences of death that are almost too cheesy for words! Football is dirty, others are decapitated absurdly with a big sword, and their most unpleasant ambush falls into the hidden bed of plaques! Herb focuses on both the ingenuity of the murders and the fast pace, so that he forgets the sub-tiles he'd previously introduced! For example, Laura's sister returns home from her military training and is likely to start investigating the circumstances of her death. But halfway through the movie, he doesn't usually appear in the movie. Girls' stepfather is also called a violent drunk, but this interesting dose is immediately ignored. Instead of carefully installed temporary and misleading red herring, disco-dance and roller-skating sequences are served and ?? of course ?? lots of pictures of 80 unpleasant chicks that remove their tops. Despite being very bad, "Ending Day" could count on the honorable pain! Christopher George ("Grizzly", "The City of the Living Dead") is a very demanding trainer, Carmen Argenziano ("If a stranger", "accused") briefly appears as a police detective investigating the increase in the number of missing teenagers and Michael Pataki ("Dead & Buried "The" Dracula Dog ") is a very entertaining part of the school's non-stress principle. With teenage beauty, Linnea Quigley and Vanna White. Heck, for some horror fans, the reason for the existence of these two women is already considered to be one of the most important slashers in the early 1980s. It's a stupid movie, but entertainment and laughter are guaranteed!
