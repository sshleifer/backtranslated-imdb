Maybe I can't get it right. I mean the movie. It doesn't make me happy or whatever I have to do. Maybe because of my mood. Anyway, this is a simple movie where kids have participants. Just admit that - all such films cannot pass through 4 out of 10 barriers that never remember who plays in the movie (for example, Antonio Banderas played in such films ... two or three of them don't remember the exact number). I am bored. I almost sleep just because the topic is both a clich√© and the actor's play was so predictable. But I'm sure my child loves this movie as he grows up ... Hey, I'm not a monster, I found some fun or good moments in the movie. The owls in the movie were so cute. Trick with painted police car windows and punches that a child got with a golf ball head ...
