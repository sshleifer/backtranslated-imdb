Just saw it on the opening night of the movie. I read some other user comments that made me look at it ... I have to say I wasn't impressed. I'm so impressive that I feel the need to write this comment to save some of your money. For people under the age of 13, it may be scary, but it was nothing for me. The climax was ridiculous and most of the audience left before the movie's resolution. Some emotional arguments between families were less convincing than sub-par alternating scenes. with a strong understanding of the plot. This movie is not worth the theaters.
