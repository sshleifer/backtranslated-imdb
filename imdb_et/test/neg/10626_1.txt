Great spoiler here: this movie is B! The! D! But enjoy it, it's good bad. <br /> <br /> Bugged is a movie you can't believe in dialogue, drawing and direction so unlikely that Uncle Ned's Carlsbad Cavern home video looks like an IMAX experience. Since it is a Troma flick, the tap has a lot of gross packages, but it is even quieter than usual. <br /> <br /> Most of the production money seems to have been purchased to buy soda and sandwiches for the cast and team. Stylish dialogue is best for immortals, "% @ # $! What was it?" which is second only to another, shouted, "Now what?" <br /> <br /> Ronald Armstrong, a writer / director, is a stranger to knowing how people act in a desperate situation. If one of your friends is found to have eaten grass / termite / chiapet alive, then Armstrong has survivors who make time for cute, but foolish, "Divine". While being caught, the divine baking oven produces a large amount of rat-poison / oatmeal mixture, stirring, smiling, mixing, smiling, never falling from the smoke dead. <br /> <br /> Killer bugs are as frightening as pi√±atas, which they resemble too closely. The implications for their transfer indeed include a quick drag between the tiles, pulling their feet off. <br /> <br /> Highlighting a movie would probably have been the blowing of the house, but they were either cash or never had any, so instead of even seeing a miniature, come to the flame, they just let the screen black (eat you heartily) ILMist). <br /> <br /> The cast is almost all black. How can NAACP consistently censor something really funny, such as Amos and Andy (which definitely represents signs that are not as similar as 99% of all white comedy tests), but says Nary looks something like Bugged. Well, this is the best thing they do not know about how this film is involved (as if it were played by any ethnic group, frankly). Before they put Kaboshi in Bugged, some friends would get together and get ready for Plan 9 of the Bug Exterminator.
