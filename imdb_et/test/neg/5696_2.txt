So it's a cosmos movie. But this is a small budget. You ask, "What are the consequences?" Impacts are sometimes good and sometimes really bad. I mean bad. And you know I started acting. <br /> <br /> Here is a story, but it's said what I think is the wrong order. I don't want the wrong queue in the Tarantino style. That means it is totally pointless. Most of this is about the mother (in the future, because you know it's sci-fi), as her daughter has said, which is mostly an exposition made in the narrative from the point of view of her daughter. Only after you have heard the first hour and heard Paul Darrow's voice as a computer, do you understand how much more persistent a narrative would have been if he read it. This narrative is so continuous and engaging that actors on the screen do not say the word in the first hour. <br /> <br /> Here's also a lesson for you and future filmmakers: if you don't do it in 2001 and want to do some activity (this one), please hire a good choreographer. Otherwise, your struggles will be well within BATTLESPACE. And note that the title contains the word "battle". <br /> <br /> I think it can be a classic scenario that tries to make a movie that is not based on anything but a concept. And some effects. My biggest surprise is that IMDb lists $ 1.8 million for this movie. If you compare it to PRIMER, which was better with a few thousand budgets, you will understand the low budget for making movies, that's the story. I didn't expect much - but I was still disappointed. Two out of ten stars.
