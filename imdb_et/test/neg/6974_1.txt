"Glen or Glenda" was Edward D. Wood Jr's first attempt to film. For this, he chose a theme close to his heart ... transvestism, the "art" of men who want to dress in women's clothing. In his endeavor, Wood tried to treat taboo to a large extent in 1953. Unfortunately, Wood had no budget and no skill to make a movie. <br /> <br /> The story opens with the Bela Prologue Lugos, which makes little sense and then moves to the discovery of the dead transvestite Glen / Glenda (Daniel Davis or Ed Wood). Inspector Warren (Lyle Talbot), with the help of psychiatrist Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell), tries to understand why he would like to live (and die) in this way. <br /> <br /> Glen is linked to Barbara Fuller) and doesn't want to talk to her about her obsession. And that's it. We see endless film footage made for road-landed soldiers on the highway, mixed with the same street along the wood, dressed in Glen or Glend and looking at women's clothes in the store window for a long time. The poor old Bela, who was happy and friendly with Wood, keeps the whole story over. I'm not 100% sure, but I think Bela scenes were added to her face after the film body was finished. <br /> <br /> Farrell, when Dr. Alton offers screen narration, also adds confusion to Lugosi's story. Lugosi says more, bevare, bevare ... take care, take care and take care of the tails of rebels and snails and puppies. <br /> <br /> The story also deals with a transvestite who has a successful sex change operation and tries to explain the difference between that person and Wood's character (s). The dream sequences are ridiculous. A good example is the wedding sequence where someone dresses as a devil. Wood also gives us an obvious rape scene where participants (?) Are fully dressed, but leave little imagination, risqu√© for 1953. <br /> <br /> This movie, along with Wood's other "classics", was so bad that they got the public by gold classics over the years. For this reason, they have survived so far.
