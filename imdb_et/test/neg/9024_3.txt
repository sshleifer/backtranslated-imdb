John Wayne's toughest worshipers will light up when they watch The Lawless Frontier. Even in the line-of-poverty studio, this is one of the steroids. <br /> <br /> Unusual For the West, we are a criminal who is a sex offender. Earl Dwire plays a white and Indian peninsula that doesn't explain why he's a Mexican, a hacked accent and everything. Dwire sounds like Frito Bandito's ad fame. <br /> <br /> He and his gang happen to be Gabby Hayes and his daughter Sheila Terry. They don't really have anything to rob, but Dwire just wants to apologize for Terry's robbery and his way with him. He hears he is in the store he has, and he and Hayes flee to the ranch. <br /> <br /> When they meet, John Wayne is on the bandit track. They also get into a very stupid sheriff who believes Wayne is one of the bandits. Again for reasons I can't quite think about. <br /> <br /> It was a difficult way to earn a living grinding of horse operas like those of the Duke. Fortunately, the better things were on the way.
