Well! Catherine Zeta Jones on the film. This is a television movie game. This is Thomas Hardy's novel. That's Catherine Zeta Jones. He is by far the only film that works better than my high school theater class. Oh yes, that's Clive Owen. I'm not British, so it means almost as much as Thomas Hardy's novel. Except he was in "The Bourne Identity" and I liked it. It almost wraps up all the people. It was really all. I get repetitive, but I like CZJ, so I missed it. The computer tells me I don't have 10 lines and I read them. I always think 11, but maybe I just don't like my style, but that's my opinion of the movie.
