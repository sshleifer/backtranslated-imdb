One of the worst films I've ever seen. When I tried to look at it, I had the flu and I was pretty open for meaningless entertainment. Unfortunately, it was too much. How, so many inseparable actors can be in one movie? This film makes porn look like a European film. The cast simply speaks of its lines without emotions; special thanks to Charlie Snows (Baldwin), who is soon-ex-spouse who talks about her divorce as we all talk about the weather. Just terrible (and funny). <br /> <br /> With many couples and friends, it can just turn into background entertainment and a couple of laughs like Ed Wood movies. The plot is a joke and soundtrack directly from the tiny soap opera. <br /> <br /> Hopefully no one will pay to watch this movie. <br /> <br />
