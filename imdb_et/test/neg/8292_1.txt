Although I have been a fan of Shatner for a long time (since we reviewed the Trek again at the beginning of the 1970s during dinner), I cannot think of a possible reason why he wanted to make this film for either personal development or commercial reasons. Did he lose his bet? <br /> <br /> Like a movie fan, I want to rate bad movies with great movies. But "Shoot or be shot" has no praise or funny bits, inadvertent or not. <br /> <br /> If not evaluated, there were no unfavorable scenes (flashing or leaving this nudity, cartoonish gunfire) "with endless bullet transfers", so one is convinced that the manufacturers just wanted to save the cost of MPAA It will make your cable little edited in 10 seconds. <br /> <br /> Of the eight people who were in the theater, four of them left in the middle, showing statements like "It's stupid" <br /> <br /> Shatner plays She escaped a mental patient who is forbidden to release because she sees herself as a screenwriter. The Examination Board captures her application "INSANE". There are some small sub-blocks that develop some secondary signs, but most often it's the whole movie. <br /> <br /> If you want 90 minutes on Shatner's "movie", see Instead, it's a lot better for a free movie.
