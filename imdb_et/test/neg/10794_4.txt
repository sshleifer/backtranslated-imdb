Camals Are Coming is a rather disappointing British comedy since 1934. I bought it because I like adventures in the desert and say it's drama. This is certainly not the case. <br /> <br /> This is a couple who leads Egypt to capture some of the drug traffickers in the desert. <br /> <br /> It would have been much better if it was done like a comedy instead of a drama that would shoot it a lot. Part of this is quite silly. There are some good action and location scenes next to it. <br /> <br /> Jack Hulbert is cast with Anna Lee for love. <br /> <br /> One view is enough for this movie. Generally disappointing. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 stars out of 5.
