I love the so-called "blaxploitation" movies and I've seen dozens. Some, such as COTTON, have HARLEM, SHAFT, and HAMMER, have excellent output values ​​and are very fun, while many others are very cheap and stupid, but still fun, like death or coffee. But DOLEMITE manages something rare for the genre - it's just cheap and stupid and no less fun! It's like blaxploitation made very, very stupid for people. <br /> <br /> Years ago, I saw the Dolemite movie "Mad TV" and unfortunately the real DOLEMITE is better. Like a parody, the actor is simply cruel. Rudy Ray Moore has all the balsa wood pieces and charisma. He can barely read his lines and his "karate" is a joke - his beat obviously missing the target over and over again. As for the rest of the participants, many may be even worse. My favorite was a FBI man who couldn't even remember his lines and really struggle to bring them out - but they didn't want to film those scenes again! In fact, so much of it was that I had a hard time understanding whether the movie was meant to be a joke. <br /> <br /> If you think that despite this terrible action and action, something worthwhile to see is wrong. Even for the perverts there, who hope to see the skin, are disappointed. The naked women in the movie really look like happy prostitutes and there is nothing sexy about their bodies. I think that watching old people naked - REEEAALLY old people naked - is no worse than watching these "ladies". And like Rudy Ray, he has a "male chest". No black super hero or hero should see this bad nude !! For the sake of prosperity, put your clothes on people and come up with a script that doesn't seem like it was written in winos! <br /> <br /> FYI - Obviously, it's actually followed by this movie! ! I can't imagine watching them, so you just have to find someone else who is watching them. I watched PLAN 9 OUTDOOR, EMPLOYEES, and ROBOT MONSTER, but I just don't think I can bring myself to another Dolemite movie - they're so bad!
