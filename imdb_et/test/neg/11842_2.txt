We all know that the world is full of malicious, hanging horror films. Some of them may be fun to watch because of stupidity, terrible effects and insecure dialogue. But the Raptor, who could have been in the same league as the same meaningless Carnosaur series, doesn't even enjoy ATTEMPT in that. It's so badly done that it's really intolerable, even if you just look at it with the intent of a non-brain day. Where do we start? Well ... the kits are pretty drab. My old drama group created more realistic stages. Genetic laboratories look like they are from the university and from the outside seemingly unbelievable (even if you put them close to civilization where people can easily hear dinosaurs), while doctors just don't. Look at all incredibly. In the following, the list of complaints contains the effects of beings; well what am I saying? Absolutely pathetic. I also think it is worth noting that a woman's tits should be mentioned. Both of the main female characters are so obviously boys' jobs and it brings down the characters, because one woman is a respected member of the police and the other is the sweet, "innocent" daughter of the sheriffs of the cities. However, acting is the worst tragedy. Eric Roberts can be excused at least for trying to give his role a bit. This is where it ends. Corbin Benson should have killed his costume designer to make his twilight result even more pathetic, while the female lead looks so boring (though, with this film you ended up). Another sign I emphasize is a daughter who lets her tits do everything that works in a "dirty" sex scene (ten minutes of endless recovery on her bump on a few blocks). <br /> <br /> All in all and together. don't worry, just take it.
