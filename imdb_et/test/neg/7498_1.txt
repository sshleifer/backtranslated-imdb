Hi all - For what it is worth, I am a doctoral student of Indonesian politics and returned to this semester after about a year of fieldwork, most of it in Jakarta. <br /> <br /> I'm a big movie fan in general so I went as often as I could and bought tons of local VCDs when I was there. That's what I saw in the theater because it was opened when I was there and fortunately closed immediately after that. <br /> <br /> Who was the target audience for this movie? Indonesian super-elite spoiled women and daughters whose antics are weak and inefficiently parade? Most Indonesians who never got a single cup in the central restaurant of the movie, not to mention the perfect meal, to afford? Or gay Indonesian men whose dilemma in the country's Muslim dominant society has been reduced to absurdly simple, respectful, self-proclaiming. <br /> <br /> If all this wasn't bad enough, the soundtrack was recorded or blamed so incorrectly that even native Indonesians didn't hear many lines. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are looking for a top-notch gay-themed movie from a region of the world that seems least likely to produce such an animal, forget about it. "Westler" from the beginning of the 80s or "My Beautiful Laundrette" from the same age succeeds in doing a much happier face when dealing with homophobia, showing that it is not talking about incessant, literal scenes. In general, it is a waste of unfortunate money in a country that still cannot educate and keep all its children healthy.
