The main part of this light musical story lies in the fictional Midwick College, which is attended by Peter Kendricks (Peter Lind Hayes) because of the size of the acting actor Grace Hayes, his actual mother who plays the same role here. Give your love of interest through your secretary, Mary (Healy), who is her real wife. This film has succeeded in a weak scenario and is further hampered by overcutting and poor editing, this movie provides eight songs, including title numbers, fortunes, and has a good soprano Healy, owner of Benny Rubin's snack shop, and dynamic tap dancing with Roland Dupree.
