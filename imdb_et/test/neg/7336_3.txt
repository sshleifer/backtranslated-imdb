First, let me mention the fact that, despite its title ("Stories", plural), only ONE Kitchen Story is. Isak died or not, I'm not so sure, because in one of the last scenes, HIS PIPE is on the table next to two cups. There is a reference to Tati on the DVD cover. He argues that the film is "très drôle: rappelle Tati!" ("Very funny: reminiscent of Tati!". Large Jacques Tati relied mainly on mime and silent body attitude to achieve his comic effects and offer his critically satirical views of his 1950s. French "modern" society, of course, "kitchen" in the 1950s and it offers some (rather weak) satirical references to the absurdities of bureaucracy and some long moments where words are not spoken - but they are All these small details are big enough to make "Kitchen" «Tatiesque» movie? That being said, I have to admit that "Kitchen" sometimes deals with the false objectivity of scientific research "truth" Human subjective emotions Overall, the film was agonizingly slow, but nothing happened - hardly any "dramatic impulse": the parts involved were created within the first 15 minutes and last ha If the hour or so, the last segment was - CLOSE U !!! - interesting and touching, it may seem like it was a short topic, less than an hour, reaching about 90 minutes unreasonably. Now, from the reconstruction (the "scientific" observation of the individual men's behavior in their kitchen): At first it seemed very promising - when taking out the results of Bachelor studies in their kitchen as a tool to determine which new inventions would be most useful. But very soon, this premise became a prologue, an "excuse" to introduce a real theme that was only fully developed and concerned loneliness and an invaluable bond of friendship. Damage! I wanted to honestly like this kind of movie. Yes, it seemed so promising when I heard some of his unusual small anecdotes that were really there and what I enjoyed - like burning a man's nose hair (instead of cutting scissors), "investing" in storing a large number of "valuable" black pepper in the garden , the role of the return (observed to become an observer), the man's mouth radiates radio broadcast sounds. The sick horse is also becoming a catalyst for human despair, the importance of driving the right or left passenger car in Sweden and Norway (reflecting how important it is for those very close neighbors to affirm their individuality?). Am I the only person not to enjoy this movie completely? Does this necessarily mean I am wrong? Maybe it is usually "fine points" that really were "too fine" for me? Maybe ... Do my individual views on this film ironically reflect the very nature of the film itself - what would be very important to have the right to differ, to affirm its individuality and not to follow blindly the trends and opinions of society? Each of us has the right to have different personal attitudes and not to be a slave to "dictatorial" demands for our bread struggle: often we also have other alternatives that would allow us all to benefit our society while respecting our internal principles. In short, being in relation to yourself - so in this film Folke (Isak's "scientific observer") finishes his work, preferring to leave his new friend Isaki's house and helping his farm with the tasks ... And so, "Vive la différence" as say French!
