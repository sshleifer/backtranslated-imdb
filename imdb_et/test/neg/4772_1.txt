Ruins are in Tourist, because Deep Impact was a worse version of Armageddon, a worse entertainment movie. One character should be in a medical school, so why are they all slowing down? "you can't continue cutting." - The best film makes up this movie. It's a terrible movie. I like horror movies, but I fully appreciate that most of them are terrible, but they had many hopes for this movie after seeing IMDb reviews. The situation where they are is stupid and how they manage it. It's terrible, one thing that makes it somewhat delicious is its cool Australian background, even though they spend most of the movie in one place.
