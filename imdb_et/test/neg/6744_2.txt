For me, it just didn't seem like GI Joe at all. When I looked at it as a child, I just don't care about it. In fact, the part that I liked most was the opening credit. They change so many facts and change the story. The Cobra commander is said to be part of this stupid foolish race in Antarctica or somewhere that is frozen. Although I always thought he was a normal man, every time they saw his eyes in the series, they were surrounded by normal color and not blue on his face. There's just too much nonsense to try and make this impressive movie, but for me it just hides what I was watching.
