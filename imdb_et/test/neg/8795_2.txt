<br /> <br /> Make it short and cute: I hope this movie will not be considered American "Making Asia". acting was sub-par, based on stereotypes, voices raised, and exaggerated eye shadow to convey his message. Chris Chan Park does not dig deep into his symbols, allowing them to remain a caricature of angry / disappointed / distant / non-communicative Asians. these images do not mean that the characters are mysteriously attractive; it makes them confused and uncomfortable. I think our Asians are more complicated about it. <br /> <br /> I didn't come out of the movie. is not convinced that these characters had a lifetime, blood-brother as related to each other in order to help their friends. is not convinced that there was something about his seemingly superficial attraction in the main week. is not convinced that working immigrant parents do not pay for their son's college education. is not convinced that all the characters were even necessary, ie: a line that is put on the bed on the back of the car and is forgotten quickly. <br /> <br /> The story I actually thought was not allowed to come in two separate ways: 1) flat characters I had no compassion / affinity, 2) nonsense, non-sequential scenes, such as seance / donut a sequence with an amy mountain that was just ridiculous and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> I commend my efforts for parking because I am sure that it took a lot of hard work to produce a movie, and I will even give it some doubts during a time as a novice director / screenwriter, but I sincerely hope the next it goes a little deeper. just because the film is one of the first kind of Korean American experiences does not mean that it is automatically good.
