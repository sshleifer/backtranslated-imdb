I'm not telling the story of the movie, as some people do. I'm pretty sure people who read it know what the stories are. I'm not going to go any further and anything that is wrong with this movie because I'm here when I do it. The story is typical and special effects are lower than today's standards. This is not a movie you should look at if you are a serious movie buff (since most of us here are) little things annoy you with the whole movie and destroy the experience. If your casual film reviewer, who likes a good time while watching a trap, this movie will suit you, fun. It would also be a good movie to involve a partner. Just not for us movie buffers. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 10
