Great concept, perfect characterization and voices, but a complete waste of time. The real shame, if it was directed higher, would not have been the bomb it was (is); too dependent on scatological humor, starters. I am surprised by the comments of "educated" reviewers, who refer to "good science" to this beak behind the trash. Unlike "Finding Nemo", where (with a little incredible stop) attention was paid to the details and science was as good as the context allowed, "Osmosis Jones" was totally meaningless; don't let yourself be out of science. Humor is aimed at people over the age of eighty, but is more suitable for some more sophisticated teenagers.
