I wanted to like this movie. In the second film of the series, it was stupid, in the movie, that it was fun (of course I was drunk). I watched this film, which had the greatest expectation of a similar high cinematic fun, a-la-Mystery Science Theater 3000 experience. This movie is a godly waste of movies, and I liked another one !!!! From feminine stools to David Bowie's fearsome wig, sticky, unpleasant women laughing, who could paint off the garage door, this whole thing was just a painful mess. In fact, I felt bad about Sue Price because the material was under his nature actor (it says pretty much). Terrible, terrible movie (this is not a recommendation).
