This espionage melodrama has a nice, almost promising cast and it should have been very obvious; is the will or the will of the atmosphere and also the desire or lack of it. <br /> <br /> Sheen plays a dissident who now activates as an agent, she is lonely, women love but naughty; Mrs Fossey is her lover. Neill plays a galantic, generous and stupid Soviet representative. <br /> <br /> Sheen and Neill are both annoying; Finlay is making a comet and so are other well-known actors. Mrs Fossey is hot; but then again he is always. <br /> <br /> Am I your real friend and break it for you? Flick is a little tense and excited, it's fine and boring; the good thing is that you see Mrs. Fossey naked. In addition, the use of espionage of mild derivatives.
