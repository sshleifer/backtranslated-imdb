This is one of the films that killed "spaghetti" west. Not only does it disappear in translation, it is also a complete chaotic editing. Both are edited and edited for the English version. In any case, it is little or no reason, period. This makes the "Trinity" and Eastwood "Man With No Name" movies much like John Ford / John Wayne. Nothing in this movie is original. Nowhere is the beginning, the middle and the (end) end. Except for the end, not everything is in that order. Robert Wood seems satisfied enough. The rest of the majority, especially women, should have made better career choices.
