Don't rent this movie. Finally, I bought a previously viewed tape for $ 4.00. It was close to the rent, so I thought I could buy it. I will do this after completing this review. The film that marks Lowet is a music video with little dialogue, slow motion, and poorly edited. I thought I could see an insane activity that I wanted to see, I didn't even get it. This film is a practice of slow moving techniques, no script, close-ups, terrible editing and poorly developed plot. I can't believe it really ends with a scene where they think viewers care about the characters. At the end of the movie, we still don't know who they are. Believe in hype, stay away.
