Too bad Mike Meyers chose this dramatic debut. This film looks like what the committee did, which could not decide whether it was comedy, drama, mid-term or sci-fi. It starts out as playful, it quickly becomes darker and then finally, probably soon after one of the main characters has been killed, stands in the back of the whole family, who laughs at something. It's strange and impossible to put a string together. The action is extremely uneven, the older professionals pay attention to you and the younger and less experienced actors who look like they are in high school. This movie showed me that it's probably harder to make a good movie when it comes from the truly professional price we see in the first and art house. This would be a good movie for analyzing the film class. The plot, character, theme, consistency - all of these are either wrong or missing from the movie.
