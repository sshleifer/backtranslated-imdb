I'm afraid that this adjustment didn't like it. When I started to look at it, I had a nice feeling of watching 70's TV shows because of the filter and the musical score. I didn't like the end scene. Mr Tilney seems to be dressed only in his vest. Jane Austen would never have a gentleman. Manufacturers seem to have made a modern interpretation of the romantic dream of girls. I appreciate more modern AND adaptations that show the eyes of those details that make the BBC series so valuable. Unfortunately, I look forward to the 2007 adjustment. I hope this is better and shows the benefits of 20 years of Jane Austen's adjustments.
