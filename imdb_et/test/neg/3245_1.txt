Once you've seen this movie, you know it's one of the worst Bollywood movies. Bollywood is known for copying Hollywood movies. Who would know that they are copying the Terminator 2. The difference between both film industries is Hollywood Millions and Bollywood spends 100 thousand (average). This is the problem with this movie, if you want to make a T2-style movie, do it right. The director added a fake fantasy page about a transformed snake who finds her long lost girl (at last birth) by 2 boys, but guilty of 10 people. He suddenly reincarnates into a ghost and together they want to kill 10 people they blame for death. Not to mention, a reincarnated snake man or villain is a super power. He can make a difference, he can fly, disappear, fire, wind power, you call it, he is. He even experiences the T1000 style. You probably don't know how he lives. its best not to ask and its best not to waste time and money on this movie. His best just to forget this movie even came out. I think it's shameful to use such an outrageous movie with a meaningless story.
