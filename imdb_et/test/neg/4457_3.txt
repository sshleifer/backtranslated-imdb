Proof of evidence that Hammer should have left his vampires firmly in the Victorian age. After all, vampireism is all repressed sexuality, so the concept is not insignificant in London in 1972, thirty things that pretended to be dirty teenagers. <br /> <br /> Remember that Hammer was badly paralyzed by this time. The public was tired of the fear of the drawing room of the 1950s and '60s, so the studio was trying to bring them all back, including a lot of nudity (LUST FOR A VAMPIRE, and al) and the renewal of their characters - neither of them probably worked in Hammer, it was just two years later in the grave. Shame ... <br /> <br /> But I still have a great affection for the classical Hammer period 1957-1965.
