Science Fiction Channel (Sci-Fi Channel) films have become boringly predictable. It looks like a low budget, originality and plot. <br /> <br /> In this creative work, the government is ready to get a lot of telemetry and recruit poor souls to help. There have been many recycled revolutions on the evil government organization. Black coats, shadows, short meaningless lines make these one-dimensional cartoons. <br /> <br /> Daniel Dae Kim plays a small role as a good actor. He brings the role of his angel to the role a bit. It's hard to miss the connection that his "Crusade" character was a telepathy, and that is a telemetry film. Was it a Sci-Fi election movement to try and show fans of the second show? Who knows. Fortunately, he is a decent actor and a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Film is definitely a low budget. This reflects the current Canadian location model of Sci-Fi channels, little-known signs, little effect, and disgraceful plot and character development. You might think they believe that science fiction fans will see something like "scifi". <br /> <br /> If you want a good telecine film, see "Fury" (1978).
