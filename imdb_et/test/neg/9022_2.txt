This is probably Wayne's poorest film; at least the poorest, where he played a major role. It's just very bad. Editing is especially terrible; it really seems that the editor (if it was) literally raised the pieces of the film from the floor and stuck them together. Opening must be considered credible. John Wayne has to be every time it was mentioned! I know there are "B" films, but are "H" movies? If so, this is an example. And I say this to a dedicated JW fan.
