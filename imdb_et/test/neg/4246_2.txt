Hope Floats with Sandra Bullock is a real disappointment. The story begins ok. Her husband deceives her and she discovers this country on television. So he has to restore his life. Here could have been an interesting or story line, but you get so bored with it. He moves back with his parents and Harry Connick Jr., who plays Justin, will hit him. These two have no real chemistry at all, but you should get the impression that Justin loves him. The movie ends as you see it, but you want it to end like every other one. They had a good start with this film and could have made it something traceable, but the movie you definitely want to leave.
