I turned it off in about 50 minutes! Whoever was the hero who decided to steal the idea of ​​the Koushun Takam Book (Battle Royal) and make it a pathetic TV show deserves to be shot! <br /> <br /> This has made the film industry a good move though. Now, directors like William Malone (Fear Dot Com) say "at least it's better than the 7th series" This piece and Dracula 3000 necktie first place in the worst 100 films! <br /> <br /> A warning that it's not so bad it's good! <br /> <br /> It's shameful for filmmakers everywhere! <br /> <br /> Never see this movie!
