It's an early morning of our dissatisfaction and some of my friends, and I've just looked at "Wind." Really a disaster movie. Not in terms of natural forces that harm the unsuspecting population, but rather a terrifying film that harms the unsuspecting audience. To give you an indication of how this bomb is cumbersome, I will give you an example mentioned during my first painful viewing. If you want to watch this movie a second time and say, cooking yourself, I'm afraid to say that the choice would not be immediate. But instead of just "ad peliculam" being tempted by a single liner, I know exactly why my friends and I made this particular movie. <br /> <br /> To start this, I like the low budget horrors. I even like an artistic, low-budget horror shot. I liked "Cold Hearts", "Midwives", "Jugular Wine", etc. Movies that were ambitious and courageous, even if they lacked the value of production, performance, and even action. In general, an interesting assumption, unusual camera technique, or just a well-made scene, or two recorded movies that are a little rough on the edges. With that in mind, I would like to say finally that I hated the wind. The film was probably the most disappointing in the sense that it was an incredibly frustrating look. From the main characters' activities to the flow of the plot (?) To the big portals hinted at by the opening that eventually caught the dust (and not even logically confirming what appeared in the rest of the film) and left the viewer, waiting for more, feeling much. The dialogue was, at best, spotty, delivered from wood and completely unreal. By this I mean that no one in any situation where the characters were, would have reacted to the way the characters did, or the things they said in the way they said. There was an obvious vision and direction that would have corrected this problem. <br /> <br /> The interaction and development of characters was exhausting. Claire, "lambent sex goddess," or so aggravating, passive-aggressive films thought about the movie, were so manipulative so public that she could also pull the gun characters. However, he was a bright spot on the film. The other main characters (except Mick's Milfy's mother, who was not terrible) are so vague that they can be imagined by the same actor. Let's see if I missed anything: border personality, companions of sexual confusion and inadequacy, encouraging joyful rage through loose sliding bimbette-sudden-and-unmasterfully-Caligar involuntary orchestrations. No, I think it's covering it. <br /> <br /> There was also no problem. How did the authors of the film assume that the casual viewer would say that this was the beginning of the fiftieth (well, what you would call) the beginning of the world of this amateur, incredible, poorly portrayed lust. largely in the woods in the middle of the middle? There were no witnesses to "freedoms". There were no witnesses in this movie. <br /> <br /> The inconvenience problems due to lack of attention to detail were common even when the plot starts. Case-by-case: if this guy Bob took this route through the woods to reach the home of the gym, and here's the key, **** every day ****, it's a good chance someone else would have been around to get something later see criminals violently claiming a crime scene. One might think that with the murder of a young man in the forest, the city would have been resurrected, the characters would have been questioned, etc. cabinet psychopath with internal monologue). We also recommend the absence of film witnesses *. <br /> <br /> As for quasi-homosexual strikes, I have no problems with them. It is not as if they came as a surprise given that we were screaming so that most male characters are after the scene. Again, it is not problematic and in itself, but is thrown for the wrong reasons. It was completely unnecessary, it was cast for the value of "pure" shock and / or "dangerous art" and was neither shocking nor dangerously artistic from any point of view. Instead, it was an uncomfortable test of a boring, clumsy film of a boring, clumsy plot. Poorly hinted at the sexual tension that was implied only by severely strangling to wait for this unpleasant bright scene, the film only pushed it down from the "mediocrity that promised criticism" to "suck so bad that it had no natural grace to suck enough to mock and eat right. "<br /> <br /> So it is with most movies, a lot of artistic wilting, very little meat and a lot of aggravation. It's not that we can't. We got it. We just don't want it. Look, the fact that we were the only * table in joyful graduation theses that was meaningful to her, is a sign that something was terribly wrong about this movie. Instead of moving fast, as the name suggests, this movie quietly moved forward like a sweat trail that works so your hands are full of nose. Argh. This feeling is pretty well summarized when the train wreck is being murdered. In this film, there is no breath of fresh air, but a slow miasma of bad ideas, which has been poorly realized, beat before reaching.
