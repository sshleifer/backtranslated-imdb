Poorly acted, poorly written and poorly targeted. Special effects are cheap. The best result is Yvette Napir, but it doesn't speak much. The story is a confusing confusion about the greed of the company, leading to the sabotage of the space station and the attempt to rescue those who are left on board. <br /> <br /> There's little tension and even less action. There's one car chase that's not bad, but the rest of the movie is just a waste of time.
