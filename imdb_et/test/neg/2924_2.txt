"Talk Radio" most remarkable is how bad it is. All callers' voices have a fake, reading-script ring. The night where annoying loudmouth is in Dallas radio station is spoken of in Sartrea's glimpse into hell. Stone strives for existential revelation and instead receives involuntary comedy. Each time a caller does something about an "empty" point, the Stone will pull the face of one's character as they have suffered some traumatic realization that will not be released to the public. Bogosian ever moves over all the celluloids in irritated performances. The underlined classic? Leave me alone.
