this movie is so incredibly terrible! all this was garbage. you can't say anything good about this movie, actors, scripts, management, effects are all just as bad as each other. even ed wood could have done better. I seriously suggested not to miss this movie if you don't want to waste about 100 minutes of your life or how long the movie was. I forget. this is the first time I wrote a comment on the IMDb movie, but this movie was just on television and I had to give the movie to the world of lover that the movie was sucking balls !!!!!!!!!!!! so if you have some firmness. go and rent a much better bad movie like critters 3
