Drab, tough and a waste of time. The plot is incomprehensible (so don't think too much). The actor is strange and wooden - I would have sworn that they were all professional bodybuilders trying to work happiness, but it could be an insult to bodybuilders. There are no interesting special effects to redeem this catastrophe, but many fires, explosions, free sex, etc. The only thing that drew my attention was that it happened after the war between the US and Iraq, which somehow goes to the core. ..hmmm. Is Roger Corman Psychic? We hope that "Iraq" was just a happy choice for Corman and that the rest of his scenario was not fulfilled. <br /> <br />
