I was so waiting for this movie that I really don't understand how I have the impression that I have that impression. I'm afraid it's really a horrible festival - every patron of every movie I went through was often shot and filmed during the movie. It's a shame, because it's a fantastic story - I tend to think it's more readable. This is not a basic sign that only shows the teeth once - and that was because of the angle of the camera. As the story unfolds, it is easier to understand the dilemmas of the main character. However, the intense treatment and drama that could have made it a truly top-notch film has been dulled. Dull as a half-burned documentary!
