Isn't it strange how crap movies tend to be a little better when you look at them, "boy, it sucks harder than some things are ever sucked"? Is it pretty much impossible for anyone to rent this movie? or even far from positive - expectations, because "House of Death 2" is a follow-up to what is generally considered to be one of the worst catastrophe of the worst. For the original Michael Hurst, the poor reputation of the original was a great advantage, as exceeding the quality of its predecessor was very easy. And exactly how embarrassing it must be for Uwe Boll, huh? Having admitted that the result of direct video without the power or advertising campaigns is much better than its own pretentious interpretation of video games? If anyone still doubts: NO, "Death House 2: Dead Purpose" is not at all a good horror movie, but YES: it is definitely better than the first and even worth renting if you are looking for an unwanted spraying film with a murderous, sloppy and stupid humor. The first film's events have no real connection (second advantage) and this second part opens up as a typical dirty sex comedy on the college campus. The Male Brotherhood Club plans to attack a corporate house where only big breasts live, but the party breaks down as a crazy professor (Sid Haig!) Who drives his car with a girl and takes her back to his laboratory as a zombie. It is the beginning of a rapidly spreading and deadly epidemic, but it does not worry, because the government is ready and sends its best scientists and soldiers to the campus to look for survivors and bring back blood samples as an antidote. Hunting the zombies on this squadron seems to be the most common thing in the world, they even called them Hyper Sapiens, but their ever-increasing amount endangers the lives of the most toughened soldiers. Luckily, director Hurst found his inspiration for the more outstanding classics of the genre, such as James Cameron's "Aliens" and ?? of course - George A. Romero's dead trilogy, especially "dead day". Luckily he did not make the same mistakes as Uwe Boll, who in his movie entered video footage from the actual video game (why?!?) And * slightly * exaggerated the use of CGI techniques. HotD 2 contains heavy images of violence, such as chopped female bodies and detailed amputations, but it never becomes nausea or shocking. Of course, there is no tension here to enjoy and every terrible horror. The film is very enjoyable when the story of writer Mark Altman does not try to explain the origin of zombie epidemics. They go to the corpses with their brains hanging on their skull, so we don't really need to know what caused their death. Not particularly when the explanations are given by a blonde corporate bitch who has obviously not understood what all the medical terms mean. Just keep bitten, sweetheart.
