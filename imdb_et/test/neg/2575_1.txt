Forget about the fact that most people are waiting for a movie in Seagal. This movie had no content. Very long, drawn and boring. The scenes were much longer than they should have been - the camera would often focus on something long if nothing happened. Treat insomnia. The worst Seagal movie from afar (like some of his other movies). 1/10
