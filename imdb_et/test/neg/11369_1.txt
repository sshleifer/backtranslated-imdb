If you thought NBC 10.5 was stupid, you'll be happy to hear that FX reached the gut of hell on television and slipped its fingers to the pseudo post-9/11 poop. Not only was it stupid, it was a total of 24 looting and bad ripoff. The filming style was now an exaggerated "docu-action" look, which, combined with the cereal B & W "rawcore" footage. I'm not quite sure what that means, but it certainly seems that DP told the director before filming. I don't know what they're doing here, but reminded me of a man in the office who thinks Powerpoint's "fly-ins" and "animations" are "cool". <br /> <br /> The story is that 6 "terrorists" take over the South CA nuclear power plant. That's right, nuclear power plants with hundreds of people working in ying-yang. For the sake of reality, they put two non-working CHiPpi in the mix. Because they can stop 6 people, right? Six. I mean, even Bruce Will had to deal with more terrorists in this stupid Nakatomi building. <br /> <br /> Leslie Hope (TV Teri Bauer) plays a co-producer who has trouble talking to the phone after she has put a bulletproof vest in her. His voice sounds like Sally Struther's TV commercial that is bright and monotonous. His character is only a plot device and he is immediately destroyed after one small commitment. Yes, Teri Bauer is dead! <br /> <br /> Bruce Greenwood stars like FBI S.A.C. Tom Shea, who constantly points out how he sees the face of foreign diplomats. His boss is out, so no one in the Department of Homeland Security believes in his prediction. He is a sensible one of the paranoid officials who are afraid of any kind of disaster. He's calm, he's strong, he's bored. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing redeeming or entertaining about Meltdon - OK, maybe Teri Bauer died was quite unnecessary and funny - nothing else, nothing.
