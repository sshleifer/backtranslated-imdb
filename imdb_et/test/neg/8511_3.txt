I was still a photographer who worked in Europe in the summer when Jim Salter shot "Three". <br /> <br /> I made some swelling images for him, one of which got me a poster for the movie. I didn't see the movie until years later. I thought it was bad. It is a pity because the elements that came into it were compelling. Robie Porter's girlfriend was as beautiful as Rampling himself. Salter asked if I wanted to stick and be a camera player so they didn't have to shoot every two times. I said for sure, but I have to go back to NY, letting me come back. Unfortunately, I never got back. One of the irrelevant melodies. <br /> <br /> I wish I could post some pictures taken somewhere. <br /> <br /> Rowland Scherman
