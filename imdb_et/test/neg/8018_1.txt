Thomas Hardy is one of my favorite authors. His novels have made some really wonderful films ("Far from Madding's crowd", "Tess of D'Urberville", "Mayor of Casterbridge") and I had great hopes for it. The Hallmark-Hall-Of-Of-Of-Fame-When Meaning "Native Return" completely destroyed it. The cast was amazing, photography was great, but the script was weak and the direction worsened. People walked to people, said the line, walked. Little excitement arose when Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones (very young, very beautiful) exchanged a bit of muscle press, but even Clive, who is a great actor, couldn't save it. It was the usual background music of Hallmark's "romantic" string and pretended to offer the plot exposure, and what might have been dynamite turned out to be terrible. The richness of the three films mentioned above was completely inadequate.
