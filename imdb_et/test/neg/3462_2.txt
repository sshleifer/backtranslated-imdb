OK, where do I start? I saw a few weeks ago screening and was shocked at how bad this film is. Of course, if you just love Beverly Hillbillies and green acres (bad actors) and think they are the best TV shows in the air, you will definitely love this movie. Personally, I like George's work and he is very talented, but comedy is not his forte. Some people are natural in comedy and I'm sure he's personally personally working and funny, but comedy he won't let on the big screen. It was a lovely movie, but would I pay it $ 12.00? H&LL not !!!! Now that I saw it, I wouldn't want to spend that money on anyone. George, friend, I love you, but please don't do more comedies? This script is missing, a big concept but just didn't do it.
