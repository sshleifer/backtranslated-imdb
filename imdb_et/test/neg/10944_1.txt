Most people get to know the luxury of writing a movie title and watching a movie before watching it, but unfortunately I've never been one of those people. I wouldn't even read a synopsis for fear of spoilers, but there are two sides to it, because if you ignore such warnings and even give the film a chance after floping in theaters, you enter your risk and you can just end up with a bad taste that is exactly what I feel stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the only thing that is good about Shakalaka-Crap-Crap is some songs (and seriously, except for the title track). Even the most promising talent of Kangana Renaud (Metro, Gangster, Woh Lamhe) is seriously wasted here when she plays Ruhi, a woman who has earned the attention of both the leading male characters Bobby Deoli (who plays AJ as a music producer without roots) and Upen Patel (who plays Reggi, an upcoming artist who crosses AJ's way). Celina Jaitley offers the right amount of OOMPH required from a social worker hit by the Region (whom she helped to get on the record industry door). It doesn't sound like a mix or movie that should contain Anupam Kheri? Well, you are wrong, because he's like Reggi's father (another wasteful talent). <br /> <br /> The film may not be so bad that they wouldn't have written Deoli's character. The moral message was too preaching (vengeance was deadly on the dark side) and the end was too unsatisfactory to make you think about why you were sitting on such a stupid movie. Truly, this is a revelation of crap.
