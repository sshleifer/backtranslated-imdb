Looking at the first moments, you understand that this is a parody - and it is definitely * a parody, but I'm not sure what (fairy tale? Opera? Hollywood C-film? - if there was anything like that) and I can assure you that it's not worth it. This is just a meaningless film (cf. good parody is anything but pointless), with cautious, low words with extremely schematic characters. It's like a comedy dell'arte. Or better, it's like a botched commedia dell'arte. And the score ... sang deliberately incompetent (something Greenaway is used much more efficiently), it is * painful to listen to (if someone carries some modern earrings, haha). Go to high-quality movies (eg A. Mitta, how Tsar Peter is married to his moor, 1976) and avoid this mistake.
