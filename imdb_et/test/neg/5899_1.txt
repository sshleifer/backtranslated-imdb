I had been shot by the film. The label line was something like "The Story of Sexual Waking Up for a Girl". You can only imagine how disappointed I was. I was seventeen at this time, and I took my girlfriend to see it. I thought we could see a sexy movie that would leave my girlfriend strangling. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I think we just weren't ready for deep and meaningful movies that needed complexity we didn't have at that time. I'm not so sure I have it now and I have long left this particular girlfriend (sorry, really ... my first love). We left the cinema in front of the movie, my friend, who should have felt better, stayed with the whole thing. I still got the necessary result with my girlfriend, the film just didn't help. It would be interesting to see it again so that I can make more conscious criticism, although I feel that the experience has frightened me for life.
