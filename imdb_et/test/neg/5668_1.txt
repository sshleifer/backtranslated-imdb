First of all, I would like to say that this exhibition could have worked well, better than it is now. What brought it down was definitely an act. Miranda Cosgrove, acting as the main character Carlyna, looked at Drake and Joshi for almost the value of her show. Unfortunately, iCarly was a great suppression. Miranda can not only act convincingly, but it moves very incredibly. She looks like she is not sure how the characters "nice" move or stand. At the end of her first episode, when she hats a hat, her hand does not leave her on her elbow. even when he danced, he saw him like the wind. And singing? The theme song was great, just because Drake was there, the music was pretty good and Miranda's voice sounded fake. I have to admit that the plot and the settings are good, unreal, but hey, this is Nick. They are practically known for their fools and characters. But wow is iCarly the worst of all of them.
