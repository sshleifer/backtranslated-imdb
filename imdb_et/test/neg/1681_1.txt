Characters with an unknown single character, with no development at all, unimpressive performances for people who sound like they just read lines, and ridiculous special effects that make it a real stinker. The story begins with an extremely empty command of Russo and his companions who attack Al-Qaida training. The scene tells us that Al-Qaeda has recently been looking for a weapon, and also illustrates Russia's only traits, the tendency to abandon teamwork. Russo travels to Chechnya with the help of empty slates and collecting stereotypes, including Russian spies, to catch a mad scientist working for terrorists. Along the way, they come in contact with a lot of meat eating bats that fly for some reason in daylight. From there, the film becomes more than a laughing noise, including a scene where bat traps spread the soldier's hand!
