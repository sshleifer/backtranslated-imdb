One commentator is wrong. It's not the only Pat Patterson movie and he didn't die two years later. He shot a movie called "Electric Chair" in Pineville, NC. He shot it a few years after Gore. Patterson died in the late 1970s. I know this because he used his house and left a cat there! It sucked too. It was a big deal when the movie came. No independent horror films were made in NC. This movie doesn't help. Patterson used gore effects for H.G. Lewis. He was also good at magic. His gore scenes at Body Shop were actually well done. The movie was shot in a building that also had 7/11. In some scenes you can see the upper part of the walls. The budget was less than $ 20,000 and the script looked like the child wrote. Only Patterson understood that. Still ... it's entertainment and it's classic.
