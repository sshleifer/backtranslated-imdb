To be fair, I couldn't watch this movie all the time, so I have no idea if it will heal unexpectedly. But the first 30 minutes are one of the worst I've seen for a while. Less than twelve children can get poorly written, behaved, and directed out of humor, but adults who are fully controlled by all of their faculties should keep it away.
