This movie is on my worst movie list. The story is unlocked and it is difficult to understand what is happening or the cause of the characters' actions. All movies must have an internal logic, and this film doesn't have that - the story doesn't make any sense. <br /> <br /> To see Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer and Diana Rapid waste of their talents in this movie is a crime. Faye Dunaway is happy because she plays the victim and kills the movie at the beginning. On the other hand, Donald Sutherland has to be an amazing actor, because he is able to look good despite his poor leadership and poor writing; her performance is plausible and she can nevertheless remain character. <br /> <br /> When Dame Agatha Christie was alive, she would die laugh! The movie is so bad!
