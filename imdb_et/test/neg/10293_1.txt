I went to the cinema to preview this movie without knowing anything about it. Acknowledging Jennifer Lynch's name and 18 testimonies, I realized that it could be a nuisance. In fact, I found the farce of the movie. I found myself incredibly through its parts. The actor is terrifying - Bill Pullman and his ridiculous face. I almost regret the participants, although the script does not offer them any incredible interaction. After some shocking incident (a lot of trying and shocking viewers in this movie), the beer is divided and 2 characters are spoken in the weather. Everything was overpriced or thought it was wise if it was really obvious! The film had the best thing about a little girl's character Stephanie. Quiet and intense. I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone. His violent without points, ridiculous characters, bad behavior, bad script and plain silly.
