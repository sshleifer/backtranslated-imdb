If you come to this movie to learn something about depression, forget about it: you don't learn anything but do not write a script on the subject. I understand that the intent was to show how severe depression could be a complete wreck for the average person, but the result is the one-dimensional character I've ever seen in Hollywood ... not small. Christina Ricci as Elizabeth spends all this film that screams at the top of the lungs, offending someone, breaking tears or a combination of the three (the only exceptions are some quiet beats at the beginning and end). There is no hint of what he might be like without depression ... not his weaker glow of other aspects of his personality ... he just screams. At one point, his roommate tells him, "Lizzie, you're a fun person who's around when you're not depressed," and my reaction was, "Is he?" It seems strange that writers add this comment to us without giving any examples, but this script is a lesson in incompetence. It has no visible structure or flow at all; Instead, it is made up of Lizzie's screaming uncomfortably twisted scenes that end. Character Development? No ... Scenes from his everyday life, ie classes that can be important details? No ... Fast with maximum volume? CONTROL. It's not quite enough, I'm afraid. 1/10.
