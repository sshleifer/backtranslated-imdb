Continuing the "stalker / slasher" magazine "Wolf Creek" vein, "Hostel", "Joy Ride", etc., will be "Rest Stop". The most unnatural and useless one of them all. <br /> <br /> We start, reasonably promising, with a real young man's violent death in a dirty toilet. <br /> <br /> This is where our interest has disappeared. Then I move on to the clich√© route for a couple traveling to LA with their eyes on the actor. . . which never makes such movies. <br /> <br /> A couple rides a sexual romp of the park, claiming all the time, the abandoned and disgusting recreation area that the girl uses in the bathroom. Safe until he leaves and finds his boyfriend missing, and realizes that he is struck by the "Joy Ride" version of Rusty's nail flat. . . Only while driving Materis "Cars". <br /> <br /> To be honest, if someone else had / had written / produced / acted it, it could have been pretty good. But no. <br /> <br /> Because then there will be a ghost story. Yep. . . you guessed it. A lot of "oh, I'll help you, but wait, you're dead" "wait, is it a man, a monster or a ghost?". <br /> <br /> But wait? Who can get to the rescue to save the girl's life and possibly the movie? It's one of Lawerence's brothers. Great. We're saved. (sarcasm) Wait, no, we are not. <br /> <br /> You know. . . if you want to laugh pretty badly or if you get free rentals like me, try it. <br /> <br /> If anything, you will learn how not to make a movie. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
