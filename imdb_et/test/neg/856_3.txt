Okay, now I'm pretty sure my summary gave you attention and commented that Zazu Pitts is Satan, for no reason. Let me explain. The film first appears to be Dandy B's film about the evil organization called evil, and their revenge in the form of murders to a rival organization dedicated to solving crimes. Although it is very strange (especially the idea of ​​a private club for solving crimes) and could have been interesting, this film breaks down despite quite impressive supporters of acquaintances. Why? Well, because Zazu Pitts (never my favorite actresses) spends most of the movie, like a bad toothache Olympic Oyl! When murders have been committed, robbed, or kidnapped, you can always count on Zazu whining up in full - almost like a clumsy 3-year-old who wants everyone to pay attention! At the same time, he is not an integral part of the film, but has received an upper bill. Why is he even farther away from me - I assume it is just whining and yelling. As a result, I found the film virtually invisible and it was completely destroyed. Now you probably know why I referred to this suspicious talent as "Satan"! I'm sure if the actors in this movie saw the final products, they felt the same way I did with my terrible excess and amateurish performance. <br /> <br /> This movie is a public domain and can be downloaded for free online. I see why.
