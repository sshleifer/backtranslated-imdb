***** SPOILERS ********* <br /> <br /> This movie was really terrible. This woman cheats her employers right from the start and continues to selfishly leave them. In the end, you see that he does the profession he learned from his "student" father. I put the pupil in quotation marks because the ruler never sees anything to teach the child. It looks like he hates him and can't be near him. I was sorry that the little girl who just wanted to be loved was lacking, it was understandable that she was saying and doing annoyance to just pay attention to things, but the viewer was not supposed to sympathize with the little girl, and the sympathy of her student hated and manipulated her student and manipulated. cheated on their employers. I just couldn't do that. It was not the story of a woman made by herself, but it was the window that was in the mind of the person who uses others at every opportunity, without anyone thinking about her own family. I couldn't stop the gang! It was a really terrible movie. I only paid one dollar for this, but even that was too much!
