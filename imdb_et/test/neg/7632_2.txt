I'm sorry I couldn't be more expressive in my overall, but these two words seemed to describe the film perfectly. Not only is it a bad film, it is a bad exemplary bad film and plot that is not important for most observers. <br /> <br /> Look at it only for naked Rebecca De Mornay, who is tied to a chain garden and a sudden "ecstasy"; supposedly erotic but actually fun. <br /> <br />
