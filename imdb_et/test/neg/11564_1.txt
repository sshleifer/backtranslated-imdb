I don't know the other works of the producer, but this movie is a piece. <br /> <br /> I never saw a version of MST3K, but I can tell you that Mike and Bots couldn't save it. <br /> <br /> I love the grade-z movie as much as the next bad movie fan, but it was almost invisible. <br /> <br /> There was no credit for "Dark". From time to time, it looked like Patrick Stewart. <br /> <br /> A group of high school students who found a junk-super-8 camera in the trash can do a better movie.
