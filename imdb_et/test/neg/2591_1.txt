I am usually quite tolerant of films and very simply entertaining, but this film was a terrible disappointment. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie after seeing William Zabka there (Karate Kid's bad boy) and during this movie I saw that was the only reason. <br /> <br /> This movie is a huge waste of talent. Music and sound are terribly sticky - I couldn't believe it from a movie made in the 90s. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie if you are not interested in one of the participants.
