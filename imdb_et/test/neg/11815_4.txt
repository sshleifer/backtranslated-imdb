Pam Grier is a sister of the 1970s superhero that appears in many blaxploitation films recently discovered and appreciated by the new generation. I can say for sure that BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA may be the worst Pam Grier movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Grier is Lee and Margaret Markov is Karen; they are two female prisoners who fled the prison after Karen's revolutionary friends attacked the wagon. Linked to each other, the film turns into women with DEFIANT ONES, but has three separate plots: a fat user (Filipino sleaze star Vic Diaz) wants Lee to die, a cowboy bunna hunter (a great Sid Haig) looking for two girls; and Karen's revolutionary friends are looking for him. The film finally becomes so complicated and with two women that the title should have been MEN CHASING WOMEN. The action star Grier is not given any chance to participate in any of many (long-term) scenes. Markov is great because Karen and Grier are Lee as OK, but both are finally forgotten in many sub-blocks. One interesting scene is the terrible hunter who forces the policeman and his boss to overthrow his pants so he can shoot it with the smallest penis (his whore), but it is easily forgotten in chaos. <br /> <br /> BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA begins largely as a female imprisoned film with lesbian caregivers and a shower, then completely switches on the tracking film. If director Eddie Romero (famous for managing filipino horror films) had just caught up with the WIP theme, he would have been fine. Instead, BMWM becomes quite old and the surprise that ends simply makes the audience think about why they were sitting in a 90-minute movie, so it would end! Another problem: where should the movie be set? Although some accents are Spaniards and cities have Spanish names (Los Robles, etc.), all natives are probably Asia! Hmmm ... Recommended only for hard-to-hard Grier fans who are even disappointed.
