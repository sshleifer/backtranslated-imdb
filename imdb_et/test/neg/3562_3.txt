This film tries to say something deep; I just don't know what it was. After all, the unresolved issue for me is to find out the main point. For a couple of scenes I really have to think about what was left on the floor of the cutting room. I don't think the wall was very well developed. I didn't get what actually happened there. When my mother finally publishes, I just didn't get any connection to the boy's silence. What's the point of the boy talking? Was he just misleading or got some power. What was the scene of this burned girl? Another power that a boy is or what? I do not understand how it developed any character or moved the plot. I got a bully, but what happened to the dog? Did the dog return or did the mother free from Fido? <br /> <br /> There were several additional plot elements that were more confusing than usage. As a radio talk show in Iraq during a war debate. I think it had to make some comparison with the grief and uncertainty experienced by mother and Addison, but for me it was distracting and tense. I didn't buy this link very much. I also found that the teacher adds to Addison that he's not talking here about the roll call. The mother who saw the doctor was pointless, how did the plot work? Was it to show how the mother is desperate, or was it something that I didn't get? Was this father back in the last scene, or just a guy? Did you also write on the wall? What happened to the dog?
