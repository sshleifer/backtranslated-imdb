After a good start, it turned out to be worst than your propaganda, which I had ever seen. This film is an open insult, which is meant to feel ill not reading the "holy bible". <br /> <br /> To continue ... OK, call it a plot ... Basically, an alien does not rob people (which we already know ..). No, in fact, his demonic forces are robbing people who are in a new age or witchcraft, or read a magazine (like one main character). <br /> <br /> It is with a little emotional piano music when the lead figure realizes it needs to be rescued from darkness to save him. <br /> <br /> quotes it all, depicting exquisite music in the background: "You can't let others, even those you love, let you follow the Lord." <br /> <br /> and we should live in the enlightened era ... work still. Boycott this piece
