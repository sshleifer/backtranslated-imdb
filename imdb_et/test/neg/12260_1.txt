I don't understand why this movie was released, it seemed like you saw your companions after you bought her mothers handycam in 1987. I am from Australia and I work in a video store in the UK and thought that if the Aussie movie was made in our store, it couldn't be all bad ... boy was wrong! <br /> <br /> If someone writes a good comment about this movie, they are liars or movie makers. <br /> <br /> The picture was BAD, sound was HORRIBLE and acting, actor, it was WORST, who was acting in the HISTORY of the movie. <br /> <br /> It makes me embarrassing and offensive because they used the title "Aussie" because I am proud to be Australia and this film is visible in other countries and may give people the wrong idea. /> <br /> Please, anyone who reads it and has seen this movie will take the time to find other Aussie movies because you could choose one of them and it would be better than that. <br /> <br /> I could have made a better movie when I took the camera, filmed it, but for an hour, I ate a movie that was waiting for it to pass through my body, then I threw off the TV ... offense. > <br /> DON'T SEE MOVIES !!!!!!!!!!
