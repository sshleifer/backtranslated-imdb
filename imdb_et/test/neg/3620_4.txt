I'm not lying or saying I'm not looking at this example - I'm doing. But there are many and many mistakes. 1) Full school is perfect. Drama is minimal. Everyone is so nice to each other, you know. We give this reality control. POSSIBLE that every school is perfect like PCA. Free laptops for everyone. Large dorm rooms. Mini refrigerators. If there were real life in such a school, almost no one would have a virgin there. Two, everyone is so rich and weird that no one has stolen yet. 2) the characters are unrealistic. The first things they say in the right sense as they do. They speak like a perfect teenager. Secondly, Logan Reese (Matthew Underwood) is an extremely rich boy with a "hot" teenage boy. My question is, is it almost never a girl in this school all over her? She is rich and "hot", now all these girls are after her, even if she was a jerk. Chase is also the most stupid person. She's the shy teenager who says she's not in love with Zoey and reacts to everything about Zoey. She must be BLIND to not love her. <br /> <br /> Come on Nick. I know you can do better than this. Please ..
