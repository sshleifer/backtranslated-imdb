Alright lets it break. Why is this one of the worst movies ever? Because there are so many answers to this question that I have a headache. Come on ... Cracker World? Mr. Honkee? Arab boy? its just terrible, i didn't care about the whole white racism mess, but when they did it with the arab boy i wanted to get all the writers. It's really not worth watching this movie for 3 seconds. It is not even funny bad, which was my first interpretation. I hope the person who drove this movie does not commit suicide, but it seems likely that I will not see any other option. Never look at this movie when you watch it, you can't say u died without regret.
