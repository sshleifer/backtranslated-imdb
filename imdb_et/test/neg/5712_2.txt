This is a soft porn with high gloss; a boring soap opera that focuses on one thing: sex. They made the bored, sad to say, because I don't want you to look at it randomly and tell me what that line was. What it is is an excuse for Kim Bassinger to show his big body and to smile Mickey Rourke. That's it. Rourke's weakness is so bad that it is bad and Bassinger, despite the great figure, seems cheaper than beautiful. <br /> <br /> Tissue some nice close-ups and wonderful colors for the photographer, but the story is so weak - no character and no plot - it can't compensate. Let's face it: this movie was made just for the reason - male viewers. At this level, it was probably successful. When I remember, I gave it a fan of Bassinger's look, but I waited for the story. <br /> <br /> Those who try to exclude it as "artistic" and something deeper than soft porn are just buggy.
