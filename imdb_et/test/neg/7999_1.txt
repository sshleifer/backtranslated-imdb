Anyone who claims that this movie is a ninja classic movie must see this movie before the mid-nineties or it was less than 10 years before it. Otherwise, I cannot explain this "classic ninja movie" title. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes in this movie are simply intolerable. Instead of being cast as Franco Nero's ninja, they could hire some experienced martial artists. In some way, the importance of functional skill in such a film is not important. Nero's combat ability is bar-low street destroyer. His punches and punches are flat. <br /> <br /> The old action movie is good enough. It's just a waste of time.
