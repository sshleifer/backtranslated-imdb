I just have to say that this was the third worst film I've ever seen since the assassination of the murder 3 and the star ship soldiers. 2. It was not just dialogs or paper walls or even weapons that just disappeared in the walls with no holes. It was a terrible act. No wonder I've never seen these participants before they all probably slept with the director (s). I think I'm nice for this movie, but that's just because I'm tired of screaming (just saw it). My advice is to buy as many DVDs of this movie as possible and burn so that no one can ever see this terrible waste of time, money and film.
