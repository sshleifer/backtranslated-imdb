... I can't believe there are people who recommend this movie ... It's a slow POS that's going to go anywhere. Oh yeah, it goes somewhere, but you see it comes miles away. Action: really very bad, maybe the bartender was such OK. Editing: BAD! I think the editor was told "we need at least 90 minutes" because half of the scenes would have been in the trash. Music: Don't get me started, the most painful score I've ever heard. Who is the one who sings loudly in the last scene? Management: oh my, IMNSHO David Lynch sucks, but someone who copies him sucks even harder. Leave it out.
