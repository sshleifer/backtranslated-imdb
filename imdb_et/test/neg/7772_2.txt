The lazy writing, the bad functioning, and the wood direction lead us to the 2005 Canadian TV movie HUSH, which must not be confused with about eight other films. Tori Spell and his doctor's hubby move from SanFran to their small hometown, where they get into their old galpas who decides he still loves him. She gets pregnant with Tori's child (don't ask) and starts knocking someone who can get on her way when she plans to reunite with her old flame. The actors of the old gal palm and the doctor are not worth mentioning because they act more flatly. Tori is not much better, but at least it is something to focus on when the plot tends to be here and there before reaching a very flat and too familiar conclusion. Instead, look at the HANDBOOK WHAT IS HAPPENING.
