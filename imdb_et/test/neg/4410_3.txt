** May include a spoiler ** <br /> <br /> The Luckless South Sea archipelago is filled with other (Caucasian-looking) natives after communicating with friends with Tod Andrews and Tina Carver. Meddlesome scientists dig him up and find that he has taken a humanoid tree. He comes to life and goes over the rampage and is confident that fifty boogeymans, the A bomb, are being charged for this aberration. To say that this particular monster walks as he is, is ** superfluous. Suffice it to say that criticism of lumbers, such as the film itself, throws its enemies into some convenient neighbors and gives the main characters one more thing to stupid comment on. Paul Blaisdell created a suit for a fruit man and it is hardly his best job. Over the years, this flick has made many comments, such as "To Hell It Can Go!" Personally, I think it's the best walking tree I've ever seen.
