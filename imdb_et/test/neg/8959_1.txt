I got this movie as a purchase, get a deal on troma.com with The Ruining (which isn't much better). The main reason I wanted to see it in the Star Worms II: Pleasure Pods attack is the dual feature of this DVD. I really didn't know what Actium Maximus was, and when I saw the trailer, I was scared. It seemed terrible. But hey, what can you say about the trailer? Well, probably I can say a lot. This movie didn't give me honesty. The special effects were so terrible that you cannot say what is going on in the name of God. I understand that Mark HIcks had an extremely low budget but came on. And it's sad because the interview seemed like it was an epic movie and meant more than you saw. But unfortunately, watching a movie is one of the most boring and 15-minute people. It is so completely painful to sit down. I can't even explain the plot to you because I don't understand it at all and I've seen this movie twice! Apparently, they used some kind of doll for "foreign dinosaurs" as they were in Star Wars. But these special effects are terrible, I can't emphasize it enough. And most of the time, bad special effects are fine, but this movie needed them badly. It happens on some futuristic planets, where strangers dinosaurs fight against each other and bad actors on the hoods are around and they look like they're husky. And some blue-light boxes are president. I know in an interview that Mark Hicks said something about making a television pilot. Well, I understand why it didn't do it for CBS or NBC. There are two good things about this movie. 1. Music is actually pretty good, it has an epic score that sticks to the head of the day. And 2. Lloyd Kaufman's introduction is just as fun. In general, don't waste your time, just look at Star Worms II: The Joy of Attack!
