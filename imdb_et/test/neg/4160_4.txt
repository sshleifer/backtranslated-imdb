*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> I saw this movie screening last night. I started with Tim Robbins and a loving sci-fi. The first third of the movie was very cool. The result was good, cinematography was interesting, the filmmaker's vision of the future was still realistic, but still interesting. I remember thinking to me, "this is the smartest sci-fi movie I've seen for a while. They just couldn't keep it together. <br /> <br /> Although it was a lot more from the beginning" harsh edges "(namely editing and later some writings). / plot development), these issues were forgiven. <br /> <br /> Robbins couldn't breathe his character, but he did what he did best. His female colleague (her name is fleeing me now) was good in her role. <br /> <br /> The main reason seemed to be that the filmmakers were unable to decide whether to make a sci-movie or a futuristic love story. They didn't get anything. <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> Some cinematic works: grainy, sometimes it seemed "21 days later". <br /> <br /> Very suitable for such a futuristic film <br /> <br /> I dug out some location images. <br /> <br /> The music was cool. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers see the future was realistic but still cool and interesting. <br /> <br /> I liked the other little characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some writings were interesting (early). <br /> <br /> The girl who played Maria Gonzales (the name can't be remembered) was good. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS DOWN *** <br /> <br /> Some questions / comments: <br /> <br /> I felt that many futuristic things in this movie were comfortable to place on patchwork story. Namely VIRUSES. Obviously, the film he gave at the end of the film changed him from his physical "fear" right there so that they could stay on to another sexual scene and then he could uncontrollably tell him about code 46. delete his memory and the movie ends. The classic "dream sequence" when you ask me. do all the loose ends associate very well if you make it all dreamy? <br /> <br /> Was Robbin's character naturally a good intuition or was it a virus? <br /> <br /> Why not? are they studying many of the issues surrounding the girl as her mother's clone? It could have made some interesting stories. <br /> <br /> First of all, I like greetings from all over the world in everyone's speech. But it became intrusive, especially since their accents were not convincing. I get it, the future is undoubtedly more racially and culturally more androgynous, but he started to become a business at AT&T Global Networking. <br /> <br /> If they were "outside", how could they get the code 46 interrupted? <br /> <br /> Kate was never precisely defined. Sometimes the trivial seemed like a visa and at other times it was both vital and death. Again, loose definitions allow this to be used to glue the various parts of the plot together. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'm gonna get negative about it, so I'll stop. There were some cool scenes and interesting things about this movie, but it only gives him 4/10
