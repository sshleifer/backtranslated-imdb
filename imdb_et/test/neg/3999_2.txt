Emotionally insecure Tom Russo (Asbest Felt) reads the secret diary of his sexy wife Leeza (Courtney Lercara) and is amazed to discover that her life's love is probably sleeping with every meeting. this shocking revelation sends the poor Tom out of their rocket, and he continues to get bloody vengeance for men who believe they are their old lady's rogers. <br /> <br /> My experience is really a very bad movie. as fun as really good, and no movie that includes dehumidification with a machete advanced ceiling fan should never be considered completely worthless; but while Killing Spree is occasionally able to entertain his creativity and cheap and joyful entertainment, I found that terrible direction, terrible product values, ugly cinematography, damping sound, terrible lighting, desperately annoying and narrative narrative (which contains a really dark graphic twist that is From the very beginning, a telegraph, plus a meaningless zombie finale), a nasty result of synthesizers, a nasty dialogue, and a thoroughly amateur actor who made this effort by the writer / director Tom Ritter with an almost joyful experience.
