There have been some great television movies in the past. Also think of epics like "roots" and "Lonesome Dove". Category 6: The Day of Destruction doesn't remind you to create TV movies. A ridiculously bad story that goes beyond a terrible scenario, Cat6DD, as I like to call it, inspires participants to be more compassionate than wild-type terror. The sound you hear during the movie should be the sound of the wind, but it is actually the career of Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy and Thomas Gibson (Dharma & Greg duo Greg, Greg) that falls faster than houses and trucks and cows can fly from 15 we're seeing the tornado we see in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The movie was promoted as a "wildlife amok", instead we get a flat story about how 15 different weather arrangements are made to produce 150 degree days in Chicago, then the next snow storm from a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico that connected Canada with a storm system, but in fact its origin was a jet. stream what global warming changed .... ENOUGH !! It was not important what the story was, acting terrible, the words the actors said were stupid, and 13 scientists across the country had come out of the coronation that heard the drift. I didn't care what happened to any character, special effects were sub-par, even for TV standards, and the story was meaningless. All in all, I really don't like this "TV event".
