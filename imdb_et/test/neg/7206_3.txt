OK, I gave it three three! It deserves only one letter, but no questions are asked. <br /> <br /> If you look at the movie seriously and take it as a legitimate B-Horror movie, if yes, it gets one star. But I believe that in the first few minutes of the film it turns out that we are dealing with being familiar. <br /> <br /> This movie and my friend I watched could turn it off and put something more in "Hollywood", but we just decided to end this whole movie. We laughed so many times that it was almost when I looked at comedy. <br /> <br /> Functioning is terrible ..... Impacts and sequences of death are so bad .... The story is complete. ... <br /> <br /> But the fact that they're trying to make a serious horror movie. Nonsense! <br /> <br /> For me, the most memorable part is when two characters go into a supposed "dark basement" that is clearly illuminated, and they pretend they can't see the splitting from the ceilings that hang from the ceiling bahahahaha just terrible. ... <br /> <br /> So if you want to laugh at how crappy this movie is with it being made in 2004 when you see this movie ... <br /> <br /> Wait for me do I write so much? no one knows this movie ... i doubt someone even read this hahahaha.
