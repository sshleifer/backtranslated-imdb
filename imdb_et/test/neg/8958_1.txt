OK, what to say about Actium Maximus ... <br /> <br /> There are some bad movies that are so terrible that they are rounding. There are bad movies that just suck themselves. There are good movies and movies and movies that are just fun. Then there is Actium Maximus. You can't do a spoiler for this movie because you should understand enough action to comment. This particular film is worse than the wars of Turkish stars and the sequel. These movies are so bad that they are spinning around and they feel drunk even when you're rocky. Actium circles around badly awesome, but then it doesn't end there, it takes another trip to badville, then "round awesome, then eventually creates a small feudal kingdom on the border with" bad "and" color drying stock footage when harpy screams inconsistently. "If you have punished yourself, this movie is for you. It causes your brain to hurt.
