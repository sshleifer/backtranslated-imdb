I can't overcome being lazy under the direction of this movie. Instead of creative creation of scenes, he relies on eternal old zombie clich√©s. <br /> <br /> If two unarmed commanders have to stand before the college, they surround the zombies, but neither of them is bitten. He cannot interfere with the management of a decent fight scene, so we see how leaders step down. <br /> <br /> Sometimes zombies are slippery and others run like winds. This is very convenient for the director because he can create something he likes without disturbing the continuity of zombies' behavior. <br /> <br /> With careful planning and a lot of inspiration, this movie could have been so much better.
