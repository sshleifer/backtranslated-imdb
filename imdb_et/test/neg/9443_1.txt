Maybe James P. Lay knows what to do in the sound department when the director directs him. <br /> <br /> In Dreamland (2007), however, he cannot write anything as a writer or director. /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie, no story, no character building, no event, no atmosphere, no plot, no twist, no action that deserves this name. from these departments, this film is behind billions of light years behind any short film with some real thinking, even one minute. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with David Lynch's work! <br /> <br /> I think it could be used as a torture or negative propaganda material against the West. <br /> <br /> Recommend it only to your worst enemies!
