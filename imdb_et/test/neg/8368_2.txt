I'm a great fan of H. Lovecraft's books and Mythos's background has created some pretty good stories and things. And in recent years, some of the guys who made films about the work of H.P. for the most part are low-budget flicks? and showed them to the public at H. Lovecraf's film festival. Now, as I said, most of them don't have a big budget, but they know at least the heart and soul of Lovecraft's work and movies like "Cool Air" or "Cthulhu's Call" - that's what I want to think - gifts for a fan base and other lovers of nature similar to HP's creations. <br /> <br /> And then there are people like Ivan Zuccon who just kidnap the name and create a movie that would have been fun to watch if I had directed it and filmed it with some friends on the beach. This was what Mr Zuccon did as it seemed ... but although Aaron Vanek's or Bryan Moore's earlier films may not have been more budgeted, they still had something to offer, such as story, real characters, and some connection with Lovecraft! Just Blabbering Names like "Nyarlathotep" or "Necronomicon" makes the movie not a Lovecraft customization. <br /> <br /> In any case, this flick will not only change the fans of myths and hide, but also dislike people who like 1. good movies, 2. laugh at bad movies, 3. like good C - refresh spray films or 4. Check out everything that is written on the Horror on the DVD cover. I will not go to this waste of time, as others have already discussed here, but as I said, is beyond the film I would have made with some geeky friends. In addition, he has no ideas for storytelling, and it goes into the ridiculous "moronic-nonsense-but-he-see-art-stuff". With this "quality" self-esteem, the canes are fun to watch when you know all the blocks and ha-ha in it, see how XY captures the false blood we've made from old tomato sauce and stuffing? but hey, you don't put it in a DVD case, say it to a real movie and want some money for it? <br /> <br /> I'll give him 2/10 because I'm not? effort or something like that
