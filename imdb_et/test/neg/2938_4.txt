But it has to be said that maybe more in America than to say, here in the UK it can still be a horrible topic. Just look at the entire attack gay is millitary some years ago in the US. It's "In and Out". that writer Paul Rudnick concerns a small town mentality in the middle of America and how the press in the US (As well as in the UK) make such a big deal out of fame. You just have to look at when Will Young and Stephen Gately Boyzone came out of the closet. <br /> <br /> Movies focus on Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline), a high school English teacher. people are preparing for the Oscar evening because one of the candidates, Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), came from his city and was a former Howard student. Cameron, who plays a gay soldier in the Vietnamese epic, wins the prize only for Howard because he is gay at his reception. It could not come at a worse time than Howard, who is just a day away from marriage with his groom and co-Emily. (Joan Cusack) .If you hope the media reaction is catastrophic and in turn Howard's life up. He is not only trying to convince his family and friends that he is not a gay but avoids a foolish news reporter, Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck). <br /> <br /> Although it was settled as a screw-ball comedy, it is clear that Rudnick and director Frank Oz are also trying to be satirical.You just have to look at the early scene of the Oscar cerimone and how people in Brackett's home and school teachers respond to his departure. . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film doesn't live up to the promise of an early movie. It's a pretty flat attempt to make a social comment out of crazy comedy. A good cast is unfortunately wasted on a script that never gives a ridiculous laughing number and isn't as close as it makes sense. <br /> <br /> Kline gives us the same love she gave us in her earlier comedy. Dave, which makes Howard an instantly enjoyable character. Cusack is also a good value if Howard's weight is obsessed, while Tom Selleck's game is very good as a gay news reporter. Bob Newhart is also proud to be the prime minister of the high school where Howard works. It's a shame that it should have been. <br /> <br /> Performances that are as good as they are, can save the movie from a dull thing. offer some fun. Only inspired scene where Howard tries to feel more masculine by listening to self-help tape. There is little to enjoy, and if things don't look worse, Rudnick breaks into the hospital for a final that scares the top sentiment. I couldn't help but felt my intelligence was offended.Malloy seems to be too slippery to become a man who put his ethics before a good story, but Cammeron finally saves the movie at the top seems to be a too self-evident character who takes care of about what happens to his former teacher. After all, it is the one who first caused all the problems. <br /> <br /> 'In and Out' is not exactly but if you think Klines likes a better job, like 'A Fish, called Wanda', you can't help but feel that there's a great talent here sad wasted. <br /> <br /> Robs Rating: * *
