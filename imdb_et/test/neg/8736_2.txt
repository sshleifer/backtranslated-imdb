"The scientist is experimenting with human DNA trying to create a perfect person. His work has come to be able to take the human fetus and accelerate its growth to an adult within a few days. Creation (spoiler left out), but the side effects of the process (spoiler left out) , "according to the summary of DVD sleeves. <br /> <br /> "Embryo" opens up promising: "The movie you see is not all science fiction. It is based on the medical technology that currently exists for fetal growth outside the uterus, it may be possible tomorrow or today," Dr. . Right. And later, Dr. Joyce Brothers will appear with a party with Roddy McDowall. <br /> <br /> First, we see a Rock Hudson (like Dr. Paul Holliston) cigarette and drive carelessly (see this speedometer!) during a storm; unfortunately he hits the dog. Hudson takes home the wounded dogs. He learns to be pregnant and manages to save one puppy's life due to his experimental knowledge of fetal growth. What this really means is that Hudson uses an experimental drug to grow an embryo so that it can survive outside the mother's womb. The dog, "Number One", is growing rapidly to an adult and is going to be his mother. <br /> <br /> Hudson lives with his sister Diane Ladd (like Martha Douglas); because his wife, Nicole, also a doctor, died in another car accident. Mrs Ladd seems to be more emotionally more stable to Nicole than death than Hudson, who lived an accident that killed her wife. Things start to get terrible when the Hudson dog shows a level of intelligence that is much higher than a normal dog. Then Hudson decides to use accelerated embryo growth in humans, Barbara Carreral (Victoria Spencer). <br /> <br /> Hudson and the cast try their best; The story of "embryo" is terribly absurd. When you take away the scenes of opening and closing your stupid lady, Mrs Carrera's brave characterization almost works; he could have been a bigger star when he was offered better movies. The infantile end refers to the sequel; but happily interrupted the idea.
