Hell's gates opened and spat this movie, then closed again. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie makes me appreciate the other movies I've seen, like all the other movies. There's no point in this movie. <br /> <br /> It would be too long to mention any plot problems. In fact, it is not really worth it if there is a warning, there is no point in spending some of the almost infinite spaces written on the Internet for this movie. <br /> <br /> IMDb forces me to write more about this movie. I think I should warn you about Edison Force when I am. But if you had chosen between two, choose Edison Force.
