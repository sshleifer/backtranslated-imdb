Well, I'll be clean and confess that I was forced to participate in my history to watch this movie and then write a short movie review as part of my class. the movie alone, at my own discretion, found it very boring and absurd. The style is dated longer than years and the actor is wrong. Instead of using the dialogue, they overlook the glimpse of each other or sometimes in thin air. For me, such an upper actor does not convey any greater emotion and, after seeing extreme closeness, Ivan faces a hundred times when I prayed to the end of the film. how wrong is Ivan. This man was disgusting, his bodyguard murders and his character's coward. For me, the film was nothing more than Stalin's propaganda that was inaccurate and boring.
