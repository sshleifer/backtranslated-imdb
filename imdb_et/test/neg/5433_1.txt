If you can laugh out on the screen with this flick, then you're a better filmmaker than. <br /> <br /> Read the logic of obsolete, common sense jumps and reliability ... betcha those more than two hands! <br /> <br /> PS: If another movie uses a location that is clearly UCLA and claims to be a different university (for this movie: Berkeley), I lose it.
