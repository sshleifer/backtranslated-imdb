Orson Welles' 1974 documentary "F for Fake" explores trick and deception, focusing mainly on two men who have been exposed to fraud. Clifford Irving is a biographer who wrote an alleged autobiography of Howard Hughes, but at least it seems to be claiming his innocence. The second main theme of the film is the artist Elmyr de Hory, a man who has painted his life with charming famous masterpieces, sometimes selling them to museums as the actual work of original artists. Between these stories are the bits where Welles makes magic tricks to illustrate points, etc., and he also deals with the fact that his career began as a fraud when he first lied to his lies and then created a "World War" radio. ". <br /> <br /> I really wanted to love this movie and find it deeply because I'm such a Welles devotee, but I couldn't do it. Part of the problem was that it wasn't just nonlinear, it was completely Although I appreciate stylish editing and fast jumping and zooming, especially when it is used in an unusual format, such as a documentary, it was simply "F for Fake." They set the style of the loan on the contrary. If the story had been clearer and more comprehensive, I think editing would probably not have been so annoying. The scattered storytelling made it even more reluctant for them to be really interesting topics, especially Elmyr de Hory. His artistic faker highlights the subject of fraud in the world of art and who can really determine the authenticity of certain works; not authentic, what does he say about admiring pieces of museums? This is one documentary that I would say at least to let, but don't hesitate to turn it off if you don't enjoy it. This is certainly the most uncomfortable documentary I've ever seen; it is a documentary, an art film and an experimental film, none of which is properly represented or isolated. I have no less opinion in Welles's opinion after that, but I do not think it seems glowing in his creation. 4/10
