Scenes of decent activity, but the film is a slow, almost non-existent dialogue that leads to the formation of a minimal character and a serious horrible event ... <br /> <br /> Did I mention that the story doesn't make any sense? However, in their defense, the act of scenes was impressive enough, even if they leave you with your head scratched, why they just happened. <br /> <br /> There is nothing more to say in the movie. This is a slick, pointless activity that makes no sense. It's like looking at the worse version of Matrix and skipping all the stories and dialogue.
