this movie is a trash because for several reasons it is based on Mark Furman's book, which is also a trash. let me tell you that Mark Furhman is a racist pig who is just looking for another way to focus - and others who imprison this type of trash correctly. because the film itself, based on the book, was also terrible. the only reason why this murder case was such a big book and movie was because the boy is related to his aunt's marriage, the Kennedy family, and it is ridiculous that people still believe that this family has some capacity to do and cover murders - they are just family and middle america need obsession. this poor man and his family have been hounded by the police for years, they didn't get tommy that they went after Michelle. his amazing that he went to jail for all the evidence that he did not do it, besides the fact that the limitation period should have, among other things, brought this trial back to God after love twenty years ago, don't look at this garbage
