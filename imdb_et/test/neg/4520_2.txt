Wow, even American Idol and so you think you can dance to get more adult stuff than WWE (at least the number of hearings has been abused by the judges) and here is WWE, one of the worst TV shows. become PG. Now that I sometimes change what's happening, that's what I get: <br /> <br /> 1) Hornswoggle, a ugly dwarf who shares his space with major events, probably for some reason, except for young fans and of course wins Chavo Guerrero, capable wrestler, every race <br /> <br /> 2) guest hosts (arghh ....!) Every week to break the teacup that was otherwise there. All these host organizations are cheap class B celebrities who are once again trying to announce fame, breaking horrible, 5-year-old jokes and making stupid references. <br /> <br /> 3) Cryme time and female wrestler (I forgot my name, probably Eve), giving lessons in different "street" words (sob) that are neither street nor cool. Before they were fun, they stole things and had a loud mouth. <br /> <br /> 4) Two are clad with non-invasive equipment linking their best to search for "sexy, intelligent and powerful (by the way, I hate this accusation) Remember when there were Torrie, Trish and Sable, they were times, plus these two are bad wrestlers who add misery.I have seen some old WWE competitions in the Vintage collection and there were two "professional" and not amateur. <br /> <br /> 5) PG movement limits so many things: During almost any blood, DX is terribly irritating, John Cena makes even more of his patriotism, a crowd that contains many children (who are so annoying) almost no "heels" etc. <br /> <br /> 6) And yes , why keep PPVs so often, once a month, have they lost it? look for fake and just-till-the-PPV-over-over. <br /> <br /> 7) Vintage Michael Cole and some of her quotes: <br /> <br /> "Ladies and gentlemen, you are wat in the longest history" (every week "<br /> <br />" long running t "ching" (he doesn't use it to anyone else) Randy Orton / Legacy "<br /> <br />" The nervous attack on Stephanie McMohan, Triple-H's wife! "<br /> <br /> WWE is almost to his death. Hope Vince rises up his sleep and does something (bring back the TV-14 or the age of attitude) from 2 out of 10 current WWEs.
