You just stopped watching this movie because it was on television and I had nothing else. I also went to IMDb here to look at the trivia page and look at user comments. And what do I find? Every stupid idiot raises this movie to heaven! I wouldn't even have written anything, but if no one else takes the time to distribute this breastfeeding film, I thought I could. . The worst was the man who played Brian Wilson (I thought I was right) when he was overactive, especially when he was high. The rest was not as bad as her, but nobody was good. I'm not a coastal boys expert, although it can't really tell you that story so much .... except to suck it. No decision of the characters is usually motivated, but hey, maybe they were idiots alive. And the worst thing was that I thought it was a movie about the guys on the beach, but you really got just a few characters. I hate doing this in the movies, in the same door, although I like this movie more. No more energy to write more ... it sucks! don't buy or look at it!
