I saw this movie for one reason: the title of the tag is "Stop head and you're dead!" Cracking. It is not surprising that this silly horror comedy ends with steam before the ribbon goes out, but it looks like a laugh at its unusual assumption and characters: eagle-eyed human radar, a great supporter and a big - a nursing sexual magnet is all led by a manager who doesn't be happy that his family is blackmailed by a murderous doll. It looks like a promising blend of ham and cheese before it turns out that the characters are one of the fun wonders and the plot is quite common when you ignore the giant head.
