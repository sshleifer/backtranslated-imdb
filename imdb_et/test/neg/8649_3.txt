If this is a film noir, the knife must be a slow Frenchman. Pick up completely improbable characters, give them something to say, punch the whole thing for free with ultra-violence, and you have a formula with a dashed dash. Subtitles could be "Sleazy Hollywood types are trying to make money from Chinatown's rip-off". One minute of Bruce Dern's is better than anything else in this flick. By the way, I didn't like the movie.
