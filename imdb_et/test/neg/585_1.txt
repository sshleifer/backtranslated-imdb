Terrible. The only way I even started to find it funny is to entertain myself. "Amazing. It's about an ass that fights crime. And he drinks / smokes! How funny it is! It's funny because where most people put things in their mouths, they put them themselves! And now he gets sexual service from some ladies! this is so big! "That's what I have to say when I like this show, though I'm sure you see obvious sarcasm. I've noticed that some people have compared this example with 12 oz. Mouse and Squid Billies. Why would you even try? There is nothing to compare. The other two displays actually have some good character development. In conclusion, I hate Assy McGeet. I'll take that name.
