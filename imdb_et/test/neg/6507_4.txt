This (supposedly) based-on-a-true-story TV movie concerns a woman who is a FBI and * a serious * foolish man. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson), a "normal boy" who has a mental job, a former wife, a child he hardly sees, and some cats. <br /> <br /> Next, "Elaine-Lisa-you call it" (Tracy Pollan), a smart, sexy and stylish woman whose tongue would break if she ever told the truth. <br /> <br /> Roger and Lisa will meet if they respond to a lonely heart ad. Roger is one of those poor suckers who can't live alone, so after putting his wife in, he puts his ad. <br /> <br /> Roger doesn't have time for Lisa to be * not a good person, but he has no idea how to get rid of him. She doesn't even have a good idea to lock her apartment door after she throws her out. <br /> <br /> Go ahead and see if you have anything else to do. <br /> <br />
