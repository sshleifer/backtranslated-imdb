There is only one thing I say in a hat from a cat ... as a KIDS movie and a good comedy that it sucks ... I lost how many terrible jokes in the movie are not only sucked, but "t exactly the boy's fit. Oh and by the way, as the cat was talking in the hat, it was annoying ... as I completely forgot. Who cares to suck it anyway. I'm not sure why Mike Myers joined, but I think the writers tried to call it without Austin's authority without he spoke, and it was too successful - but what it was annoying. not seeing it - it belongs to the bottom 100 ........................... ... jokes are so unkiddy it's funny
