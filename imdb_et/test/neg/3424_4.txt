Macbeth's story was one of the most successful Shakespeare ever written. This may be due to some of the features that make this slider close to genre, murder, murder, kill, kill gallons of blood, intense sexual relationships between major characters, and so on. Instead, the original game is very appealing considering the length (it's only half the size of Hamlet) and focusing on Macbet, whom we've groomed despite its bloody nature. The game seems to be ideal for creating a movie. Not so long as it gives directors the opportunity to explore it on multiple levels, a good actor can play a role in his life, the film has a deep meaning in every historical period. Unfortunately, this has not been the case with Macbeth. The Polanski version is quite close, but it requires too much in the Middle Ages. Welles' film is too personal, an interesting twist to totalitarianism, the 1990 TV version is too low. This 2006 film is no exception. This is very far from Shakespeare's movie, but it is interesting to see how the director understands the story and places it in today's life. No knights shiny armor but gangsters shiny cars. A lot of drugs and trippy music will replace the fear of the original game. Macbeth's idea is so simple that in today's life and for implantation, Shakespeare doesn't need it at all. The worst part of the movie is the lines. Most of the scenes in the game, such as a dagger scene, are cut so much that they are meaningless. Replacing the door impact with doorbells and car horses seems funny. If they wanted to make a movie about power and its temptation, they could have done it without Shakespeare. This Macbeth seems to be a relaxation of the brain, not a brave warrior, brave and ambitious, who wants the power so much that he is ready to kill and who grabs the net of fears and despair. The film does not explain what drives Lady Macbeth to madness, it does not give a reason why some characters should be afraid of Macbeth and his "fear" (because there is no inheritance of the throne without a throne and all) and put Macbeth in awkward as the gang leadership is so far away from the king as the whole movie is far from Shakespeare. In conclusion, we have two overlapping ideas that never match a movie that is ultimately pointless.
