There is not much to add to what others have already commented on, the film will not succeed if it does not, it has no depth in the planning of the strokes and the characters are so incredible. <br /> <br /> One thing I thought was that while the rest of the gang is trying to remove the door from the doorway, because there is no other way to open it, the guy inside the truck, it is very easy to remove the truck floor who has that hole so that he can come out and then come back without anyone noticing it, because no one else would think he could get out of it or even better get out of there. <br /> <br /> Promising, but not quite there.
