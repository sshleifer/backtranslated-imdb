There is a problem with commenting or reviewing such a movie. I remember feeling the same as disliking Dogma. If you don't like a movie that's strange and contradictory like Mulholland Dr, you'll see that you can't get it. Of course, those who have already seen this movie know that the whole point has never got it. <br /> <br /> I have heard from various sources that the unique and pleasant aspect of this film is dream-like quality. In other words, the plot is not structured like other films. In the Mulholland case, a third-class boy who has delayed his art project seems to be an unreasonable collage. It doesn't make sense, it shouldn't be, but I know it was a TV series in the beginning. Lynch seems to have had an unused movie pack and decided to put it in a heap. You will notice that nudity, sex and unpleasant language are growing towards the end. Everything he wouldn't have filmed on television. <br /> <br /> For a better movie, not to talk about conventional, linear fashion, hire The Thin Red Line since 1998. It was a great movie, it's not. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 10
