Don Wilson's stars like a policeman who enjoys a random virtual reality fighting game, but things go wrong when people behind the game decide to take virtual reality to a new level, making real people into the video game, be they cybersex models. as a prototype, but the main bad guy in the video game wakes up and starts killing people, and now the only guy who can win a guy, Don Wilson, who at the same time falls in love with the cybersex model. In fact, my greatest confusion was trying to understand how people from virtual reality were robots, human, cyber, or just a type of unknown computer program. It doesn't matter, because it's all just an excuse to look at one of the worst performers who have ever been butchers as if it were a deli. Don Wilson's complete lack of charisma is the biggest mistake in the film because one just doesn't like him, he's too good and good, his voice is too high and it doesn't look very impressive in the sequences. What saves its lowest rating is Athenia Massey, who sees high-cut equipment as super hot and occasionally naked. Loren Avedon (a good martial artist), Stella Stevens, and Michael Dorn are also the main voice of a bad boy, but their efforts are in vain because everyone is embezzled by Wilson's very poor performance. Another mistake, the biggest mistake in the film, is the lack of action, because we are asked to look at the story, but not Massey's nudity and perhaps some unintentional amusements that are really interesting because of ridiculously convincing action. It also extends to sequences of operations with a choreograph that is firmly inclined, poorly targeted, and completely irritated. Making it virtually unnoticeable. <br /> <br /> * 4- (bad)
