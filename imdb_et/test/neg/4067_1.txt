My proposal ..... This movie was actually meant for "comedy", isn't it? !!!! If not, manufacturers, managers, actors and "hairdressers" should really choose another career! Now, my submission guidelines require a minimum of "10 lines". How can I add more to this world? Hmm ... Let me see. Oh yes, the beginning of the movie was quite fun with the "crash landing" scene. It is too bad that the plane did not hit the tanker and the "marteine" would have been thrown out of the wreck (apparently hiding) and decided to take over the "world" planet and make a better movie. Now it would have been a great start. <br /> <br /> T
