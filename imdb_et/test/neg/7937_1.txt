Is it just me or is it ATTENTION? I'm going with this great movie ... <br /> <br /> Knowing that it's a guy flick (usually defined as full of rides, accidents, bomb attacks, explosions, etc.), I'm still looking for some credibility. If I can't believe in the assumption, the film MUST not work. That's how we get into the "Assault on Precinct 13" issue. However, I make an exception here because the plot is ugly. The bad guy is imprisoned in Precinct 13. Bad husband's friends want to kick him out. Surprise. Bad guys are actually corrupt policemen. Dirty, restless, but heroic young policeman saves the day when a girl romanticizes a girl. UGH. Yes, it's really easy and it's stupid. <br /> <br /> In Detroit there is an "attack on Precinct 13". Not a bad setting for crime and corruption (I spent three months there at the end of 2004, so I know what I'm talking about). Nevertheless, it is offensive and offensive to the police and the citizens of Detroit. I've spent a lot of time in downtown Detroit, but I can't imagine how the final chase in downtown Detroit ends. I have to miss this ... <br /> <br /> There are no refunds for watching bad movies. Save your money. In 2005, there were too many good movies to waste with $ 3.00. </p> </p>
