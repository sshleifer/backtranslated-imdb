Not to be confused with Michael Ritchie's disgusting 1975 beauty contest, this "smile" is an example of how good intentions pave the way for hell. <br /> <br /> Film equals two stories: The impoverished Chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to raise face-deformed orbits, called Ling (Yi Ding), and the TV-born Malibu family operates "Gidget Get Birth Control". Katie (Mika Booram, the third Olsen twin) plays a corrupt, self-absorbing high school that is away from reality. His teacher (Sean Astin) paves the way for a school trip to China to show students how to work with deformed children. <br /> <br /> The film uses deformation as an arbitration treating Link as a Frankenstein monster. Kramer constantly masks its deformation through hats, hoods and camera layout. This approach uses the characteristic quality of the material. He may be uncomfortable with how society views his views, and Kramer's response is to cover him up until he is exposed. Why disturb your audience with such a nuisance? We'll see his face briefly at the end, and only a few minutes later, when his post-operative credit snapshots discover the bull under the spike. It's not good enough to give a girl a reason to live; It is imperative that Ling be equally hot and popular as Katie. <br /> <br /> The film's funding came from the trust created by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. They saw the legacy of high quality family movies. Give me "Son of Paleface" every day.
