I can't make it easier, it's a terrible movie. I have worked in the industry and made several (short) films myself, so my standard is pretty high, but seriously, I hate this movie. I haven't commented on IMDb before, but I hated this movie so much that I literally had to warn others. This is a piece of t. Writer / director is an idiot who simply does not know how to make / write a good movie and who has adolescent teenage writing skills. The characters are unreal (the leading woman does not think the police gun is still inventive enough to impromptu the Molotov cocktail? Pleaseâ€¦) and not even pleasant, hell I hated her and rejoiced when she died. I don't understand what the director was trying to do with his demon-redneck idea, but it just looked like sloppy writing and comfortable bulls *, which doesn't make sense to me. It's officially the worst film I've ever seen in ALL YEARS. Congratulations to Shiba, you are now here with great prizes such as Micheal Bay's prestigious "shouldn't be allowed to spend millions of dollars to make a movie club". I hope you read this, I really do. And to the 163 idiots who rated this 10 out of 10 films from BWAHHAHAHAHAH, I hope my god, I see that the red devil appears comfortably behind you and tortures you.
