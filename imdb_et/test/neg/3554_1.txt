One of the most boring films I've ever had to sit on is completely formal. Just a movie clip you can predict for each movie scene, from the genre, because this movie doesn't add anything new. Dialogue is never funny, interesting or intelligent. The actor is weak and the soundtrack is annoying - basically everything seems to have been made by the amatuer filmmaker. Something fresh, memorable or entertaining is not combined with being LONG, it gives it a light thumb. Sorry, fans. <br /> <br /> Overall Class: F
