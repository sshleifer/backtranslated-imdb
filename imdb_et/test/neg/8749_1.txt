Yes, this movie contains a gallery called Jessica, who says that everything is bad and it also causes trees to land on people (well, it only causes one tree to fall, but she says everything is bad). This film is about a farm that apparently rents people out, but offers little other entertainment. Jessica can find things and she finds a bad guy. Of course, they do not know this until the owner of the farm assistant opens the box containing the head. The head continues to hypnotize everyone it can to reach Jessica and use its powers to find things to help their body look. This movie has a rather interesting story, but here it is very bad. Anyone in this flick gets their nerves at least once.
