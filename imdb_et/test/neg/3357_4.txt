Sheba Shayne (Pam Grier) gets a telegram that informs her that her father may be in trouble. Separate investigator and former policeman Sheba goes to her father for help. But no-one will consider their father's business anymore. Trying to show your muscles skewed and Sheba's father is in cold blood. These guys have come to the wrong woman. <br /> <br /> If I had to describe Sheba Baby, the best thing I can do with Pam Grier Lite, who has very bad behavior. For Pam Grier's film, Sheba Baby is incredible. It's not nearly as violent as some of his earlier films. Gone are the pictures from the top of Pam that put a small revolver or razor blade on their afro. The pilot (D'Urville Martin) and his team can't carry a candle on some real villain Pamile, who faced his previous films. It is strictly ancillary to numbers and is almost on television. As far as bad behavior is concerned, the misfortunes Pam face are as unnatural as I have seen at their birth. As a result, such characters as the pilot do not come as threatening as they should or need to work the movie. <br /> <br /> It doesn't mean that Sheba Baby has no moments or elements that I didn't enjoy (Pam's costume and Pami's finger gun), it's just that compared to other Pam films like Coffy, Foxy Brown and even Friday Foster that the film will not succeed. <br /> <br /> One final observation - maybe I'm more sensitive to these things after 9/11, but I don't even remember the 70s security threats if you could take a suitcase full of weapons on the plane. When Sheba flies to her father's help, she's packed with arsenal!
