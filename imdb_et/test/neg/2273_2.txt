Oh yes, I have to agree with others who describe it terribly. This four-hour lesson is equally bad, so bad it is impossible for me to believe that any of the parties to this production could earn a living as an actor. I still don't know who did it. Everyone sends their lines without any other character or emotional investment. No other has a real relationship, family or other. The direction is also terrible and any action is ridiculous and convincing. Did the movie editors sleep? <br /> <br /> Costumes are authentic during the Regency period, but fabrics and colors of the 20th century (especially blue colors) are dirty and I don't think they were available in the early 19th century fabric, except maybe be silk. <br /> <br /> Hair too: Men are obvious discounts of the 1970s and women have "big hair" --- especially a woman who plays Anne Elliot. <br /> <br /> All female characters, young and old, are pretty beautiful, but it doesn't compensate for lack of ability to act. An actor who plays "Anne" looks like she is in the forties, while Anne Elliot should be 27 years old. I mean, where was the makeup and lighting team when we found faith with a woman playing with Anne? He spends a large part of his time with the eyes in sight, whether indoors or outdoors. I still don't know what it should give. Unfortunately, maybe? Yes, this production is unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Louisa's player was really terrible. He screams, slips, strangles and jumps around like a twelve-year-old sick man (my apologies for twelve years reading it) that I am looking forward to the moment he strikes himself. How this behavior is to attract an adult man is beyond me. Most would be back when he first opened his mouth to fuck and eat. <br /> <br /> An actor who plays for Captain Wentworth depicts someone as wonderful and colorless as to wonder why every woman could pine for eight years. > <br /> Joining a pair at the end is not convincingly made or explained. How did they come together again? Not because Louisa was in a coma; it has been confirmed. No, there must be more and not explained in the movie. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the production of two stars: one because it is Austen's work and the other because some of the outdoor conditions were beautiful. The only reason I looked at the whole production was that I was ill with the flu and got it from the library. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed this book, check out the 1995 version of Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I recommend this movie even if you haven't read the book.
