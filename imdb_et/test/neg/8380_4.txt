First, few colleges allow students to take courses from their parent's lover. Secondly, some female professors sleep with dorm chefs. Third, in some brasses there is a father who bakes his dormitory. Fourth, when another member of the College's small group project team meets with violent death, the College PRESIDENT dissipates the whole class and DO NOT pay attention, because the professor will happily rejoice the rest of the group towards deaths. Since CULT's supernatural elements don't make any sense, it's useful to study the daily content of this movie to really understand how much this flick really sucks!
