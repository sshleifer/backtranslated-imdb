Although it was the first documentary that I have seen on Hunter S. Thompson, it was the best, despite the involvement of big star events such as Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Gary Busey and some others. I stopped it and it was a bit interesting. What I was looking at was some old clips from fear and fear in Las Vegas and where Buffalo roam. Not so good, mostly because of the rambling of old boys and things that every fan already knew. I still think they milked it, because it could have been compressed by at least half. Still, if your fan would like something for you that is related to the hunter. best wishes
