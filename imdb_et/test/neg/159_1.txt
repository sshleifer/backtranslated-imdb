This film does not succeed in every census. At first it is pretentious, trying to be "significant" and unsuccessful. The script was extremely banal, nobody said something very interesting. No characters were impossible to take care of. The knight was a waste of time, while Sienna Miller was just a waste of time. A small soldier in war was a cliché even before the film's conciliation. The use of World War II as a backdrop was in itself a cliché ... bombs, shelters for piping systems, etc., used to import a little needed drama. Why did somebody think for a moment that this film was worthy is far from my understanding. It was another case that "we can look for authenticity, never a story, a scenario or an actor!"
