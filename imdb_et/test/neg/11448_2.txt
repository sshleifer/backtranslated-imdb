I've seen this movie n I can say it's a really bad movie. The director's lost nuts ... of course .. he knows a lot about the military, but then he's definitely a cheap man. The film also has very technical errors ... <br /> <br /> Okay ... here's my suspicion - finally, when they save the family (including just raping a girl) ... why are they leaving them out of there? I didn't see ambulance! There are many aspects of the film that are real ... but then I just want the major to have told / helped / helped some other good director who made the film. <br /> <br /> Mohanla definitely deserves a better director!
