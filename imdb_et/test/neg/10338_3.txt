This fourth film, "Angel Guts", which only takes a few minutes more than an hour (it just looks much longer) is also the shortest, perhaps just as well as it does without the series. , the department store secretary is interested in second part-time work. Her co-worker at the department store introduces her to the model of "pornography" called "red porn". But when his other employers discovered his naughty pictures, they decide to release him. And he gets some unwanted admirer. Oh yes and she likes to masturbate ..ALOT. Using different household products. Wall and wall sheet masks hide the absence of a noticeable plot and push it too much into a usable area, but not surprisingly, although its director is Toshiharu Ikeda ("Evil Dead Trap", "Beautiful Prey"). Maybe his feelings just didn't fit into Angel Guts's movie. <br /> <br /> My Class: D <br /> <br /> DVD Additions: Jasper Sharp Comment; Bio / filmography; 36-minute interview with Toshiharu Ikedaga; Original sleeve; and 4 other Angel Guts Films (High School Co Ed, Red Classroom, Red Vertigo, and Red Porno) are all available in Artsmagik's Box Set, but for some reason there is no 6th "Angel Guts: Red Flash" set
