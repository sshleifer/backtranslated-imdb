What is dealing with those ethnic criminal groups that are copying films related to the Italian Mafia? We all know Godfather like Don Vito Corleone, now we have this Mexican one that is just a little copy. I do not understand why other ethnic groups have to mimic and imitate Italian mobile, but it certainly makes them foolish. They certainly seem to be Italians. I would prefer the Mexicans to make their own ideas there and would like to see their culture and how they do it, instead of copying the ideas of the godfather's trilogy. Moreover, the film was disappointing, seeing that the Mexicans were acting and trying to be Italians, this is not my business. After watching it, I now look at the "real" godfather so that this movie can be deleted from memory.
