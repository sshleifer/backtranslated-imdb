Guy Pearce looks and acts like the Calvin Klein underwear model or one of the bimbo boys who wear Levi jeans and are facing the Buffalo cattle because they realize that Buffalo like Levi. Guy Pearce looks in every scene as he says, "Look at me, I'm so beautiful!" As a hero, his character is complete. For every scene that requires courage, Pearce gets a short tip. SPOILERS: At the end of the movie, this clever book-worm is packed with a Pope-like Morlocks who can drive and jump along the walls (like Spiderman). At the same time, TIME MACHINE seems to cause some kind of nuclear pressure that sweeps through the valley. Oddly enough, Pearce and his gal-palm Mumba are the last Morlock to be killed; seconds later Pearce, Mumba and the tribe look up the valley for the safety of their hill. Now that it's fast, !!! Jeremy Irons is King of Morlock. He really makes the movie a lot better. Mumba, a model-turned actor, is not very cute, and she doesn't do much in this movie. Scenes from the 1900s lack any real atmosphere. Although dress and vehicles of the period have been shown, characters like cartoons act on how they depict the walking and talking of the people of the 1900s. The original version of this movie was much better in this respect. The period characters were much more realistic and they were much better. The original version of this movie changed PAST looks like the basics of the characters. The new version lacks content and feel. The scenes where Pearce is dealing with Emma's death and then not saving her from her destiny are very good. The issue of cannibal morls is not very well explained and it does not make sense that they have a big dark butcher shop full of knives and cutlery, but they have never been used with weapons other than a shotgun. There is also great water, full of water and bones. All through the underground walk Morlocks everywhere chewing muscles bones. So how can all these skeletons be in the well? It seems there are some Morlocks that Bar-B-Que your people and eat them on the grill and other Morlocks just like filleted meat ?? And where are the toilets of all these creatures? When I looked at dozens of Morlocks who were gorging on human muscles, it happened to me that they had to have a very well-developed toilet and water supply system, considering that they hit a lot of bones. All these issues were never addressed. At the end of the movie, Pearce is in the hands of Mumba, but you see that she is facing her friend Manding. Another completely irritating thing about this movie is LION KING music, which is in the background. When Pearce arrives in the future (802,710 a.d.); The LION KING music never ends, and every time the natives are, is the African Moaning Singer (Is it Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon)? I looked at the credit at the end of the movie, and the jungle music isn't exactly defined, but I think Elton John should probably look into this issue. Time Machine was a mediocre film with a good FX. Look at it once, forget it.
