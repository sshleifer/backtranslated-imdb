First of all, I'm a spooky fan. But this "Tobe Cooper" production (fire, man from the original Texas Chainsaw and Poltergeist!) Was lower, even for the fan. Action was not bad at all, some characters were incredible, but the leading ladies were OK. The story was something we've seen a hundred times, without a surprising twist or anything. Never be exciting or intense or think of any special effects other than spraying blood. Scary zombie kids have white palms with dark eyes and this is it. It could have been working in the early 70s but not now. Director J.S. Cardone did not do a good job of holding the arbitration, halfway there is the risk that you will fall asleep. My voice is mainly based on leadership factors, but it could easily have been called the 8th Corn: from corn fields to mines.
