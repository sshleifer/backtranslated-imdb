Well, of course, everyone has the right to have an opinion on the matter ... everything. The presentation was interesting: black and white film, 1968, student manifestations, general strike, young people, ideals, love ..... etc. Sorry, but I didn't feel love, ROMANCE. A lover who is all right, that his girlfriend sleeps anybody? Is this love? But not only was the movie very long and without a reason I had to watch the film several times because I just lost interest. I was expecting something to happen but ....... NOT. The only thing I was impressed with during the film: the streets playing gypsy violin, yes, it was nice. I don't think art should be complicated, encrypted, hidden in secret, confused. Great disappointment and waste of time!
