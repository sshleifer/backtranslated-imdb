I never wanted to see Venom, but I got this cable. It has good elements. Louisiana sex atmosphere one, something we unfortunately do not see in the movies very much, because Hurricane Katrina. It is based on an interesting concept, a common man who is enthusiastic about the evil spirit. His confrontation with his son could have been interesting, as well as many movies. But as usual in Hollywood, it's an interesting idea to get to know a familiar one: <br /> <br /> Kill all the characters by saving a good girl, starting with a black boy. I am a fan of Agnes Bruckner, but other characters, the villain mentioned above, CeCe, who must become a voodoo priest, are more interesting. And for God's love, I just want to see that the virgin can kill. We all like a simple girl, why can't she live? In this case, it was Bijou Phillips and we love him. <br /> <br /> The end did not make sense with regard to the invincibility of the attack. All the carnage and atmosphere, and that brings something.
