- So a weak excuse for a general waste of time waste involves a man who wants to be an animator but does not get his career. His super hot woman is more successful and he doesn't seem to care that he is a loser, but he is not happy with it and wants to get out of his life. One day, the dog brings a magic mask that changes his life. Unfortunately, he is looking for God's magic mask and if he finds a man with a mask, he tries to get it back, and that's the whole story. If it seems exciting to you, someone has to throw you water to wake you up. <br /> <br /> - This movie is terrible. There is no other way for me to say that, and I just can't stretch it. The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman who played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot, but besides her there is nothing about the movie that is worth watching. I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic, but what about adults who have to see their kids in this trash. Why do we have to suffer through this horrible vomiting bag. The original mask was a very good film with great comedy and great story. It's a crazy movie-making attempt by cinematic filmmakers and a ridiculous BO decision I think the franchise won't go any further. <br /> <br /> - The operator must be beaten seriously because the sweet colors of the movie make you feel like throwing. When there was music, I didn't pay attention to it because I had already split my headphones to prevent myself from listening to the fearful dialogue. Then it is here, or at least what works today. you could look at commercial information and see much better action than in this movie, but I can't really blame the actors because it's the director who deserves the accusation because I don't understand that the actors have to take another f ** shoe. When a new line wants to launch this franchise, they have to pick up their game by hiring writers who actually write and don't think the audience looks all out. <br /> <br /> You are sadomasochistic and you love torture yourself, please please check all the tools as it is painful to look at, but if you are not and you really want to watch movies that are good then avoid at all costs
