Dick and Jane Harper (Jim Carrey, Téa Leoni) stop working when Dick is working, caught in a corruption scandal and after trying desperately and unsuccessfully trying to find a job, the duo is turning to crime to get them out of poverty. <br /> <br /> I've always been a fan of Jim Carrey. It has been a while since it has made a straight comedy. The latter was Bruce Almighty, which was pretty good. He has proven to be able to make serious dramas, but comedy is his real element. Fun with Dick and Jane proves he still has. Although the film was funny, it was still a disappointment. It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. It's worth looking at once, although unlike most of Carrey's films, it doesn't have a good repeat value. Part of the problem is the script. I was surprised that the script was weak because it was the same man who made forty years old virgin. Some jokes just fall flat and at other times they seem too harsh. If Jim Carrey wasn't, this film would be much worse. <br /> <br /> Next to Jim Carrey is Téa Leoni. She's a good actress, but she's just not very funny. She didn't fit well with Carrey and she seemed to be calling her performance. They should have gone with someone. Supportive pain includes Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins and Aaron Michael Jenkins. The latter plays Billy Harper and actually produces a decent result. He was not as annoying as most of the child's letters. Alec Baldwin was fine and Richard Jenkins tried too hard to be funny. Frankly, I am a bit biased here. The film was quite average, but I liked it because of Jim Carrey's performance. Jim Carrey fans should enjoy it, but that's it. Finally, having fun with Dick and Jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes, but not particularly memorable. Rating 6/10
