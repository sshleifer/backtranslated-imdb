Danny Glover and Carey Elwes obviously forgot how to act when they made this movie, acting completely awful. Paying is even worse. I regret Danny Glover, I hope he paid for it well, because it makes him completely stupid, the same goes for Mr Elwes. Despicable. This is probably the worst example of veteran actors I've ever seen. I don't know if they looked at the script, or if they did, they must have said that you forget everything you know because it makes these two ridiculous. The behavior of the two experienced veterans is terrible, I hope the wage control was very high, I thought it was a scam at first. If you find the satisfaction of this movie, you will have more power.
