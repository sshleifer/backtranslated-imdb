Shemp discovers that he must inherit a million dollars if he is married within 24 hours. Considering how harsh he sees and his personality, it is not surprising that he does not get a creditor - that is, until an article appears on the paper explaining his contradiction - at what point are five terrible women who are not required to have their new Ukko (plus money) , of course). <br /> <br /> Although I don't hate the Three Stooges and want to look at their shorts sometimes, they never came closer to Buster Keaton's brilliant comedy the best day. That's why I didn't like this movie because it was the ripoff of Keaton's masterpiece SEVEN CHANCES. In Stooges, Columbia Pictures was not uncommon to steal old comedy plots or recycle older Stooge shorts. So, from the outset, this film is a pale imitation of the original. It is also evident that this film lacks the charm and nuance of the original, and that the gags generally appear to be very compulsive (especially the phone cab scene). However, the cousin Basil was a bit cute and funny - though far from fine! But the worst aspect of the film was not a very funny conclusion. In the Keaton version, hundreds of women seemed to marry her and the action became very fast and furious - all this was left in one small room and she had no comic punch that ended with a fan. <br /> <br /> In general, boring is restored. Also, before marking this review "don't help", be sure to check out the first one to see what I'm talking about - then you decide.
