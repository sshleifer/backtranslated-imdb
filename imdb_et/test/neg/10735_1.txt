I get over the political parody; even if it would be the "masters of horrors". <br /> <br /> But what I can't switch over is the brutal use of our war heroes (and their sacrifice) as cautious in some laundries. to Horror Maker Political Statement. <br /> <br /> It was just offensive to me to destroy Arlington and our heroes. I have a family in Arlington. The idea that this guy (Dante) even depicts the disturbance of Arlington's tombs makes me just dress up. <br /> <br /> I've done with Dante and done MOH.
