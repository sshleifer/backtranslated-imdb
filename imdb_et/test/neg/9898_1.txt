I wish I had read IMDb comments before the movie. The first 1 hour was OK, though it made me wonder why everyone in the middle of Chicago was and why no one reported weather conditions outside the US. Individual natural acts (such scope) are unthinkable. But after the first 60 minutes, the film just pulls like an endless story. The scenario is terrible. Like actors, a very bad choice. Only people who have been hired in panic are next to their roles. But I have to agree that this film has some good special effects. If you have rented it from a DVD and you want to watch the movie despite it, play it at the maximum speed your player promises!
