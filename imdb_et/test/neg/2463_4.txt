"Once again, we have a film that wraps around 20 minutes of entertainment - much of it is the band's occasional funny words - a 90-minute package." For anyone who is old enough to remember it, it's like the first "Bill and Ted" without the story. If that's not enough about how this movie is meaningless, think about Jack Black's song for about 20 minutes and it's his sales point. If you really want to listen to Tenacious D because of your musical ability, then tap yourself and buy a soundtrack. Don't waste that time with it. If your stoner is looking for a good smile with a bad smile, you still have the wrong tree grip. No matter what the strength of your buds, you still want to see your grandmother again.
