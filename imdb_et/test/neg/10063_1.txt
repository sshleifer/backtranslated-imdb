Manufacturers Golan and Globus should have been ashamed to disclose this trash. I know it sounds good, but compared to this, the first "Hercules" of 1983 has developed into a mature and exciting epic! This "sequel" is moral, inexpensive, irrevocable, childish, fake, intuitive, and BADLY ACTED. A landmark in a bad cinema and one of the few little movies I saw that MAY be worthy of the lowest rating: no stars!
