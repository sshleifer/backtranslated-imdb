The next stop on our journey through the calendar-slasher scene is ... oh yeah, "Ending Day"! All those seniors who are simply able and ready to step out into the real world and become adults. But this is when they can stop it without getting into the campus running around, going out of the pupils with the sword of their fence ... Yes, it all comes from watching high school who clots blood during the race and a year later his parent returns Sister to finish the Navy. The track trainer has accused and animals in his descended state of the shop class, while the girl's boyfriend is still dying one year later ... All these characters are the main candidates for the "Serial Number of the Year" and you just have to sit through this movie to find out who did it . "The Day of Completion" is fun, although it is not in any way properly binding and there are not many memorable events, but there is enough time to attract you lightly. Like Linnea Quigley's music teacher screwing and breaking with 30-year-old teenage players and of course ... Rollerdisco! I have to love this mess! You can do much worse than "Finish Day", kids ...
