The third stabilization of Franco Zeffirell ("Rome and Rome and" Julia "," Nazareth Jesus "," Othello ") when Shakespeare is screened works very well with Mel Gibson (" Mad Max ")" "Lethal Weapon" and Pre- "Christ's Passion "which had previously belonged to Sir Laurence Olivier (and rightly so; see my review of his" Hamlet ", supposedly the best Bard's timeless interpretation) (and most quoted) tragedies) and Kenneth Branaghi five years later in full-blooded treatment, explaining this 3-hour 22 -minute driving time, combined with a dream (and many little additions that were well-chosen and expertly done by William Shakespeare's modern master Kenneth Branagh, "Henry V" and "Dead Again". Joining the "Lethal Weapon" star is Glenn Close (" The Big Chill), Paul Scofield ("A Man All Seasons"), Alan Bates, Ian Holm, Michael Maloney (cast against Roderigo against Kenneth Branag) h and Laurence Fishburne Oliver Parker "Othellos" (see my review of the "production" version of the Olivier tragedy, though he only starred in it) and who Branagh put Laertes into his 3-hour version of Hamlet (a Sir Laurence Olivier and his classic game; see also my review of this) 5 years later), Nathaniel Parker (who would be in the version of the four-year-old brother Othello in Cassio) and Helena Bonham-Carter, poured into "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" 4 years later. <br /> <br /> Zeffirelli saw this movie as a tribute to Sir Laurence Olivier (who had died 2 years before this movie) and it works mostly well. What I was a little uncomfortable was Zeffirell's misplacement and in one scene, he gave one Hamlet to Ghost Helena Bonham-Carter DOES NOT convince me of Opheliana. She was too boring and unrealistic, while Jean Simmons (who was immortalized in Olivier's version) and Kate Winslet (who did acceptable work with Kenneth Branagh's uncircumcised "Hamlet" recycle) Simmons is BEST Ophelia ever, so he was named the best actor in 1948 (he didn't win what the shame was.) Ian Holm said his lines too fast, not slowly, k swim with him waiting, Laertes and Ophelia. But then again, I am accustomed to interpreting the role of Felix Aylmer and Richard Brier, and I think they did better jobs than Holm in their respective Hamlet versions (both made by big leaders, actors, text editors) from all Bard works producers and stars), Polonius. <br /> <br /> The rest was great. The scene where Hamlet stands against his mother was very well done, but Olivier and Branagh raised the scene to a better length to create even more emotional intensity and tension that the scene needs. <br /> <br /> I recommend this version just to pass time, but it is perfect for 12-grade English teachers (I suggest you first show Olivier version, then Branaghi and finally this version). Despite the rating of the movie "PG", there was really no objection in the film. Only what you played. <br /> <br /> Hamlet's best versions are: <br /> <br /> # 1 Sir Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh. Both were so good that I can't decide which one was the best. See reviews of these versions for more information. # 2 by Franco Zeffirelli. That was all right. It started right with a scene that was not in the game, but should then move on to the beginning of the real game where the guard shouts, "Who is there?" "No, answer me. Stand and discover yourself!" This scene scares you from hell because you sit quietly and then bam! In short, this scene sets the tone for the rest of the game. The part of Zeffirell was misspelled to exclude this scene. Also, many rows (and others I think they should have placed) were misplaced, like a line where Hamlet says to Ophelia, "Take you to the nun, why would you be a sinner?" this line was supposed to take place on this scene, not where it was placed on the film (after "be or not to be" soliloquy. This version fights too much or too little withdrawal from the excellent literature. Kenneth Branagh would fix it 5 years later with a tragedy unmodified, changing HIS version of Sir Laurence Olivier, as several actors (aside) were performing "stage" or "Hamlet", but Zeffirell's "Hamlet" is loyal to the game and what I was looking for. In the Branagh versions, but that the Branagh version was more violent than the previous two faithful versions (more in line with the game; Olivier emphasized it ... and it worked equally well) and stayed closer to the game when Branagh scored some harmless to his own ... good effect. <br /> <br /> This version has not been rated.
