I'm not quite sure I agree with this version of Scarlet Pimperel. I imagined Sir Percy Blakeney being a very calm, seemingly lazy aristocrat. This particular Sir Percy Blakeney seems to be full of energy and volatility. I did not appreciate Houdin, James Bond, what is possible for the Impossible mission to not be accessible by Sir Percy. In earlier versions, there was an escape tool, not a technology. Also, the characters in Marguerite and Chauvelin are not adequately represented. There was little energy or chemistry in the interactions between characters. <br /> <br /> I don't want to blame you, because perhaps the reason why my film doesn't like it can just be a different interpretation. If the director's interpretation coincided with me, I might not be irritated by what seemed to me to depict bad characters. <br /> <br /> I preferred the 1982 version. Anthony Andrews was quite effective as an effortless, calm fop. So were Jane Seymour and Ian McKellen. In my opinion, the piece of this period seems to have disappeared with the last adjustment of it. I recommend sticking to previous versions, either with the 1934 or 1982 versions. <br /> <br />
