I found that Ricci's character in this film was impossible. If he had to be depressive, I think the scriptwriter and the director continued the depressive studies before the film, because Ricci's character was more self-centered, valuable! The image of the bag as a victim of depression and surviving. /> <br /> Forcing an introspective narrative was just as ridiculous as the painful relationships between him and the people around him. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I couldn't buy it. This is a direct video clip. I'm glad I didn't pay for it.
