This movie tried something but failed. All the attempts to stop were cheap and there were so many tired tricks and plot holes that I finally laughed at and am having fun all the way. At least I was entertained. The spirits are trying to warn the family, so why do they attack a girl whose name I didn't remember. And what was black and white at first? I know what they were trying to do, but they were far away. And where the hell was that guy (John Corbett's character) coming from? It just hurts loose where in a wide area. And why did he suddenly lose it when the slaves came? And when the slaves were the manifestation of his family's spirits, why did they attack him when he made him kill the family? Dont understand. There is no point in doing so much in this film, and the actor is not too beautiful in the character of the main girl. It's not terrible, but a bit like his child's movie days. So all this movie was not brilliant, but I had time to hang it, and sometimes it's all a horror movie. Entertainment, not quality.
