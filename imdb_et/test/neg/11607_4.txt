The big problem with this movie was that Lombard's character was "unnecessarily cruel" according to another user. Lombard plays the role of Ann Krausheimer Smith, who believes he is married to David Smith, played by Robert Montgomery, a well-dressed but appropriately worshiper. The movie has some funny moments, especially when Montgomery's character is very long to try to get her "wife" back. It is understandable that he is upset because the marriage is technically not legal, but he finds only three years. <br /> <br /> The character of Lombard seems to be his "husband" sincere attempt to make it back. Although Montgomery is not very adept at this, Montgomery is still a very loving, but Lombard is still as cool as the ice pillar. There are hardly any clues that point to any reconciliation between the warring couple for most of the film, and in this aspect it is hard to see any comedy, even dark comedy. To some extent, the film refers to the almost sadistic undertone, the Lombard character gets out of his wife's weak efforts. Although one might consider this second "Sex Battle" -type movie, the reality is that it is a very lush battle if it: Montgomery's character, though certainly flawed, is not wrong enough to make it a typical masculine example of showcase / misogyn (its excellent for example, Michael Douglas "In the Roses War"). In fact, this character is largely feminine, as is not only apparent in the Montgomery sharp dress (which probably owes much to the prematurely dressed actor himself), but also to his discomfort when he is not trying to play a role. feminine undergraduate studies. His only big mistake is his vanity, but this mistake does not counterbalance his partner's excessive cruelty. And there is no suggestion that he is unconsciously trying to bring something jealous of love. It makes it so cruel and sad. Montgomery's character just seems weak. In reality, no woman wants the man to be as weak as she "would not wear married pants". But then again, a woman who is wearing a marriage trouser never wants to be so cruel that she has confirmed this role early on. So the whole subject seems strange. This film is not a champion of feminism (Lombard's character shows some of the 60's independent-oriented women, but this idea will soon be canceled and the character will fall back to the 1940s), or a homogeneous battle of sex (as Montgomery's character is indeed masculine and therefore lost). <br /> <br /> This film is a blast on the surface, but under this plywood is really much darker, sadistic undertones. All this makes your resolution well odd. (Maybe it was a strange point?). In any case, it's not a movie.
