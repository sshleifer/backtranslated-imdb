This movie was terrible and the only reason it was done was that the story turned to the far left. I find my temper modest, so I saw this movie as a garbage pile. Although I'm not a Bush fan, your desire for GW is not a good reason to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> To get started, this low-quality movie was cheap, rather artistic. In addition, the signs are deeply deficient. Chris Cooper's character was George Bush's poor parody; better suited for a Saturday night, a dramatic film. The rest of the characters go to the clich√©s and have bad faxes from other characters in much better films. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs!
