If you want to watch movies because they are beautiful, then you should do it. If you want to watch movies that start with a good boy who is trying to grab a bad boy, let's expose the clues to each movie's motive, skip it. At the end of the movie, I still didn't know why Stargher killed the women as he did. If you are such a ritual killer, it would be nice to know where the rituals come from. In Dreams there was a similar real movie with a serum killer that wasn't the best, but at least how she killed the girls. They also hinted at Vaughn's character in a dark background, but did not explain, did not really say why Lopez's child psychologist was so much better suited to this task than the rest of the people surveyed, did not give much explanation for the small child problem, etc. If the rest of the story is convincing, I don't care about the details of how Stargher gave all the fancy electronic devices and underground chambers, or why the FBI didn't check if he had any other assets or had access to the roads when they waited to see Whether the whole innocent's entry would work, but I like to understand what motivates the serum killer in the shooter movie when he kills in such a complicated way.
