The participants were not believable, the story was really weak, full of juice and completely predictable. Really frustrated Depardieus. It was disgraceful that they did not focus more on the Canadian fight for independence. We've seen this love story many times before, but with better actors! We had to wait for a little drama in the last 15 minutes! The soundtrack was completely annoying. Underlining hit you with sentimentality. But really up. The only thing we found was that the Indians spoke their language. And we found the Indian cinematography relatively realistic.
