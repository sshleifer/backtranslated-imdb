I would never have heard "auteur" from Neil Johnson before I saw "Battlespace" on a Hollywood Video DVD. For a few minutes I understand that it's not bad. Like many other Sci-Fi video films, this film is largely dominated by bad special effects and a constant paradise of brilliant sci-fi concepts that do not create the story. <br /> <br /> Viewers are tortured by a religiously speaking textual introduction, followed by an oral introduction, followed by a narrative of the main character's daughter. It seemed to me that it seemed like a smoke screen to hide the film militarily with ugly vision and near zero pressure. Some of the people here seem too willing to take this movie seriously and swallow its seemingly new era of hook and sink. These favorable reviews must come from similar people who might think that things like "Battlefield Earth" are a great movie or Shasta is as good as Coke. <br /> <br /> Those who were covered by the art of cheese are attracted unexpectedly (in small doses, with long blocks that don't speak), rotten computer animated effects (especially in high doses) and irritating computers. What you can't do is excitement, emotional stimulation, memorable dialogue or a good story. <br /> <br /> "Battlespace" is an impenetrable bull and its constant irritating irritation proves it. True science fiction, hell, true filmmaking is about the characters and their dialogue, not the special effects and the dull predictions. It is directly similar to sci-fi like "Cl.One" and "Recon 2022". If the "Strange Horizons" and "Alien Visitor" boredom is something you are looking for, check out this crap. If you have good storytelling and hatred for fake lenses, you are better off with a real movie.
