The Planet Earth has suffered a terrible environmental disaster, so that mankind lives only underground that is divided into different religious cultures. What caused the disaster? I have no clue? why is mankind divided into different ecclesial factions? I have no clue. Since the Earth's surface can no longer support human life, how can people grow crops to feed the population? I have no clue. Which manufacturer thought this scenario was worth financing? I have no idea <br /> <br /> SHEPHERD is one of those films that slides on cable television late in the evening. This is a movie where you consult with IMBb to see if it has any benefits. The number of people who commented on SHEPHERD on this page has not yet doubled and this is a film that appeared nine years ago. Maybe people who have never seen it are happy? <br /> <br /> For the rest of the plot, it's very routine. Dirty ex-policeman Boris Dakota, whose wife and child died several years earlier, meets his wife and his child, and his job is to save his life, almost like a futuristic west. Throw a former wrestler who is now running on God's channel, a fascist Christian bloc who is trying to ventriloquist Bor, some R & D, for the sake of it, and you have a mess of film. I think that after Neil Marshall sees DOOMSDAY, it may be a cinema masterpiece
