The King James Mars is a mystifying film. I can't think of what he was supposed to be. This is the story of a young man called Elvis, played by Gael Garcia Bernal, who receives a respectable approval after 3 years of naval service, and then goes to find his biological Father and behaves unfairly with him and his family. It's all pretty sick. Elvis believes she is going to the family when she attracts her 16-year-old sister Malerie (Pell James). In this film, it is quite impossible to identify here in the Middle East. Teacher Father and Hell of a Happy Christian Congregation; I couldn't work out if the film was meant for their arbitrary belief. Or the goal is a happy family and we have to think that it is not viable. OR it's just saying that some people have disappeared and just hell has been destroyed. It's low. We all know that bad things happen; an interesting bit is to learn why this film is just violence without ever bringing it. "King" is such a lost opportunity. There are really interesting questions about honor; warrior code; changing changing concepts; killing honor in Indian families and so on. Respect is a very diverse concept. But this film does not give any thought to the idea. But Paul Projection did more than his little role. The DVD projector showed all the movies in green and the only way to fix it was that it was sent to Belgium. He did it during Christmas. I think these postmen and repairers and Paul went beyond the job and our reward was this shameful film. But can you see it differently?
