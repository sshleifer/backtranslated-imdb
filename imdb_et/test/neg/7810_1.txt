I was interested in the nasty boss, as I am, and the actual boss's daughter was attractive and interesting to see even the younger Ashton Kushner, but the film is so clean that I had to turn it off. Watching it was a waste of time. When people started peeing the whole living room, it was too much to watch. Painful, terrible crap movie. If they had softened it a little. Are there really people who find it funny and enjoy it? It was easier to know that IMDb readers were so low. The career side of the story was intriguing, as well as the young man trying to get the promotion and win the bosses in favor. I liked this part. The train's co-operation with colleagues was also cool because I like the characters of his co-worker. If you get non-sensory movies on your stomach or you are pretty young, this may be the one you get on your stomach.
