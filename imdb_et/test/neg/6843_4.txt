Ireland's most fertile man turns around Eamon Manley, who is 24 years old and is still a virgin. She lives with her mother in Belfast. He is also a very shy man for women. Eamon has all the changes when a woman has seduced her (as far as I remember a neighbor). It is not because he loses his innocence, but he discovers that he has superpower. Despite being protected, this is a neighbor pregnant. Your doctor will tell him that he has a very high sperm count. His mother comes up with an idea that makes us see ginger-stricken children at the end of the movie. She will help women on both sides of Belfast to imagine the children. The first volunteer, then with the help of his colleague, leads the company. Ireland's most fertile person is in his funny moments but needs better jokes and a better script. I couldn't think it gave me the impression of television, not the movie. Kris Marshall has a different name on the silver screen but does not look like a star. This is the kind of guy you saw in such and such a movie. As he really loved (I think he was very funny at this point) .. Well, it was okay to look, but he couldn't fall off from time to time. ** at the end *****
