Unbelievable. I didn't see anything like that. Everything is bad; really bad. Photography (many scenes without focus) for the actress (a young woman is terrible). And what can we say about those helicopters made in Paint Brush ...? Really amazing B, I mean, Z movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is bad, cliche and bad wrote. The main convenience of the scenario seems to be working. I can't even think that a young filmmaker is making this movie. Nothing justifies it. <br /> <br /> I even suggest you see this movie. Sleeping or playing lonely is the best choice. ;) <br /> <br /> xxx
