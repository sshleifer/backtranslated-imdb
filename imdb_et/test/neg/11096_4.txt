If you thought it was a French mommy and if you hope another "Vidocq" ... look elsewhere. It has the same story as The Mummy, which concerns the book of the dead and the soul that needs to find the 7 missing pieces scattered in the Louvre. I found the film a little fun and boring. The special effects are not bad, but it is not remarkable when I was expecting great explosions and maybe the Eiffel Tower would break until I realized that these scenes were in The Mummy and that is Belhpegor. Obviously Belphegor relied so much better on the French cultural tradition. I just voted this movie 4/10 for the beautiful Sophie Marceau ... she must be almost 40 and she looks breathtaking!
