and generally you have to look at this little pearl in the end. Describing how I changed my sex or Glen or Glendat, as it is better known, I have to repeat Andrew Smith's thoughts as he wrote when he wrote â€œIf you haven't seen any of Ed Wood's second films, it's a totally amazing experience if you're have seen some Ed Wood movie, it is still absolutely amazing. The film is so fun and tragic, but it moves with a rather strange rhythm that casts doubt on its author's knowledge and meaning of every word he speaks in his current length. Wooden, blessing him, was one of the most important ambitions as a director who wanted to promote peace, understanding and even acceptance in the 1950s. When Tim Burton revived Glen Or Glenda's viewing studio capture, he showed that they were laughing and telling each other that it was supposed to happen. More than fifty years later, there are still people who struggle only to give the respect that "normal" is taken for granted, so I will certainly not. <br /> <br /> No, true comedy in Glen or Glendas is pure injustice. Directors often use cinematic footage when they find out what fits their goals, and they can be modified to fit with their film footage. Ed Wood used the film material indiscriminately, and Tim Burton biologically celebrated the scene where Wood, as Johnny Depp played, contributed to making the entire movie. Unfortunately, actual Ed Wood died before he had the chance, but Glen Or Glenda is his closest. IMDb claims that twenty percent of this sixty-minute film is equipped with film material and it is never difficult to guess what material. Recorded highways, overhead airplanes, bad flash effects, soldiers who do their thing are all useless, sometimes repetitive, and often have only an open connection to the story Wood is trying to say. If Wood had been able to sit and think about what he was trying to do for a while, he wouldn't say what he would have achieved. <br /> <br /> The wood itself in the movie appears as a title character, a confusing transvestite who depicts himself as a woman called Glenda. Besides the courage with which he tries to make his point, Wood makes one ridiculous wife. Having discovered myself in a society that thinks I am "disabled" and what I have to "treat" myself, I found honestly that I hope for the best of Wood's character. However, to make the point, the short stories of the two other transvestites are wooded. One of them takes an extreme step to staying sex change to become a woman, the other finds itself so unfair that she is afraid to arrest so much that she commits suicide. The frightening thing about this movie is that if you edit transvestism and replace disenfranchions like your position in the autistic spectrum or things like schizophrenia, very little movie has to be changed. So little society has learned because Ed Wood was a boy. <br /> <br /> Another important person in Glen Or Glenda is Bela Lugos, who has been wrapped in wood. Speculation depends on Wood's motives, but the accepted theory is that Wood wanted to help revive the Lugos career and do something about it. Except that it takes time to carefully build up a good movie, that is. Glen Or Glendas uses the use of Wood Lugos, which is best described as "odd" in Flying Saucers Over Hollywood. Lugosi plays a character that is counted as a scientist, but goes beyond the almighty dollhead. People who have not seen Ed Wood's films before the biopsies think Tim Burton "warned against a big green dragon at your fingertips". If anything, Burton was supposed to stick to what a strange speech in the wood-dialogue. Nothing can prepare you to see the speeches in your original context, not even Criswell's fun ranting during the 9th Space Plan. <br /> <br /> The remarkable types also represent the presence of Delore Fuller, Wood's girlfriend. Again, Burton dramatizes his reaction to the first vision of the script, while the film depicts him as accepting and thinking for the future. I can't help but feel Burton's portrayal is more accurate because Fuller looks very uncomfortable in his role. He only appears in about fifteen minutes, but his delivery seems so mechanical, so inanimate that he can somehow feel less talented than his companions when such a thing is possible. Whether Wood's direction was better oriented than usual in this case, it is difficult to identify, but if the capability of leaving the stars (except for Bela obviously) is any guideline, then it should be no surprise that Fuller appears in a very small amount of other wood. Because he wrote several hits, he says he made the right decision to stay behind the camera. Although Wood appeared in front of the camera, it was never as much as a cam, entrance or a little bit. <br /> <br /> I gave Glen or Glendale one out of ten. As a rule, I will only give this assessment to films that are so bad that they will become entertainment. With heavy and good will like Glen Or Glenda, this description is suitable for T.
