I'm speechless, frankly, I don't understand how anyone could have allowed such a script, let alone tell a movie. The fact that I write this review is offensive to my fingers, this movie must be thrown into the trash, not reviewed. I'm frustrated at Flex Alexandre to even think of accepting such a POOR EXCUSE FOR SCRIPT, let alone a role. OMG! I think I just insulted the word "essay" ... yes yes I did. What you know, the less you talk about this pointless drivel, the better. You have been warned, no one warned me that I had to experience the horror myself. SEE YOUR RISK.
