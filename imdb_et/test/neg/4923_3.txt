The fact that a movie is on a DVD does not guarantee that its quality is very good. The fact that the quality of the film is coarse does not mean that you should not buy it. This review actually applies to two movies related to a single DVD. <br /> <br /> Plots of these films have little effect. These are only interesting for people who collect Holmes movies? someone who just wants some better deals would be good to buy some of Jeremy Brett's products? or a pinch of Basil Rathbone. There are still some very good Holmes movies with one-time good actors? such as "seven per cent solution" or "Sherlock Holmes privacy". In any case, these films are much less appreciated. <br /> <br /> Here we have a couple of movies with some of Holmes' best actors, even if the results tend to be disappointing. This seems to be the only disc with these films (although "Deadly Necklace") appears in itself in the same version on other discs. In 1962, though it doesn't sound or sound. Some who have seen it may be surprised to know that it was produced by Hammer Studios. Not that Hammer really was left, but when Christopher Lee was worried, they usually did a better job. The print has a direct transfer from a pretty worn out 1: 1.33 copy in black and white. The quality of the color indicates that the original may be colored, and the ends of the film indicate that it may be 1: 1.66 or more. <br /> <br /> The film was set in the early 20th century Century? it is not unlikely that Holmes worked then (and did not actually die until 1957). However, the scenario is not adapted to any actual Doyle story. It includes Egyptian necklaces and Professor Moriarty appears as a world-famous archaeologist as well as a crime prince. The plot is melodic and banal. The biggest drawback of this movie is that ?? for any incomprehensible reason? Hammer filmed it in Germany. However, it was filmed in English. It was then dubbed in German and then duplicated in English. So what do you hear is not Lee or any other original actor, just a few unknowns? not that outside of Lee, I doubt someone would know other participants. It's too bad because Lee (see his "Baskerville hound") makes a pretty decent Holmes. As he is, his voice is a double and mild pudding that does not contain raisins or cinnamon. Too bad no one thought of ragtime. As it is, music is not related to an on-screen event and is often in conflict with action. , starring young Raymond Massey. The quality of the picture and sound is fully in line with the efforts of 1962 and actually a little right. Massey makes Holmes quite honorable, though he certainly doesn't own the Rathbone Road and Brett. Other manufacturers involved in this production are unlikely to be of interest to modern readers. Acting? like many films from this period? owes much to the Victorian stage and silent films. former film. <br /> <br /> There is very little to say about this movie. The settings seem to be a strange combination of the 1890s (horses) and the 1920s (electronic devices like a primitive dictaphone). All in all, this is an interesting curio and enough incentive to buy a DVD with a pair of bindings, not just "Deadly Necklace".
