For the first time in the film review, I immediately found that the story didn't matter. I don't know if it was like it was filmed or a story behind the characters, but he felt strange, overly, and totally unholy. In the first thirty minutes I found myself apathetic with all the characters and the story. I felt like I had seen this structure before and Tart didn't offer me anything new to surprise me. After thinking that it might just be my mood, I stopped the movie and decided to start it fresh in the morning, but the same feeling persisted. I just don't care. It's not a good sign. The characters were great. When I say bliss, I literally mean that when you look at their development, your taste will never be felt. The story seemed to be recycling, almost to the point of plagiarism. Now I'm not saying Christina Wayne stole this story, but she didn't add anything fresh to the perspective. The casting was terrible, the insignia and the themes had disappeared so far that no critics could find them (nor the characters), and the stories were vague and desolate. You knew nothing and nothing, and instead of emphasizing more characters, we found instead drugs, juvenile sex, and money that was pushed into our faces. These are the topics we've seen in movies since the beginning of the movie, but Wayne could not capture it in any way. <br /> <br /> What immediately drew this story? It was mainly characters. I've seen most of Brad Renfro's work and honestly has to redefine himself. Director Larry Clark has defined him, and strangely can't get out of this stereotypical character. During the first 20 minutes of the Renfro screen, I was bored. I knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why. It was remarkable and not impressive, just repetitive. He had to play his role just to play a random society. Without a strong character, the last climax of this film is rather a fall. Renfro did not show the best abilities in this film. While I'm on this subject? no one showed their best ability. What's going on with Dominique Swain, outside Lolitat, I don't think he's really been an actor, and following roles like Cat Storm doesn't help. Bijou Phillips was the only actor I saw, trying to bring something spectacular to the screen, unfortunately due to the frightening action of all others. Rambling here and there and during the second act honestly almost forgotten. Melanie Griffith was a nonsense voice and most of the budgets in this movie were probably on her two scenes she was. My biggest problem outside of action was the pace of this movie. Something, and it's hard to tell me, but nothing worshiped. During the film, there were so many sub-stories that no real substance was formed. The kidnappings, the teenagers "anger and misery", the rich societies learn how terrible the reality is, the random children of the boy boy and even the end that seemed quite rushed and terribly together. With this dirty finish, the whole story does not really represent any real shape. Family structures have never been defined, the characters never gave any emotion, and everything we have left is honest remnants. Wayne did not perform this task. <br /> <br /> Although I do not want to put the burden on the director, I missed a few choices with this film. With a terrible title that just cried out the complete opposite of what this film was about, with the amateur directing ability to cast quite a lot of was able to give every emotion to every scenes, leaving us nasty in acting and bad developments, and vague narration it's hard to put any "good" "Behind Tarti. It was a movie I haven't heard of, and after seeing it, I see why. All Wayne has accidentally made extracts of other films that have done a better job by defining all the above elements and cutting everything together to make the movie Tart. I find it hard to say, but Wayne destroyed this movie. Although I don't think that much of this story was, all the other elements of excitement must be emptied when Wayne took the lead. Although most of the time you get a story of credit, maybe strong action or even music, nothing can be credited in Tartu. From opening to the end, I felt that I was swimming through very one-time oatmeal. There is no consistency, no strength. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a waste of time. If you are looking for some deep symbolic elements or perhaps somewhat of our society, you won't find it in the movie. Although I know that what Wayne was trying to show seems to be the end product, as it was edited in Etch-a-Sketch. It was an embarrassing film to sit down and encourage someone to take it. Wayne threw the wind in all of Columbia University's education lessons and destroyed two hours of my life. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Rating: * Off *****
