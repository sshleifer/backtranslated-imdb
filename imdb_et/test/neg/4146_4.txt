I can't believe it's a movie I didn't like. . . I usually find myself open to all kinds of things. . . but this flick is just, well, bad. <br /> <br /> I can deal with the topic if the script and story were better. I can deal with performance when the camera was working better or the characters were better. . . I think it usually tends to go under the script and the direction. <br /> <br /> It was just bad. <br /> <br /> I want to give it the lowest rating, but. . . I don't think at least that guy got his tail to make a movie. . . so he gets four stars (just above the average rating he has made so far)
