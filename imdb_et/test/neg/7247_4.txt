Director Lesley Selander's comprehensive routine "The Yellow Tomahawk" (1954) captures Cheyenne against a US cavalry with a moderately nervous Rory Calhoun, like a seasoned, buckskin-coated Indian scout who has to fall victim to survivors. The West of American Artists was a lens of color, but the TV edition of Turner Classic Films was inexplicably black and white. <br /> <br /> The action opens with Adam Reed ("The Black Spurs of Rory Calhoun") who lived several Indians, and riding up to his older friend and Cheyenne, Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef, The Good, The Bad, and Ugly) who have killed their mind Fire Knife warns Adam that his Cheyenne brave is ready to sweep up a nearby cavalry fort because it violates an agreement with the Indian government. Major Ives (Warner Anderson, "Purpose, Burma!"), a camp camper, sees a beautiful wooden nymph about Adam's impending Indian attack, who will be luring the lake. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden ("I, Peggy Jury" is another one Of those foolish women who swim naked in the middle of an Indian country, despite the world, the castle seems to be really naked in his bathing scenes, perhaps the most memorable scene in the otherwise predictable western part. sits that someone has attacked his ammunition mine far from the fort. This is one of the many questions that Richard Alan Simmons did not answer in this disagreement, with a 82-minute grid. Why bury a cavalry in its ammunition in a desert rather than in a fortress? As soon as they have made this discovery, as Indians, they attacked the hero and leave him the only survivor. Before the attack, the castle will be visited by a few white spectators. Sawyer (Peter Graves, "Stalag 17") brings his partner to his chest with an arrow. Although Adam begins to remove the arrow with warm water, the greedy Sawyer begins to deepen his shaft and kill his helpless partner. Later we find out that Sawyer and his partner had hit the gold. The question of leaving gold was left unanswered even after our heroes survived. Adam and Fire Knife have one final stream and Fire Knife demands that Adam hand over Major Ives or all die. Of course, Adam refuses and the Indians begin to overthrow the white. James Best, a supportive cavalry, gets his arrow behind him. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a purposeful Mexican scout, performed by a sexy Indian girl named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actor Rita Moreno, "West Side Story") and Robert Bray "Lassie" is a briefly ill-caught cavalry officer that Kate was about to marry . <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise in this unobtrusive western descent, which is in Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives, who killed the notorious Sand Creek massacre of Indian men, women and children, has kept the secret that he is also indian! Ironically, the fire knife that Fire Knife gives to Adam at the beginning of warfare is what our heroic spy uses to kill the Cheyenne warrior after the ball ends. "Yellow Tomahawk" ends with an ambiguous remark. The survivors will reach the second outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives will report to the army on this issue, but we will never know the outcome of this meeting. Whether it is artistic ambiguity or another unanswered question. Manufacturer Howard W. Koch is not involved in Casablanca's Howard Koch scenario. Ultimately, "Yellow Tomahawk" is one of the many Indian western countries that appeared after the "Broken Arrow" (1950), where the Indian is considered a noble savage, which some, but not all, white, are being treated terribly. Selander, who made dozens of Westerners in the 1950s and 1960s, makes this minor's western tolerance despite his thin characters and familiar hardships. Calhoun stands out above the average, as a leading man always used, and a good looking castle is worthy of his feminine charms. Peter Graves plays skunk as usual in most of his earlier roles. In fact, Lesley Selander made a more dramatic version of this film a year ago called "War Paint" (1953) with Robert Stack. By the way, Noah Beery Jr. and Rita Moreno "Rockford Files".
