Of course, I set it up in the hope of seeing some of the beefcake frames by James Brolini. Unfortunately, there was only one, early and the rest of the film was very annoying and ultimately a little pointless. <br /> <br /> The story that is there focuses on Nick and Julie Atkins. a couple whose marriage has started to grow for years. Successful businessman, Nick, has focused on work to leave Julie aside, trying to empty when he goes back to school. Julie's longing for her and Nick at the beginning of her marriage is beginning to become a powerful sexual fantasy that blocks reality every minute, causing her to do things like burning breakfast and her husband's papers fail. At first, he fantasies about his wife, but when the film progresses, he starts to fantasize with other men and meet with the strangers he meets. It culminates in his fantasies that have catastrophic consequences for his marriage. Can he and his wife build their relationships? Is it worth saving? <br /> <br /> It could have been an interesting assumption, but filling is so strange that you don't know why they even bothered. Characters are not developed. Motives are not explained. No background information provided. No research has been done on how Julie reached the point where she could not control herself, nor did she explain how she would do it in the future. The final product is a confusing mess that is as confusing as Julie's fantasies that are surprisingly underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> Functional is shuffled. Donna Mills, like Julie, does well with the material she's given, although her constant self-esteem becomes somewhat striking. James Brolin acts as he reads his lines from smart cards, and even his anger against his wife's infidelity is hard to buy, showing so little passion for the whole question. Supporting roles are mostly forgotten. <br /> <br /> An interesting story is deceptive. It is more sorry because it does not even offer the eye what it promised.
