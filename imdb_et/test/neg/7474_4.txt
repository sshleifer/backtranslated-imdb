... recommendation! Gloria Grahame runs a children's home where discipline is carried by a meat cutter, orphans are hung on meat hooks to punish them and kept in deep freezing so that they can be brought out during a social service call. Since the orphanage is dressed in cash, we know that Gloria puts all the orphans into work and also because there do not seem to be enough clothes to go around - especially for older female female orphans (the age range seems to be 12-30). ish). However, the new arrival is more than a game suitable for Gloria - and it has indeed been taken out by her mother and mother lover (wisely a claw hammer and a firing opening scene). Predictably, Gloria herself will get a meat hook. It was made about tuppence, but was / is a huge huge hit grindhouse circuit. My DVD cover promised "disruptive and politically incorrect scenes" and it wasn't necessarily lying. I believe that this is considered to be the civic strain of the orphanage, which tortures pornography. 4/10
