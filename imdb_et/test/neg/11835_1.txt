Why isn't this movie under 100? The Raptor is undoubtedly the worst film I've ever seen in my 15-year life. I've never seen such a catastrophic confusion before. Absolutely everything is inconvenient and cheap to do. <br /> <br /> Somebody's cast does not provide some decent performance. Dialogue is completely inconsistent and humor is nothing but humorous. Corbin Bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing. I can't help if I recall some of his lines, like "In or Out? You're worse than a cat!" and "Your lady is not a very good poker player. She just opened her hand." <br /> <br /> The predators are a joke. Even I could make more realistic dinosaurs when these filmmakers have shamelessly done. It is an insult to actual velocirapors or any of these dinosaurs. Not only that, but killer scenes are too harsh for me. I don't think seriously that these animals will cut their victim's slices and throw the pieces all over the country just to make everything gorier. Besides, blood and courage are all useless when you see deaths miles and miles away. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of Jurassic Park movies and dinosaurs. Maybe the filmmakers didn't see anyone who had the intelligence or meaninglessness to leave the bad movies off to HBO late in the night, as I did. If I can tell one thing that was involved in this movie, I should quote dr. Alan Grant from the first Jurassic Park ... <br /> <br /> "Just try to show some respect."
