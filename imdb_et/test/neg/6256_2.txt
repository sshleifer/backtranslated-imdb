Originally branched out as the "The Slumber Party Massacre" series, this film falls on its face with a new headline. First of all, if you add the word "massacre" to your movie title, it is better to offer. It certainly is not. There's no gore, no murder on the screen, no chainsaw, because the art of the box leads you to believe. Instead, we get a paper thin, redundant plot group cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned salon by way of a soccer game, just that one by one. Again, this movie could have been OK if the gore's share was a little higher. Why drivers, especially those who are direct video, are afraid to show that MITU Gore is outside of me. Now, I'm not a big fan too gore, but come ... why else would anyone rent a movie "Cheerleader Massacre ??" Apart from this problem, the film suffers from the low cost of the camcorder. It seems cheap, sounds cheap and the actors aren't that good. He's trying to hit us, who the killer may be, but even that it won't work. The end is a ridiculous mess. People, when you go over this movie, walk away and find the original "Slumber Party Massacre". 2 out of 10.
