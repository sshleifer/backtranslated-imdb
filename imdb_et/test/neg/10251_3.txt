Yesterday I was watching this television production and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I had no big expectations when it came to television production, but the complete film was a pain that didn't end. I felt it lasted 3 hours, but it was just me who died forever. Every minute there was a long fight and I really fought hard to get away from the "turn off" key. <br /> <br /> There is a doctor (Dr Verghese) in the movie who gets a lot of AIDS patients and most of them die during the movie. It is hard for Verghese to live so that his family is punished with his frustrations. But this film has problems showing both sides, it mostly focuses on the conversations with the patients and sometimes we see the flaps from our home, but we don't get much. Difficulties in showing more than one part of Verghese's life do not improve the poor activities of Naveen Andrews, the man I hope will not see in any good future. <br /> <br /> I think it was 7.6 because of the topic (taboo?), but I'm sure the market will have better movies on this topic. Stay away from this movie, it doesn't deserve more than 3/10. <br /> <br />
