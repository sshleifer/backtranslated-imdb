This movie is not worth anything. I want to say that if you want to look at this type of stuff, let Hollywood movies! It is completely disgraceful for Bollywood. Neal N Nikki Sucking Seriously! Never look at this movie. As for the actors, it seems that functioning genes arrested the generation. Tanisha could not have spent less, and Uday Chopra had probably chosen, because he was the director's spoiled son. (All of this Halla Re was amazingly stupid) The songs are eh, and I hope the director didn't spend much money on it ...... Bottom line, I hated the movie. Don't let your kids watch it and if you have it in your house, it's a stupid movie to throw it away! Buy a CD if necessary. (As I said, the songs are.) At least it's better than the movie.
