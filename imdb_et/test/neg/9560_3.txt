A sensitive gangster film that leaves you wanting someone to have mercilessly changed this farce. I would have thought that the story of creating Las Vegas would be interesting, but it would not succeed at almost every step. Warren Beatty, as a stupid and unlikely Bugsy Seigel, leaves you wanting to see someone else. Once or twice she blinks through her performance fog to provide an interesting scene, but most of the time you can't care for her. Annette Benning gives her an unreliable lover for a qualified move, but even she is just a bit more tasty than she is. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't like to disturb this marketable drama if you're not committed to Benning.
