The only reason a hundred users watched this movie was that they belonged to a team, were friends with the team, or were obsessive fans of Lance Henriksen or Lorenzo Lamia. Personally, I follow the "Lance cult", so I was disappointed that, despite being the main one, it is just a name. Playing Rich Crime Newcastle is Lance's joy, but all of his screen time falls to the beginning of the movie. Newcastle creates 747 hunts containing Ketchum (Lamas) and a number of forgotten characters. The biggest shock to this viewer was that pre-throw scenes were not all that bad. Except for the somewhat unpleasant and rather confused looking Aviva Gale, who once plays the actor from the classical finish of every class, it worked all the time, and none of these lines changed me. > But when the theft occurs, the film sleeps. Not only is their plan the most ridiculous thing ever captured on film, but it has been pulled out too long. It's not a very deep film, and you have to fill your 90 minutes, but these scenes are so boring that I finished twice in the afternoon. One particular order in which we look at each of these characters is that the same task is always complicated again and again. The movie is called "Rapid Exchange", but the exchange is far from fast - it's too long and extreme. Perhaps it would have worked if any characters had real personalities, but come on, there is so much that you can ask for Showtime Extreme's direct video. <br /> <br /> Luckily, there are several laughs, deliberate and inadvertent (Lorenzo Lamas seems to be a hidden master that makes a couple of incredibly bizarre scenarios) and Lance returns to the end of the movie, though for a short time. This is a bad movie and I probably didn't have to tell you about it, but it is by no means the worst I've ever seen. I don't put it too high on Henriksen's movie list because he's been with some real jewel that has a bigger screen time, and in both cases the film loses a lot of steam after the attack, but the best thing to say is that the last two movies , which I looked at before it was the main hostage and overpriced, pretentious Crash, and it was better than both.
