Successful movie remake may be a complicated business at best. The real classic repetition, especially the one that really is Alfred Hitchcock's final film, is something else. And after looking at this version of "Psycho" led by Gus Van Sant, two things instantly come to mind: what thought and what did they think on earth? Especially considering that Van Sant used the same scenario (Joseph Stefano, taken from Robert Bloch's novel), which Hitchcock used. The end result brings out the finer points of the art of filmmaking: first, that the "remake" should be just that; re-learning the original, not a "copy" of new players; And secondly, for coloring, more blood use and a bit more graphic making, the effect of the movie is slightly more. Although it was a surprising effort by Van Santi, it ironically endures the same mistakes that Norma Bates was plagued with: the "mind" movie was divided; half was Hitchcock, half of Van Sant. And the twin, though fulfilled, is never tied. Van Sant, even if he worked from the original script, would have been better off doing his own movie - all the way - instead of trying to duplicate exactly what Hitchcock did with certain scenes. For example, opening a movie and especially a "shower" scene, which is arguably one of the most famous scenes in cinema history. Copy Hitchcock straight from the shower head to the drain and the same skree! skree! skree! 'Sound Effects - Even if Hitchcock's tribute - again, just hit the story. And if you did a play by William H. Macy (like Private Eye Arbogas), you'll have another movie breakdown. Macy is a terrible actor - one of the best character actors in business - and her performance here is great; But as good as it is, attitude and delivery are pure David Mamet (with whom he has worked many times) and seemingly outside the context Van Van does. So the film comes up with a triple personality disorder: Hitchcock, Van Sant and Mamet. I felt like I would look at the "Good House of Holy Games". <br /> <br /> As for the performances, Macy's was as strong as they came, and Anne Heche (Marion Crane) did a good job of creating the original character, escaping the trap of Janet Leigh's imitation event. The weak links were Viggo Mortensen (Sam), who made Marion's boy so fragile and unpleasant that you didn't know why he had to do anything with him first; and Vince Vaughn, who - as complicated as possible - was just as terrible as Norman Bates. His entire performance was played by an actor (and not particularly convincingly); it influenced feminine admonitions and spoke to their Norman cartoon as a character due to the spontaneous bursts of manic laughter as a character, incredible and pretentious. This gave the film "True Incident" a reenactment that you would see in a TV show; it would have been completely in line with the sensitivity of the film to cut off Norman, who sat alone in his salon, with a nice face from Peter Graves, intonating: "That was Norman Bates's mindset in this fateful, rainy night when Marion Crane stepped out of his car and in his life ..." Supporting casting includes Julianne Moore (Lila), Robert Forster (dr Simon), Philip Baker Hall (Sheriff Al Chambers), Anne Haney (Ms. Chambers), Chad Everett (Tom Cassidy), Rance Howard (Mr. Lowery), Rita Wilson (Caroline), James Remar (Patrolman) and James LeGros (Charlie Car Dealer). Unless there is anything else, Van Sant 'Psycho' s curiosity shows that a good script, predominantly excellent cast and proven goods, may not be a success. Due to the contemporary psycho-babble era, American Psycho and Hannibal Lecter have somewhat limited Norman Bates's character; but there is still a singular intimacy between Norman, his mother, and his victims, which remains eternally disturbing and frightening; but Van Sant is not able to pass on this fright to the throat that fears the throat. If ever it was a movie that should have been separated from live video, that is it. Better than ever. I appreciate it 2/10
