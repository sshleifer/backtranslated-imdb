I like Steve Buscemi. I like her work very much, both as an actor and as a director. Could say I am - Steve Buscemi. Steve Buscem freak. I'm losing Steve Buscemi. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing my first full-length director debut at "Trees Lounge". I liked the movie, though it wasn't as good as it could have been. It was the same. It - a great scourge of itching, itching, that you want to see "small" people from "small" "small" bars located in "small" cities. It was close enough to say that it was a very good movie - one that could have been great with some tweaks. But that's OK. I like the movie and I watched it more than once. <br /> <br /> But this review does not concern the tree recreation area. It's about "Lonesome Jim". When I saw the description of the movie and then I saw who it was, I was glad to finally see the movie I knew it might have been in the Trees Lounge. But what I actually experienced was no different from one of the small town bars that had a belly full of cheap whiskey and a cheap cozy, who went back to their apartment, where there was an exciting brain full of exciting prospects that would inevitably reality is the impotence and dizziness caused by alcohol. <br /> <br /> In other words, this film left me flat and unsatisfied, and regretted that I wasted time and money on getting to this country - the film's equivalent next morning with this cheap relaxation awake or if you're floating , wake up to the smelly and fake and unshaved imbec. In the film, all the hidden white bread sandwich (which contained no less shop mark) and frame emotions. I am not sure what the idea of ​​this film was, and because it had to have some point and it was not an abstract surreal exercise that gets without one, the lack of this point is a sin of omission. Sorta likes those new cars that are no longer with the ashtray, though millions of people who smoke and buy new cars (I'm not one of them, but hey, I get compassion). All in all, it was a boring film about the boredom of boring things and had no fear and credibility that could carry and record such a movie. I mean, Trees Lounge was boring for the boring things, but it was interesting. <br /> <br /> I blame much for Affleck. Why do people throw these Affleck swells away? They suck life on everything they relate to. One Affleck was in one decent movie (and not even the reason why the movie was decent) and all of the funny things called Affleck stink as many movies as possible. And Liv Tyler is no better. Rockstar's daughter may not be an actor. He's just as inanimate as Affleck. These people just don't get up on the flat page of the script. People pay to see the movies, and they deserve to see the actors and actors with a little bit of charisma - the two dude don't have the sparks of the old sons who walk through Wal Mart's shopping trolleys. I always thought that Steve Buscemi was the type of guy who got higher than this type of beating, but Oh, Steve promised us down. This movie will make me want another wood chipper.
