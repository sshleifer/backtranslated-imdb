It's Saturday, it's raining, and I think every movie should have at least one comment ... so I just looked through "The Crime Doctor's Courage". It is a mystery of murder, with typical characters and a few ordinary suspects - each with its own potential motive for crime. The story begins abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot without character or storytelling. I think it's not surprising for the B movie of this period. There are also some moments that look and feel before the Second World War, but perhaps this is due to the writer's background in radio programs. California on its R & R from its Psychiatric Practice on the East Coast. He is attached to a mystery writer's friend with whom he has been involved for one or more earlier mystery solving capers. From time to time, the novelist plays the role of sidekick for our mouth (AKA dr. Watson) and occasionally eases things slightly with comic relief (sort of). <br /> <br /> The police captain is also somewhat simple but not quite bumpy, sometimes disturbing confusion. And then there is a mysterious Bragga, brother and sister who are dance artists in the nightclub. Dance is a kind of interpretive dance that is one of those moments that know more than 30s as the 40s. Although the story is in California, it seems that Braggas lives in the castle! <br /> <br /> There was one plot element that was able to amuse me a bit, but I'm not going to publish it anymore because I'm always enjoying the movies more than the story is discovered, not known in advance. (although I can think of many many B-films that could be higher, and it's hard to say that watching this is a well-spent time), I haven't seen any other movie from the Crime Doctor series so I can't make any comparisons .
