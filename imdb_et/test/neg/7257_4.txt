I got a copy of this discount. I had seen it several years ago. My only recent experience was the "Mystery Science Theater" where it was wrongly violated. No one really gets any chance of accessing these films because of all the byplay. I love the beginning of the fifties horror movies. They give us an intelligent lecture on defense systems near the Arctic. These were to protect us from the expected Soviet invasion, but they should be at hand because of the danger of very large insects. <br /> <br /> This particular flies. For some reason, even though they are made of dishes, they are capable of aerial blasting and blocking of fighter planes. Anyway, it's more fun - first, a mandatory deviation manager who saw a flying thing, cooling his jug in the hospital (it just teaches one - see insects as big as the house-- hold your mouth shut). I don't know if the poor guy went home after finding the mistake. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's a pretty normal effort. There is a routine effort to find a way to prevent a stubborn error - and leave us open to other opportunities - the Russians next time. I still get out of these movies and it's usable.
