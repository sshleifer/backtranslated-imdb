The film begins with a storyline that explains certain crimes that occur throughout the city, and then we know that the hero is a policeman who is either suspended or is likely to be retired. Before commenting, I did not have the patience and interest mentioned above. If then the narrators have a stereotype to have a deep, sleepy voice, it is high time to end it. I fell asleep seriously and didn't bother to close the movie. I'm still trying to figure out what the movie was, and why it wasn't shooting. The tertiary TV series has more movies compared to the collection, and I still regret that the participants and producers are taking part in this huge movie craze. It should have been produced as a regular TV series, or perhaps even as a local theater, rather than displaying it on a big screen. The waste of time and money. The film was supposed to be in production for a long time and it would have been better if it had been. What is superfluous sleep-inducing dialogues and kits, this is the worst film I am with.
