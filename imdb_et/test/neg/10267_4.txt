If the word "presents" appears in a title preceded by a famous name, the job is usually banned immediately. For some reason, people who can create good art do not seem to see it from others. But I've always been ready to try the second part of the trilogy of demons. First of all, the tracks are absolutely dead. Most American directors would have sacrificed small animals to join talent that would be on the demons 2 soundtrack. Another, well, two words: Asia Argento. (Of course he was one at the time of making this film, and several years away from his obvious decision to design his activities early on after Helen Mirren: a steamy look and little clothes.) Lamberto Bava comes from one of Italy's best dynasties in this strange horror known as Giallo (he is the son of Mario Bava, who may have been generating in the 60s). And the original demons are an absolute must-see for fans of B-horror films of the eighties. So how bad is it, right? Well, bad. The demons continue their attack on the Italian media, as the film opens in a modern Italian high-rise building, where many people who live their lives have TVs in the background. They all watch a certain combined news report / mater video from some investigator reporter type trying to prove the first movie events (which seems to have no time frame after the first film in a few days). Because of the incapacity of the usual horror film, reporters are able to bring the demon back to life and come through the TV screen to start the plague again. <br /> <br /> Yes. It's so bad. The only thing to say about the movie is that the soundtrack (if you don't eat the ones loved by The Smiths, The Cult, Gene Loves Jezebel, etc.) is stunning. It comes from the Simon Boswell keyboard, which began as part of the Argento Dynasty and has since collected films such as the Lord of Illusions and Hackers. <br /> <br /> Make a semi-free rental if you are planning a vigorous drink, but it is definitely not close to the fun of the original. Cronenberg's wonderfully funny high-rise-nasty creature rum, Shivers (aka they came inside), is much better.
