Like most viewers of this movie, I am also an avid reader of books. In the first two films, the main characters are Buck, Ray and Chloe, but in this second game, they play another violin in Louis Gossett's JR President's quest. World at War is based on a meeting with Buck in a series of books. <br /> <br /> The problem is - this movie is as terrible as the first two. Amanda appears somewhere and suddenly plays an important role (I won't publish it unless someone reads the series). Other illogical parts. I really want the cloud 10 to make a good left-handed film, but unfortunately it is similar to the first one in all the bad ways.
