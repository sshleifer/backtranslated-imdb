Heart of Darkness Movie Review The heart of the darkness of Joseph Conrad is pretty dark, deep and very deep. I have to say that reading a novel is better than a movie. Kurtz, played by John Malcovik, was a totally wrong actor who did this part. He fits the letter "Mice and Men". The film missed the key parts of the human being, which I find important to get a true message. <br /> <br /> Movie is poorly edited. This shows a much more important and disturbing flash. It has a very intense atmosphere in the novel, but the film has no such feeling. There is so much in the book that remained in the reader's imagination. For example, when Marlow spent hours and days in rams and the whole scene was out of the movie. In the novel, Marlow waited a long time for these rivets to arrive at her boat. It was a trivial source in the novel. The film added more parts that were useless and which didn't make sense. For example, when Kurtz spoke to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz grabbed the monkey's neck and killed. That's just what all destroyed, it didn't make sense to me. So my suggestion is not to watch the movie, just read the book. You understand more and interpret the story better. <br /> <br /> Chris C.
