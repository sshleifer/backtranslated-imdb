This movie is such an incredible piece of crap. First, let me talk about the pros: Sandra Bullock's black swimsuit. <br /> <br /> Now the rest of the story is pretty bad. We have said that computer programmer Angela Bennett (who is ANGEL - HOW WITTY !!! I can bet that managers rejoiced for this one hour) who mainly checks for other Company's software for errors / failures and so on. On the Internet and then on the fireplace for your monitor (EXTREME computer skills shown so far). This is after it finds a virus in a Macintosh program that interrupts the entire system after the escape key is captured. This is probably a big problem, but a virus designed to do this could be done with a simple batch file in about 1 minute. <br /> <br /> Every event we move on. He gets this call from another block (which works in the same company) and this fool says to go to that symbol, which probably opens up a secret Internet gateway to an unprotected "top secret" heap of data! Angela saves it on the mess board and now these gaps have created people to get her. Of course, this is only when he grabs one of the bad guys before he tries to kill him before he jumps out of the ocean before he accidentally opens to the hospital. <br /> <br /> Problem # 1: No gaps can be created on the Internet to access the most secret FBI data. Where does hell come from? When can a group of hackers manage the main stream of the Internet (even in 95)? Problem 2: Angela needs proper identification before releasing the hospital or clinic. He couldn't just pack things up and go. <br /> <br /> Then these "hackers" or any change to Angela ID so that she can not get anyone and comfortably, all her ID is lost. So she returns home and the chase of the cat and mouse continues and continues. <br /> <br /> Probably all the police and FBI people are stupid and don't believe him. So he has to use a number of tactics to enter the building where he works (where the person who has filled him now) and back to his old computer. He starts to talk to some other random coin and finds out who is behind the BS's BS address, which the director knows is that the audience is too stupid to believe. <br /> <br /> Then he runs to all the centers to post all this information to the FBI. Obviously, he needs to use a mainframe to send the FBI to emails. But then the same fool who tried to kill him in the water, tries to catch him again and easily gets into the FBI (wtf?). But remember this cool virus? Well somehow he luckily gets it, and although the virus only worked with software, it now works on the entire system. It brings down the entire mainframe that has all the fake data because the mainframe was just sitting in the middle of a convention ... WHAT IS HELL IS ATTENTION! In any case, the uber virus is now working and Angela (actual now) runs away and later kills an evil guy with a fire extinguisher. Of course he has a gun, runs to him so he is like 2 feet and decides to aim. CLASSIC Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is full of BS and Crap. Anyone who doesn't know much about computers is wildly thinking that this mess is possible, but not one thing is right for computers or the network. And I doubt I see a Mac and a mainframe (* cough LMAO *) on a multi-platform virus.
