Here's another low quality movie from Disney. There is no longer a Disney spirit. The story is boring. All emotions are fake. It's not cute or moving. The Disney company was at one time a magical company that gave children dreams. It is now making money. Shame on people who use Disney's name for personal benefit. This is the fall of the empire. And by the way, Pixar isn't Disney!
