I was going to look at "TKIA" with great expectations that may affect my opinion on it. I've seen all Dogme movies and this TKIA is by far the worst. The story intertwines with Shakespeare's games: King Lear, but never succeeds in capturing and caring for the audience. The actor's leadership is very loose, even in the Dogme-style movies, and results in bad, indefinite action. The story lacks any dynamism and I lost interest in a very short time. There are some scenes in the movie that are there to capture the viewer, but I don't think they even increased the story. The Mifunes band sang and Festen are both dogma films that were well run and had a good story so I look forward to better Dogmefiles in the future. Maybe Aake Sandgren's "Invisible Man-Dogme 6" proves quality again. Because he's like Vinterberg and S.K. Jacobsen is a qualified and educated director.
