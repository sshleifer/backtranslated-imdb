Now I love Italian horror films. The more cheese you have, the better. However, it is not Italian cheese. It's a week old spaghetti sauce with rotten meatballs. This is an amateur hour on every level. There's no intercourse, no horror, just a few drops of blood to remind you that you're actually watching a horror movie. "Special effects" consist of lights that turn red when the ghost (or whatever it was supposed to be) is surrounded and the string pulls the bedding up and down. Do you feel chills? DVD quality is VHS transmission (which actually helps the film more than painful). Duplication is even below the lowest "bad Italian movie" standards and I gave him one star only because the dialogue is so much fun! And what we discover when he finally looks in the attic (on the scene that is day and night next) ... I don't break it for anyone who really wants to see it, but let's just say it's not very "new"!
