What disturbs me with the so-called science programs is that it is presented as if it were the fact that dinosaurs live "millions" years ago. First, no one can even carry out research to prove that the land is millions / billion years old. This is a low theory based on inaccurate radiometric familiarization methods, where huge assumptions were thrown into the evolutionary pot. Second, no one can prove that evolution has ever happened. All Darwin's missing links are still MISSING! When you look at all fossils everywhere or on earth, they are certain types of animals, such as: a dog or a cat. No one has ever found a cat or a skeleton of a dog that has changed in this series, the dinosaur has become a bird. <br /> <br /> This is a great washing water. There is more evidence that Santa Claus exists as any animal that becomes another animal. <br /> <br /> All the ideas in this series are an attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe and everything in it have been created. <br /> <br /> This series is NOT SCIENTIFIC. This is a religious worldview that hides science under the banner. Science is something we can observe and repeat. What you see here is the fiction of science. <br /> <br /> If you'd like to see a science fiction program that is happy to admit it's a science fiction program, look at Star Trek or Star Wars.
