The Lord is merciful! Why was this movie made? Why Seagal and the rising star Max Ryan agree? The alien is so embarrassing in such a way that it attracts the mind. Like a few budgets, he was far from them. Worse still, the makers know it and try to compensate for it. The result is a movie that just doesn't look right. Fighting scenes are so boring and edited "discreetly" to hide the fact that Steven Seagal is no longer in good shape. None of them are interesting or exciting. The plot is meaningless, which does not interest in any way, or its uniqueness. Locations in Eastern Europe (a big step for producers to keep the budget out or not) seem to be unpleasant and should not be the basis for the action film (what measures?). <br /> <br /> And what is the title? As far as I can tell everyone, there was a stranger in the movie. What is the title of your ONE? <br /> <br /> DVDs have 1.85: 1 anamorphic widescreen and Dolby 5.1 sound. Nor are they significant to justify a single rent. An alien is not worth one second of your time. I have to love that words! "If they think they can stop him, they are dead wrong." Sheesh!
