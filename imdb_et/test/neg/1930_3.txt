**** Possible Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> When you made a serious movie with a powerful but aging father with three obviously ungrateful daughters, featuring the highest caliber actors with great cinematography and beautiful Midwestern setting, where are you going with it? Why should you naturally follow the tragedy after King Lear. <br /> <br /> That's what I expected. It wasn't necessarily what I got. What I got was a 105 minute feminist staircase - one long bell of man's inhumanity. Why, the whole story wasn't a decent man. <br /> <br /> You'll see at an early age where this movie could be directed, but you can't believe anyone destroys all these beautiful actors and craftsmen in the scenario - you want them to go with King Lea's theme. But it never happens; and when you ask me there is a real tragedy. <br /> <br /> After a panoramic panoramic view of the rustic countryside, the only thing worth seeing in this movie was the wonderful chameleon, British actor Colin Firth, practicing his Midwestern accent. Now there was treatment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
