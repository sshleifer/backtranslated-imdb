I'm probably one of the few people who protect and even enjoy "Frisk", a project that put Todd Verow on the map when it's actually where it is. I appreciated that someone had the courage to take Dennis Cooper and not back the material; Verow quite rolls around. In deciding what he has done, he is suitable for this material and should probably stay with it. The "Holiday", "Probably" Serving Film, is so erroneous in so many ways that it becomes involuntary comedy, and I'm disappointed that I have to report it. <br /> <br /> First of all, our hero, high school "Joe" is too old to play 18. If we later meet a man who should be Joe's teacher, it's confusing because a sweaty face-looking man looks much younger than the student he teaches. Joe's mother looks younger than she does and doesn't work any parent. Secondly, he showed Joe's opening scenes that he was playing or actually experiencing mental challenges. To get his credit, he got better when the movie went and I thought he was "playing young", but it just didn't work - it was weird. <br /> <br /> It's 15 minutes before anything is clear about who, what and where these people are, and why we should take care. The second scene of the film is an expanded business in the men's toilet, which, in the light of the story later, is completely redundant; the teacher sub-block does not go far, even if our "young" hero "passage of the passage" ... one minute Joe tries his hand to stop the bathroom (a scene that is so erotic that it really makes you wonder what anyone sees in practice) The next minute he is an expert on sexual blackmail and violent double crossing. This is followed by an extended scene, the nature of which we will learn later, "Andrew", and that's all we know about him, except he's probably gay, but he's not out yet. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of running time of 1:44 (which is about 20 minutes too long - I can't imagine how he played Joe's walk spiritually with long and meaningless deleted scenes); The Gods And Monsters sub-plan, obsolete by a patron who talks about rhetoric that has not been played by an actor who obviously can't remember his rows. slow week); between boys and their girlfriends, there is almost a four-way mixed game, gay bashing toilet toy, four queen wise smart wives (and whether the nellie queen has suddenly taken over) the role of a "gold-hearted heart" as the most tired stereotype? blackmail, theft, murder, alcohol consumption and the use of music sound to record the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> What you can't find in this movie is all the interiors that create the masterpieces; we should imagine that we are at the airport, the grocery store and the classroom, because all the scenes in these places consist of close-ups and poorly edited sound images to spread the idea of ​​local areas that production has not been able to afford. One thing they were able to get seems to have been the actual gay bar; is it the worst bar in the world or in Bangor, Maine, there are only about 5 gay men, as the bar never has a patron. Another good stabbing came when the actors had to yell over the dance music, which obviously didn't come from the speakers, but was just more than a "score" dragging eye music. <br /> <br /> Plots and characters come and go, emotions are unreadable, and Dennis Cooper's clearly-inspired dialogue is a "film call" that means no one actually speaks. Since we do not have any information about these signs, it is impossible to take care of what happens to them; as Joe et al appear on the ether one day and they just cease to exist when the credit is rolled out (apparently, Joe's sister, Wannabee Jennifer Gray, who is Bohemian crazy, is simply "stopped" by nature, never knows where she is in LA or what's his problem ... but again ... it's important?). Visually, the film looks good from time to time, evidencing a new development of hi-def video as nothing. Editing is rather dirty (one big edit; Joe depicts naked and says, "I wanted to play sports, but ..." and we cut off to reveal his "butt ..." ha ha). The composition is also strange from time to time (I thought I was looking at the SCTV parade "Personas" when the boys were talking in bed and visually felt their nose was put together for the whole scene!). <br /> <br /> One feeling Verow really limits himself to making a "naughtier" or somewhat tougher film, as he usually does, and maybe he shouldn't have retained it (a frothy toothpaste / sex fantasy worked well, I thought, though the tone it was about touching the rest of the movie) ... she produces and manages this "sensitive age" story, like Herschell Gordon Lewis films without pornographic movies without sex. I got some unintentional laughs about it and it wasn't boring, it wasn't very good.
