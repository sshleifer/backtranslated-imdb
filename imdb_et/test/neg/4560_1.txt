Community comments make this a very interesting movie, which I would be very interested in. Unfortunately, manufacturers did not see the inclusion of closed captions for hearing impaired and deaf people. It leaves me and many others like me who depend on closed captions to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> This is unforgivable for every film produced in 2005. In a world where all kinds of deficiencies and disabilities are housed, it is furious and ironic that the constant entertainment industry does not require all productions and cinemas to be closed.
