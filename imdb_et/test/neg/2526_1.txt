The root canal with anesthesia is more fun. This movie is annoying and pointless. There is nothing plausible about these characters or plot lines. What were the names of the people who thought when they agreed with the stars in this movie under the name of God? Acting in this film is so incredibly bad - even from actors who are usually pretty damn good. "In-laws" is a funny movie. "The Birdcage" is a fun movie. "The Big Lebowski" is a humorous film. This movie is just stupid. I can't even start the sick mind that needs this movie to write a "novel". I can't even honestly think of one nice thing about this movie. It just doesn't make sense. People please - I ask you - you can't see this movie. You will regret it for the rest of your life. This movie is not the worst ever made, but it is definitely on the top of the list.
