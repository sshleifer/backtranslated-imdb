Dreadful! I'm a teenager and I don't mind teenage movies, but it's terrible! Aaron Carter plays this pop star called JD McQueen and keeps his grades up or down, he works with jokes Jane, whatever it is. But "average girls" are too predictable, and clothing that most girls wear is not realistic. How about any of these girls without bra, underwear and shirts that reveal their belly? ENVIRONMENTAL? In my school we would send home something like that. <br /> <br /> And one part of the movie where JD's texts are Jane, he says, â€œDude tight? He must think I'm an idiot! I didn't know that texting was so stressful! How does texting create stress? And how obsessed with Jane JD and how she "falls in love" with her is very stupid. Dialogue is fun and stupid, actress terrible. the music is somewhat enjoyable and the plot is little or no. <br /> <br /> For girls who still love Aaron Carter, you enjoy it. If you're a casual observer like me, it's not a movie for you
