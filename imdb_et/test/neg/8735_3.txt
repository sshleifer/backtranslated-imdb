First of all, I would like to say - to a record - that it is incredibly stupid to call your movie "Embryo" when the subject is only 12-16 weeks old (animal and human) in scientific research. The embryonic stage is over at the end of the eighth week of pregnancy and from that moment on, the unborn critic enters the fetal phase. Okay, frankly, I didn't know all this, but I looked at it and it is also the least thing "embryo" creators could have done. Do not worry; I'm not just stumbling over details or being too bitter because there are several reasons to say why an "embryo" is a big failure. Actual science can be considered boring and inaccessible, and therefore Science Fiction is a cinematic genre designed primarily to make otherwise annoying, but educational science topics more interesting and understandable to larger audiences. By depicting ambitious scientific experiments that go horribly wrong, or space releases that come in contact with evil aliens instead of empty empty years, filmmakers can usually attract people with special entertainment effects and at the same time teach them little about science. In order to make a good or at least semi-decent science fiction movie, writers and directors have to fulfill only one basic rule: Don't be bored! If they fail to fulfill this condition, the viewer can also read the theoretically accurate book. Something has gone wrong with Ralph Nelson's "Embryo" production. The basic assumption is potentially exciting and even inclusive, because we are all sensitive to saving the lives of unborn children. There were also very prominent names in production, such as the major stars Rock Hudson ("Giant", "Seconds"), Diane Ladd ("Chinatown", "Alice no longer live here"), and director Nelson himself was responsible for the recognized classic "Soldier Blue" and For "Charly". Then what went wrong? Easy. The script is unredeemably boring, the clich√© and the whole thing look incredibly stupid, because lab labs and science equipment are clearly too primitive to achieve medical breakthroughs. Rock Hudson plays a very poorly performing doctor who has not done any passion in his research after his wife's death. When his car reaches the rainy night of a pregnant dog, his passion will return and he will do his best to save the fetus of dead animals. He can keep one fetus alive, impressively accelerating his growth process and training to become an extremely intelligent dog. Because his procedure is so successful, Paul Paul Holliston persuades his friend in the hospital to repeat his attempts with the human animal taken in the womb of pregnant teenagers who committed suicide. The female subject grows unexpectedly quickly, but after a couple of weeks she is an adult, striking and super-intelligent woman. A good doctor loves her understandably, but treatment with groundbreaking new growth will also show terrible side effects. Absolutely nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the movie, except for many unlikely and too melodic mumbo-jumbo and one or two deeply impressive tricks by the dog. The other side of the movie contains some grotesque action and intercourse, but by that time the stupidity of the dialogues and the unlikely plot-twists have already destroyed the potentially fabulous Sci-Fi idea. There are some very cool scenes, especially the shock-showdown between Victoria and Roddy McDowall (a very memorable and redundant support role). The final is absurdly grotesque and literally ridiculous, and it almost seems that Ralph Nelson made it to the final catastrophe because it was a general rule in today's thriller & Sci-Fi. The last sequence, including the terrible freezer at the end, is definitely not compatible with the film's previous 100-minute tone. But still, my sincere admiration and respect for the dog and his trainers. With this kind of intellect and talent, the animal certainly deserved his tricks in a much better film.
