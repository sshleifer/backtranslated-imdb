I was watching TV Guide last night and saw a movie starring Heather Grahm, who liked movies like Boogie Nights and Austin Powers, so I decided to watch it. It started ok, but you could say that the story was missing and about half way, it started to worsen. I don't remember this in movie theaters, and I'm sure it wasn't long if it was. The action was hidden and convincing, the dialogue was stupid and predictable, and the story was confusing and stupid. Definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I like movies like those that have been compared to the Fight Club, but it doesn't come close! Heather Grahm has done a lot since then. I gave it to 2 out of 10, but because I clicked on the wrong number, I thought about it 1.
