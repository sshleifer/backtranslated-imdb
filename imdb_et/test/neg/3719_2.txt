When this movie turns into a day off, I have to hide during the rest of my life during my life. How would you even think about comparing it to "Wonderful Life"! It was terrible! The boy sang my toes. And what on earth was his hair dealing? Emmy's worthy performance! Please. Allowed, Lucci did OK, but Emmy ????? I think this movie is a waste of money. The fact that they were so close to the original story that they pretended to give him a modern and retro touch made it worse. It lacked enthusiasm and persistence for all accounts. Lighting, wardrobe, make-up seemed like everyone wanted to go home. Just great NO from me.
