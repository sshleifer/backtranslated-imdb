This is a complete piece. This is an insult to Frank Herbert's fantastic book. They have the story and the signs mangled. Operation is poor on average. The only sign that has been done correctly and well is Duke Leto, played by William Hurt. Unfortunately, his story dies very early and then all downhill (not because it is very long at the beginning of the mountain). <br /> <br /> The 1984 movie was directed by legendary David Lynch. I was not too impressed with the film, but given the technological limitations of time, they tried their best. Amazingly, the crappy mini series makes it so much better than that. It was at least somewhat true to the book, which I really love. <br /> <br /> They had the opportunity to do this this time, unfortunately it wasn't done.
