It's not a good movie. Simple and simple. Get out of hardcore sex scenes and what you have is a mediocre graph, average performance (at best), headline and boring dialogue. Add to the box and you have a mediocre plot, a modus operandi, a dirty direction, a boring dialogue with hardcore porn. The problem is also that porn is nothing special. So it's not a good movie and it's not good porn. This will fail on both lists. They can say that women made this movie and they were going to do it, and that with it, etc. But speaking is inexpensive, the end result is what is read, and what we have here is a mediocre film, some of the sexes being shocked to try and destroy their time by looking at it. One of those movies where you want the time you look at it.
