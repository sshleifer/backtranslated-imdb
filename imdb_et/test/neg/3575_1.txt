I really enjoyed the "Candid camera" with Dom DeLuise and I was surprised that after a year Suzanne Somers has shown the co-star of the show. But this was the only positive aspect of the exhibition - the whole studio, the intro, the hosts - all that give the word "pompous" a new meaning. <br /> <br /> Well, it would be OK if the materials were not so cr * ppy - I mean fire, the best you can do is show a few men who have problems with getting into a bottle of ketchup, Suzanne Somers walking with a Halloween basket in July, a place for ice cream that sells only vanilla ...? I've seen a few episodes and every time it was terrible. They were like the biggest exhibition ever and then fill the time with so moody scenes that I really felt embarrassed. Even their people saw boredom and just couldn't be good.
