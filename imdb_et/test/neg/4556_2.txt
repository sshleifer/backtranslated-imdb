This movie was so bad that it became enjoyable. If you want to see a soap opera, you decide to make a movie, that's for you! Overcoming, insignificant incidents, incredible dialogue - that's all. The main character has a split personality and he cannot make his own thoughts, whether he is a thief, a loving father, or a hero who risks his life for others. None of these roles is plausible. It determines the standard of many other characters. The boss of the company whose building is set up is just as unpredictable as his wife. And punch line - who has taken the "chip" - beggars faith. I found myself laughing heartily and for this reason I suggest you look at it.
