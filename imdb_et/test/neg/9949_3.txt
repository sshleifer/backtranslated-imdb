When I sit and think of poison fairies, I understand that I may not be fair about the film. In my opinion, 3/10 may be more related to my disappointment with the film than its actual quality or entertainment value. Based on the plot description, IMDb overview, and 7.6 IMDb rating, I would be sure I was a little known pearl. Unfortunately, it didn't work for me. For some reason, poison fairies all but put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> Poison Fairies is a story of two young girls in 1965 in Mexico. One girl, Veronica, is a compulsive liar and tells her friend that she, Veronica, is a witch. The other girl, Flavia, is so light she believes and fears everything she tells her. It's really about that. Actually, nothing happens and the film pulls on and on when Veronica tries to terrorize and dominate Flavia. One IMDb commentator described it as "the most appalling movie in the 80's Mexican cinema". My comment? if that is the case, in the 1980s, there are not many horror films in Mexico. The second comment wrote, "Look at it if you want to be scared." My comment? Are you sure we're talking about the same movie? My opinion is completely the opposite of these examples. For me it was boring, uninspired, and badly acted. Scene design is particularly annoying, as director Carlos Enrique Taboada never shows any other character. Veronica and Flavia continued long-term conversations with their family and teacher, but we never see the face of these people. This is a tedious trick.
