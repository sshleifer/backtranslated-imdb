This movie is surprising !! I'm sorry to say that I manage to watch the first 15 minutes of the movie and something else, that I really have to sit down and watch the rest of the movie. It's completely stupid and very fake. The robot in the film looks like a man wearing these steel suits and the actor is very bad, especially the one who plays Alien. He's totally annoying! Don't waste your money by looking at this stage for popular Gen-X Cops. I'd rather sleep or spend my money on watching something other than watching this movie. 1 out of 10. If possible, I would give 0.
