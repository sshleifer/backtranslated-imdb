This movie was a very good movie in my eyes, Nicholas Sparks is a great novelist and this movie was all about being as big as a laptop, but what sets two apart is a laptop dream team led by McAdams and Gosling, but here's the wrong behavior of Channing Tatum. . I felt that many scenes were unevenly clean in their performance, many emotions disappeared in different scenes because he couldn't act, leaving an uncomfortable and uneven situation, Amanda Seyfried gave a great result just to let Tatum fall down and the mood disappear and the scene cant recover. <br /> <br /> This story was worth it was right, but what he got was a pretty boy who couldn't act. Tatum should adhere to what he is good at, films that are more of his physical ability, though terrible, such as GI JOE, are accelerating and fighting. The less he speaks, the better. <br /> <br /> Try not to think of me as Channing Tatum's jailed prisoner. I went to this movie with an open mind because I am a lot of time surprised by Adam Sandler's reign over me. I gave Tatum the same chance that I didn't see him here as the sum of his past roles, but just his movie, which unfortunately was a downturn
