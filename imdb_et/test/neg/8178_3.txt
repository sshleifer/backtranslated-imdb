What you need "What do you need", every episode because "lonely" had been to some extent a winner. This episode is the first major failure after the "escape request". The Serling script is based on someone else's story, Lewis Padgett's story. As "And when the sky was opened", Serling changed the content significantly by removing the scientist and his machine and inserting the older generation. <br /> <br /> "What you need" works best when it's sweet. On the opening side, where the footballer offers the customers the bar the objects of which they need in the near future, its delicate charm, which may be thin throughout the episode, but works well within the prescribed time. Unfortunately, the main plot it forms is full of holes. The result of Steve Cochran as a two-bit thug will become the main focus of the episode. The part of Cochran is a signed stereotype and his flat performance highlights this mistake. The exploitation of his old knee is boring and predictable, and the revelation that his old man murder is completely convincing, so the whole scene of slippery footwear seems to be totally wrong. Ernest Truex is good as a footballer, bringing the magic to a magical, mysterious but warm edge, but he's not good enough to help floundering the script. contradictions. For example, we learn that the ability of a football player to give people the opportunities they need is based on future opportunities. So how exactly does it allow him to produce a pen that magically chooses the winning horses. It seems that it should be little outside of its area of ​​power. The man who sees the future also acts as a surprise to the footballer when he finds that he is waiting for him in his apartment. There are many more holes you can choose from, "What you need", but it's hardly worth it if the episode is so thin that it can still be seen.
