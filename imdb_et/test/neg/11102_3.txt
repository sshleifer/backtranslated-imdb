My vague memories of childhood have preserved the Belphégor cult series in the 60s ... so I was eager to see the big screen adaptation. I should have kept my money and walked in Louvre. <br /> <br /> The scenario idea is still very appropriate and interesting (Le Louvre's fantasy), but adaptation is ridiculous. Dialogues are hesitant between French irony and serious "American business" without achieving the same, but not without the asinine. <br /> <br /> Continuing the way of leaving is somehow desirable and the special effects are small compared to what could be expected (low budget). ?). <br /> <br /> What's left of it. There are not many good images outside Paris ... which are rarely disappointing. <br /> <br /> Belphégor was worth more. <br /> <br />
