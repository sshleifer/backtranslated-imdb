Ladies and gentlemen .. Be sad (or be happy!) .. We are a nasty forensic T.V series-ERA! Now read me and give your luck in advance: <br /> <br /> "CSI: Crime Scene Research", "CSI: Miami", "CSI: NY", "NCIS", "Jordan Crossing", "Da Vinci Investigation "", NOT "Cosby mysteries"! .. Wasn't we already ready ?! <br /> <br /> From the late 1990s to the end of the 2000s, we have a partner (or team) with the same sick series of genius criminologists So you have a lot of many and many repelling scenes where we can see clearly, precisely and terribly the most terrible techniques in TV history. <br /> <br /> OH GOD .. If we had big days; (or detective) ERA, like Columbo, Kojak, Magnum and Simon & Simon, or the old old Sci-Fi ERA, like a six million dollar man, a bionic woman, Knight Rider. The Love Boat, Baywatch, even a flop like Thunder Paradise. <br /> <br /> All of them were unforgettable, original, h ead .realistic good thoughts, activities, women ..If X FILES came .. And then it was a misfortune to start or accurate: disaster! <br /> <br /> X Files Undoubtedly one of the biggest, but there were some slight drawbacks, we had agent Dana Scully (doctor and FBI agent) for every episode that made kindness ... and of course on her lap (if the series was successful) ) became part of our living room, so that money-lean producers loved it with all physical terror + real exciting hunting. Therefore, they tried to repeat it in some other not too distant classification: forensics! <br /> <br /> But it got so ugly, full of deformations and very rough like BONES. Plus Emily Deschanel's unsexy gift and bleeder like David Boreanaz (she was a much better angel) and all those corpses. To the extent that every time I watched it, I found myself screaming AAAAHHHHHH! What a terrible gross game! .. <br /> <br /> Cancel this please .. You have canceled before good shows like (Lone Gunmen) or (Man Called Hawk). Here's the bad .. So please .. Little bounty and enough bones-ERA !!! .. or we will fall into nausea and monotony!
