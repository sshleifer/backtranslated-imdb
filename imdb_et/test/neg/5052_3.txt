You know, I'm really tired of all the general music used in such movies (see Jawbreaker, disturbing behavior, etc.). Any real tension here (and there are some) is instantly ringed with some cheese pop music that completely dissolves arbitration. Why do they do that? Of course, to sell some of the tracks, but what is unfinished - did anyone buy a CD? <br /> <br /> And yes, Mrs Mirren is attacking her role with fun and joy (with some cheez-wizs add a kick). But what are Molly, Leslie and Vivica doing here? Their roles (they are so underestimated that I can't use "characters" here) have no story at all, so I can't understand why the three well-known actors were cast. <br /> <br /> Oh and the end is so incredible and irresponsible. Children get free and act like nothing happens - everyone smiles at the end. They're criminals, people! There are no consequences for their activities (robbery, assault, breach of grade) - nothing. <br /> <br /> Small things - is Tingle's story about her husband true? What is a cross section? Does the virgin Katie's character lose her cherry in such a whim? (Big message, guys.) Why did McKean go home? How did Kate's academic nemesis walk through the door at that moment? How do students even get teachers' home addresses? WHAT IS JEFFREY TAMBOR? What was McKean shooting on Tingle? He is bloody, exhausted and hostile by students, forcefully! <br /> <br /> Well, I spend a lot more on the script than Mr. Williamson probably did, so I'll stop here. br /> <br /> 3/10
