Before you start whether this film is worth your time or not, I should inform you that I have never seen another Carmen customization, so if you are looking for an overview of how it belongs, it may not be of much use. When I met Carmen, I was in a car stereo when I was in Spain during my family vacation when I was a teenager. I didn't pay much attention to it because I didn't like the opera and I didn't know it better. The story has been around 150 years. Do I feel I have left the film after seeing it? Yes, mainly because of the plot, but also because if all the actors who played Carmen look like Paz Vega, then I would be happy to sit in the DVD collection. <br /> <br /> Director Vicente Aranda (who also wrote the story with Joaquim Jordà) talks through the original author Prosper Mérimée, a French writer who crosses the 19th century Spain. He comes over to José (Leonardo Sbaraglia), a criminal soldier and one of many men who fall in love with Carmen (Paz Vega), a hot, sexy, beautiful gypsy with a fucking mouth, a 'mood. toro ”and who carelessly drives men to their destruction. Today, when he meets José, he is tempted to behave. But he grabs him, rolls him and lets him go many times. Until one day, José has wanted to kill. Carmen persuades her to join her group of Roma smugglers. They seem to live, fall in love with him, but he meets a charming Esbadobo. Does José keep his jealousy under control or destroy it? <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful, seductive story, something that almost resembles a Shakespeare or Ovid plot with huge images of passion and emotion that can make or break us and make us without character. . It's poetic, fiery and above all slutty. I stayed hanging, I didn't know how he was going to turn. I always hoped that José could make Carmen's dirty little ways. I won't tell you if he succeeded or not. The above synopsis is what I took from the movie, but I didn't impress the film myself. It was only after I looked at it that I dug a bit deeper into the story and I realized how much unforgettable opportunity Aranda made from the classic of Mérimée. It was a low, filthy period-drama that saw Paz Vega spend a lot of time partially or completely naked (not that I particularly complain!). <br /> <br /> First, it was bad. Sbaraglia as José was not impressed. I'm still sure he was a weak actor or José had a weak character, I haven't read the book. He should be the man who burns with Carmen, but he spends most of his time confusing, jealous, and a bit dim. Paz Vega was a little better than Carmen. I was convinced of his tempered, evil character, although I have seen more convincing performances in other films such as Zapping and Lucia y El Sexo. She seems too beautiful to play a gypsy woman (not that I have met many Andalusian gypsies), so in some ways she didn't fit her role. The other film participants were also not big. They seemed to do everything in favor. The story is passionate, emotional? they saw halfway as if they were able to wait to get the tough 19th century costumes they wear. <br /> <br /> But in costumes, I was impressed - one of the redemption factors of the film. I like Spanish culture, I liked soldiers uniforms, top hats and women's flamenco. They installed time well. That's all I can really say about it. Sorry, back to criticism. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, Vicente Aranda and Joaquim Jordà wrote the script and did so badly, leaving it to turn his grave into Mérimée. It was boring. It didn't make the best use of José's intense passion for Carmen (or maybe it was just acting). Among all the millions of adjectives were hair on one another, on Satan and on the devil's connotations. I know that the word for Spanish is part of the Spanish language, but the film was full of whore, "whore", literally in every row. It was realistic in Seville, a victim of the 19th century, but this story itself does not need it. <br /> <br /> Editing and camera work were boring and normal. I just liked one little bit, and that was when the camera followed the approaching air that lands on Carmen's face. That was good. But the rest? Bored. <br /> <br /> In summary, it is sad to see that such a big story is wasted if there is no convincing operation and leadership. If you are a literary teacher, have your class get the tools to view this customization. However, thanks to Paz Vega, the film only costs the interest of half the class. Otherwise, stay with the opera version (although I hate musicals). I give this movie 4 just because I love storyline! If Paz Vega!
