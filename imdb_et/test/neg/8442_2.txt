Let's see what are the benefits of watching Piranha, Piranha? Well, if you have never done anything with Venezuela, there are so many in Caracas and rural (and jungle) as well as in the work and play of various indigenous people, as well as many natives in wildlife. If you like William Smith, he plays a bit of a guitar (as he is always used to doing). <br /> <br /> And that's it. If it wasn't for William Smith, it could probably go through the money to save a collection movie for children or another organization that benefits the third world. The only time you see a title fish really is during the opening credit. No mutant killer fish like Roger Corman named Piranha. You would see twice as much fish in the title if the characters had twice as many monster fish, but unfortunately this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a photographic register and his brother comes to Venezuela to make a story of one of the last untouched places on the planet, but their motivation quickly becomes one who wants to find diamonds that are probably quite rich. <br /> <br /> There is not much real action or danger in this movie. What could have been an exciting motorcycle race falls on the mass of landscape and animal material placed there to pull the film's driving time. There is not much more action in the last fifteen minutes of the movie (which is probably about how long the film would last without the entire travel document). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the only way to get a movie is to be a BAD movie that must be boring or incredibly stupid. Piranha, Piranha will surely respond to this former sign and is pretty damn close to another. The only reason I do not appreciate this is that the added film material is more interesting than the rest of the film.
