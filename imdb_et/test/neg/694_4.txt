Why do the powers given to Jennifer Lopez continue in unbelievable roles? She was in Selena great and pretty good in the money train, both of which put her in roles where she could basically be. However, such roles draw lines. I would never have seen Lopez as an FBI agent (look at this inconceivable performance), but as a psychotherapist? Give me a break! When he enters the mind of a comic serum killer to help save one of his victims, he interrupts all the rules to try the madness of his inner mind. <br /> <br /> Lopez usually operates below average. I don't get the high-level voice he has. She is not Julia Roberts, but she still appears on the screen as she believes she is on the same playground. Well, he's not even in the same stadium. Sure, she's a very sexy lady; but it doesn't wear the movie, and it certainly doesn't. If someone else played the role of this movie, it would have been great, especially if it had been cast by someone who could trust this character more. <br /> <br /> Having said that, this movie is visually stunning. The colors are fabulous and the story is not half-bad like a B-movie. Sound is also great. This movie collects some points about the original style and the main points of how it sounds and sounds. Unfortunately, a pair of functional and poor casting will diminish. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 6/10
