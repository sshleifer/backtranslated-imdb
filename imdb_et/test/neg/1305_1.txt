This movie follows The Riddle Routes, which is for all British people who are honestly terrible! The bad cgi effect, poor editing, bad direction, cast, which I hope well paid, because it is nailed in many quarries. <br /> <br /> Nigel Planer would have had to shut his Wig again and He was at least laughing! <br /> <br /> It was like a long and drawn "Torchwood" episode, but without a fake Canadian doctor fella ... he had the same too dramatic music, constantly repeating, in vain trying to tear a little tension. <br /> <br /> Humanity!
