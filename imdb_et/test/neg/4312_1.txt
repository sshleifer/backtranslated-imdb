This is one of the worst movies I've seen and definitely the worst movie Nagesh Kuknoor. I can't believe that a person who has created a movie like Teen Deeware can create a complete mess like that. <br /> <br /> The film itself is really flawed, that Zeena must look for Meera and give her mercy to help her husband to avoid the death penalty in Soudi Arabia. The common logic says that if Zeena is not able to easily find Meer, so it is not a Soud government, Zeena can safely build Meera's signature or thumbprint and produce it in front of Soudis. The second darker thing Shankar gave the wrong address to his passport could not be accessed by Indian government officials, but after Meera got Shankar's suit through the Soud government. Wow! Does it not make Soud more network in India than Indians? <br /> <br /> Suura makes a little more in the movie than the role of Chopra, who looks at Meer and is looking for Meer. Girish Karnaad (this man is just wasted) helps to keep him. <br /> <br /> Nagya does not know Hindi and she is helping other boys translate English dialogues she writes in Hindi. This time it seems that his helper was in a serious state of intoxication when he wrote dialogues like "Imaan ki Chalaang" (a leap of honesty). For a few minutes, for our worst nightmares, Meera not only takes this honest leap, she touches her feet to make "Iman also Naach" (the dance of honesty). <br /> <br /> One of the only bright films is his cinematography and really nice tones. But since Bollywood has learned what is called post-production, almost all films have colors and beautiful mixed backgrounds, so it's not a big deal. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that making a cheesy film is not limited to Chopras or Johars or Barjatyas, Nagyas and everything is affected.
