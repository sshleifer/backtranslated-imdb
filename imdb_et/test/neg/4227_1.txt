Although this film has a slow, dreamy, almost mesmerizing pace and an interesting, though not entirely accurate, description of the French French military's criminal investigation practice and staff, I find it ultimately impossible to recommend. I think this movie is just one person - the director, one prerequisite - the shock of heterosexuality. Certainly, all forms of human sexuality can have their reluctant moments, not to deny it! But choosing this option at a fairly good price, as this film does at every step, refers to the wavering sensitivity of the work. In short, if you enjoy homo-eroticism with compassion and portrayal of heterosexual love and female form in a frightening and humiliating light - then this film is for you. I'm not doing it and it wasn't.
