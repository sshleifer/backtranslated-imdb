Maniratnam, who has often been compared in India with prominent world champions and is considered a filmmaker for genius, has once again proved that he can only make the frames look good without offering much thought. joy that can be derived from cinema as an old art. <br /> <br /> Although I wouldn't want to ask myself and imagine myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful films that have been made around the world, there is still some thought and a bit of an educated filmmaker can recognize that his films do not contain innovative inventive plots of land, do not contain permanent effects and contain the ridiculous end and LOT melodrama we see in Indian films. <br /> <br /> In general, Maniratnam has once again affirmed his embarrassment with his film. <br /> <br /> Sorry for those who have otherwise claimed this table. My suggestion to you: SEE THE VIEWED GLASS BY GLOBE.
