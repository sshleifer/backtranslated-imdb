This is another notorious Mexican horror film, but although the original Spanish version is quite annoying, the English version (created by Jerald Intrator - all who did similar tasks in CURIOUS DR) was added with all kinds of gore and nudity. HUMPP [1967/71] - and like the US version of this movie, it was previously available on DVD using something strange / picture! <br /> <br /> First of all, I looked at the original and, albeit not great shake, it was quite interesting - especially if the acquaintance is familiar because it was: the doctor goes beyond the calls of life, trying to save his ultimately sick son; he even has a glowing, playful assistant (played by Carlos Lopez Moctezuma, who had a surprisingly similar role - albeit in a slight vein - COLD WOMEN COURSE) [1961]). I know that several Mexican films mixed the horror with the "Lucha Libre" (wrestling) genre, but I had never looked at myself; this element is here - in fact, the hero is a wrestler - but the two styles are perhaps lucky (that is, wrestling sequences are expertly made, some movements are very fun). <br /> <br /> The doctor's son is transformed into a monster (looking like the Incredible Hulk with the soil that sprinkles his face!) after he has been implanted with a monkey heart - but when it is replaced by a wrestling woman with a coma grow a couple of fangs boot (it shouldn't realistically become transsexual ... though i think it wouldn't have been very interesting)! The climatic roofing system, where a monster kidnaps a child and fills the police with death, reminds GHOSTI FRANKENSTEIN (1942). My favorite unintentionally funny moments in the film come when the doctor, trying to comfort his son, tells him that he will soon cure - just behind his back soon after the tears - and he will also give his tired assistant an impatient look (if the latter is slowly standing in the car) when they get out of the lab to chase a monster. <br /> <br /> An alternative nude scene works for the film (these were actually Cardona himself making a Mexican version called HORROR Y SEXO), but its reputation is based largely on the material that shows excessive violence, like an eyeball, which is pulled out of its nest, scalping and even the human head is torn. There are also a number of graphical additions to the operation, which, however, create a drought: if it turns out that only two people are involved in the operation, we see a third pair of hands that keep the patient's mask constantly on the face of the patient. <br /> <br /> The film has also been said to be Cardona's own black-and-white horror movie DOCTOR OF DOOM (1962), but since I have not watched it, I can't say how much it actually pulled out of the Nighty Night ...
