I saw this movie without knowing much about it. The split screen device was immediately irritating and things didn't improve for me after the title sequence ended. Plot, characters and dialogue were all extremely cliched - a bad man abusing a family gets thrown out of the home, wants to get out of his "party", reinvents himself, changes his voice, dresses for other clothes, is against a gay man whom he continues to make his way to take part in the international British drug aristocrats. <br /> <br /> The legacy of Patricia Highsmith (talented Mr Ripley) should appeal to the filmmakers. My triple screen with more than 120 minutes duration reveals almost no editing. You can't decide which image works and what is most powerful, why not show three and hope you get one right. This trick removed any character-related link or interest. For each screen, the important dialogue was repeated three times, as if to say, "this is an important / moving / deep moment, ok!" <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. <br /> <br />
