here it is difficult to make a negative statement after being robbed of how big an act of inquiry is, how wonderful the actors are and so on and so forth. I didn't like the movie. it's filthy! <br /> <br /> Org, they have taboo sex (gay sex, bi sex, oral sex, rape, anal sex, masturbation, brother-sister-sex, brother-brother-sex, sex drugs, sex without drugs, sex , sex, sex seems to dominate your world.I don't know what made those people up with this story, and above all: who cares? <br /> <br /> technical stuff didn't satisfy me too. and there is no "direction", but the actors are good, but I guess what it is! their job is to act! there is no need to jump from their place when the actor did a decent job. ? <br /> <br /> I gave it 2/10 because after that there was something I could not put in. b movie charm? camp fun? nudity? I don't know.
