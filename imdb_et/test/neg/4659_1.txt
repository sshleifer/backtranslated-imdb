This "schlock-buster" should include a government health warning. If you play it on your DVD device, you are in serious danger of opening up in space-time continuum and disappearing without traces - this is the "movie". <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie was so successful that it proves the true desperate condition of a modern Hollywood cinema and constantly ordering films that turn to the "lowest common denominator" - although I am really afraid to think of the "lowest common denominators" this movie actually <br /> <br /> I think Hollywood just did that they proved this movie and showed it! I can imagine that plenary meetings are in the studio ... "How bad is the chance to make a movie - and STILL make a lot of money!" Holy cow, I didn't know we could go that bad !! Woooo hooooo !! "<br /> <br /> The only film that is worse than that, what I mean (and I believe it is close) is the second day of death (RIP Bond franchise as I knew it) and Independence Day! /> <br /> PREVENT - AVOID - PREVENT !!!!
