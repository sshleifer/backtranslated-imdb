It is below the average "whodunit" with the clich√© of every living room routine. Charlie Chan is a secret service agent who works for the government, and he has to find out who killed a bomb scientist to win the German U-Boats in World War II. There is little to recommend with this film, because neither the bomb nor the scientist or war has much to do with the plot. The fans of Charlie Chan are likely to be disappointed with this movie. Who dunit? Who cares?
