As mentioned earlier in other comments, the main problem with NVA is that it cannot decide what it wants to be, the cheapest or honest parody of the East German army. There are a couple of moments that are quite moving, for example, when one recruiter returns from a completely crushed person to the Schwedt Army prison. Finally, Leander Hau√ümann goes to infantile humor. No wonder the film is floped in the German box because it is historically unfair to the actual situation of their training camps and was led by an actor who is unfortunately unable to produce nuanced results. <br /> <br /> The work of Frank Griebe's camera, which - as always - does a wonderful job. If it weren't for his beautiful pictures, I'd be a lot worse than the movie.
