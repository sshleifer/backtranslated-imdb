Fully watching the entire video game's customization, this is Mr Boll's second terrible movie. The way she continues to work is a constant surprise to me and probably most of the film community. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, this experiment was partly better than many of his previous attempts. Some dialogues were even half-decent in Far Cry, although he still uses some phrases and in some cases he doesn't even use phrases correctly. <br /> <br /> Now that Jack Carver should be American and not German, Til was still fun in this role. The exception is the ridiculously flat lines she uses to put her in bed with her. And should we believe that he is ready to have sex with him so randomly after this minimal dialogue? Emile? Just there is a comic relief, I'm sure and still flat. Jack's character looks old and tired, but is still capable of extreme acrobatics, which is necessary to avoid a modified super-soldier in the lab. <br /> <br /> Don't look at Far Cry for customization. But you could waste just one and a half hours if you have nothing better to do.
