This movie seemed to be put together as quickly and graphically as possible. My two daughters were ready to go 30 minutes before the end of the film, which rarely happens to theaters. It was Nickelodeon's production and it would have been better if they had issued it. stay. The animation itself was in some parts o.k. but the plot was terrible. The classic story of a son who tries to fulfill his father's expectations has been used in many children's films, but animation or graphics must be very good for the child's attention. It wasn't this movie. There were also inconvenient elements between the character of the leader and the female female character that the plot could have done without.
