I thought it would be a fun comedy with no sex or nudity. Well, there's no sexual content, but it's "fun comedy," I remember only three times laughing at "green butchers". Fun is focused on cannibalism and spiritual spirituality, which is just sick humor, badly. <br /> <br /> I should have gone out of this movie and I'll kick myself out because I didn't. Actually, I wouldn't have seen this movie. The only good thing that came from this film was that Bjarne and his brother finally made changes and put their ugly past behind them. I recommend that every well-understood person avoid this flick.
