I love Japanese movies - having seen at least 100-200. So it's obvious that I'm not afraid of Japanese movies. However, sometimes there are Japanese film concepts that simply do not translate well into Western countries. They may be at home, but they just don't look abroad ... normal. It's like a living fish that my wife drove at a business event or odd PS2 games like dating simulators or Katamari Damacy - things that are accepted there that interfere with non-Japanese language. It's probably like others see things as a matter of course for Americans, such as American football, fried Snicker bars, and Paris Hilton! Well, the king of strange Japanese movies that just doesn't seem to be right for Americans can just be ATAMA buildings. Now, the style of animation is not a problem - it's different, but nice enough. No, it's a story and a pretty strange ending. It makes it a really unusual movie and it goes like this: There was a strong man who obviously had no reason to grow out of his head. At first it was a little and he just cut it off, but he went back and forth again - so he decided to let go. And after a while, people began to live in the shadow of a tree. Strangely, when they were under the tree, they were tiny, but when they left, they were full again. Then, after finally getting sick and out of the tree, the man sank! End. <br /> <br /> Look! I told you that it was very, very strange - but not like TAMPOPO or KATAKURISI LUCK - just strange. O-D-D .... weird! And if you do not have such things very high, I doubt if you feel bad when you know that this Oscar nominated film will not win. Frankly, it makes me happy because I don't want this film to encourage such similar films. The only reason he earns 4 is due to a nice but not remarkable animation. <br /> <br /> This movie hurt my brain ... I hope it's not a sign that I have a tree!
