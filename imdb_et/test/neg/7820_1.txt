For years I was hesitant to watch this movie. Now I know why. It's not just a comedy that can't even be funny in the distance, but it's just a laugh about the movie *. It was even worse than I thought. I rented this mammal and still felt more frustrated than the money. I've never seen a movie that bothered me so much. This is a movie about foolish people who do stupid and terrible things. I don't know if anyone with common sense can actually act in such a movie. I've been using IMDb for a while, but I felt obliged to sign up just to avoid renting bad unsuspecting people, or, worse, buy this stinker! Really a waste of time and money. I have to say that the plot line is terrible.
