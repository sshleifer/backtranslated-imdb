How did someone give you more than 2 stars, amazed me. I made an account in IMDb to comment on this movie. Operation is cr @ p and the plot is cr @ p. It wouldn't be at all a star if it wasn't a descent (and there are some amazingly clown songs, especially those that contain an obot and sounds like a black and white comedy comedy background music and not in a way that fits the scene with the mood they intended haunting) and high quality cinematography. Dialogue and plot are about as complex as Dr. In the Sues book. These participants are terrible. I'm watching this movie right now and I'm stunned for every word if you swallowed it all. The only reason I didn't turn off the movie was that I've been in contact with creating an IMDb account and posting it for review. I dig traditional movies, I curse foolish movies, I dig retro-indie movies and almost every other type / genre, if it's done well. My brother persuaded me to rent it because he said he heard that it was good and he has a good taste in films in general; the moment she told me I was looking at her like she was crazy. I have a tough time ending with this beach because there is so much bad to talk about. The only way I can rationalize a good rating is that you paid for the high rating of this movie. It is so badly done and not where it is dramatic, artistic, complicated, well written, well prepared or even tolerated. If this were the end result of my hard director, I would be embarrassed to release it to the public, so I don't even regret the director if he reads it - what the hell were you thinking?
