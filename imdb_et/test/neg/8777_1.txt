I think it wasn't a complete filmmaker's mistake. The film suffers from an unimaginably stupid decision to say to Clayton Moore (who had played his role in the 1950s and it was our only migrants whose old people grew up) that he couldn't wear the mask openly. Now remember that the poor man didn't make so much money, and it wasn't like he was going to take away this movie, but the whole thing seemed ... free. <br /> <The second thing the movie suffered (in addition to the leading person whose voice was so terrible that they beat it) was that the West wasn't so clean in 1981. John Wayne was dead, and we had just been subjected to a decade-long, large-scale liberation of how the West was built on the genocide of the Americans. (This and Blazing saddles sent the whole genre! Campfire scene. Enough said!) Hollywood went away from the West because Science Fiction was then COOL. <br /> <br /> One scene that stressed this was a drunken President Grant (and seriously, I would have given bad guys to Grant after the rescue. The country would have been better!) Yeah, right, it happened!
