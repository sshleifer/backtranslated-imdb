I was expecting quite simple R-rated graphics, a sexual, raw teenager when I saw it ... it turned out to be quite accurate ... only that was a lot sick and nasty when I thought. I don't know if director / writer Gregory Poirier is sexually ill or deeply confused, but I doubt that a normal person could have made such a movie. Maybe I could have done that if it was just that the only thing that was wrong was that it needed a hard stomach ... but it wasn't. The film is also terribly meaningful and disturbing ... every symbol that has more than one full time on the screen is extreme ... sexually, mentally or physically. I don't know if it's just a director's sense of humor, but I found it just ... wrong. Just wrong. Even comedy should have some seriousness. The plot is stupid. Operation is bad. The characters are contradictory and poorly written ... all of them. There is no pleasant character in the movie. Humor is disgusting and goes too far. The film is so incredibly badly made that I really don't think it's worth anyone's time. If you like R-rated, raw comedy with lots of sexual enthusiasm and graphical stuff, check out The Groomsmen, or better, American Pie ... or Road Trip, my personal favorite. But don't look at it. I can't describe how bad it is ... you should experience it yourself. But this is one of those times when I say you're better. So you can imagine that this movie goes near the bottom ... without knowing it goes through it and is much lower than that. This film looks the most like a group of horny teen boys together, a film crew, and each time one of them became an idea, they filmed it and later put the whole thing together. It lacks structure, consistency and taste. I only recommend it to horny teenage boys who have seen every other R-rated raw teen comedy and who doesn't care about quality. All the others ... do a reasonable thing; avoid this. It's not even worth seeing the harvest. Believe me. 1/10
