*** Small plot spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have a soft spot for Wayne Crawford. I know him very little, but he seems to have received enthusiasm to compensate for the lack of talent. In her films, she usually performs multiple tasks - perm from any of the 3 leading men, directors, producers and script publishers - who deal with the baselines of the basement. Nevertheless, the end product is usually a fun, non-attentive fun. <br /> <br /> "Evil Down" is Captain Crawford's happy luck, a bit like Bogart's "To Have & Have Not" - while the similarities in the movies are similar. <br /> <br /> The story begins with an underwater scene where two divers search for a wreck before the creature is seen attacking - jaws "Jaws 2". The wreck is El Diablo, which fell centuries earlier. The ship was manned by precedent priests in Spain, where the treasure of the church was stolen. This allows you to get acquainted with the various links of supernatural forces in which Lucifer and Armageddon see. The title of the film refers to the Devil ship, which is drowned in it, rather than to any malicious marine animal. <br /> <br /> No matter what the film is, there is a lot of fun to look at and do it professionally. You can't help but like a movie that, in the last five minutes, copies the famous beach scene to "So far forever" and "Casablanca" to the final line.
