You could have meant that there were signs on the island for some reason and the same movie. The first one had the original story, the second stole from King Kong and at the end of this trilogy (hopefully) it seemed that the story was over. Drag some people to the island full of dinosaurs and watch them live their lives. It was all there was. Special effects were decent, but not worth $ 8. If you have a discount theater in your local area, wait and see. I don't even bother to rent it. That would be too much money for this troubled thriller.
