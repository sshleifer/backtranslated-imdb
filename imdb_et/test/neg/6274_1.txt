This movie is so bad that they should burn the captain. You can't ruin the plot because there's no such thing on this film. Graphics are less than fake, they are terrible. Then you slip through the work-a-holika of the star-gaze of the rural areas, bouncing between your madness and the madman of the mad preacher. And when he finally gets to DC, they don't even need to kill him; The monster (which you don't know at the moment) is already dying, but how ... who knows and, of course, this ultimate sweet ending ... all the others on the planet are dead or die, but his family and a handful of stragglers are alive. Imagine! This is the movie C Thomas Howell goes with his serious regret he ever celebrated. It probably gives her nightmares.
