I'm not surprised that so many people fell for it. When I watched this movie, a few viewers attacked me if you were "forced" to break or at least "touched". Like when Hunting said he didn't love a girl. Like Robin Williams' character (sorry to forget the name of my role), he says repeatedly to the hunt, "It's not your fault" (Lord, thinking of this scene gives me a horse). I wouldn't have cared less about what characters would happen. Many of the people who work for Hollywood make the characters they don't even get (I think Titanic; Yuck!) ... but it only made me push and I want to get out of the theater. I think I just refuse psychologically and emotionally to manipulate all this. <br /> <br /> People are not me who I am forced to ... these characters are, and without good reason, because they are unreal. Worse still, nothing is new or surprising. Even the character of Robin Williams is all nailed. <br /> <br /> I gave it from 1 to 10. This is probably not so bad; it's just quite mediocre ... but so many people went to the other extreme and gave it to 10, so I thought one balancing voice wouldn't hurt.
