It is obvious that the director, the writers and all others do not know anything about their faith or the people who practice it. This film is an endlessly flawed and complete holistic heap. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a scene where a rabbi enters a woman's ritual bath while a naked woman swims, puts her hand on her head and blesses her. This is a complete look at the laws, only in such a scene are some violated laws: modesty, rabbi never gets into a ritual bath if there is a woman. <br /> <br /> Wrong contact, rabbi would never have put his wife on the head, not to mention that it is not a blessing. <br /> <br /> A woman from a ritual bath dunking a naked woman, pushing her head under water The laws governing ritual swimming require the entire body to be exposed to bathing water; that is, no one should come into contact with the sauna, definitely not suppress them! <br /> <br /> There was more in this scene alone, like 13 times (where does the concept even come from?) mentioning the rest of the movie was a complete mistake. It's scary what ignorance can do!
