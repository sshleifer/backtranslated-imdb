As a special fan of Western countries, I looked at it mainly because I wanted to see Lucille Ball in a role other than "I Love Lucy" or "Lucy Show". Here, in 1868, he plays Christine Larson, the owner of a salon in the territory of Arizona, married to a shameful local Indian (Dean Jagger.). he didn't kill me. I managed to make the role very different from what I used to see him - there was very little angry physical comedy that he later became famous, even though the film tried to gently keep the fun. (A typical funny line - "there are two ways to deal with women - and no one knows!") I couldn't find that hope, though I appreciated that Indians have been shown to be victims. Indian representative. There's a typical shootout action and lots of horses - your typical western, in other words. As for Christine, we think from the outset how her planned marriage ends; it's just a question of how he gets there. If you like Western countries, it would be pretty typical with a little humor. If you're not big in the genre, it's not. I'm not big in the genre. 3/10
