this is only the second time I was overhauled. unfortunately, both times have been films that can be described in several four letters that can be defined as stools or excrements. another such caliber film was masked and anonymous. <br /> <br /> Anywa, after the review .. for this movie, there are a number of important things I describe below. <br /> <br /> 1) Steven has lost a plot (ie all his other movies are killing. Family / friend is killed. Steven gets angry. Steven kills people.) <br /> <br /> 2) Steven has run out of money (there was a good car chase at first, but I think he blew his budget and couldn't afford a decent script writer or editor). <br /> <br /> 3) Steven no longer looks like his own action. Instead, it was shot (from memory) 2 under the neck of the fighting scene and back, so you didn't see your face. probably a double stunt. I think chuck norris is. <br /> <br /> Summarize ... the worst piggy movie ever. the second worst movie I've seen lately and I've seen many bad movies.
