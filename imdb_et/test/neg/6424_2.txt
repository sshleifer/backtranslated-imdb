I know a couple of people who see the leading actor in this movie (or at least the one it represents). They all give me a slip and I would be the last person to ever borrow one of these weapons or borrow. even a sharp knife. He has one average and ugly look. If you can express some sympathy for him, let me know. <br /> <br /> Of course, I may have the same concern and fear if I had an imaginary friend who had killed friends and acquaintances from my actual killing for the past 15 years. <br /> <br /> And for our European friends at IMDb, I am sad to say that some US colleges and universities are teaching paranormal phenomena, based on pathetic defense that it represents "academic freedom" and open exploration. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth it for you. You have no sympathy for any character (except Aunt Lydia, who goes quite early) and the plot doesn't make sense.
