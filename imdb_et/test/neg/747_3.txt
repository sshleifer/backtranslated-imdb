The BBC and the Arts & Entertainment Network should be ashamed of this unfortunate production in the world. The action is, except for Robert Hardy as General Tilney, painfully painful at best and worst. The costumes are up and they have some ghoulish exaggeration - a costume designer obsessed with feathers of women's hats? Certainly, at the beginning of the 16th century, not all women in Bath had feathers in their head. Production values ​​are bad and the film's boost makes it feel like the last minute has been rushed and clumsily edited. All in all, a torturing movie that I had to make myself look at. This is a shame, because the producers probably spent a lot of money on costumes and taking pictures of the location. Compared to Emma Thompson's sublime "Sense and Sensibility" or the extraordinary production of "Pride and Prejudice" in 1995, or the fine intensity of "persuasion" of 1995, this "Norther Monastery" production is definitely turning into Jane Austen's grave.
