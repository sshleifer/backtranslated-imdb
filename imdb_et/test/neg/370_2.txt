When you take movies, Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome, and Steel Dawn with Patrick Swayz, you have a pretty good idea of ​​what the movie is about. The only problem is that the film does not have the value of either production and it is mainly the first two copies. True, the film has many activities, but the viewer is asked to interrupt the faith. No one can hold a 50 Caliber machine by holding it - and keep going, and you can't shoot a group of people with an automatic weapon and a whole bunch. The problem is also poor editing when the school bus moves over, it's easy enough to see how the cannon does the job. And the lady running through it is superfluous because she had more time to stop the truck. If you are only interested in meaningless activities and violence, the movie is easy enough to watch. But don't expect anything from Thunderdome or even a cheap and sticky Steel Dawn.
