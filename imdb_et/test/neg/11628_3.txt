Jack Higgins' Simple Thriller About One Last Job Forced IRA Bomber (Where Have I Heard This Land Before?) Gets Mike Hodges to a Snarking Treatment. Mickey Rourke, with alarming red hair, admits all the priests (Bob Hoskins, all people) who accidentally showed the shooting. The rules of the Church keep the father of Bob speaking, but then Rourke goes and loves the darkness of the priest. They bind the organ of the church. What? Really, it's a plot. Alan Bates is like the top dog mobster who calls the frames (literally) and he seems to be the only actor in the hood of Hodges. Bates is all ready to do PRIZZI HONOR in the US, but someone else, including effortlessly charismatic Liam Neeson, has been informed.
