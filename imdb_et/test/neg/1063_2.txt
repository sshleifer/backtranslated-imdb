... said that TACTICAL ASSAULT was supposed to transmit the continuity provider. After seeing the first two minutes, I thought Rutger might want a new agent. After seeing the next ten minutes, I started thinking that Rutger might want to retire to save the potential audience from more of his performances. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's really a terrible movie. I didn't expect much, and why should I, when the name Rutget Hauer appeared on credit, only within a few seconds after the opening title credit, which showed NATO's military plans for bombing Bosnia with the USSR, I realized I was forced to ignite the unripe turkey three months after Christmas. <br /> <br /> No attention to detail. NATO airplanes bear the USSR markings and were told that the Hauer character spent six years in a Iraqi prison, which set in 1997. What NATO bombed in 1997 to the Serbs! I think the producers didn't think the audience would have noticed this ridiculous inaccuracy, but I know I did. Manufacturers also hoped that the audience would not notice the lack of consistency, such as the war with the Iraqi nozzles, which suddenly returned from Migs to F-4 Phantoms, but I did. Even in alien characters, F-16 would start off when they get back to the base, the jet has become Soviet-built. Mig <br /> <br /> Oh, and if you're waiting for a fool, you're just half right because it's stupid , but most of the plot center is located around the BASIC INSTINCT revenge plot. I give some credit to the producers (maybe the credit is too strong a word), because after seeing the sight of the sons of hell, the police of hell, the companions of hell now have a hell of a hell, which means every 20th century in the hell of a plot where Be TATICAL ASSUALT is the worst film in the lot
