This gawd-terrible piece is all over the place. The script is bad, the plot is bad, operation is bad. There are a couple of decent actors (Charles Durning, eg.), But the director didn't get anything from them. The plot line is Santa Claus, feeling dejected and thinking no one needs him anymore, having a little girl across the country to try to get his father with his mother. It includes a companion in a Santa suit with a stuffed parrot on the shoulder (played by "Isaac" from The Love Boat), the world's largest elf (played by Bruce Vilnach - a very funny man, but not an actor), an owner of a hardened factory who works for his employees for overtime for Christmas Eve, and a migratory trail where someone cuts one Santa Claus skiing, trying to win. If the plot sounds bad, it is worse on the screen. If you see this movie next, start, don't walk, watch TV and remove it. You may want to boil the TV to remove the remaining infection. If you look more than 10 minutes inadvertently, you may need to burn the TV and install the cable company with brand new lines.
