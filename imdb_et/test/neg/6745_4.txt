I speak badly with G.I.J.M. mainly because I think he lacked something that G.I. Joe was. Yes It was something that G.I. Joe was not like Don Johnson's celebrities, and Burgess Meredith, but I think G.I. Joe: The film lacked passion for G.I. Joe was in the TV series. Most of the artists' voices really sounded like they were in a dead pan and they died now. This is a good movie, but I wouldn't say it was the world's largest film I.M.H.O. :) <br /> <br /> Although violence is what G.I. Joe was built. I'd say Serpentor's amazing Duke in his chest wasn't the best way to go about Charlie Adler's character. Also, Golobulus Cobra's commander did not remember why he was elected to command the Cobra forces and then terribly mutated after he was unable to provide what Cobra-La rightly felt. <br /> <br /> It wasn't the best way for a GI Joe series to go out, but it's better than nothing. :)
