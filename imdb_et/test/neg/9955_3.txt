The plot has so many holes, it makes you wonder if they know they have an audience for it and just threw it together. I don't know much about George Zucco, but I've seen him in two movies. Apparently he is a loving father, a mad scientist, a vampire boy. He looks so ordinary. I'm surprised he's in the genre. This is typical: "I hope monsters can be used to fight the army." By relocating the wolf (or the coyote) to his hired hand, he turns into a werewolf. Glen Strange, one of Karloff's descendants to the Frankenstein monster, plays a lovingly hired man who has been sacrificed because he trusts a mad doctor. At first, the scientist is able to check when Petro (his name) can be changed. But as an invisible man, he suddenly starts to become independent and becomes responsible. There is a little love story of a daughter and a reporter with a high-pitched voice (Golly Miss Brooks). He wants to leave, but his father, the doctor, does not allow it. He is also driven by a group of his peers who mocked his research before and now he is satisfied. The way he disgraces them or kills them is quite far away and depends a lot on Petro and the guys waiting for the attack. It's not a very good movie. The strong point is the atmosphere of the forests, as people and monsters lie around the Spanish moss. Again, the townspeople are a bunch of whore who look like they fled from a bad west. One thing I missed was that the first girl is the first girl and it seems unusual for this film. There's a smoker's old lady who knows about werewolves, but nobody listens to her.
