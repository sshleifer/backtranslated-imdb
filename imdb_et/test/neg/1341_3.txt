Director / Screenwriter Diane English's 2008 update of George Cukor's 1939 MGM Classic Comedy is unfortunately more than his predecessor. Based on Clare Booth Luce's attentive 1936 game in a relationship that develops strongly among a group of female hired Manhattan societies, this story seems to be mature for a modern remake. Instead, because of the English-language thematic overload, production is accompanied by extended therapy with little intelligence. What's more, the different lifestyles of women in this movie today are reduced to the stereotypes of sitcom levels, and the central idea of ​​losing men from events seems to be even more established considering the public pseudo-development of both the public and men. women since the 1930s. To add insult to damage, HBO's "Gender and the City" recently made the big screen customization of this type of corporation much better and much sharper. <br /> <br /> The original game skeleton remains as the story focuses on the wealthy Mary Haines, who gave up her promising career in clothing design to become a Wall Street financial advisor to a dedicated woman. Like "Sex and the City", she is surrounded by three of her best friends - Sylvie Fowler, successful, editor of the devil magazine Miranda Priest, "Fucking Prada" (another movie echoes) Perennial Pregnant Edie Cohen, representing her husband and wife; and lesbian author Alex Fisher, who seems to represent every repressed group that is generally excluded from such an exclusive click. Through the manicure of the mouth, they find that Mary's husband communicates with the incriminator Crystal Allen, a Saxon girl who is more than ready to break the marriage when she struggles to show the actor. The rest of the plot is of little importance because it changes into a series of scenes that are focused on sister binding and striking, none of which is very enlightening and without a satirical zing supporting the 1939 film. <br /> <br /> Strange 47-year-old youth seems to be playing Ryan in a way that seeks to restore the goodwill of the 1990s "When Harry Met Sally" and "Sleepless in Seattle". It is not that he is not here at age, but his familiar sprights are at odds with the character's passive nature. Annette Bening's Prices Sylvie Rosalind's role as Russell in the scene steals somewhat better because she's been hiding the vulnerability to promote hardness, but her character goes through a trick that seriously undermines actress performance. Poor Eva Mendes has to play Crystal as a low, transparent shooter compared to a smart, sharp cookie with Joan Crawford's game. Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith have traveled along the road, like Edie and Alex. Much better is Candice Bergen than Mary Savvy, supportive mother and Cloris Leachman, who is not a useless housekeeper. <br /> <br /> Probably the release of a movie is reflected by the off-site post office, the 2008 DVD does not have a definite set of extras. There are two deleted scenes - one Crystal and his friends who have a girls' evening when contrasted with Mary's well-established garden party, and another expansion of Bette Midler's companions as several married Hollywood agents who advised Mary in the yoga camp late at night. Two Highlights: The Women: The Legacy, which discusses the history of the original 1936 movie movie, and the Women behind the Woman, cast and the team speaks endlessly about female self-empowerment and self It is ironic that the woman she is instructed and writes, uses such a patronizing image for women.
