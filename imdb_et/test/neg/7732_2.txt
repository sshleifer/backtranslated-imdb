My movie, this movie was nothing more than making movies by numbers. A fighting salesman can't go to New York, a mentor with a golden heart takes him under his wing, fights a salesman in California and makes it big, then loses that big, then bounces back for a simple life, then hits the bottom, trying to restore the top. I don't think I can remember any part of the plot that took more than five seconds. Case (spoiler?): When John Kapelos's character says he and his girlfriend came to Santa Cruz, and James Woods says he has virtually no chance of coming, you knew with 100% confidence that they would come in for the next scene or two. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Sean Young seemed confident.
