Story: French policeman Alain is shocked to discover that he was a twin brother when his body is in Nice. The investigation of the murder reveals that he had a list describing the acts of the Russian mafia. With the help of her brother's girlfriend, Alain dissolves Russian gangsters and corrupt FBI agents trying to find the list. </p>. As far as things are concerned, it is strictly formal. The script sticks to the clich√©s and the actor is mediocre. There are some nicely done sequences of action that have inventive chasing, fighting in a burning building, escaping through the roofs, a brutal struggle in the elevator, and JCVDs that flee their enemies through an elevated train path. Director Ringo Lam keeps everyone at a reasonable pace.
