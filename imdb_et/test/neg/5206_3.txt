I liked the movie, it's just that the characters run around without being mad. Like I said, bad goat. The goat was skin when the boy pretended to grind it. I would have liked the rape scenes to be more graphic (not the goat). Jane Ryall, who played Celia, made only one movie. She was very naked. This crazy couple who killed and tortured many people reached their legitimate places. I almost forgot the couple of gay transvestites who have also chosen sinners. If you like wall stuff, it's your movie. 3/10
