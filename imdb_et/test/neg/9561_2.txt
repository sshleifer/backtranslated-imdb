Not as bad as "Billy Bathgate", but close. Try, as he may, Warren Beatty just couldn't believe as Bugsy. When he turned to violence, I found it quite embarrassing because it was so fake. Also other actors do not appreciate. Annette Bening doesn't just have what she needs to play seductive women. As many have pointed out, Joe Mantegna would be better off if he had more faith in the script by George Raft. Only Harvey Keitel was undamaged, but then again, this guy can sleep. And Robert Beltran, with just one line, steals one big Beatty, Bening's scene. With these films, I am never sure if the director is going to make mobsters as ordinary businessmen or just comes out. Either way, I don't like it. These boys were killers and no matter how much Las Vegas is owed to Bugsy Siegel, I don't think the film should be worshiped, especially with a large studio support.
