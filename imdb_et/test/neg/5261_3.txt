My age: 13 <br /> <br /> Keats, played by Damon Wayans and Archie Moses, played by Adam Sandler, has been the best friends and has been around for years. What Moses does not know is that Keats is really Jack Carter, a secret police who is waiting for the right time for Moses and Frank Colton, who is a big criminal who is involved. When Colton and Moses discover that Keats is a policeman, Colton wants to kill Moses, but he goes away after shooting Carter, which doesn't kill Carter. Moses is found in police officers and is proven by Colton's misdemeanor. But when the police, including Carter, go to the plane of the whole country, all other police officers are killed and Moses and Carter are alone in the desert. Carter must stay alive and take Moses. <br /> <br /> Fairly medium action comedy, bulletproof is a fair plot, but a lot of movies are just stupid. For comedy, I found most jokes completely unforgettable. But when it comes to film, he has some pretty good things to do. Not a good fan of either Adam Sandler or Damon Wayan, but I found the actors and therefore the characters that were below par. The climax is not really big and the film is so unrealistic. It's not entirely bad, but it's not too good, and it's too short. After less than 85 minutes I stayed for another 15 minutes before it ended, but it wasn't, and the film seemed too short. In general, it is not a waste of time, but I wouldn't recommend bulletproof. <br /> <br /> Australian Classification: MA 15+: Medium Violence, Sexual References, Average Level Coarse Language <br /> <br /> Rating: 56 of 100
