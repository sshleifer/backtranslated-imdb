Don't make me wrong, I love most of Paul Schrader's films, so I was excited to be part of the Rolling Thunder screening at the French cinemath√®que in Paris, which had a surprise film on 17 December 2004. surprise movie The Exorcist and most people were there (I was too). The film was finished, but the score so P Schrader used extracts from the king's return and some other movie I forgot (Was it Conan?). Anyway, except the movie is ready. The lucky few (maybe 200 people) could say that please do not write a movie on the internet or in magazines, as it may have jeopardized his ability to get to the Cannes Film Festival. Then came the movie, then it came to light that the film might not choose for the festival because of its quality. Never in my life did I ever feel any discomfort when people were clearly laughing at skepticism. Regrettably, at a glance. I couldn't believe how low the authors of Sleep, Mishima, Blue Collar and Affliction had sunk. <br /> <br /> Forced to operate thorough, foolish, black and white moral, terrible FXs, the hardest to take from Christianity Schrader, never even relaxed, just bored like hell (not intended) and at all surprising! Some good places, but unfortunately unused or at least do not fulfill the original hopes! Finally, I was 100 times more satisfied with Schrader penned Rolling Thunder and wanted 2 hours ago. <br /> <br /> Don't believe the hype, even John Boorman's movie, is more exciting and original. Oh, and Billy Crawford's casting, the poor man does his best, but what are you waiting for? He is now part of a small club that is never the worst! I just give the movie 1/5 just because I didn't leave the room, but I should have.
