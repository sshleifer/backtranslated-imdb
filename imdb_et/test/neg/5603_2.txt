Pretty. <br /> <br /> Pretty actors and actors. Pretty bad script. Pretty frequent "let's have our panties" scenes. Pretty fair F / X. Pretty jarring location decisions (college dormitory room looks like a high-end hotel room - probably because it was shot at the hotel). Pretty shy story. Pretty terrible dialogue. Pretty locations. Pretty tedious editing if you don't like the music video flash-cut style. <br /> <br /> It's not an innocent pleasure - it's embarrassing. If you need to watch it, choose a good dance / tech album and turn off the movie - you can see real people in real black panties and probably follow the story easily. <br /> <br /> Cast can be capable - I doubt anyone might seem qualified given the lines / plot they were supposed to deal with.
