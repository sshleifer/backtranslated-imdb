I watched this movie with my boyfriend, an attractive hip-hop fan, and he was really looking forward to the film's alleged "soul" feel. Boy, we were dead wrong. When I watched the film, I felt two things: regret and relief. Think about the fact that I regretted that I was wasting my time to look at this terrible piece of soil, and the relief, because I watched it free of charge on the cable. <br /> <br /> This movie really gives the black people a bad name. stereotypes that I believe all smart black people everywhere have been trying to spell. I'm Asian, and I feel very sorry and sick for those who made this movie. What else to say? Bad writing, even worse functioning and terrible story. <br /> <br /> Even if you are dead and have no choice, don't look at this movie. Seriously. The movie doesn't really have anything to offer unless you want to see things like illegal illegal drinking, animal killing, female degradation and general: a really very bad-silver-sliding-amazing movie. Yuck.
