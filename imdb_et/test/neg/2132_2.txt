the movie I've ever seen. In fact, I find this one of the MST 3000 entertainment episodes I've seen. Not that it was good, but for everyone who has seen Manos: hands with a fate know that it wasn't two bad ones. The monster of the movie showed terrible things, everyone wore distracting things with swimwear and the plot was ridiculous. I still have no idea why they did the monster, they never gave a real reason. Lead female was supposed to be the worst gal I ever saw. They would have done better when they first cast the dead head that led. On the plus side were the dolphins that worked great!
