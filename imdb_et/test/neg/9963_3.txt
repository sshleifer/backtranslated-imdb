I work my way through the Horror Classics 50 film package and MAD MONSTER is one of the films included. <br /> <br /> I am sure George Zucco was a good actor; but it was just another movie I saw him, the first was DEAD MEN WALK, where he played two parts. But even a good actor couldn't save MAD MONSTER. <br /> <br /> Zucco plays a mad scientist, Dr Cameron (who was banned from academic circles due to unethical and inhuman attempts). He believes he can control evolution by bringing the characteristics of one animal to another. <br /> <br /> In this case, it is the blood transfusion (I expect) of so many other animals in my wolf. people. His goal is to create an invincible army that he can control through an antidote. The subject of his experiments is his hired hand, a slowed-down gardener whose dialogue slows down this snail's pace from the almost complete stop of the classic. <br /> <br /> In addition to his experiments, Dr. Cameron also reveals revenge on those who redesigned him using his transformed gardener. But he loses control over his subject, who starts to change without transfusions - yikes! Werewolf transformations are classic Hollywood stop-action / make-up effects. No doubt they were the beginning of time; but in today's digital age it is hard to imagine that the viewers are frightening it.
