The only entertaining thing I found about watching this movie was to listen to Star Wars, who came through the cinema theater wall (yes, I'm going to a very bad movie theater). This movie is so desperately bad that I think my eyes would be scratched rather than looking at it again. <br /> <br /> Compare it to the original. One is charming, funny, exciting, well-behaved and one of the best films ever made, the other is so funny that everything you can do is hope your eyes fall out so you no longer have to watch . I'm sorry Christina Ricci is a beautiful actor but can't compare to Hailley Mills and doesn't even start with Doug E. Doug in what amazing and absolutely fascinating Dean Jones. The small part of Dean Jones in the new version is the only partially redeeming part of this movie and this is the only reason I can justify a 1 * rating (also because imdb doesn't go negative).
