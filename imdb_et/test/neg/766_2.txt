Tom and Jerry transport goods by plane to Africa. But being white men, they are worried that they are not safe, so they put on the black surface. When they wear it, they take the black dial and live their new characters completely. They fall to the ocean and use an airplane wing as a raft. Before they get to the ground, they suffer too much from octopus and serious threats from sharks, swordfish and whales. On Earth, they have scared the fantastic creatures and ducks into the caves. Inside it is even worse when exposed to black surfaces with living bones. When you leave the cave, things are even worse when cannibals discover. <br /> <br /> "Plane Dumb" is a very sloppy effort by Van Beuren Studios. One example: an unknown lion to Tom and Jerry enters the cave before they do. But the animators have to forget it because the lion never appears again. Another example is the end that is not the end: it's just an arbitrary stop. <br /> <br /> According to the YouTube poster, the comic was designed with the votes and cartoons of the originally popular Negro comedy team. Aubrey Lyles died of tuberculosis before the end of the recording process and co-chiefs John Foster & George Rufle were forced to work around the animation of Tom & Jerry. "<br /> <br /> They shouldn't be disturbed. Crude oil animation and badly executed gags make the movie loser from start to finish.
