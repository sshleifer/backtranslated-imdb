After a secret mission to Bucharest to disclose an international armed group, Agent Son Griffith (Wesley Snipes) has been appointed to defend Romanian Nadia Kaminski (Silvia Colloca), the widow of the Romanian Mafia accountant. But the CIA safe house has been crushed by criminals and Son realizes that the information leaked inside the agency. Alone, trusting only his friend Michael Shepard (William Hope), Son fights to fight and defend Nadia. <br /> <br /> The career of the Wesley snips is downhill. I just saw this flick and this is another actor's disappointing film, whose career is now very similar to Steven Segal. The film has a lot of explosions, shots, and car chases that are related to a terrible story and terrible effect. First of all, the Bucharest police run Afro-American Wesley snips, but they never find a black American. I've never been to Romania, but I believe there are not many African-Americans in this country. Her character does not like the bath, wearing the same clothes for several days. There are no chemistry between the bull and sexy Silvia Colloca, but she has free sex, falls in love with her and shares her happiness. The boy who fills Nadia's son is terrible. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Detonador" ("Detonator")
