When Singin 'in the Rain and High Noon appeared, this overwhelming turkey somehow won the Oscar for the best picture. Half of the movie is nothing but circus shows. The other half is the soap opera and melodrama. Heston and Wilde were both overwhelming, though they are annoying Hutton-related security system models. Playing as a self-centered trapeze artist, Hutton acts as a superfluous student in a poorly-produced school game. Grahame is the only party that has decent performance. DeMille has no interest in telling a good story, but only in creating a longer view.
