I don't think this is necessary for sketching the plot because the site and other users have already done an excellent job. That said, here's my chance. This is by far the worst film of 2005, and has been really bad. I don't even have to go into the details because this movie is NOT US. Bad behavior, bad plot, bad leadership, bad special effects-you call it. If it is not alone, when the worst film is ever made, it is tied to another piece. I would be embarrassed that my friends would know I was in this movie. But hey, most people who see it do it no matter what the comments he gets, so you have more power. If you feel a gap between your evening in two hours, don't blame me.
