This movie should be called adventures in Cinemascope. It's like a scriptwriter and director who talks about Cliff's Notes page 3 and decided it would be a great tool for the Italian Alps. Rock Hudson is pretty good here, but the dialogue is not like Hemingway at all. This is a version of Hemingway. Scene from Hecht is a cage. See the 1932 version of Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes. It is a great cinema and it was done by someone who understood Hemingway and the war in Northern Italy. Gary Cooper is very, very good compared to his presentation to whom Bell Tolls, where he is rigid as a desk and thinks he is in the west. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you are a Hemingway fan, take advantage of yourself and don't watch this movie. Your best choice is to get a disconnected audio CD and just listen to one of the greatest novels ever written.
