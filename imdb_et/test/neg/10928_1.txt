It seems that people involved in this film are filling the ballot box to increase their ratings. The good news is that probably only 18 people have seen it. I think he will put me in the 19th century. I do not participate in the flick and do not know anyone who did it and I am a long-term IMDb user (check your voice data and comments for the last seven years) so I promise to give an honest and impartial opinion. It has come to you with a 30-year-old horror fan, who has also appeared with a couple of small budget flip-flops. <br /> <br /> After a few interesting video effects, Frankensteins Bloody Nightmare is inconsistent, boring, and technically incomplete. Apparently, it was shot in a quiet reserve and the sound was then duplicated; most sounds like it is recorded with tin and string. More than three-quarters of the dialogue is unheard of. <br /> <br /> I looked at it from start to finish and didn't know what the story was or even if it was. It seems that the director is mostly impressive with long and punching tables and dead black spaces that do nothing but the pillow film. It would be a problem if we actually developed a plot and made a film with some feeling. In this case, the rule does not apply. It doesn't matter how scenes are taken because they don't add a story. <br /> <br /> Watching this video is an exercise of all levels. Regardless of who worked on it, they write, but they try to influence IMDb ratings here, it's just a bad, annoying stuff. <br /> <br /> This is the truth. If you're thinking about spending your money or time, think again. It's easy to find something better because you can't find much worse. <br /> <br /> And that is an unbiased, careless truth.
