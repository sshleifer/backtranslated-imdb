Michael Feifer writes and manages this fictional story based on the arrest of Edward Gein in Plainfield, Wisconsin. Gein was responsible for the scourge of terrible murders which, in the late 1950s, sent a shock wave to his rural hometown. His evil spirit and the twisted world are suspected by his dominant eager Lutheran mother. Ed was given the nickname "Plainfield Butcher". He kidnapped the corpses of the woman's fresh tombs, which resembled her mother, and she had sex with them before she "dressed them like deer" in her garage. The earpieces whose bodies are hanging upside down are his personal mark. After her arrest, she would have found many articles made of human leather at her home. In this film, young deputy Bobby Mason (Shawn Hoffman) makes a search for Gein (Kane Hodder) personal when his storekeeper's mother (Priscilla Barnes) disappears. Operation is much better than the ridiculously liberal saying of documented events related to Gein. Also cast: Adrienne Frantz, Timothy Oman, John Burke, Michael Berryman and Amy Lyndon.
