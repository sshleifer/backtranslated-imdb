It's really just terrible. Quaid crosses more than Shatner. The part where Elvis walks and says, "You can have it all," just kills everything that might have been in this movie that is bad enough, as it is. Drug use was completely covered with snow, the only thing he had to do with his life was a little bit of his cousin at his wedding. Quaid also looks like Lewis and has dark roots and eyebrows. I wish it could be done again in the future with someone who doesn't try so much. A bigger budget does not harm and perhaps more of his real life. I was very disappointed in Quaid. Don't look at this movie or you're too.
