I can hardly find words to describe how much this trash can offend me. Why is it that American filmmakers always leave the way to represent Jamaica as an upside down, and even worse, to let people play Jamaicans who are trying to focus? We are not all very blind, we are not all wearing furniture, be it work or protection, we do not share naked in our homes and we do not practice VOODOO !! We are doctors, lawyers, architects, businessmen and women, musicians, actors and filmmakers. I'm sick and tired of looking at all those Jamaican images like foxes that do nothing but sit down all day at the beach for smoking or firing (if we don't live in our wooden houses). ). YES, we wear clothes. YES, we have electricity. No, there is no weed control on the island and NOTICE IS BETTER IN ENGLISH because you! The worst part is that I am not only angry and bitter, these are the real answers to the questions most Jamaicanans who have traveled abroad have been asked at some point. Read the book before you assume what it is like in another country and even worse, decide to film it. <br /> <br /> WELCOME TO JAMAICA! The countries where we all do is murder white people and beat our bongos drums ... Crypt tales are officially ill with the whole team that worked on this garbage, especially with the writer.
