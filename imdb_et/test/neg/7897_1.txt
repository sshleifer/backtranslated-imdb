It may be the worst film ever made, in a league where there are movies like "Howard Duck", "Plan 9 Outdoor" and "Ishtar". I don't understand why I decided to see this movie because it was a waste of my life. Also, I don't understand why I would like this movie, despite their sense of humor. Action is one of the worst I've ever seen, as well as writing. The characters are all foolish and the whole movie doesn't have a funny scene. Tom Arnold is probably the worst actor - this film proves it. There's nothing worthwhile about this movie. Don't try it, don't look at it, don't even say it looks interesting. It's bad enough when I saw it.
