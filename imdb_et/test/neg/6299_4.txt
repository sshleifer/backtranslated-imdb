This movie is trying hard but fails. Maybe for non-Australian audiences this can be a travel letter, but it's just annoying as a native language. <br /> <br /> Everyone who lives here knows that Broken Hill is a tough, harsh, isolated mine town. When a couple of quoted fruits pull up, it's all so predictable. Where have I met the worn thing before? Oh yes - city mouse and mouse. Keep us. <br /> <br /> I hoped it would improve, but after the Broken Hill scene I could see where it went and the TV turned off and went to sleep.
