All in all, I spent my group of friends and spent about 45 minutes outside the theater, sharing our favorite tongues, contradictions in the plots, unbound open ends and other ridiculous aspects of this movie. I found that the story is lined up with unreasonable points and plot lines are as underdeveloped as dino embryos, which are still locked in the Jurassic Park shaving cream. Editing was bad and no characters created any compassion or feeling. In short, this film lacked any intercourse and excitement that the first film offered from the viewpoint Even the new dinosaurs were little and far away (although I really enjoyed pterodactic.) We have several short new species shots and only 2 really were involved. <br /> <br /> There is no lack of actual scientific content (not that it was to be realistic but logically formed, ie how they built dinosaurs # 1 and malcom's chaos ramblings) as researchers and former childhood specialists were also disappointing. <br /> <br /> In short, it seemed that the movie was nothing more than a pretext to make the dinoside back to the scene to make some money. I hope the movie's visitors will not fall into this trap (although I probably did)
