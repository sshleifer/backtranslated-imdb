Midnight Hour AKA: Tell Me No Lies (as found in some video stores) can be evaluated in two different ways. Merritt is one film that has a plot (without holes), a good story and a credible conclusion, and the other is a skin flick that it is trying to be. This is definitely nothing more than a B-film skin color, whose only purpose is to show every girl in the movie at least one long sex scene. <br /> <br /> If you try to rate it as a regular movie, it is at the bottom of the line. LARGE plot holes destroy any drawing on it. For example, if a co-worker is killed, would you call the police or have you got home and hit a hot tub? By judging this film by the content of the skin, it's traceable ... hardly. Girls are mostly beautiful but obviously enhanced. Sex scenes were quite long and superfluous, and it made its quality just a bit boring. <br /> <br /> Amber Smith may obviously be a decent actor if he wants to. He was not as terrible as you could imagine or maybe cast aside, he seemed much better than him. <br /> <br /> Zoe Anderson, who played Array's Detective, shouldn't even look at the movie, much less acting in one. He seemed good, so we know why he was there. <br /> <br /> Generally, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Even if you are looking for a good skin flick, it is much better. I appreciate it in 4 out of 10
