I do not see anyone who actually read the mysteries of M. Didius Falco could do such mockery for them. An Aussie has no ancient Roman activities. No book is in this movie except for the setting and characters, and they are wasted on a thin enough plot to read a stupid script. Kevin Connor and Lee Zlotoff have a lot of nerves that display their names on credit.
