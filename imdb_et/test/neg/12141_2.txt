I grew up looking at "Bowery Boys" on weekends and even at a young age I could say that it was a small rent stuff as the name suggests. However, it was fun to see how Satch (Hall) got better from Muggs (Gorcey) after Muggs beat him. The East Side Kids stuff was never shown, although it was a public affair and probably cheap, but it was just a low standard setting for kids, although we only had five channels to watch. Enter in 2005 and I'm from my childhood repossesin. I can't find any Bowery Boys on the DVD, but I found on East Side Kids and on a public website. Luckily I saved my dough and saw free Bowery Blitz on the web and it really really blows. Now I see there are some Bowery boys here and maybe some bad film enthusiasts who gave this melodrama to the 10's, but haven't even tried to be funny. It's the East Side Kids drama, not comedy, so it's not good. The best part was to see Muggles fight at the end, he reminded me of his classroom days, which is like a girl when I fight. Leonard Maltin said in his mini-biology that this flick is one of the best, so you can just imagine. If you want to see some of the semi-decent East Side activities, you may see Ghosts on The Loose, but the bottom line is usually a comedy group that starts its career hard and narrows. if they were the best. Still, Grade 2 stuff is below 3 stories that imitate them, but entertain those who grew up with them. This feature does not bring pleasant "Bowery Boys" memories back and is best left to the Monogram fanatics.
