This movie sucks. Action is worse than in the movies we did when we were 10 years old with the camera. The effects look like 80's of computer games and the scheme is worse than terrible. Even the worst Van Damme films make it look. The bad boys' accent and speech rhythm is so bad that it's funny. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend watching it if you are not one of the biggest fans. 1 out of 10.
