The film begins with Ingrid Bergman and his two freaky servants arriving from Paris to New Orleans. Apparently years ago, his mother was involved in a scandal and Ingrid returned to try to irritate relatives who had previously forgotten that his mother existed. This is because he explains that they are shocked enough to pay him to get rid of him. Then he leaves that money with New Orleans and looks somewhere else for a millionaire as he depicts the countess. Gary Cooper sees the way up and looks completely out of place for the sake of love. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that this movie wasn't the reason why Ingrid Bergman's film career fell - his performance and character were bad! Instead of a classic and a weak woman, she usually played in a movie, she is probably one of the most annoying movies. His fake Contessa was low, demanding, unpredictable and amazingly stupid. How he could feel any man as a mystery because he seemed less vampish than just plain nuts !! I am not exaggerating to say that he behaves occasionally like someone with a combination of severe mental illness and personality disorder, and all these together make me think "who would fall in love with this confusion in the world?" . Frankly, I was unable to hold my histrionic and narcissistic behaviors and he looked more like a guest at The Jerry Springer Show than a leading lady! The confusing, terrible and excessive act is the words that come to mind when I think about his role. <br /> <br /> The rest is frankly puzzled by Bergman's healing and hysterics. Although Gary Cooper is generally a great leading man, he dominates him and just seems lost. And, strangely enough, they flogged their two companions together - Flora Robson and Jerry Austin. Mrs Robson is known for her queen Elizabeth I's images, but here they are somehow strangely covered with honey, and the end result looked like a cigar shop in India and Aunt Jemima's love children! Her face was very wood, she created a strange eyebrow and she dressed like a slave. As for Mr. Austin, he was a dwarf and although it should not be opposed to him, his role was written as he was acting - very, very ungrateful to a person who is "vertically challenged"! All in all, this rotten actor, writing and limping direction, as the great smellers of this age - is almost as meaningless and boring as famous turkeys like PARNELL and SWING YOUR LADY.
