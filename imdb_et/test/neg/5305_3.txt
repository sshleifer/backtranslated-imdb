Chili Palmer is tired of making movies and knows she wants to succeed in music. Half of the Mafioso half as an expert negotiator, he wants to rise in the music market. But you know that everyone is like him and it is harder to expect a good singer, Linda Moon. The first part is funny and full of irony, it belongs to simple jokes and it has much less good moments. Only two women (Uma and Milian) have a decent role. Most of the film is made of histrionic character, too exaggerated (little is OK, too much is nasty) and the only thing that could be saved is a gay bodyguard who is at least consistent, the rest is too much idiot. The most surprising is that the movie is not boring, everything happens so fast and there are so many things that you don't have time to get bored if you want to watch the movie. It can offend your intelligence (a lot!) And the movie is bad (yes!), But it's not boring.
