I saw this movie because Calexico scored. Real disappointment. Irritating, trendy scenes with suburban horses and their cliche lifestyle. Cheesy stereotypical Mexican border culture (mystical grandfather with rattlesnake and potions, grandson of his mariachi-style restaurant getup). The couple laughs, but over you, barely seeing and the main filmmakers.
