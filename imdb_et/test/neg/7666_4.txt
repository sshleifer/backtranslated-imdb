Concorde ... The airport '79 starts in Washington, where a man named Carl Parker (Macon (McCalman) is contacting a high-profile TV news reporter Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely) to give secret documents to prove his superior Kevin Harrios (Robert Wagner)) Harrison Industries owner and president who develops weapons for the armed forces have illegally sold weapons to foreign countries, but Maggie sees Carli murdered and barely flees his life, Maggie tries to get to Concorde the following morning and plans to hit Harrison, who is also his boyfriend who would destroy him and decided to save himself, he plans his high-tech Buzzard home rocket to stop and destroy the Concorde attempt at a time that killed all the on-board & documented destruction of evidence ... <br /> <br /> Airport '80 - Concorde for this cinema and primary home video publications, because it appeared here well in 1980, not in 1979 the last entry David Lowell led the fleet in the franchise. Rich & is a notorious bad film that was probably laughing at the time of journalism and testing, calling on Universal to promote the film as an action comedy. The first thing to say is that Concorde ... Airport '79 is really a silly and downright movie, but for pure entertainment I can think of a much worse movie to spend 108 minutes, which I really want. I liked the absurd graph of a wealthy industrialist who wants to kill his girlfriend's TV reporter before he can disclose him as an illegal dealer, but this guy doesn't make fine and decides how to do it the best, is to blow up his guided missile with Concorde and then you can fench fighter pilot try and shoot it before you finally sabotaging it so really there are three mini catastrophe flicks in one here because every time a super pilot Joe Patron succeeds the day. You know that Joe Patron, played by George Kennedy, appears in all four airport films and goes to the mechanic for the first Concorde pilot, and I think he is a bit jinx because he has been involved in four major air accidents in nine years. I think the real reason why the airport series stopped was that Patron retired after that, and jinx was canceled. Some of the things that are happening here are just stupid, Patron makes a barrel of rolls, rides up and out of the enormous Concorde of a guided missile, not to mention landing the fire and firing fire guns out of his window to destroy the rocket . This man is good, very good. Then there is a character, there is a saxophone who plays a black guy who smokes in the toilets with an old woman with a bladder problem and a team of badly accustomed Russian gymnasts. Neither do Concorde passengers who are almost hit by a rocket and then attacked a Jet Destroyer to disturb and manage to board the next day, I do not know about you, but after that I would probably find a safer way to travel and why the police or authorities don't ask anyone? Why has Concorde Captain Patron been able to sleep with a French prostitute? Concorde ... Airport '79 is definitely not boring and full of memorable moments and I was entertaining, although it's far from a good movie and for today's audience it may not be patience, hell, I liked it was a little bit, but it's not sort of classic. <br /> <br /> Although Concorde is no longer flying, it is still quite cool looking for a plane and there is a lot of material used here at Concorde ... The airport '79 was built seven. This Concorde was also the same aircraft that fell after the tire bust caused a fuel tank breakage and a leaking fuel fire on July 25, 2000, while Paris unfortunately died of 109 passengers and crew and 4 people on the ground. When it flew on television in the United States in 1982, almost twenty minutes of new material was included, if not all that has just been released over two years after the original production. I know that most of the consequences here are, but I don't think they are too bad if you think it was done in the late 70s. The camera moves during effects, the actual material of the actual tiles is used instead of the toy models, which I think would have been a lot worse and I can certainly see what the makers tried to do with limited resources and limited technology. In a strange way, they are quite impressive without ever looking for it if you know what I mean. Most likely, the airport's activities are rockets, exploding planes, bold landings, murders and a boy named Robert Palmer (no, not the singer) who gives the woman a jacuzzi. <br /> <br /> IMDb says its budget was about $ 14,000,000, which is actually more than I thought, maybe these special effects aren't that impressive. Shot in Utah, Washington, Los Angeles and France. Action is not great here, people do not see enough concern that they die. Goerge Kennedy gets some bad linings while Robert Wagner plays a bad guy. <br /> <br /> Concorde ... The airport '79 is fun for bad movie enthusiasts everywhere and be brutally honest, rather I look at this fun crap movie as an approximately two-hour Oscar candidate.
