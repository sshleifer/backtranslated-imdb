In this film, there were some decent moments and a few times when it was pretty funny. But this did not compensate for the fact that in general it was a very boring film. In this movie, Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock had no chemistry, and I didn't understand why he would even consider leaving his wife for the chick he was supposed to have been beaten. Armageddon had better chemistry between him and Liv Tyler. Hell, there was better chemistry between Sly and Sandra as a demolition worker. <br /> <br /> There were several moments in the movie that just didn't have to be there and were amazingly slow. <br /> <br /> It was a bad remake of "My Best Friends Wedding". Wait until it has been in the video for a year and a half and rent it in a 0.49 cents trash if you have nothing else to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon, and you can't think of better movies.
