Tagline: Happy died ... before looking at it. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a Bulgarian movie from the 1920s, so I can't say it's ever made a movie, but it's definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. I can hardly remember it. <br /> <br /> Everything I remember is a family of stupid people who don't do anything right. Their car has one of the four wheels left in the sand, so they decide that there's nothing to do and prepare to live there for the rest of their lives. Then there is an old man who is aware that there is a cannibal band, but has never had the idea to report it to the police. <br /> <br /> And talking about the police ... when these freaks have been living there for years, many people have to disappear ... how did the sheriff not suspect anything? <br /> <br /> But I gave up asking questions in the first five minutes or so. The rest are drilled. Hallucinating incredible cage. <br /> <br /> I'm gracious and not talking about dialogues. And actress. And the consequences. <br /> <br /> I only mention the last scene where a freak girl eliminates the snake (snakes! They will eventually come out of the hell they have a story?) with a sniper-accurate stone, which shows Mr Craven's total disregard for reality and at all on the planet Earth. <br /> <br /> I believe the film has been a rebellion. The first appeared in 1977. <br /> <br /> Even if eating cannibal is not a fair punishment for the director of this intelligence attack.
