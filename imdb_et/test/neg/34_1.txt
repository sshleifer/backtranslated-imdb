Jacqueline Hyde starts like every other ordinary day for a telemarketing individual, Jackie Hyde (co-producer Gabriella Hall), until her boss (Robert Donovan) shoots her when making personal calls, but that's not all bad news because she received a lawyer from her, who informs her that her grandfather (Malcolm Bennett) has recently died and that she left her mansion and fortune (why doesn't something like this happen to me? Sigh). Very excited, Jackie drives there and makes himself home by looking for a thermostat late in the evening. Jackie stumbles upon a secret space where his grandfather stands out with the red formula he invented, which allows anyone to drink a change. Being a little porky, Jackie finally lives with the enchanting Jacqueline (Blythe Metz), but Jackie's better-looking ego is starting to lead ... <br /> <br /> Written, compiled and directed by Rolfe Kanefsky I thought Jacqueline Hyde was from the beginning to the end complete and complete nonsense and it is so simple and straight. According to open credit, "Jacqueline Hyde" was "inspired" by the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel "Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde's Strange Case", frankly, if Mr. Stevenson saw what his story here is going to do to his grave. At first I think Jacqueline Hyde was / is meant to be a horror film, IMDb will definitely list it as such, but there is no horror besides how bad it is. I would say that Jacqueline Hyde is more like a soft core than anything else, and we know why to sit and watch this softer than soft porn when you can see what is the right core that actually delivers the goods? Why, this is the question I ask here. Also, it is not even good porn, besides being too soft, it's boring, boring and not-worth mentioning sex scenes are little and far. The most intelligent aspect of this movie is the title that would have been pretty smart, if not because another film used Jacqueline Hyde's (1998) title over the last century and judging from the IMDb plot summary that it sounds much better than this rubbish piece. This is one of the films you have to watch to see how bad it is, but I hope you never get a chance. <br /> <br /> Director Kanefsky worked obviously with a low budget, but it is no excuse these days, filmed in a digital camcorder film seems cheap and some cases of CGI look like they came from Nintendo Gameboy, the final "shocking" twist is probably The worst morph effect I've ever seen and is pretty good for a laugh like scene when Jackie's breasts grow horrible through CGI. This is another thing, the film takes itself too seriously. The subject sucks, is too predictable, and makes a bad film, but maybe, if the dialogue was deliberately funny with some dirty porn calls, watching the movie would have been more fun, unfortunately it is not. Forget about any decent horror, violence or gore, because at the end there is no surprise without losing blood. <br /> <br /> Technically, Jacqueline Hyde is home-made film material, photography is a flat hand hidden - and shooting options, music, production design and special effects are suitably low for script matching. The act was terrible, seriously, that it was bad. Any decent film enthusiast will have an almost impossible time to try to find the value of this mess, be sure to avoid it.
