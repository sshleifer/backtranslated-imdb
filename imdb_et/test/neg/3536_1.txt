SPOILER !!!! Mind Ripper hmmmm .... I just looked at pedestrian pedestrian films and I was just about Giovanni Ribis. I thought Giovanni Ribisi didn't do any horrors, so I checked it. I saw a "outpost" (remember the ripper). I checked it on my Tivol. There was a date on Sci Fi. So I was appointed. I got my pop corn ready and came to the couch and what the hell is that? Freakin bold guy in blue sweat pants runs around yelling! Nothing is scary about this movie! If something is funny! Funny, if the low budget is, funny how predictable it is, funny how bad the actor is and funny how much money he didn't make. Ok giovanni ribis is a good actor, but this movie is stupid. It's so stupid. They killed him at the end and then they go on this plane and have a "monster" on it. They shoot him with a head shotgun and fall to the long way. And <br /> <br /> -GASP- The killer ends, in his life! WOOHHH! Scary! woooohhhh! Happy fat bag with 2-hour garbage waste. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: You have to go somewhere and you have to kill some time. A pleasant ripper is not a recommendation. I'd rather be naked in the snow than watching this movie a second time. <br /> <br /> GENERAL GRADE: F- - - - - - - - - - (ENTERNAL)
