This movie is just nonsense, I can't put it otherwise. It is known from the beginning that this is a mess. <br /> <br /> Story, dialogue, acting, special effects, makeup, pretty much everything sucks. I like vampire movies and I know they have never been Oscar winning movies, but it's not even worth seeing, I can't believe how someone produced this thing. <br /> <br /> It's not even about vampires, it's still a dream / reality experience. The film's development is inconsistent, the motivation of the characters is ... There doesn't exist, everything seems to be a big joke. Maybe they tried to do that, but I doubt it. I'd like to know what they were trying to pull, but it's just upside down, it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen a lot of bad movies but nothing compared to it) Please do it yourself and don't look at it. <br /> <br /> P.S. It's also full of clich√©s! P.S. 2 Bad script, bad management, bad cinematography. P.S. 3 I looked at it when I commented on it for everyone.
