I really tried, but this movie wasn't good for me. The action scenes were boring, acting was surprisingly bad, and some of these characters were too stereotyped even funny. Pam Grier strives, but if you have nothing to do, even his remarkable talent cannot prevent a disaster. Even according to the standards of this weak genre, this movie is pretty bad.
