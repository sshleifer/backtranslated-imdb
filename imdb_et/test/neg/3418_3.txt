Geoffrey Wright, director of "Romper Stomper", transmits Shakespeare's "Macbeth" to Melbourne, Australia's contemporary criminal underworld. The result is a semi-terrible cinema. Sam Worthington is Macbeth and walks for great self-awareness and boredom. Victoria Hill, who wrote the script with Wright, is Lady Macbeth and she is not terrible or good. Lachy Hulme, who plays McDuff, is the only actor who exerts any authority. The rest, including Gary Sweet, is wasted and misdirected. A view of a movie shot by Will Gibson, no visuals on the film. Everything is too clean and too deliberately illuminated. Wright's direction is extreme and the sequences of actions are confusing and inaccurate. The film has been mistakenly used as "Australia's most violent film", but the film is sometimes violent and reasonably bloody, but it does not give any influential moment. Slow motion and terrible pretense, this eleventh version of the silver screen from the classic game is the wrong end.
