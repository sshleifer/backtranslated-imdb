Although the Twilight Zone was a great show, it was also very uneven - some great episodes, some delicate and many in between. Do not believe that hard evil fans - there were some stinkers and it was definitely one of them. <br /> <br /> In a house that is obviously designed to attack Fidel Castro, nearby Peter Falk has a lot of make-up and razor) to reach a magical mirror that allows him to understand who all his enemies are, so he can eliminate them. Though I believe Castro is a thug and dictator (and confirmed by tens of thousands of refugees and political prisoners), it is amazing how such a sermon is actually an audience laughing at America's attempts to crowd and indeed Castro seems to be fine! Think about it - Serling and the company wanted to hurt Castro, but it seemed to be obvious, preaching and silly. <br /> <br /> It's really bad - almost ridiculously bad to see today.
