This is the embarrassing n-th transformation of the same plot into a n-idiot-young-adult-in-peril-them-need-on-idiot film that is beginning in the millennium: this time we get the story of the madman who comes back from the dead so he to withdraw gold. We have almost no excitement, almost no bare muscles (even if the girls are really hot, only one of them shows their bare ass in a few seconds), the usual horror of the sunset-shaped boulevard (this time Karen Black, Richard Lynch, John Philip Law, Jeff Conaway), A lot of fake blood, only this crazy miner who is picked up as a zombie is cool enough to leave you dead - even not exactly - to the end of the screen. Don't waste your time if you are not a graduate.
