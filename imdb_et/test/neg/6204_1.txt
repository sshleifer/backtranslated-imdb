I just don't know how it is foolish, crap, junk, garbage, and good nothing in the movie. It was a very boring, very weak (or not) story and wasn't even funny. The film was only 135 minutes only on the section that tells Premi (Salman Khan) a guru of love and helps the unhappy and romantic Bhaskar (Govindat) to become a girl of his will. I'm not saying I didn't like the movie because it wasn't funny or anything, I accept a movie that's not funny, but having a decent story. The only two reasons I can say that this is a super hit is: <br /> <br /> 1. Salman Khan & Govinda is on the screen, but for the first time it was Salaam e Ishq, which was a flop, so it can't be. But it was a really good movie. <br /> <br /> 2. Salman Khan is called Prem and all the films with that name have been hit, including Maine Pyar Kiya. So it's just luck. <br /> <br /> I heard it was a remake of Hitch, I haven't seen it, and I'm glad I didn't. Music is good, only good songs Do you want a partner, you are my love and Soni De Nakhre, but what is it to use in a very bad movie that even if you have someone like Katrina Kaif, who dances with her left feet? He's totally nonsense. He does not know the actor, the language (his voice is always dubbed to him), dance, and always does not impress. I don't like him once, that he was even disappointed with Karan in Karan. General Partner is a disposable film with a disposable actor Katrina Kaif. It's better that he kicked out of Bollywood and never comes back.
