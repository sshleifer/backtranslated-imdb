At the time of production, the title of the LWT series was "Rocket To The Moon", a title that was cheesy enough for everyone at the time. Then came the word that it was sent back to "Achieving the Moon," as if the addition of this new word would have created difficult metaphorical meanings, which would include character relations and aspirations. This flawed fineness and understanding of the same heavy hand is clear from the entire fabric of the entire series and the same tired and boring love-triangle line is actually over 7 episodes! Any television program that decides to use the story of the "Love Triangle" even for one episode, pushes it, but it is unforgivable to have seven episodes over it. However, there is reason to look at how the Wight Island landscapes seem to offer a beautiful environment and Lynda Bellingham's seemingly relaxed blow that hits all the right comedies. But that is not enough. Several appearances are noticeable, especially when placed against a static and emotional landfill that Jonathan Kerrigan refers to his face. I have already mentioned Lynda Bellingham in her role as a "gift mother" (yes, it is as far as character development and background), but I was impressed by actor Maurice Roeves (who is by far the most experienced actor), having appeared in everything from classic movies like Richard Attenborough 'Oh What a Lovely War' and 'The Eagle Has Landed' and TV, including Baywatch, Holby City, The Bill, Eastenders, Cheers, Doctor Who in the 80s, Star Trek, and even in 1995 with Hollywood Sylvestor Stallone, Judge Dredd), whose performance reminded me very much of the real teachers I have met - often powerless men whose lives are very sad. It is refreshing to see that Roeves is still working, having also appeared in the 1998 British film "The Acid House" and recently with the wonderful Maria Bello and Sean Bean "The Dark". The reason for viewing this series, though its performances are very small. Another actor trying to raise his program hardest is Ben Miles, who is the role of the brother of a typical sexual crazy person (again, what is the original character!). Like in Roeves, the CV says it all. After that, Miles has since appeared on Hollywood V Vendetta and the full-length feature film "Necklace Affair" by Brian Cox, Adrien Brody, Christopher Walken and Jonathan Pryce. Unfortunately, quite capable actors I mentioned are relatively small roles compared to the dramatic drift tree, Kerrigan and Saira Todd, both of whom seem to have been in an accident for too long and have not yet learned to act. Even the permissive Frances Gray has suffered in the presence of such theatrical fetal dummies, and unfortunately, for him, the persistent memory I have of him is asking AD to take another relatively complicated picture, because take him unconsciously "pulled his knives out of his prow!". In every episode, familiar faces appear - the CBBC program children and "2 points 4 children" and other ads like Mr Ben's ("they remember me for that"), Lynda 'Oxo lady Bellingham and others I don't even want to remember. Every episode tries halfway to "deal with problems" such as teenage pregnancy, annoying pupils, and missile (!) ... things Grange Hill did better when my parents were young! All in all, this series was a disappointment and a wasted opportunity to see a truly interesting and well-developed drama series. Unfortunately, they took a simple route both in writing and mostly casting. I would recommend both "Waterloo Road" and "Street" to fans of good dramas - especially the last one who managed to achieve this. If you like the island of Wight, don't "get to the moon," instead go to the brochure - it probably includes more character development!
