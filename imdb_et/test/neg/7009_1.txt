I just throw in this review to show that I'm not crazy - I like a lot of Wynorsk's work - Deathstalker 2, Chopping Mall, against the law is fast paced and very enjoyable - just to prove that I'm m not blind, I need it to mention, with some of Shannon Tweed's "Body Chemistry 3 or 4 or something", are those that are bad - I have nothing pulled out of the sex sequences, but Julie Strain's breasts are so unnatural looking that you can't help but stare at them - which may have the desired effect, but i didn't enjoy watching them - and many of its voter members seem to be depressed or uninterested - "erotic thriller" was the worst thing ever to happen with low budget flicks and thanks to god that their day is more or less done.
