I picked it up again and again and I wondered if I should give it off. Today I broke and gave it to the bubble and I shouldn't be. <br /> <br /> Although the writer / director gave the film a venerable effort, it went a long way. The characters, though you wanted to feel them, just couldn't develop enough or deep enough to really engage them. Sara's sexual outbreaks became tiring - fast. I don't mind having sex in movies, and I don't mind bitchy characters, but being a "bad" girl does not mean that you are prone to ask people randomly if they want a sexual advantage. By the time the characters happened, I got bored and ready to move to the top, end, something exciting ... and nothing. The things people finally say about the story seem to be forced and unreal and just not played correctly. Had they been a little more angry there, they might have been interested. It should have been a temporary / drama film, and it should have kept the whole "red right" and a horror film cover similar to "Jon Good's Wife". Hell ... it should have been tight, period. <br /> <br /> Either way ... look at it on a rainy day or late night if there's nothing on the TV. Although not as big as I had hoped, I would go over some infomercials.
