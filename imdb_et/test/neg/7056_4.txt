'Sufficiently said. The hidden captain of the state capital is sent to a small county where moonshine works. He goes along the road when some local cages don't know he is a secret policeman (so they just fly as happily as ever). Soon he will take care of his wife and his three daughters who will wear all the short and short short short pants (gotta luv '70ndad). She loves one girl, but in the meantime she has to find out who is doing all six layers and rides to all local bars and restaurants. He must also fight the fat sheriff and his incompetent deputy who thinks he is a moonshiner because he is new to the city. <br /> <br /> Life in a small town in America, in the 70s style. YEE HAAAAAAAAAAA.
