Eight teenage convicts are taken to an abandoned Blackwell hotel to clean it up for community service. They will soon discover that it is the residence of a stray psychopath (Kane), who has a thing to pull and collect eyes. It doesn't help that the guard who reviews them (Steven Vidler) has been out of the beast four years earlier. <br /> <br /> My innocent pleasure is slaher movies. Most of them are poorly targeted and acted upon, but they still enjoy the value of complaint and entertainment. This is not a good example of evil. It includes scary writing and action, but death scenes are pretty good and the movie is fun. It is assumed that there is a blend between Friday, 13th and Halloween: the resurrection. I really liked this idea, but it didn't work too well. It was really just clicks and everything was predictable. Scenic Dan Madigan focused on death scenes and nothing else. The scenes of death themselves are pretty good and bad. Director Gregory Dark did a good job with them and found some creative killings. <br /> <br /> Actors are quite blissful and remarkable. This is because all the characters are one-dimensional and we don't know much about them. It was difficult for these people to feel because they were quite unlikely. Kane is surprisingly mediocre. I was expecting his screen to be more present, but he didn't do it well. Another option for Jason Voorhees if you want. The rest of the participants are relatively unknown and this film does not help or harm their career. <br /> <br /> Although death scenes are great, they are not scary. There is really no relationship that is just some of the death-related scenes. That is why the film will no longer hold a repeat value. Also, if you don't like slasher movies, don't waste your time with it. It does little to change your opinion. Finally, see No Evil is a decent film, but it's general and forgotten, so it's not worth it. Rating 6/10
