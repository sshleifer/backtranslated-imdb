My wife and I looked at this abortion from the beginning. I hated it immediately, but my wife got it for a couple of years. For me, worsened and worsened, and all the characters were undoubtedly harsh and depressing without redemption. Then my wife grew tired and we stopped watching at all. Sometimes I catch this clip or go through the surf. There's always someone shouting or doing something terrible. There never seems to be any lighter moments or happiness. It was always my main concern when we first looked at it - not humor. It seems that writers do not have the idea of ​​drama - they think they think about the drama of IS in the conflict and of course this is just one element. There is a great need for light and shade and actors who can bring something about it. I'm sure Eastend's participants are competent, but they have nothing to do. It must be the most frustrating work of showbizi. I don't understand why the British public is watching and loving it. What is on earth about our psyche? I've heard that he said it was "like in real life" - I don't know anything about my life or someone else's life, otherwise we would be under high buildings or public transport. The topics he deals with are far from looking at the family, but there is still a front distribution. I love series like Breaking Bad or The Wire, but I shouldn't wait for them at 7:30 or 8:00 in the evening. The program is large in the trash and should be avoided at all costs.
