The Bridge At Remagen contains some superfluous warfare scenarios I've ever seen. Apart from the actors in the wood, the top commanders of the tank do not attack their tanks parked in a nice clean line, in the middle of the road, and troops that bundle up with the weapons. Constant suicide behavior has so often found my "tilt switch" so that there was no movie to enjoy. Apparently, screen writers and directors have never been through the actual warfare and have never struggled with an expert who had. This movie is very inconsistent with the excellent detail of Saving Private Ryan. If you are under 7 years of age, I suggest you look at something else. <br /> <br /> GB
