First things first - though I believe Joel Schumacher is at best a mediocre director, and more often (as here) badly, the lion's share of this ugly traverse has to blame John Grisham, whose novel is based on it. <br /> <br /> At an undefined time (50s? 70s? now) the movie opens with a child's rape and murder, which is so cartooned that their goal seems to be to secure racists that "at least we are not so bad" ? Cut the bad guys who arrived in the evil places when the girls, father Samuel L Jackson, feared they would go off the road. <br /> <br /> The device is a "deep south" that probably never was - some black characters live in the shadows and seem to choose cotton, dyed-wool-racists (Kiefer Sutherland's comic version of Klansman) is ridiculous. The set is a trial: "good guys" defense - a milquetoast lawyer played by Matthew McConaughey, like his coma, his assistant Sandra Bullock's breast (he doesn't seem to serve any other narrative Donald Sutherland as a drunk-lawyer-in-match-up fight For the Prosecutor's Office, Kevin Spacey goes through the demon spawning suggestions, while the city generally burns the crosses, the witness is intimidated and the local citizens do not seem to care? Some reviews here claim that the film is immoral because Samuel Jackson is a killer and should trust to the forces of law, rather than to get off the weak-hearted oratorio by Matthew McConaughey. and the dialogue almost from parody Peter Menzies lush, 50s Technicolor cinema o n pretty, but a derivative. <br /> <br /> And it takes almost two and a half hours! <br /> <br /> What to say? It's a waste of 141 minutes for everyone, it's annoying, void and hammy, and it's almost morally reluctant to have the same effect.
