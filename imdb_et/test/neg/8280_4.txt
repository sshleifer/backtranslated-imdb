Pretty flat and terrible slasher that someone kills members of a high school team after their streak dies during the meeting. </p> I don't think anyone has ever watched and tried as seriously as Chris here - not even at the Olympics. This is a typical divine CG performance and if you are a human / legend fan, you should run straight and copy. <br /> <br /> But we look at slashers for murderers (you know it's true), not performances, and the End Day can't read most (is one really good kill). The real horror comes only during the band's "Felony" performance. Never heard? See the end date and explain why.
