I like the J-horror, anime, and even a little pink movement that some have called it, but it didn't do me anything. I'm ready to take a step further and mark this career of one of the greatest hopes of this film. <br /> <br /> Three young rockabillies are going to rape their girls. One group starts to develop references to their passport when their child's sister tries to catch them. The group always switches once the friends fight each other. It ends with a movie with the appropriate note. <br /> <br /> Apart from worshiping one another, they do not do much. The film is full of LONG continuous frames that only aggravate the problem. In addition, even if the film begins to do something interesting, it suddenly becomes an essential philosophy that never makes sense. For example, after one friend has turned into a heart attack against girls, she goes out and does it again, but then stops her mates from turning. Ah? Cinema art is slow and lighting is bad. Writing is OK, as is the operation that makes it a cinematic effort from the start. Mix the lack of technical ability with thin content and you have nothing but a waste of time. <br /> <br /> And one more remark, at least one of the familiar girls is not old enough to do it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
