I have a question for "Prozac Nation" for writers and producers: what is the reason and what is the solution to the widespread problem of American personal depression? The film is a film with unlimited potential as a Harvard student and writer, as Christina Ricci's ability to move. But this is not a story of success, but one of self-destruction when we look at Liz to bring in all those who come into contact with him. The film examines divorce, family dysfunction, drugs, alcohol and prescription drugs as potential causes of Liz's accident. But none of these superficial explanations is satisfactory. <br /> <br /> At some point in the film, it would have been helpful to assume that Liz should be responsible for his life and his problems. The light was not cast into what the film allegedly was "depressed in the United States." Liz had a story about a caring therapist (Anne Heche), caring roommate (Michele Williams), a caring boy (Jason Biggs) and a troubled but caring parent (Jessica Lange). The film's key picture is located in bed at Liz Hospital, following the disintegration of Challenger's space shuttle. Instead of equating Challenger with Liz's life, the film should have used the image as a starting point for his healing and recovery. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of the lifetime network of the "victim" movie of the general cable. A great deal was wasted, especially in the serious phase of Christina Ricci. Real Life Elizabeth Wurtzel obviously found her own resources to cope with her depression and become a successful author. It is unfortunate that the film could not even give us the slightest glimpse of his courageous spirit.
