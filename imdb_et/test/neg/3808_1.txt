another eu roth in making. self-promoting, bad script that apologizes to the horror leader. the winner is as far away from the new horror icon as mary poppins (reference to Disney score). what's going on here? you have marilyn manson who opens and closes this mess and chitty chitty bang. can it even be called horror? terrible, yes, but horror is stretching. David lynch should call them an elephant man for prosthetics. please stop the fans who want to be among the leaders. video managers already have enough competition in the film industry. Online and talking about how big your movie is, doesn't make it true. Stop madness. I work in industry and yes these movies are fun to do but rarely ever entertained.
