This review is for the UK DVD disc kit. The disc is called the Caught in the Act, which includes model behavior, Jamie and quick and curious. Two plates are called bedroom fantasies and contain Blue Plate Special, which is again amazing and love Potion No. 10. The final album is called Anything Goes and it contains chat rooms, he is a boss and legally you. Why the other four series are not included is a mystery, because there is definitely more material on the boards. <br /> <br /> Each episode opens with a letter from a satisfied customer reading Chloe (Lauren Hayes). Then we can see the story that opens when the guests check in. The Blue Plate Special is an exception because this story comes from the speaker. Writers should be given the hope that they will offer a different story. For example, model behavior is about two models that are under the attention of a photographer's team; Lust Again is about a man and a woman who left and resurrected their love when they meet at the hotel again; He is a Boss who is about to be a male secretary / dog who shows that he is more of a male than his female boss - much of his joy. All episodes bring a lot of nudity and sex. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and beautiful pieces. Even geeky secretaries change when they remove their glasses and shoot their hair down. Sexual activity is great, but it seems to me too funny and wrong. The work of the camera could also have been done somewhat moderately, spending too much time and moving everything to take it all away, and as usual, when we make sex, we get loud music. Finally, the final credit is mentioned in Palm Canopy Hotel, Singer Island, Florida, although my Florida card does not show Singer Island. The landscape certainly looks more like Florida than Utah or Las Vegas, which some people have mentioned. This is a pretty good effort and it is regrettable that the second series is still waiting for the UK DVD. 4 stars.
