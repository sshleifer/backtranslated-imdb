A possible good idea is a completely weak scenario that throws all the credibility out of the window, leaving very little cooperation for the participants. Roth covers it as well as possible when he is all in the mouth; Huril has about as many threats as the fluffy bunny and Stamp do not seem decisive as to whether he plays Eton's playgrounds as a former London cramp or some toff. As for the poor Laura del Sol, she does what she can, but her character is no more than any North European idea of ​​a stereotypical latino woman who is all pouts and hot temperament. If you are a fan of any major actor, do not be disappointed with yourself or the fool yourself (as I suspect many other reviewers have done here). Look at it with all sorts of means, but stay critical; you know these guys can do better.
