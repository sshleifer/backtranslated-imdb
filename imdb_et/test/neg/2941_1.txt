I saw this movie in Blockbuster and thought it might be a good Sunday night movie, if nothing else. So I bought it, 3 DVDs for $ 25. Although it was cheap, it would be my money to spend a better nail to drive through the leg. <br /> <br /> The film started nicely. Kinda Dark and mysterious. I was always fascinated by vampire and samurai movies. I thought the combination would be really cool. The first fight scene was pretty cool. I was excited about the rest of the movie. Then the film took a serious nose diving. <br /> <br /> I understand that it was a big blow to the East. I think twins. I can't see it though. This film, after the first 10 minutes, was absolutely terrible. So many movies in this genre have the potential to be great and blow it terribly. It's just another accident. <br /> <br /> The role of Jack Chan in this movie doesn't make any sense at all. Whyyyyyyyy? Complete stupidity. He probably made a few bucks about it. <br /> <br /> The only cool thing in this movie is the swords they use. Nice idea. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
