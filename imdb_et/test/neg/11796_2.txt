In this movie, there are many repeated dialogues about "cold places" (which signal the presence of a ghost) and characters who pray in the light of light to defend themselves. To revive the film, I refer to cold places repeatedly throughout the review. I saw worse movies than St. The Francisville experiment, but it can be the most * forgotten *, one of the most ("it's cold!") Basically spend the 20's in the haunted house. It's filmed as a supposedly real documentary. This is obviously not real, but the house has some cold. SPOILERS- (as if you can't predict most of the plot!). There's not much in this movie. We have a dignified cat clip from a cat who jumps from hiding from the beginning, because "practice" scares the audience to warm up. People walk around with flashlights, from time to time to remind the house that they are in peace - that they do not harm the spirits (or cold places). Now and then the door keeps someone busy and amazes. Of course, the ouija board will appear. They talk to the ghost "Charles". The girl eats a sandwich with sandwich. More cold. The second door is swinging and a boy is going to the door scam. He speaks, shouts. Oh my god, someone says. "Survive yourself with white light." I admit that the attic has a good scene (worshiping the chair) that really pulled me out of the guard. However, besides the funny bad dialogue, the only good thing about the chair is that the chair scene (the actual split second when it is knocked is nothing shortly before or after that moment). However, there are still some cold places here. Finally the movie ends. No one will die. No more details required. I wasn't a big fan of Blair Witch Project, but it looks like St. The masterpiece next to the Francisville experiment. You may not discuss whether this is a real documentary, but whether it was funny. I still don't know. But whatever it was meant, failed.
