Very distracting but expertly designed and scripted for smart eye and detail. Mary Beth Hurt, Sandy Dennis and especially Randy Quaid are unusually good. The story focuses on a young boy (Bryan Madorsky) who thinks where all the lodgings they eat come. His elder (Hurt, Quaid) strange behavior is caused by a school psychiatrist (Dennis). It's a dirty cannibal film. But that's not bad. If you like Hannibal, you love it. If you don't like parents, stay away from the movie. Just giving advice to Cannibal Lover and Haters. <br /> <br /> R rated for strong adult topics and graphical violence.
