It's funny ... one day before this movie I saw that I was watching a documentary about Leni Riefenstahl, so the comparison type came automatically ... of course there is none :) <br /> <br /> The film is weak in every aspect ... action is not persuasive (especially one who plays Simona ...) and unnatural ..., editing confused and always leaving an endless picture of taste, music doesn't fit, the story doesn't flow, it gets boring and the movie goes a lot longer than it is ... oh, and the characters aren't very well shown, you can't really talk much about girls (except what you see). .. The film also tries to shock with explicit suffering (which is very ridiculous) <br /> <br /> So ... 2/10
