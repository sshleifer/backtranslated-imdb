I really enjoyed BG Seasons 1-3 and really didn't understand those who didn't like it. But I can't protect that nonsense. Spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> The first problem is that characters now do unexpectedly stupid things regularly: <br /> <br /> So if Starbuck thinks he knows where Earth is, why not send him out in Raptor ? Would Admiral agree to the resignation of his third most experienced officer? Does the quorum choose its newest member without selecting Adama Junior? He has about three weeks of political experience under his belt and is the son of a man they trust. Did Adama send Gaeta and Halo with Starbuck, leaving himself with senior officers? Would Adama put the man in prison with the cylinders responsible for the sex fleet? <br /> <br /> I just don't buy it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, although I agree there have been miracles and references to God until the end of season 3, now it's all up. I started looking at BG because I thought it was Sci Fi, not a biblical epic. I expected the characters to continue to behave reasonably and wanted some satisfactory explanations for some odder developments. <br /> <br /> Baltar was the best character of the show, but now he seems to be totally crazy. Not illogical, considering what he has done but very dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> All characters seem to be just dolls dancing with unknown third-party behavior (some divine persons). It's not a good drama, it's a tedious and spelling tool. <br /> <br /> OK, what are the good points? The Battle of Nice 4.1. At first. Some good dramatic scenes (well worked) when viewed separately. A good final scene, a nice staple curve ball, but it's not Sci Fi, it's become a fantasy. I can't imagine how writers can restore it.
