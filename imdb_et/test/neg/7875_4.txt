I saw it in my local supermarket and I knew Debra was in it, so I decided to buy it (out of the support of that sexy woman!) The plot and the action in this movie was terrible (except Debra Wilson; I'm not saying that since I I love her, she was the only actress or actor who had emotions in her actions and voice!) What I didn't get at first is why a woman just didn't get back to her car randomly like this one. It was so stupid. And this is LA (NOBODY saw that he was kidnapped in a public, residential area - NOBODY ... yes, that is realistic!) In the park, when Charlie stole a woman's cell phone (for some stupid reason), they were hell he found him (and at one point ) when they got him at the gun point - over CELL PHONE! In fact, I doubt that LAPD goes like a stupid mobile phone! She could have walked in one of these cell phone cabins and replaced it! Kids also act as miracles of skill (I think they read from a smart card or whispered someone from a camera) because they were asked questions and they would look around and then answer the questionable question (ie leave father?) Also, how would all these snipers have been trees and building roofs in LA without seeing it!! I see it being played at 3 AM in the US. <br /> <br /> The fanatics of Debra Wilson enjoy her parts. She is the only actor with any real skill (Debra, sweetheart - stop these cheap D-Classes right on video ... maybe it will change with the upcoming movie Whitepaddy.) She puts some jokes in it (as one of her bosses comes up and asks who she's talking to, she screams on her computer and goes "Damnit, Charlie!") I gave him 4/10 ... 4 only thanks to the skills of Debra's good actors.
