Yes, in this film, obviously, many small snowmen are being treated in an extremely hot climate, so yes, this movie is definitely not serious. In fact, it is a much worse film than the original, because at least the whole production looked like it would cost more than a few bucks and a camcorder. It's your funny moments, but really playing your movie at a low cost and making it your intended laugh is such a weak movie when you ask me. You can't find a good story, your effects are really bad, hey, let's just make the movie as bad as a terrible one-liner and we have a movie. The first one had at least a somewhat plausible story than a snowman who attacked in winter and not what was in the resort. They also had better effects, it's just a step or two in front of the "Hobgoblins" on the monsters and you really want to be more than one step above the two-handed dolls. Nonetheless, it all forms an extreme end that represents a great sea-going ship that is powerful in the cold. Actually, I'm just kidding, but it was a fun part of the movie.
