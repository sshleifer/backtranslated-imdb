"Black Dragons" is a popular World War II propaganda film during World War II. It's not as bad as some of you would think. <br /> <br /> The secret meeting honored by Dr. William Saunders (George Pembroke) is cut off by the mysterious alien names Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi). Soon after, the participants in the meeting began to kill, their bodies placed in the steps of the Japanese Embassy in Washington. Colombia is suspected. The case is assigned to federal agent Dick Martin (Clayton Moore) and meets Saunders sister Alice Saunders (Joan Barclay) who is trying to help her. The reasons for Colombia's actions are not explained before the final rally. Until everything is explained, the story is hard to understand. <br /> <br /> Lugosi, who had been reduced by a small budget by then, is actually pretty good. He must not act as much as he did and credit for this must go to director William Nigh. The Lugos character slides through the shadows and resembles his Dracula, even when he has reached the full length of penetrating eyes. <br /> <br /> Clayton Moore, at best a one-dimensional actor, would become TV Lone Ranger for a few years. Joan Barclay makes a good heroine. <br /> <br /> Although "black dragons" are not a bit obsolete right now, it's not an hour.
