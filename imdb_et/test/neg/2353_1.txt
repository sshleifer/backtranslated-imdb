Hitchcock is a great director. Ironically, I usually find my movies wasting time watching. I admire Hitchcok at a purely visual and technical level. <br /> <br /> First, positive. Hitchcock invented the concept of a probe camera. Curious eye that is able to hold or look for information. This is not exactly a new visual grammar, but it was then revolutionary. Secondly, Hitchcock improved the thriller and chase movie a lot. He has an economic style and always thinks of the audience. It gives them regular excitement, regular humor and regular shocks. In short, he waits for the audience's basic needs and plays them as a violin. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, people's basic needs are mostly stupid. Food, sex, excitement and little comedy. Hithcock sees all of these needs on the screen, except for the food that, according to his size, satisfied the screen. <br /> <br /> This is a hijack for an audience that sabotages most of his films. Another downside is that most Hitchcock camera work and visual grammar is now a common place. What keeps his films under observation is the simple economy of his stories, the intelligence of his camera work, and his skill in making intense deeds. <br /> <br /> So "Saboteur". This is a 39-degree venous heartbeat. It jumps sequentially until it reaches a typical Hitchcock final work. <br /> <br /> On the emotional level, the relationship between leaders is not equal to Robert Donat and Madeleine Caroll. 39 steps ". So there is no story about some energy. There is just a machine that depends on adding new scenes. And the new scenes will only bring us closer to the end, because it is unclear whether the hook is the hero's escape from the police, the villains or his actions to stop the drawn sabotage. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock's logical errors are common. For example, a boy with handcuffs is released by a car fan belt, etc. (Why does he just not drive in a car? Are these handcuffs not necessarily restrictive? He is always able to swim!) < Br /> <br /> If you want a better Hitchcock war propaganda flick from the 40s, I would suggest you look at the "foreign correspondent." They are both stupid movies with a memorable finale, but "foreign correspondent" uses a lot of umbrellas and tulips, something in Spielberg's "Minority Report "It speaks nicely. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 - Some good sets of pieces. However, there is nothing to overwhelm the teeth.
