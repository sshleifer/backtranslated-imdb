Mostly, "Michael" is a disaster? ten minutes of charm and ninety worth of mistake. <br /> <br /> Travolta and MacDowell do their best, often crossing the Nora Ephron numbering banal script. But the movie moves like a snail. And even in the context of their fantasy, the characters act regularly regularly. (Journalists who routinely live the whole life? An evident angel who lives on earth?) <br /> <br /> Nobody forgot to talk about the romantic comedy maestro Ephron that William Hurt is so great in so many other films is not Tom Hanks. The word "climax" redefines the word again. Ephron can be here in the sky, but unfortunately "Michael" is a long and long journey through the cinema.
