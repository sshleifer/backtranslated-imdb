The burned, boring and racist selection of "Cimarron" is the worst choice for the best picture in Oscar history. Poorly acted (especially properly forgotten by Richard Dix, whose performance as self-centered and irresponsible Yancey Cravat is one of the narcissistic characteristics of the screen's history) and busy, the film is truly shocking today, because the racist tendency is one of its black characters introduced in sleeping shown in the chandelier. <br /> <br /> Other comments from IMDb reviewers have left this attitude as simply dated, but many of the films that appeared during this period were NOT portraying black as confusing, lazy mental deficiencies in such a way that this vision is very happy; so this statement seems weak. But whether you consider this humiliating character at any time shockingly bad taste or simply an unforgiving ignorance of the less cultivated era, it is very painful to look at the eyes of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> But even this may not be important if the film wasn't long-lasting, that is. Voted 1930/31 Best Oscars for Academy Awards when no mention was made of "City Lights", "The Public Enemy", "Dracula", "Dawn Patrol" and "Blue Angel", "Cimarron" is by far the worst choice to join the Oscar pantheon.
