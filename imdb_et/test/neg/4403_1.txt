Brazilian cable television this month will show "Yadon Ilaheyya" on its "culture" channel. I saw the trailer and listened to the ad and decided to see this movie. Indeed, this is an absurd boring pretentious fool of meaningless, disconnected mess of the Middle East conflict and, together with the Soultangler, they are definitely the worst films I've been trying to see. I really wasted forty-three minutes of my life watching the first half of this mess that is very tortured by enemies. How can this movie be awarded to Cannes Awards and Awards? My voice is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Intervenção Divina" ("Divine Intervention")
