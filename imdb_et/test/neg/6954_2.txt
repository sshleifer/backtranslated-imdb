Michael Caine could have attempted to successfully acquire a greater life character, but the whole story and Character are around him, which is not at all pleasant or interesting. It was all very boring and somewhat predictable. My favorite actor Martin Landau didn't play anything. He was useless. After some time Michael Caine got a little irritated and the film couldn't decide if it was a comedy or a serious thriller. Caine tries her hard and good, but I felt the direction and storyline put her down. Don't waste your time. It starts well in the first 10 minutes and then it is. Only for the movie "Die Hard Caine Fans". Stay away from it ...
