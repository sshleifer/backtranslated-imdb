The name of the movie and the clips I saw made me believe that this movie has exciting and interesting moments. I was disappointed. The high sand was interesting, but this movie pulled the snails to speed. It started well with underground caves and came out, but tried to involve us in the life of a very unlikely person. When they found the corpses or should I say that their skeletons are some muscles, they began to look for a reason why? Sometimes it became somewhat different when something was followed in the desert. Some kind of black or something that would make people eat meat. When the meat was polished, the bones began to slip after the rest of the people. The reason for this black bean, when we found out, was pretty bad, ants? Unbelievable! Then the end was not over. I think the motto of this movie is, if you have itching and you see the antenna, then kill it quickly before the antide friends smell your meat.
