Oh, oh! I just said that this "classic" movie has a plot that TEXT! Well, that's true ... so over! This movie was Joseph P. Kennedy's vanity project, where his lover celebrated and the money flowed to make him an even bigger star. Currently, there is only a fragmentary copy - one that was a few years ago. Even if the film had been perfect, it would have beat STILL for several reasons. And without any further occasions, here are some of my reasons: <br /> <br /> First, Gloria Swanson, aged 31, is playing a girl in a monastery school - maybe aged 16 or 18! Come on - she looks old enough to be the mother of many children. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film all depends on the stupid idea of ​​"love at first sight". While some people believe it, it is ridiculous to believe that the Prince would throw ALL of the women he didn't even know! What a lot of hooey! Third is the film histrionic and the plot is nuts! After leaving school, Kelly goes to East Africa and then gets "Queen of the Whores" - and later, after the evil queen in Europe dies (it's comfortable), the Prince can get out of prison, actually finds Kelly and marries her and then gets her Queen of True Honesty! Break the break - it's RIDICULOUS, even on the days of the silent movie, it was a challenge! ), parading around the classic! There are so many quieter movies - look at them first and avoid it.
