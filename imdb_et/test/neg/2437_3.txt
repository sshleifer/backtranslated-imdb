It's hard to tell who this film is aimed at; Characteristics and style of the "Children's ITV" series crossing the Aussie soap, but the subject, nudity and tongue strive for the older audience. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour, the heroine Justine has philosophized her losing her innocence and is surprisingly embarrassed to anyone over the age of 18. Full hanging of "Ferris Bueller" from the camera to the graphics on the screen. <br /> <br /> His nerdy friend Chas brings him to a computer where an explosion of virtual reality machines occurs as his man. Or actually he creates a male ego called Jake. Don't look at me that way; I'm just connected to how it was shown. <br /> <br /> After that, the movie is somewhat amusing; Among all the looting of drama schools, only Rupert Penry-Jones brings the true role of comics to his wife-trap-in-a-man-body role Jake. Jake has some funny scenes that deal with his new body and new feelings; something you haven't seen before, but then in this movie you turn on something that is fun. <br /> <br /> Justine and Jake meet unfortunately and follow the fun worship (wish), involving their owners. a virtual machine that wants to rob Jake to have sex with her or to study her or something. Anyway, it's just an excuse to fill an explosion and a passenger car for another half an hour; for such a cheap movie, explosions often come out loud, indicating that the money was spent in all the wrong places. <br /> <br /> Finally, the heroine understands that he cannot fall in love with himself, extinguishes his alter ego, and arrives with a nerd one night to lose his virginity (this is probably what is meant to pass in the 90s). But only after he removed his glasses and placed some hair and leather jackets; God forbid him to actually have sex with someone who looks like nerd. Of course it is a bit subversive - on those PC movie days that tell you that you love and be yourself, and that everyone is special in a special way, there is a refreshingly reactive film that shouts "CONFORM!" at you and treats virgins and cords with contempt for what they deserve. <br /> <br /> The characterization is simple; nerd is very funny (space full of computer, thick glasses, social retardism, virginity, leather jacket), slut, she is very slippery (blonde, tight dresses, orange tan, vampy accompanying music), there is jock, she is very ... you get the picture. With such characterization, you can access a wide range of comedy, but "virtual sexuality" is not very funny. It is only partially amusing and terrible in others. She is as lovely as Justine (Laura Fraser plays) to disturb me, but she controls it. <br /> <br /> Don't let the headline cheat; there is nothing erotic about the film and it does not deal with the ways in which new communication technologies change and interact with communication (unless you think your PlayStation can blow and change your gender). <br /> <br />
