This documentary strives for comedy, but never reaches me. Camp? Ehn, maybe. The most appropriate word is that everyone agrees - and they have difficulty avoiding any kind of review - is kiƒç. It dripped into a piss. Just as the filmmakers would be worried that the viewers would take the movie too seriously, so they bent back to put the kitsch and said, "We're funny here! Look ???" <br /> <br /> In short, I felt it was trying too hard. For example, the snapshots of each scene (me) were annoying when I was sure they were meant for fun - or at least (ahem) kitch-ey. <br /> <br /> However, avoid this movie based on my complaints. Just be prepared to enjoy kitchs instead of preparing for you. If you are interested in light tickets, you can go a long way. At least, the fact that Bakers' rise and fall surround the facts makes it interesting and worthwhile. In the best case, lace-like lovers of similar thoughts strikes clips and crutches all over the film.
