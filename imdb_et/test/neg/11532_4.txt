I found it traceable, be it a very predictable film. There was some good stunt work that gave me a fair excitement and skipping. However, the reliability of the plot had to be suspended on several occasions. For example, despite the pilot pulling the undercarriage manually, they lost the loss of their cable, couplings, and harnesses, fortunately they found a stock on board equipped with a Caribbeans. Hardly the ceiling hole drilling plot, when the system is reactivated (I can't think why), the deposit alarm system blocks, the battery-powered drill cannot drill through the vaults, but they just happened to have a hydraulic drill with hoses and fittings that fit equally a comfortable take off hydraulics located on the storage side. Because the aircraft has a closed hydraulic system, it is difficult to see how it can be done without affecting the control systems or at least setting the hydraulic pressure in the cab. To accept this for the sake of the plot, it takes several minutes for them to drill a small hole through the vault (they can be drilled through the FED before they get there to check for false alarms), but the locked door is closed and before the FED had walked a couple of feet to my second security, were they cut a hole in the roof of the roofer, large enough to pass through. For the sake of good yarn, all the theses and other contradictions can be accepted, but what the richness of the film for me was that what seems to have been a scriptwriter's effort to discuss what until then was a pretty predictable end, killed two heroes (may refer to heroes as a hero) Ketchum & Brooks one was shot and thrown out of 747 by 10,000 feet when the second wili slides between the two planes when the villain Daltry with one hand can unlock a cable carrying a full adult man a mass whose air pressure is several hundred miles per hour, pressing him and letting him fall to his death. And yet in the following order, the two without any explanation (albeit weak or unreliable) are completely surprised by the 10,000 feet and had the time to create a complex scam for money. The only comment about survival there was to Sophie that her brother was a bad shot. Don't expect an Oscar candidate for this.
