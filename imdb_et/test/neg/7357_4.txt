When you get in front of the movie, you know you're wasting your time watching this movie. That's how I felt when I looked at the darkness. I saw that every twist is foreseeable and easy to rotate. It's a combination of "The Amityville Horror" and a host of movies that deal with occultism. It's so stupid that I almost found my naivety. I can't say I was totally bored, but I found the movie too tasty. Director Balaguer√≥ tries to make his early Spanish stroke "The Nameless" again, but he can't pull it out. I admit that some sequences were scary enough, but I just scare when I understand what happens next. I also hated to see good actors like Lena Olin and Giancarlo Giannini sweat so much over this drec. Finally Anna Paquin as a Star of Horror Films? It must be a joke. She is cute, but she is one of the good childcare institutions that has become a very monotonous adult actor. You can live without it.
