Here is a good "Rule of Slaughter:" <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling, Clea Duvall and David Morse are giving great performances. Gosling is, as always, very beautiful. Places are often breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Here's what's bad about "Kill Rule:" <br /> <br /> - Everything else. The script is terribly confusing. And while I definitely appreciate a non-"good feel" movie, this movie is boring. Great performances cannot create a movie with a stupid assumption and a script that is filled with lines that often do not even understand. Just the first hour of going through the chore. <br /> <br /> I missed it because of Gosling, but finally I made my own and changed the channel. Spoilers gave me the end. I didn't miss much. Take your preference - if you want a good Gosling flick, see The Believer. <br /> <br /> My score: 2 out of 10.
