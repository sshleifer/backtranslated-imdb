How many monster disability movies do you see in life? Well, I'll go out and say one. This film is better to watch late at night, 12 packs of beer, sound out and you and your friends. In the Pacific Island, a young man is considered dead for engaging in "evil with Americans" (his loving wife seems to be asleep with a witch doctor and made him die so doc can be a king. "Does he promise to come back and revenge. <br /> <br /> Before you shake, goofy natives start hunting for American scientists screaming "Tobanga come!" <br /> <br /> It seems that the young body has just done it like Tobanga, a walking tree monster. his vengeance is terrible (and this is also the movie) .It seems that these natives cannot cut wood so that he throws them into cattle, rolls them up in the mountains, etc. Soon the new king will start to trade his wife or king in an ax or chainsaw. /> <br /> There are a lot of common problems with this movie: Comedy relief is an uncomfortable woman who has a Cockney accent (as this film needs comedy) .You want her to die in her first appearance. and lumbering.The natives are Brooklyn accents. Monster suit is pure giggles. <br /> <br /> Although this is a bad movie, it is still fun to watch. It gets 3 inadvertent laughs alone. Your dog can rate it somewhat higher, but only if the tree was not mobile.
