On many fronts, the story didn't matter much. It's a good action film, but it's about it. <br /> <br /> - The movie says lycans were kept to protect vampires during the day. However, they are kept in cages and have neck collars on their neck. So they can't turn into their wolf form or do anything else the slave can't do. How does it protect vampires during the day? Who are they protecting vampires? Uncontrolled Gateways? Human slaves are nothing but peasants. - My understanding is that vampires are immortal and not older. But Sonya's age since childhood is adult. Do they just stop aging at a certain age? I understand that Viktor is old because he was turned (as explained in another movie). But the age of the vampire children? Strange. <br /> <br /> - I did not know that vampires need torches at night. At the same time, we see these films on the movies. <br /> <br /> Silver was the only thing that had to do to lysane. At the same time, large shrubs also kill steaks from burnt wood. <br /> <br /> These are just a few of the things that tell the story.
