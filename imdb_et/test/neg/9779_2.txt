I just gave it to this movie 2 1 just because I'm a polite person. This film made me open for 90 minutes of my life, where I could have done something useful for people or just for me. Dialogue is bad, actors never look scared! Even if it should be a horror movie. For example, the scene where Kurt collects his former colleague's bones. She should be scared, but she looks pretty common. The film chick is such a cliche. One of the things she liked was the dress she'd worn in the last scene. And by the way, the end was extremely predictable when the cocoon flashes pink in the box. In fact, I was thinking more of an antenna that walked in the back of the car. But it's still not surprising to me.
