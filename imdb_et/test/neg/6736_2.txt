I saw the "Alien" in IMDb's "100th Bottom" in the movie list, so I didn't expect much when I called the US channel a week ago, but I had hopes. "Abdominal pain" (which declared a month ago) was confusing, but he had a great landscape and photography, and some rather cool moments, so I thought this film might have the same. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In almost every way, this film is unable to meet the basic standards of tracking. The scenario appears as a follower of John LeCarre's novel and Richard Ludlum's film bastard, but it is done by people who do not have any of these worthy writers' talents for plot and characterization. Instead, we have a glowing, mean-looking, nihilistic, mysterious mare nest that is confusing with motifs, forged alliances and withdrawals. And shaving. And bomb attacks. And the internal organs. It takes over the director's style, based on the shocked "sharp shock / slow motion" every 10 seconds with wire work and hyperactive jumping. The films that were hidden 10 years ago when the MTV directors used them for Whitesnake's videos, and the director works like a hit press, hoping that some cool artistic thriller will put into the process. <br /> <br /> Segal himself is just terrible in this. He spends the entire film dirty, whispering throats and alternating between two expressions: he looks like sucking lemon, while someone is laughing under his nose with a small swelling or looking for constipation. And he's so thick (and in vain) that he never takes his knee-length camera. I understand that it is difficult to keep a woman's age under the control of a woman (although Denzel Washington and Paul Newman never felt that problem). But you're dealing with it, being honest with it, and growing up as an actor, not hiding it with carefully selected camera corners and floor length clothes. So I can't really say what's going on, and the film doesn't give me a reason to take care of what's going on, and the protagonist is completely one-dimensional and visually unappealing. Not a good recipe for a movie experience. Strangely enough, most of the designs and landscapes are atmospheric and striking; In fact, if you freeze the movies on almost any particular scene that was not in the vicinity of Seagale, you would be in the care and professionalism of lighting, colors and composition, and the beauty of Eastern Europe. settings are. But dressing a rotten egg like Faberge does not make it edible. And the procedure is rotten. <br /> <br /> There are "cool" movies (such as "Versus") and there are visually striking but emotionally cold movies (such as "Underworld") and paranoia conspiracy thrillers (like "The Bourne Identity" and its transformation) Matt Damon). And then the thing that can't think of what it wants to be is pretending to be all these things and failing because it has no guts or souls. <br /> <br /> This is a movie made by professionals who have a real budget so you can't really put it in the same class as "Manos", "Killer Shrews" or "Hobgoblins". But I look back at all these three films several times when I look at "Alien" again even once.
