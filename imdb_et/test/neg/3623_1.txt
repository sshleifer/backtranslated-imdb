It is a series of children's programs for Mary-Sue who are at the same time, medium and harsh. I couldn't sit on my 3 episodes of Zoey101. Not to mention that Jamie Lynn Spears can't save her life! What message does it bring to children? If you're not perfect like Zoey, you're worth * rollseyes *. <br /> <br /> It is absurd how Zoey's character is exactly the kind of person who would be despised in real life, but he can get so popular. Then there is Chase, who is basically a lovesick puppy who worships the land Zoey walks. Then it is true that all other characters seem to have fallen to stop Zoey's dropping. I'm sorry, but the character of this show is extremely unrealistic.
