"Based on Jim Wynorsk's joke" ... this is what I read at the end of the closing credit. Mr Wynorski must have a terrible sense of humor! This movie is really terrible. I loved the first two chapters of the Slumber Party Massacre series; the third movie was pretty pointless but completely traceable compared to that joke! Not even Driller Killer and plot, actor, characters, locations, events ... everything is boring, absurd and ridiculous. The only good reason to watch this turkey is girls: if this movie were porn, I think it would have worked much better! The film also has no gore: the first scene (in the tent) can be bloody and the scene where the headless guy knocks at the door lasted one second! Some exciting moments cannot save a non-existent plot. Buzzy (Lunk Johnson) seems to be the only real actor here: I found the only satisfactory character for this movie! Oh ... there's a meaningless part with Brinke Stevens who appeared in "Linda" in the first Slumber Party Massacre: the police are bothering him with more details about the killer; but what we get is only a few movies from the first movie! Not a dialogue, a monologue, or something like a traumatized adult girl who is forced to revive the worst 30 minutes of her life (as she says), giving us any clues to the murderer! <Br>> <br /> At your own risk.
