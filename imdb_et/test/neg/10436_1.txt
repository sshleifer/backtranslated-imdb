The recent DVD edition of a good humor character marks the film as a comedy. It is hardly a comedy, rather a boring indie movie about losers. In the 1970s, little attention has been paid to the details of the period, the color adjustment of which is too quiet. The monotonous soundtrack only helps to emphasize the repetition of the film (perhaps this is a point, but it does not support the enjoyment of the viewing experience). Unfortunately, the losers' clicks are only pleasantly in one place, whiteners. It seems that the purpose of wrapping a movie as a comedy is to deceive people into renting or buying a movie that is a complete waste of time.
