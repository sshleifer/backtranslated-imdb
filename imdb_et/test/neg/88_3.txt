Wow what overpriced movie it turned out to be! It was supposed to be "an extreme story of a mad murderer who keeps a woman hostage and fear at home." Well, I doubt it terrorized viewers in the early 50s and I know it would make today's audience fall asleep. <br /> <br /> "Sends shadows under the spine," announces the New York Times. No, the only thing I get is that everyone stays on the planet who believes something in the NY Times is printing something. Well, it was a dirty man who kept the woman briefly hosted in his house, but a man. "Howard Wilton" (Robert Ryan) was actually harmless and friendly. In fact, it was one of the nicest roles Ryan ever played! Yeah, "Wilton" was nuts, but he never damaged a woman and only wanted to trust a friend. <br /> <br /> The film is boring for a while, but very little except for a lot. Beware, reader ..... it sucks.
