1989 was a year when Eddie Murphy was not so hot and started to make films that will soon be forgotten. It was a funny year when Murphy directed his first film, but it would be the first and final experiment. "Harlem's Night" was not exactly what you could call a success, even if it was good to see the two best black comedians, Murphy and Richard Pryor. Don't blame it for the actors, because they all played their role as you expected, even if you (again) see a typical Murphy laugh. The worst thing about "Harlem's nights" is both the scenario and the dreadful decorations. Everything is set in roaring twenties and everyone has banned club profits. Sugar Ray (Pryor) and his adopted son Quickie (Murphy) are easily collecting $ 10,000 a day, but of course the mob and the corrupt police are just getting around the corner to claim their share of the cookie. Sugar and Quickie are not the guys who give their money for free and have their own plans. You can watch "Harlem Nights", which is for sure, but if you suck at the moment you hear the name Murphy, it's better to avoid it, because after this movie there's nothing but a flat excuse to see some good jokes.
