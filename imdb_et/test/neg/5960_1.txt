Do you want the worst horror film of the 21st century? El Chupacabra is it. "Manos: Hands of Fate" is the worst film ever, but El Chupacabra is definitely the worst film of this century. It must also be distinguished from the possession of the absolute worst leading actor. The leading role actor Eric Alegria has never made a movie other than El Chupacabra, a gee - I don't know why. <br /> <br /> Obviously the monster is attacking people, but everyone who is attacked is moving slowly and really stupid. And there are no police in this city, but two idiotic detective - Hi! First, police officers appear at the scene of the murders, then detectives come! And apparently, the monster only attacks one person in the backyard and in some deserted areas by docks. Or ... this is the only place where filmmakers can access the movie. <br /> <br /> This "movie" is the reason why IMDb must allow us to give negative letters. It just deserves -10 stars or at least 0. They should allow 0-rating.
