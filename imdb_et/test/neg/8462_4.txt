this movie is not so big ... at all, but it's good if you just want to laugh because it's pretty ridiculous :) it has a lot of mistakes and it's fun. I got this movie for Christmas like 5 years ago, but for some reason I never gave it. I think I like it for a rainy day, though I only look at it once a year. This is a very 90-year-old movie, so it's really funny to see how all the dresses and works. this movie is good for some youngsters ... though they come to think about it, I didn't even like being 12, but that's just my personal opinion. the film was really predictable. I wish she had some extra strange twists, but I think it was trying to be a suitable movie that everyone could enjoy. I think it was suitable for the whole family, but the Hallie dress was a bit unmodified, but certainly enough for the family material.
