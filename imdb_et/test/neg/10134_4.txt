Imagine yourself in the dark medieval museum and the resurrected vampire and his manic sidekick pursuing you. Where is the absolute last place you want to hide? I would say Nuremberg's torture tool in a nice Virgin, because there is a good risk that you will be brutally killed. And yet, the elderly women of this movie run their own coffin foolishly. "The Vampire's Coffin" is a rather disappointing order, as director Fernando Méndez does not create the Gothic atmosphere of the 1957 original, but puts emphasis on comic situations and dialogues. No more threatening fortresses with fearsome horses on nets and dark treasurers, but confused doctors and clumsy assistants who provoke a laugh instead. The story opens to Count de Lavud's final resting place, where a distinguished physician and hired assistant steal a coffin to study the body in a private clinic. Of course, the wooden stake is removed from his heart and the number of vampires must be resettled, immediately enslaving a small thief to do his dirty work. Vampire has a beautiful female patient in the clinic, and Dr Enrique Saldívar has the right to save the soul and destroy the bloodthirsty. "Vampire Coffin" uses a limited number of places and there are very few actions. The whole movie would be really boring if it wasn't a handful of memorable sequences and decent exhibitions. But photography is amazing with the ultimate use of shadows and darkness. This is the most important event at a time when Count de Lavud holds a young woman through a small town on the deserted streets at night. This is the only true value of the whole movie, the rest are pretty mediocre and déjà-vu.
