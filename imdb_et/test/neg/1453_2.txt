This is a very strange product from Hollywood. Apparently, it didn't work well because the participants with the credit film material have been fully developed, which means they have been working fast. It would seem that most of the time it would have been handled by the competent Demme and simply thrown away. On the other hand, it is so completely absent that perhaps nothing can be saved. It has no real environment, neither narrative nor slow. Although it says that driving time is 92 minutes, it seems to me that it will end suddenly around the 80-minute mark. It's over before you go. It's pretty much ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The advantages of "Matthew Modine's Image" were just as difficult as Luke Wilson's picture is now.
