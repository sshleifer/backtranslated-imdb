Kokoda was inspired by the events on the Kokoda track during World War II, when the Australian army slowed down and eventually stopped the pressure of 10,000 Japanese soldiers on land and on Port Moresby. What they really mean is that the film is set during this time period, but it is a fiction and everything that happens is simply confused with the standard scene of other war films. The first hour is just one clich√© after another. Some scenes are just there so we can feel that this conflict is terribly comparable if there is little evidence of it. Both sides fought hard to follow the leadership, and neither side showed mercy. Both sides suffered from logistical shortcomings and the terrain was a great leveler in this conflict. As the Japanese approached Port Moresb, their supply chain grew and eventually led to their decline. On the other hand, when the Australians left Port Moresb, their supply chain decreased. Some scenes seem to be a straight scenes handbook containing any kind of warfare. The film was wrong and highlighted the young people in the production team. At a time when Australia could have made an excellent movie about one of Australia's best moments, the Kokoda movie is low.
