This movie is just garbage. I have to say that I am an expert in garbage films. I reserve a "1" rating for garbage, but for funny movies, but this movie is just annoying and definitely not funny funny, but nervous. It will be "2" so that those who get there can distinguish those who laugh at you and those who put you to sleep. In this film there are scenes where actors look at something, their expressions are surprised, and wide eyes and jaw jaws tell the audience that what they are watching is deeply amazing, it just isn't just in the closet or even more in the desert. It must be a pretty divine terrible thing to go out to me, let me tell you, I went out and made quite a few people.
