The romantic WEAPON, which is the basis for this terrifying part of the garbage, is one of the best techno-thrillers who come to the pike for a long time. The character of SOLO, who shouldn't look like a human being, is a wonderful creation and it was just terrible to see him reduced to just another Terminator clone, where Mario Van Peebles tried to scare "act" like a robot. Nothing is worth anything about this movie. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood demand that they plunder rights to great novels and then pamper them? There are so many things in SOLO that their listing seems to be unfair if you call a man who has no legs on Hopscotch's powerful game. Avoid this terrible movie and look for the two novels of ROBERT MASON that have the fantastic character of SOLO. Books are WEAPON and a great order for SOLO.
