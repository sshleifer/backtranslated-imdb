Real horror and bad movie even for Chani series. I like a good Charlie Chan movie, or even pretty good, but it goes beyond the mark. Charlie is involved to help identify the murder of a scientist working for our government when someone in the house has stolen another power plan. The mystery is very pedestrian and the actor does not pay much better. The only salvation fell in love with me in the film was Mantan Moreland's performance as Birmingham Brown. He gives the film a little comedy, and he has some good scary faces, but after that the elections are quite thin. Benson Fong is here like Tommy Chan and couples all with Chani's daughters. What about Sidney with Toler? She's pretty decent, but she looks to wear a movie. The most I noticed was filming. Chan's director Phil Rosen, whom I generally like most of his entries, uses many long shots without action (like Charlie's original walking from outside the house). Why? The movie is only 64 minutes long with a loud voice! Such pictures tell me that the director had to complete the time because the script was even weaker than he was used to. This is probably not the worst movie ever made by Chan, but it is still the worst thing I've sadly sat down.
