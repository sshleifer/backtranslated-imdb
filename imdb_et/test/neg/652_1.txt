To summarize this film, LaBute has been portraying his sadism as a comedy. The predictable result is that he is constantly moving on to all the jokes, demanding that they be surrounded by violent violence and extremely hateful characters. There is also evidence that he is continuing his efforts to offend and ridicule everything in sight, but then apologize for the weak gestures with the computer. In principle, the film does not work, its plot is farther than natural, the characters are one-dimensional clich√©s, there is no continuity and no development, and comedy (where it's not totally inappropriate) is the worst High Concept management. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman and Renee Zellweger are completely wasting the character that seems to be a studio-driven audience parody - whatever they do, make them pleasant, neutral (and castrated) and full of moral spreads. Crispin Glover is long enough to convince you that he is no longer in the movies. Chris Rock actually has negative chemistry with Hitman Freeman - as if they were in different rooms, even if they were two inches apart. In fact, Chris Rock seems to be a digital input. At least he's not as annoying as Jar-Jar. <br /> <br /> LaBute 15 minutes can be now. It has already seen her overcome her greeting.
