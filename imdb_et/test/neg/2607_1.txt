Wow. After seeing the film, you know why American youngsters still lack intelligence and any traits that contribute to the well-being of society unless they do more. </p> <p> </p> most of the reusable people in this core who have no talents or brains to do something about themselves (especially Bam Margera and Steve-O), and the only chance to fame was to live entertaining as stupid as they were there is there. Is the man drinking the horse's sperm? Just nasty. The man who hooked the fish between his cheek and acting as a "bait" for sharks? It is not humor, it is evidence of its institutionalization. <br /> <br /> In general, I walked out of the theater without the hope of humanity.
