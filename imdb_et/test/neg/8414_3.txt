This movie is a bad movie, but I recommend that you look back at Rosemary Baby to get the nutritional value it provides. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to learn about how different directors can make the same presentation for participants who play the same characters. Watch the Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon) and the fine work she did in the first film compared to the terrible transfer of this film. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see how the same characters were played by different actors. What makes me wonder if someone who is related to the offspring was aware of this first film and did it before watching Rosemary Baby? <br /> <br /> If your interest in movies is purely superficial, it would be better to avoid it. I have a lot more to say about this movie, but I really don't want to go there.
