Like most of you, I've been watching a lot of great movies; We often find those films that are so meaningless that we think about why someone does it, either voluntarily or mistakenly. That's exactly what I can say about the dead man's knee. <br /> <br /> At least, what I can do is try to warn someone else. If you like the story, act and film more intensely if you want to choose something else. Now that's not all bad ..... If you want, creative movie editing and unique angles with original music are ambient if you think it's OK. Like someone who appreciates film, acts and is entertaining in the movie, the truth is that this movie was so terrible for words. I can easily find this place on the list of the worst movies. <br /> <br /> As for Val Kilmer on this issue, the truth is that he was probably cast in favor of the director; As a fan of Kilmer's films, I don't understand what his motif was. The film seems to be part of Western romance ......... Finally, I am sure most of you will agree with me that this is just the rude waste of our time. If you haven't seen this movie, my suggestion would be to avoid it completely.
