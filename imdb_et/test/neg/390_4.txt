The best scene "People around the Lake" is a really horrible night-time scene with a house, murder and a lake. After that, it's pretty much downhill as far as horror. The family (mother, father, sister and younger brother) are hidden in the (slightly) dangerous neighborhoods of the suburbs and decide to go and live near the lake. Since then, the film has too many flat happy family doo-doo on the lake, sometimes with all the corpses here and there. A couple of scenes where they discover their bodies are quite convincing (in terms of creepies), but they are in stark contrast to the rest of the holidays (where it is just about everyday family life). The truth about things (the mystery that makes killing) has learned too early, leaving only the family unknown and the spectator awake during the failed final (which includes discovering in the basement and running around the house) as if it were a television thing suddenly reminded that it should be a horror film. It's not really bad; content and story are not just interesting enough. The only highlight in the story is Barry Corbin, although his performance / character is a bit too funny to take it seriously. Blonde cutie Tammy Lauren (daughter) can also be a recognizable face for the eager horror junkies as well as she also starred "Wishmaster" (1997) and made TV outings like "I saw what you did" (1988) & "Stepford kids" (1987) ). He doesn't have much work to do on this film. Interruptible, but traceable, if any.
