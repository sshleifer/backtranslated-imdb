It is hard for Dennis Quaid to prove to us that Jerry Lee Lewis was dark. And he does it too much. TV series are very good, like a photocopy of old black and white films. Music is also good because Mr. Lewis is singing himself. But the rest is just a Hollywood B-film style, which is a difficult day in the fifties. I think the only good thing about this movie is the young Winona Ryder.
