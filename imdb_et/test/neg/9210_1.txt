There must be a 0/10 chance for this point. <br /> <br /> It was painful to look, but strangely convincing. No doubt, because it seemed incredible that the film could suck it a lot. I thought it had to be better. It deteriorated. And worse. <br /> <br /> How did people start to produce such categorical junk on earth? But the most surprising thing is all the reviews I see on people who really love the movie. Yes, the actor was good, but the movie was very bad. The worst movie ever!
