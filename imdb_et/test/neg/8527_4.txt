"The Messengers" leaders Danny Pang and Oxide Pang are responsible for "The Eye" and its sequel, and their premiere American image plays as "The Grudge" set on the farm. down to the sunflower farm in North Dakota. Almost immediately his teenage daughter Jess sees ghosts. Of course, his parents and police are skeptical. Definitely the film is well done and there are two or three effective fears, but relies too much, but relies too much on the Boo effect. Continue with the carbon copy of many ghost stories in the plot and the end is anti-climate and amazingly awful. The cards are on the low side, prone to CGI. In general, "Messengers" is a rather weak horror film that simply does not transmit.
