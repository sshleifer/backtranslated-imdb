Simply put, these films are without any substance. Just take my word and save yourself time when it's full DUD! I would say that the characters are one-dimensional, but that would mean that they are a kind of character. I thought Eric Roberts would jump in any second that was so close to the B-Movie status. <br /> <br /> A girl from this 70 is beautiful ... but if you are not her stalker-type fan, this movie has nothing for anyone. Avoid ... Avoid ... Avoid <br /> <br /> This movie was right on DVD for a reason ... it's ... it's a train wreck !!!
