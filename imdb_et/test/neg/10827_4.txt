although this movie was okay. I don't think it was great. was a bit too slow for my taste. The whole drama, but not very much action until the end of the movie. This movie was basically a dramatic film, with profitability, if you could call it that, as soon as I ended, the pillow's bursting scenes and the water that flooded the city, okay, but too short. the actor is decent, but it just didn't do it for me, in the long run. I thought it was related to the fact that very little tension or tension was built through the film. Another factor is that I recently watched "10 .5" and its sequel ".5: Apocalypse'.these" are two big budgets that I find to be a very difficult act of special consequences and destruction scenes. The result is that I think the Killer flood: the day the devil broke at 4/10
