Too ambitious and messy; and sometimes too darkly lit. The REAL-REALITY scenario is not even close to the original. Dark and dull in the basement. Abducted prisoners. Awful survival. Carey (Alisha Seton) tells her family and friends she's going to Europe. He's not doing it out of town. He's caught up in a rainy sidewalk, stunned and wakes up in the dungeon. Finally, he realizes that he is not alone and, when he meets some of his compatriots, has different thoughts of survival. His cellists begin to die one by one. Can he get enough power and courage to see the daylight? Others are Laila Dagher, Rachel Oliva, Eva Derreck, Arthur Bullock and Jen Parker.
