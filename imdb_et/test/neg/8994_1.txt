Ram Gopal Verma usually makes a cookie cookie when it is raised from a Hollywood flick. His every film after Shiva is in the genre of cookie cutters. Sometimes he makes a really horrible movie. In the first 55 minutes, we will only introduce 2 characters, a fighting gymnast who masks a qualified dancer (the figure goes!) And a wannabe actor who tries to capture it in Bollywood abundantly. They fall in love, a zero becomes a hero, a dancer / gymnast can't break, gymnastics, angst, normal heartbeat, gymnastics, angst, song, dance, angry, some more gymnastics, ridiculous gymnastics and before you know it, sleep again. And despite the hot sexy hot sexy hot bodysuit, the leading lady-cum-gymnast-cum-dancer. <br /> <br /> But hey, you're not alone! Editor, director, photographer, actually the whole cast, and the team sleeps through the entire production. The only difference is that they got paid when you paid for that money, so you lose. Ha, the joke is about you. Don't feel bad, but about our bad breaks when he highlights daily his high-rise penthouse in the most sexy leotards and workouts. When the poor breaks, he's a STARR-VINNNG? <br /> <br /> Antara Mali can't act. RGV lost its marble. Abhishek tried hard but failed. No plot. No story. Something. He has to pay RGV nicely to make all this nonsense in addition to free gymnastics training in his casting chamber. What is a super thing. There is no need to pursue a career. <br /> <br /> This absolute garbage can of course be "Made in Bollywood"!
