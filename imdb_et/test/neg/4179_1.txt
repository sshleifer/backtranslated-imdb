If you want to enjoy the money you would spend on renting this money, buy the ice in the bag and watch it melt. It's more fun than this movie. Bill Cowell, shame on you. Or if you want to see this movie plot, go to the corn field, bring two of the most annoying girls you can find, drive a couple of hours if girls scream as loud as possible. Then send me a few bucks you would have spent. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the first Dark Harvest, after watching the sequel, I cry to sleep.
