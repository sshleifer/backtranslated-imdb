Why did they have to adapt so terribly? The whole "Complete Jane Austin" series, part of the Masterpiece Classics, looks like a big disappointment. The characters are completely wrong and there are no chemistry on the screen. The whole thing seems pretty hurry. The 1999 film edition, based on the same novel, appears to be a masterpiece compared to that. I really want to forget it. I am really glad that "Pride and Prejudice" can't be done again as part of this project and we see the iconic and magnificent Colin Firth and Jennifer Elle as the main characters. If you left this "Mansfield Park" production, you will feel happy!
