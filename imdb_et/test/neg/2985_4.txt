Sometimes patients just see patients when they look at the indie horror. If you can just go slowly into the early scenes, you can sometimes be a real pearl ... This (unfortunately) wasn't "Satan's whip". <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Jason Maran, "Satan's Whip" is trying to pull us through a boring film whore-festival, with no real reward at the end. I think black and white (and blue) cinematography must have been a reason, but never explains why most of the blood is blue, and I found it more and more disturbing when the film went. The story itself is not so bad and it actually had originality and proper content, but acting is simply pathetic. This, coupled with the slow pace and the lack of real (red) gore, made Satan's whip unforgettable. I'll give her a "4" rating for some smart dialogues that made me confused, but unfortunately it couldn't waste that time.
