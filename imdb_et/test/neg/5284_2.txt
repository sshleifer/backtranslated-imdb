I paid this girl for $ 2.00, I want my money back. this is a horror movie in the ad class that is not so tough <br /> <br /> There are many floors in this movie, including the lack of an actress, a real horror, a lack of nudity (which is not the original sister (porn outfit) and still breathing naked body <br /> <br /> Soundtrack may be the best thing because it has some cozy sorta guitar riffs / tracks. <br /> <br /> There are your usual typical characters, jock, jocks-woman, nerdy -friend (who looks more like a jock), rookie-policeman / ranger (who has the biggest gap in my teeth, I wanted a few dollar coins in this gap..I'm going to go to the farm) mysterious fella and pure girl. <br /> <br / > The kit was pathetic with dr chopper's side views, with a clear make up line and a natural skin tone, the DVD cover design is clearly Photoshop / enhanced to make the cover even more appealing, as Dr. Chopper looks like an old "plopper." Like the rest of this movie. <br /> <br /> Plot ke The vivacity was very predictable and the abundance of bad FAKE limbs was ridiculous what they thought .... um throw some limbs around and some fake blood and you have a horror film. <br /> <br /> Dr. Chopper himself is the most stupid character I've seen for a while, though the original thinks the creator of this movie was tense for ideas and maybe tried to use a rhyme doctor and a chopper (bike) and thought that "bingo" makes this filthy movie. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse before ..... but it's just bad. all this is bad ... lack of break ... lack of real horror or character development ... lack of decent event ... the only thing that was good about this movie was when he finished. This movie is not in this category that is so bad that it is good for me / <br /> <br /> Generally, 2/10 director / writer / editor should know better.
