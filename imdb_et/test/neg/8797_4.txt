In the US, it was time for the film to have everything possible, so that the harsh movies that contained horror and an explicit scene came. The most well-known are forced entry and water power, but of course they were made with a little budget. Everything is shown at 42 in NY, but hey, there were other floor houses that didn't show any budget. Wet Wilderness is an example of this. After a while, he turned on an underground scene, so the copies were available, but some of the copies were cut sharply in the form of other reviews. But the revised version was complete. Well, I would call this one more porn, then tough, there is a sequential killer, but he likes to see more about how others have sex instead of killing him when he kills it off the screen. Action is the worst I've ever seen. And I thought the so-called actors did not like what they were doing, for example, at the beginning, when we had a lesbian scene, that one girl would stop working and get her hair out here. when a mother rides a black man, the daughter sits ants in the ants! But this is a story that made it famous, incest and racism is what made it famous. If there is blood, the two girls who sit there look forward to the cue to act, god it is worse, but one more if you have a blast and a floor house. Make sure you have the full version.
