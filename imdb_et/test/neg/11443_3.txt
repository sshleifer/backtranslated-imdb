I recently watched this movie mainly because I am a big fan of Jodie Foster. I saw that this movie was right between his 2 Oscar-winning performances, so my expectations were quite high. Unfortunately, I thought this movie was terrible and I still don't know how he ever convinced this movie. The script is really weak. The story itself may be somewhat plausible if someone, like Mel Gibson, played as a striker. I thought Jodie Dennis with Hopper and his irritating accent couldn't buy it. I thought Jodie looked great throughout the film, which was probably the only reason I looked at the whole thing. Perhaps the only reason for making a movie was to cut Jodie's clothes as little as possible. I saw the story of Jodie TV, where basically all of her films were commented in chronological order, and this film was the only one never mentioned. After I see it, I see now why.
