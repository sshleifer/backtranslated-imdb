I couldn't even ... I mean ... look .... okay ... <br /> <br /> Wow. <br /> <br /> Not even a lot of my drunken friends who are trying to have a movie can enjoy the least. <br /> <br /> I can only think ... how. How do independent filmmakers depend every year without noticing (or even their lives) and artists like the man who made it on a DVD? It seems serious that a man with a home camera went out with some of the boys he met in Subway and did the worst he thought. <br /> <br /> "Hey, give me some ideas. Corn and work back." "Well, you have to be actors directly from high school and some crushed corn stems with clothes attached. And chest." Thank you, dude, I'm sure you and Windows Movie Maker are unexpectedly waiting for you next to the project.
