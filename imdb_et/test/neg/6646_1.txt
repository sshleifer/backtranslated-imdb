I've seen this movie, but not in one session. What happens is that it plays on TV, I watch for a few minutes, find that I have taken everything I can and then leave the room. In those few minutes I will never laugh at having the pleasure of what I look at, and I find myself in depression that is angry. Interestingly, I am told that psychological states are incompatible, that is, there can be neither anger nor depression at the same time. This film tests this theory. <br /> <br /> I think that part of the problem is that I spent almost ten years in Chicago, so when I look at scenes, I think of my own experience in this rotten city, and so I'll bring a piece of my luggage clearly. It is quite possible, I am willing to admit that if you are not a Chicago denizen, then you will find a piece of fun. If so, I envy you. <br /> <br /> And more. John Hughes put his films in Chicago and these films worked for me. I think the difference is that Hughes was a first-rate writer. I think it is obvious that he knew how to balance his situations, as well as his sympathetic and credible symbols. In comedy (which is different from a farce), this balance is important. And that is not easy to achieve. If all were very good movies and we shouldn't worry, as we do in the real world, asking when the genius will ever appear. In "Adventures in Babysitting", it is not. I hated these signs. <br /> <br /> Between a sympathetic and just pathetic, the difference is deep and real. <br /> <br /> For me, every scene in this movie is clunker. There is no humor, no humanity, no person knows. Just actors who read their rows, as if they were all they could do to limit themselves to shouting, are sure to finally have fun, this time for sure! It's like watching very bad comedians. It is embarrassing and after a while, usually when I get up and leave, I feel sorry for all those involved, which is a kind of emotional connection, I think. Elizabeth Shue is terrible. He does not act, certainly does not act comically, and it is quite possible that he will not. But lord how he tries. She looks older than 17 years and is younger than her 7-year-old effort in the school to make her a prize. And he's not alone. Just like everyone can't relax and let the story go. As everyone just doesn't have a clue what they do. <br /> <br /> Now it was Chris Columbus's early effort and he would have clearly improved and helping better writers (eg John Hughes himself) would definitely help, so maybe some forgiveness is fine. But the film is simply desperate. But as I said, it can work for some. If any of the above turns to you, and this clearly made some reviewers, go to the DVD and tap yourself. Otherwise, avoid such confusion as you would in the dark Chicago alley, where as you hurry, you will only see the shadow and you will hear the noises.
