This is an absolutely terrible excuse for the show. People say wisely and intelligently? I don't see how? Perhaps because characters use fancy words? Perhaps because they are dirty, use dry humor and have 2-dimensional personality. I went to the Ivy League school and no one acted as much as any of those signs. Actually I had met someone like I could have worshiped them! Men act like small emotional pre-teen girls and all minorities are based on stereotypes ... The characters are not AT ALL AUTHENTIC. Simply put, it sounds like a family of trailer parks trying to be rich and complex. This exhibition is just one cookie-cutter that hit the brain-dead prime minister who eat regularly.
