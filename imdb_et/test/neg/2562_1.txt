It seems that Sensei Seagal is becoming more and more moral and less active. To date, it must be his inferior film ... without action, a bad story, an impossible plot and making things worse, one of CHEEZIEST's endings I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Seagal movies are like seeing Dirty-Harry, you don't see it for big social reasons or impeccable behavior ... you want a good boost. <br /> <br /> 1 to 10 on a scale of 1 ...
