OK, last night I saw Paul Schrader's exorcist: the start of the Brussels International Fantasy Film Festival. Due to the whole film, it was very welcome. <br /> <br /> The director was there and most of the stars (except Skarsgard). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film was sucking a lot of time. It was a real disappointment to me because I am a big fan of both Shrader's and Friedkin's (RIP) 1973 film. <br /> <br /> What was wrong with this? Most of it actually. FX (you think that the digital revolution of the Matrix and the LOTR never happened: it was so badly melted!), Editing (real tempo or rhythm), actor (only Skarsgard was sometimes convinced). The script was an IMO created in the original film to explain African scenes. So the movie was just created for a scene that didn't give anything. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did was cinematography by Vittorio Storaro, although I have seen him better (Apocalyps Now). <Br /> <br /> All the time I thought it was just a rough piece. And given the (well-known) circumstances, this is probably what it is. But this does not change the obvious problems with the script. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to meet Schrader (very briefly), but I had no courage to tell him what I was thinking about the movie. I was so nervous (this is the guy who wrote the taxi driver for Christ!) So I forgot to ask him to sign his taxi driver copy ...
