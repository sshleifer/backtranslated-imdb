************* SPOILERS DOWN ************* "Night, Mother" is the story of Jesse (Sissy Spacek), a divorced epilepsy woman who peacefully announces her filth mother (Anne Bancroft) that she is going to commit suicide. This is an exciting premise that has been emptied of all vitality and excitement. Stylish hook turns out to be deceptive - the next story is content, hard, and rude. Where are the shocks and surprises when mother and daughter have the last conversation of their lives? Where are the secrets, confessions and fantasies uncovered and regrettable? They are here, but they're all painted in the same dull color that keeps the emotions in the background and marks the actor's Marsha Norman's "gene" for everything else. The result is not a film, but an exhaustive endurance test. <br /> <br /> Allow me to comment, saying that Sissy Spacek is one of the greatest actors in film history, so natural that a magnetic woman continues to surprise and amazes me after a twenty-year take-off. She brings touches and magic to everything she does, and I've seen that she can get more than one movie from her recycling trash with her angelic face and vulnerable eyes, her soft voice and a sweet smile. It was because of the great Spacek that I was watching this movie first, and that one of his films is terrible, he must fail to a great extent. This movie fails twice. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the Pulitzer movie is so carefully adjusted that it is claustrophobic and repetitive. The whole movie is a dialogue between two women, Jesse and her mother. What worked on stage - a middle-aged mother and daughter claimed two hours in a small household on film. The game, no matter how big, must be * custom * for the screen? it is self-evident and arrogant to believe that dialogue is so perfect that the word cannot be changed. The screenplay of this film could have been reduced to thirty to forty pages, and a conscious scriptwriter would have given some Spacek and a few * physical * sequences of competent Bancroft, some facial reactions, something to crush the wall-to-wall yak festival and prison-like lumps. No wonder the scenario was adapted by the original playwright Marsha Norman, who can announce the theater, but opens up here to be unsuccessful in the film. <br /> <br /> I can't emphasize the stage where the performance script is on film. Jesse and his mother seeing Jesse's upcoming suicide are superfluous and boring. Women walk into the living room kitchen room and back to the living room, where they all start again. The small Midwestern house is not the perfect place for a one-time movie, and the director will never catch anything smart or original, never trying to break the monotony with an external shooter or a blow or kickback or *. There are no music, no other signs, no other stories ... just two women who cover the pillows and claim their opinions. Respect for the game is sick? even Shakespeare's most holy classics can shake the screen. Committing to the original game seems almost embarrassing? it would be like the movie was only made to document the dramatic treasure of the performance, another idea with the audience. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the film fails is Anne Bancroft. He may be a good actress, but on a film with 80% of the performance, it rarely seems appropriate. She certainly doesn't fit here, playing Midwester's grandmother, but she looks more at Mrs Robinson before her morning coffee. She runs around Jesse's house, looking more than amazed, and looks extraordinarily atypical, even when her lines deliver a loving as a faulty wife. <br /> <br /> Sissy Spacek is great, as he is always, honest and honest, and so good that you really understand and agree with your choice of character. Sissy allows us to see that Jesse is a flat tire, a wrong turn to a woman who has had every bad break and made too many wrong choices. He has never gotten control of his life and his suicide is his way of saying, "Not anymore - this is where I get off." So he puts it anyway and when Spacek talks? you listen. In all of his films he proves that a good actor does not have to behave like a man, not all bluff and bravado and borrowed testosterone. In this and in movies like "Coal Miner's Daughter", he quietly shows soft strength and quiet depth that is as impressive as it is hypnotic? you can't help but fall in love. <br /> <br /> That's why I was so hard to see "Night, Mother". Spacek has been wasted in a stuck movie game that never helps to interfere or even interfere. I wouldn't want this movie to anyone except Sissy fans like me and even when you're frustrated. I'll give the movie a full-time bonus bonus that is bold enough to let the manager do what's right for her * and not to the happy end. GRADE: C
