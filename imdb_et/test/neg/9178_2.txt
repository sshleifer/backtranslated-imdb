Fred "The Hammer" Williamson presents another cheap film. He could set himself a new standard. Look painfully for the special effects mortar cannon that is visible on the street. You don't see it once, you see it several times. Look for a focus outside of a scene and the camera operator will try to confirm this by scrolling through the scene. Watch it with a group of people and make your own Mystery Science Theater!
