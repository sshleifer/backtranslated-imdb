If you find an image of violent murders and police cruelty, expressed in the plot with less film that is entertaining with the glacier, you will definitely enjoy surveillance. This film was garbage for both spirit and spirit. The idea of ​​being a "thriller" is comic; it would mean some tension and twisting. You expected the story to actually "start". It never rises above the glorification of weak spiritual criminals and individuals in all walks of life. Imagine all the "Old Man's Country" violence without any chase or sympathetic character. Thrill-killers on amok. Operation is usually good, but the script is a bunch. Don't worry and tell your friends you won't bother.
