Tycus is one of the worst movies I can ever see. <br /> <br /> I am not surprised that this product is not present in the cinema. Visual effects of art (start is terrible) Bad participant (I don't understand why a big Dennis Hopper appears in this movie) and a bad screen without meaning. My alternative: Armaggedon or Twister. BIRTHDAY: Don't look at this movie.
