Soultaker wrote Vivian Schilling. He also celebrated Joe Estevez, Gregg Thomsen and Robert D'Zar's angel of death. <br /> <br /> The story begins with getting to know Soultaker, played by Joe Estevez. We can quickly find out the role of Soultaker in this film. <br /> <br /> Next, the college's parents are preparing for the youth festival, which is called "Summerfest". In this film, the battle of the classes is all over the film. Girls come from a wealthy class and boys come from the middle or lower class. Class roles play no reason in the film, which is not quite clear or relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> In Summerfest we learn more about the classic fight for why Zach is still not encouraged by Natalie. Soultaker also makes a look, probably with his superior Death Angel. Here, D'Zar manages a character who must die and who are souls. It also appears that Soultaker has a characteristic conflict with Natalie and how he deals with his past. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Natalie has been on her journey to Summerfest and Zach persuades her to go home. While driving, Soultaker actively takes the lead, causing them to wreck at high speed. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is surrounded by Soultaker, who collects the souls of dead passengers, and Zach and Natalie are trying to cross her back to her body so they can continue to live. The class and character conflicts were a story, but really never been at the forefront or solved. <br /> <br /> Finally, a part of the drama is being pulled out, there's a lot of searching and running that is really boring. It is not really acceptable and it would have been nice to have it dealt with differently, but perhaps maybe increase the drama, but not the audience. Soundtrack is OK, and even the output values ​​are good. <br /> <br /> Robert D'Zar in his short screen performs a good job as a Death Angel. Joe Estevez does OK, but sometimes his role is a bit flat. Vivian is beautiful and does a decent job like Natalie, though maybe a couple of scenes just over. <br /> <br /> It may seem strange, but this movie would certainly have got some nonsense nonsense. Vivian bullies us a little, but it wasn't enough. <br /> <br /> I think it was a very serious attempt to make a movie. The results are worth it. Just don't wait for perfect production. <br /> <br /> 3/10
