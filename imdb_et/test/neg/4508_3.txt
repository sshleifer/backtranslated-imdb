Victor Buono as a devil? Certainly one must decide when that decision was made. It's not the silly mish-mash that contains a variety of haunted house tools, but my voice is the funniest part of it. Although the film is not terrible, I do not even go to other "rubber boots" of the 1970s, such as Amityville Horror, The Changeling and The Hell House Legend. Evil can be entertaining in places, but don't wait for fear. It is better to approach what it is: The silly fear film made everything a brilliant because of its too serious approach.
