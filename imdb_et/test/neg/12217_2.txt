Asmali Konak has probably become one of the best TV series coming out of Turkey. With its unique cinematic and visual approach to filming, the series has received a wide-ranging base, whose ratings have been constantly interrupted. Personally, I disagree with the singers who become actors (hence Ozcan Deniz - the leader of the actor), but I think the figures speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it was disgusting how much anyone could destroy such a drawing. Dealing with the years has allowed this film to track all the story in the series. Not only were cultural defects unacceptable, an idiotic scene involving family members who danced (in Greek style) and crushed discs that did not exist anywhere in Turkish culture. <br /> <br /> Some argue that the film should be seen as an independent film, not as a continuation of TV series, but this theory has one big decline, the way the movie was marketed, that it rises from where the series was left out and concludes a series of times and everything. . With that in mind, I and everyone I know would have asked for refunds and accepted the theater to warn other victims.
