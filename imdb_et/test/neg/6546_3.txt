This movie has some good productions - and that's all it does. Wires, especially Pauley Perrette, are tempting. (Although some bitmates seem to be working on a TV channel.) Material - this is a problem. I feel that the scriptwriter / director looked at the entire fit from Felicity throughout the session, then sat down to write the script without sleep. It really reminded me of Felicity - a thoughtful young woman who found herself, finding love, trembling-up-and-that-what-happens approach to characters and their relationships. Except that when I usually enjoyed Felicity, this film was cold. Writing is just terrible. It is amazing that the cast could be as good as possible because dialogue is at best boring. Worst of all, it becomes fine, strange and amateur. There is nothing original here, where the plot elements are recycled from tricks that were not so brilliant from the start. (Angels and fortune tellers? Come on.) In the first half of the movie, I took charge of the actors and hoped to get a prize for my patience. In the second half I wanted to finish it. My condolences have been cast down, who have devalued their talents better.
