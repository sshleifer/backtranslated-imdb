Imagine a movie that is completely in conflict with Arab Lawrence, instead of having all the male cast women. Instead of settling in the Arabian harsh desert, it is located in the New York bulgarian center. And instead of being one of the biggest films ever made, it's one of the most useless, boring and forgotten. <br /> <br /> The film touches Mary Haines (Meg Ryan), the perfect woman and mother, envy of everyone else in her high society, Manhatten social circle. She is painted as women who carry the weight of the world on their shoulders, despite the fact that she needs a babysitter and a housekeeper to live with her child. But I don't want to be too hard for her, Mary does all this while taking the liassez-faire attitude to fashion design work her father has given her. This idyllic lifestyle does not last forever and things start to crash in a very real way. <br /> <br /> Mary's wife is cheating on her and her father is burning her for not working enough. He's naturally upset and breaks down a bit. <br /> <br /> Mary must bounce her impressive young daughter and herself back. It does this through rehabilitation, hair straightening and shaping your dress line; though amazingly such a film, not an assembly. Mary succeeds; her daughter loves her, her mother loves her, her friends love her and her husband decides she loves her now. He decides to take his cheated husband back after he realized he was guilty because he hadn't told him enough. <br /> <br /> Movies that are one of the rescue armies are that it doesn't go down. all the men are the evil way.
