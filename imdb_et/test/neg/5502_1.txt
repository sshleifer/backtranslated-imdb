definitely this studio cage? maybe not, but I feel that there were serious mistakes in storytelling that if they were not associated with the editing process, they could only be caused by serious misconduct, crime, writing and leadership. to achieve a stylized effect similar to that of the gothic fairy tale of Edward Scissors, but unfortunately it falls to the surface and does not reach the mythical depth of the sling, but only an offensive attack. ie bad acting and low character even for fairy tales. <br /> <br /> Finally, not so scary, but just a little fun in its trials. the use of dialogue as a background to the plot was cumbersome and unnecessary. enough of the mystery of the halted rider, there is no need for a myth of a German mercenary, although Christopher walked on a comforting figure, but not that threatening - seeing that the head of the Horse deer makes him much friendlier, decapitated an inhuman nine-foot long spirit like the original legend. <br /> <br /> A true rhythm or universal tone has never been created and not the burton's classic. stiffened and trimmed as my exit ...
