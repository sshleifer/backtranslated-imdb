"Tenchi Muyo In Love 2" is the third Tench film. It seemed that its creators took the first two elements to do that. Tenchi is kidnapped at risk of spoilers and the team has to get him back. There's nothing new there. Former love Yoshost is a bad boy. It happened in another movie. The struggle between Aeka and Ryoko begins to be boring. The film has almost no scene and very little comedy. Personally, I don't know what the AIC, its creators thought. I gave this movie 4 votes.
