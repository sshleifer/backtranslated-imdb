I love how everybody treats this exhibition as it was the next big American sitcom. I looked through five episodes of this abomination, and the only person close to the actual teacher was the old man who loved and hated his work. The rest of them were just beautiful people who tried to read the lines written by people who are not really in the real classroom. I loved how each episode consisted of two idiots (the one who could put it, and the other who did not), getting into some sort of difficulty that indirectly involved their students. A British girl who thought she found a good quality with the main idiot, but in the end it was somehow shocked to be a jackass. A hot chick, which was hot there, and a principal and his shortage that somehow continued to be a non-existent plot of land. I loved how almost all the teachers in this show were very young, but I ask you to think back to your high school days and remember the teachers you had. . . did they see? Or did you go to a high school where people with secondary education were taught? This is the high school that everyone else went. The exhibition did not have any research on what was going on in schools. In public schools, directors have no authority over senior and fire teachers, the school board, but in every episode I looked at, the main threat to my teachers was the fire. Think back to your history class. . . . . or think of any class of history, have you ever seen an incredibly hot British chick who teaches American history class? No. Have you ever seen a teacher salon that is so big that you could play basketball? Teachers could have been a great show if it was actually based on reality in some way. What makes teaching fun is the stories you get from communicating with the students, and the teachers find it funny because they're dealing with pupils a day. Obesity for life outside of teaching made it another four camera sitcom with unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment, saying unrealistic features, and I'm sorry I just didn't buy it. The exhibition could have modeled itself after other successful hits and used a single camera format, and it should have focused more on the teacher's relationship with these students rather than with each other. <br /> <br /> It gets a star and a star for a hot chick (she was really hot). <br /> <br /> Finally, it was an unsuccessful sitcom that goes down in history when hacks try to understand the profession. I only hope that when they make a second learning environment based on teaching that they learn from their mistakes so that a monster like it never touches a television screen.
