This is the worst film I've ever seen, and the worst I see. I don't see the need to change what everyone else has said before, just warn ... <br /> <br /> This is NOT one of the bad movies you think you want to watch it's easy if it's BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. <br /> <br /> This movie is equivalent to your friend's "pet rock". Wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen. Unfortunately, it never does. At least with your pet stones, you knew what you came across. Lion's gate is misleading in this bomb ... No ... it's a disaster. After watching the movie, you would swear George W. Bush's hands in making this movie ... yes, it's idiotic. <br /> <br /> Stay away, of course, just don't want to watch the worst movie all the time. This is probably how Lion's gate thought it would take the money out of this piece.
