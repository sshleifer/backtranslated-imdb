One of the latest York entertainment films, "El Chupacabra", is remarkable because his viewer wants to die after watching for two hours. This movie is filmed with a back-up chamber, which is usually used for birthday parties. The only reason I can say that this was not because of certain scenes where the camera man's shadow is in the frame. <br /> <br /> This film is afflicted by almost every aspect of the cinema and I am sure he has brought the film industry ten years ago. Actors have cut out the boundaries, often stopping when they wait to change the external chip card on the screen. An actor who plays Navarro not only splits and skips the word in his dialogue, but stumbles through a Swiss cheese restriction that sees his face sliding and confusing. The other actors break the wall and show the actor of a twelve-year-old child who is carrying out a research project in his backyard. <br /> <br /> My friends and I are looking for the worst possible films and gave us more than we wanted. The funny parts are inconvenient and the rest are horrible clich√©s and holes in the plot. As one friend so humbly put it, this film is an interrupted hope for the industry. I highly recommend this movie like people like me who are deliberately looking for these movies, but for everyone else, be careful!
