Most of the European repertoire of European films is pretty poor, but it's his own league. In fact, it may even be the worst (Sandra Bullock) film ever made. I can say that I could have missed it if it was just one unfortunate bad Hollywood thriller when I didn't see the Dutch original SPOORLOOS. The modified end here is stupid enough (and will be executed particularly unfairly), but much worse than the one that removes all the intelligence and depth that the original called. The real horror to find here is that the same man who led SPOORLOOS is responsible for this cruelty. Will a real George Sluizer ask?
