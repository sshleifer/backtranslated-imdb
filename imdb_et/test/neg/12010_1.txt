Did the first travesty actually make money? This is another order (by the way) that no one asked. But we've got it. The sequel is similar to his predecessor, completely dead. It's also quite disgusting (remember the dinner scene?) I think I almost felt sorry for Ritter, Yasbeck and Warden. Did they have so much money?
