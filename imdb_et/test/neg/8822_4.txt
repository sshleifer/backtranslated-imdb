The strange, often effective, hippie zombie flick, featuring an unforgettable wife / husband Alan and Anya Ornsby team, is not as bad as most of its genres, but is still a high cheese factor. Includes a number of discounted zombies, amazingly entertaining dialogue, chewing Alan Ormsby scene, multiple gay / kinky robbers, and a single string soundtrack. Wife Anya makes it so strange that she doesn't know if she really works. At this time, there are many worse pictures (look for the Al-Adamson flop), but this is not the night of the living dead. Director / writer "Benjamin" Clark, is really Bob Clark, who continued the "Porky" service disasters earned in the early 80s. He has just returned after the first inexplicable movie ("Christmas Story") to return to "Baby Genius". Weirdo Alan Ormsby later wrote the "Cat People" version of kinky Nastasia Kinski / Malcolm McDowell. Moocow says to watch this hippie horror movie for fun, zombie frolics and campy dialogue: = 8)
