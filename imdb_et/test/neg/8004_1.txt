This movie may be much better if they didn't use Brian Conley as a gangster and when they didn't start with Christopher Biggins. <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie, I wonder what's going on. There were too many double crosses and plot twists to make the film credible. The film deserves 0, but if I don't see 0 then I gave it 1. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. some rusting scissors when you watch this movie again. I'll tell you that it was one and a half hours of my life that I can't get back to. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a gangster movie, don't get it. Instead, look for "High Time Off" or "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking."
