Please note that I only saw the last half of the movie, so take your review of any suitable salt cereal, saying, seeing what I saw, was more than enough to make me pretty sure one is enough if it's enough . <br /> <br /> In short, it's Chevy Chase killing an excellent predecessor (NL Christmas Day), but it's not Chevy Chase, and it's happening on a tropical island, mostly without Christmas at all. <br /> <br /> Ol 'Chevy probably didn't want to, because there is no real fun on the plot, instead they got a screwed cousin. Eddie, who was once again big in the original, but is just up there, and an extremely poor foundation for any movie that looks and acts. Humor tests are common to such an extent that even modern television comedy comforts and given that it should be a comedy, I doubt I need to say more. <br /> <br /> This is not to be seen in its features because it has nothing but its drawbacks and again, how Hollywood's life is to catch the blood of the past. <br /> <br /> I think I'll look at the original before the upcoming Christmas holiday to try to restore my childhood innocence from lost time when the movies were more than just a high budget, but meaningless garbage.
