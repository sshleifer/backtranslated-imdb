I do not know honestly what legal or illegal substances they - the writers - were when they wrote this terrible trick! <br /> <br /> Cast - Suck Plot - Suck Editing - Suck The whole premise in the movie is that a psychological / telinetic force comes over to the lesbian vampire corporation, you just have to be in your head to watch even 1 minute of it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I had a look at it - it was here! network after the purchase of two images and a movie that came after it was real, what I wanted to see. I quickly shipped the whole thing and was just surprised at how stupid this film was at double speed! <br /> <br /> Don't try, buy or watch this movie .... movie vampires are no wonder as much as general movie and production! <br /> <br /> If you want a good lesbian vampire movie - hunger with David Bowie, Susan Sarandon and Katharine Deneuve - a great movie to watch / own / rent this clean
