I rented this movie because it probably takes place in a jazz club - you know those hips, cool places where you can be late on Saturday night. Well, this ridiculous movie doesn't have one ounce of "cool". The result is funny, the original songs are terrible, the songs of both leading actors are always key (to be kind) and unprofessional at best, the plot is no more complicated than the "boy meets girl," is ridiculous and the only decent cinematic moments are film scenes. Jazz club scenes have a sophisticated sophomorphic dialogue with the most busy organ music. This Joey de Francesco should keep his day's work (unless his daily work helps to evaluate films). Is it possible not only to get my four dollars back but also to pay for my therapies? This movie, interesting, is so bad you might want to watch it. Just like driving a bad accident, you have to look at least once. Just get headphones ready!
