This movie is traceable but nothing special. Four girls on a voyage in Vegan decide to attack foolishly (because she is cute). They all stay at night in the motel somewhere and apparently psychotic problems with women appear in pop-ups. <br /> <br /> Characters are clich√©s - a married, responsible woman; slutty party girl; solid bride-to-be; and a man-hate who just got dumped. Hitchhiker is really nice until he gets crazy. <br /> <br /> Not enough mess and too rape. I enjoy a lot of horror / thrillers, and it did nothing to me. The end was the same as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is positive that the actors did a great job they had to work with. The dialogue is not terrible, and in general I was mindful of having ever seen or heard any of them. And the plot was not within the limits (although I doubt that any woman that day and age would distract the hacker - no matter how attractive she is), so I didn't dare that things were not reasonable. <br /> <br /> In general, The Hitchhiker was a good one, but it wasn't very interesting. In the same genre, there are many better movies I would recommend ("Holiday Stop", "Devil's Reject", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", even "The Hitcher" remake). Do it yourself and skip it if you have no other options.
