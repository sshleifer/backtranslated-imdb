it is a 1990s TV show, not a 1979 movie, which appears to be three episodes that total just under 90 minutes. Before watching, I thought it was one of the movie versions and I noticed that he had a TV show Feel not interested in it too much. I just felt the story wasn't there and there wasn't much excitement or drama. I watched my DVD player often it took time because I was really bored. I also thought some dialogue was that it politely, not good.plus, I thought that acting left much to wish. but it is just me, it is a good clean, healthy family entertainment. There's certainly nothing offensive here.
