OK, so Herc is a hunk ... but the remaining 3 hours were wasted, wasted ... oh mankind! <br /> <br /> Poor Sean Astin was supposed to follow his master in the same mountains as New Zealand, which ... wait! Could it be? Someone in the Lord Lord of the Rings was doing his free time with home videos! Yes, that's it! <br /> <br /> At least I want to say he was promising. <br /> <br /> Special effects were often ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But Herc was a hunk. <br /> <br /> NH
