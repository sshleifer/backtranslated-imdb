After a while I was dedicated to exhibitions such as Ghost Hunters and Destination Truth and other things, although I thought they were crazy and found them interesting and fun, and so we watch entertainment television. Fun is to turn off your brain and believe that every camera caught by the camera is not just a shadow, but a mental spirit of some crazy detainees or something that you can return to later in the real world. With that in mind, enjoying Paranormal State more than just turning off the brain requires that you take lead in high doses regularly in childhood, then you will suffer a recurrent head injury, then take your huffing color to your teenagers. Then you need to get high / drunk and look. <br /> <br /> The paranormal state is beyond pseudo-science (which I can enjoy with some critical thinking) that you find in Ghost Hunters (which I still find a reasonably interesting and fun program), it's pseudo ... everything. <br /> <br /> The exhibition follows the adventures of a group of Penn State University students (not to be confused with Pennsylvania University). When they take on demons and spirits, Ryan Buell takes ceremonies at any time when religion seems to be the most dramatic (from the Catholic exorcism carried out by the College, along with Wiccan's incantations, triggered by socially uncomfortable goths, Native American cleaners). credit, the Indians). If you believe in Wicca or you are a Catholic or a traditional Indian religion, then I think you want to be cleaned by someone who ... is not a college student with free time. I don't remember the exorcist scene where the priests threw their hands and said, "It's no use! Invite a college club to the college. It's too much for us. They've probably read Wikipedia's article on exorcisms." The exhibition opens with a title where Ryan speaks of the PRS (Paranormal Research Research Society) saying that when he came to Penn State (you notice that you don't see any show where the host says the same thing, but he says instead of Penn State) he says he says, "When I came to MIT or" When I got my degree in theoretical physics ... "he found other people with a paranormal interest. He says they are sometimes" warriors " "I remember when I pretended I was a warrior and I fought with ghosts. I was six. Then emotional Ryan brings out an amazing and reluctant Chip Coffey who pretends to be in a tranche and fires in pain. Awesome. I thought people had somewhat thought how ridiculous is the idea of ​​the psyche and the media after the "Crossing Over" has gone out of the air, the exhibition is taking too seriously because this small group of social lies feels they are fighting against some old, cosmic evil. Waiting values ​​are small, the stories are boring and unlike Ghost Hunters, who occasionally try to get something inaccurate (though probably explainable but interesting) on ​​their devices, the PS requires you to think their audible noise and wrinkles are evidence of demons, ghouls and possibly leprechauns. The only thing that is frightening about this exhibition is that there are people who take it seriously. The only paranormal thing is that the people to whom it is directed can do every episode while keeping a straight face. <br /> <br /> Call me beating, but I feel that the great secrets and the aftermath of the universe are too big to solve a half-hour TV show by the press in the state school. <br /> <br /> All of this has said that I would recommend everyone to look at this example at least once if no other reason is a real horrible movie or TV show. Or you can also do a drinking game. I think the other would be better.
