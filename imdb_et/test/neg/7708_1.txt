OK, I have to admit that I am a very bad House of the Dead despite its well-documented shortcomings. But this was the worst movie I've seen on the Demon door. The effects are much better compared to DATD. But the plot is weak, acting like everyone's favorite, porn movie and "character" decisions and actions consistently moron. I feel like I'm trying Uwe Boll's latest cinematic trips to get some perspective on HOTD2. I am not suggesting that he is really a treatment, but a case of a different illness, but if your minds are offended in such a terrifying way, the only way is. OK there. I have succeeded in minimizing ten lines and no longer wasting the pulp of our time that is dead in House 2.
