Wind. Just one of the worst movies ever made. The only good thing that comes from such nonsense is that seeing movies from such a proliferation makes me a sure horror film like me, I'm sure my upcoming feature will also cut. I mean, if it is a horror for the market, I can manage to record the video in 83 minutes. <br /> <br /> A complete list of what's missing on this film takes too long to write. But high are: no story, terrible action, terrible cinematography and almost no editing. This last bothered me the most. As a personal editor, this film made me totally crazy because it didn't change anything at all. The captain was photographed for each scene. They had no coverage at all. For anyone who doesn't know ... "Coverage" captures the scene from multiple angles to change cutting options during editing to make the desired viewing experience. Yes, this movie was nothing about it. I'm even talking about the simplest scene. Example: A common conversation between people sitting at two tables usually starts with a master who identifies who is in the scene and where they are. Then, if the conversation continues, you would reduce the conversation back and forth by continuing the conversation. You can even throw down a desktop picture or two on the table or someone's hand. Something. This is the "Movie 101" stuff. These people seem to have no idea how the movies work. Each shot had a camera lock. Moving, cutting, nothing. If I taught a film-making course, it would be a visual help for my "What not to do" lesson. <br /> <br /> Finally, don't waste your time on people. The only amazing thing about this movie is that it is even distributed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
