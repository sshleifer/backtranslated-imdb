Simply put, Mencia's mind is the worst, most dishonest exhibition in Comedy Centralis and perhaps all television ... ever. I love Comedy Central and watch many shows and movies there all the time, but every time this show starts even after good comedy, I can't find the remote control fast enough. <br /> <br /> Mencia says used, worn out racial jokes in a bad attempt to be contradictory, then draws attention to the ethnicity she was just talking to the public, as saying, "they liked it so that all your competitions like her and expanding her also. Let me break Mencia, I don't know if these people are plants or not, but just because you're going for a black woman and a high five for her one ridiculous joke doesn't mean she thinks you're funny, it just means that you put it on the ground and what else does it intend to do on TV? He gives the impression that his jokes are deep, meaningful and thought-provoking, which appears in his advertising, but if you look at this example, almost 100% of what he says is common sense. He also claims that only smart people get their jokes, but you don't have to be wiser to understand what he just said when he says that maybe you have to finish 3rd grade Carlos. The guy continues, saying he says what others are thinking, but I think you will find that if anyone thinks what he says, they all thought it was ridiculous, and that is why they never said it first 1 episode and do it if you need to, because after you have seen 1 episode, you have seen them all. Why Comedy Central is renewing this terrible exhibition that's over me. If you are looking for good comedy, look elsewhere because you will find very little here.
