If Jacqueline McKenzie and John Lynch were not such talented actors, this film would probably be even worse than it really is. The story of two mentally disabled people who fall in love and have a child is interesting and worth exploring. On the negative side, the plot becomes more and more up when the story progresses, and the musical choices become more and more strange, so at last I was laughing when I know the director I like to cry.
