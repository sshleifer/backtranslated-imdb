"Menlo Park Wizard" was deeply responsible for many of the things we took for granted in 2007: even if he could not find them without competitors or assistants, he gave birth to electric lighting, phonograph, film camera, electric car battery, electricity the most important but the least memorable invention), prefabricated houses and upgrades for the phone and the telegraph, as well as the adhesive tape machine and the early voting device. The total number of patents is over 1000 - much more than any other American inventor. <br /> <br /> But Edison was a ruthless business competitor. He often had great legal struggles over the superiority of his inventions over his competitors. The best example is a phone where he was one of seven or eight competitors who demanded Alexander Graham Bell. In fact, Edison's central idea was not that Bell and Gray had come out independently of each other in 1876, but had improved the sound quality of the receiver and transmitter that Bell had not developed. However, it was part of a major 1888 Supreme Court ruling that was the longest decision of the US Supreme Court (one of these reports!), Written by Chief Justice Morrison Waite - which, incidentally, died within a week of overriding Supreme Judge in 1886 Edison found the same in the power networks of large cities ruthless competitor. It was George Westinghouse, the inventor of rail breaks. The Westinghouse company had received the help of a new inventor and former Edison assistant Nicola Tesla. Tesla developed "AC", a system of competitors for "DC" of Edison. The Edison system was basically a straight electrical system. The Tesla system made it possible to switch from one circuit to another - in fact it was a better and more efficient system. But Edison decided to break this rival with an advertising campaign. <br /> <br /> It started with power lines. Edison had his lines underground at an early age so that they would not be exposed to the weather. However, Westinghouse had forced its lines open on the phone lines. When Westinghouse's repair lines had several occasional deaths (especially one case where a repairman was alive in hundreds of frightening spectators in Manhattan's business district), Edison began to insist that AC power be much more dangerous than DC All this was Edison, helping some affiliates find Westinghouse some inventors alternating current generators and dynamo for electric chair. Edison himself always denied that he invented an electric chair, but he helped several smaller numbers on his journey - the whole story was read by Mark Essigi's EDISON & THE ELECTRIC CHAIR (New York: WALKER & COMPANY, 2003). <br /> <br /> Edison is experimenting with cats and dogs (attempts to show off to the public). In the long run, Edison was unable to assist the public support for AC in inventing a new enforcement method. But he never stopped trying. <br /> <br /> In 1903, he was able to combine his campaign with Westinghouse and A.C. by inventing his film camera. He helped "suppress" the well-known elephant ("Topsy") who had killed several men. He did so by dying with the poor beast A.C. It's a pathetic movie - whatever poor "Topsy" had done, was a poor beast - not a Machiavellian murderer. Today, we see explosions of electric sparks that show the death of elephants, we know it will end soon, but the "collapse" of Topsy is still an unpleasant sight. The film leaves a bad taste in the mouth of a contemporary movie audience. Unfortunately, it probably made a profit for Edison - in his film description in his film catalog, there is a real pride here. In 1903 it could be seen by many Americans. We are pleased that today more people are terrible - sometimes it can be understood that humanity has improved a little.
