This film should have presented three film summaries that are interlinked to form a full-length feature film (including many people who slowly pass by dark corridors and streets). WARNING! The first hour of this movie is just the hash of the first two Aztec films, as the main character said. The actual movie doesn't start until it's almost over. I have to say that Bat's participation is quite fun. <br /> <br /> As for the robot, I thought the robot was a mechanical device that could be a human. The Bat "robot" consists of a radioactive reanimated body that is covered by a robot body. As Tom Servo said, "He's not that impressive, he doesn't even have knees!" That, and it takes the robot about an hour just lumber across the room. But when he catches you, look! She breaks you with a touch (radio? Pluh-easy!). <br /> <br /> This is a great movie with Joel and Bots. Otherwise, you are just an abuse.
