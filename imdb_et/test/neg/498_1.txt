Critics love this movie. I found it personally meaningless and tasteless. It's a million times I've been critics loved this trap and came out, wishing someone would throw boiling hot water into their testicles because it was less painful than watching a movie. There are many scenes that are completely unnecessary. Warning for Animal Lovers: Don't look at this movie if you don't want to see sheep killed and molested. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good Asian movie, see Africa. If you want to see the film escaped from the convicted offenders, see Gene Wilder / Richard Pryori's classic Stir Crazy. Avoid 9 Soul like plague.
