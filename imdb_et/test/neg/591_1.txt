I did and I lost two and a half hours of my life so I can never get back again. <br /> <br /> I have the honest idea of ​​what critics and fans see in this movie. And that's not because I don't understand "art". I love a good movie with deep messages, brilliant cinematography, and great leadership. <br /> <br /> This movie is not one of them. <br /> <br /> My main complaint with this movie is that it is so terribly slow to kill that audience. On the other hand, the dialogue sequences move too fast and there is not enough exposure that people who have not read the book know what is going on (my mother was merciful to me and explained everything before I looked at it). Would it have killed the narrator? At least at the beginning and end? <br /> <br /> Let me break down for you: (Spoilers all the time) <br /> <br /> In the first two minutes, a black screen with no music is waiting for the actual movie to start. <br /> <br /> Over the next minute, you will see several pictures of sunrise and savanna landscapes. As the audience couldn't figure out how to set the scene when they didn't see the hit three or four times. <br /> <br /> The next eleven minutes are busy monkeys. They fight, see the monolith, fight some more, drag things to the bone. They are said to be prehistoric men whose development is influenced by the monolithic song. Not that you could tell if you haven't read the book. <br /> <br /> * Finally, we get into space. Only for twelve-minute ships that are slowly turning to the blue Danube (pretty fast paced roll, as I understand it, but here it seems completely embarrassing). Finally, we get some harmless dialogue and a rather mysterious exposition that says the government won't let people fall into the moon. We'll be thinking about it with anti-gravity for another 14 minutes on Blue Danube and spinning ships and clean camera tricks. <br /> <br /> Next is four minutes of watching the ship over a month and docking at a space station. We get a little more exposure in the next board room. Then we're back outside traveling at a snail's pace for over a month. There will be another monolith that will fill our ears with this terrible ringtone (I had no idea it was real music!). The monolith makes its small light exhibition and then the plot jumps. <br /> <br /> * Seven * minutes to watch the ship on Jupiter. By that time my brain had been transformed. Can it move slower? Maybe it's "realistic" to imagine it as such, but we don't have to see the same or five different frames to understand the concept of "realism". Let me tell you about this "realism" thing; I rejoiced when the secondary astronauts died. Not because I am a sadist and as people look to die, but after five minutes I was just so annoyed that his breath breathed! I have to take care of this character, feel when he dies! Instead, I found myself waiting for the blissful silence no matter how it came. <br /> <br /> Anyway, now we're in the most interesting part of the movie, part of which is HAL. Forget about Dave's wooden hero. The real star of the exhibition is that a cold boyfriend is a cold boy, a cool guy, a ruthless merciless computer. He's great. And the "Open pod cool doors" sequence is wonderful. But it's too short. And it won't be long before the director repeats for too long. <br /> <br /> Four minutes when HAL dies. And he will die. Slowly, painfully, losing intelligence every minute, the voice becomes lower and slower, singing "Daisy, Daisy", all with low and constant lifting that becomes as annoying as heavy breathing. <br /> <br /> Seven minutes of flying colors when Dave enters the monolith. Seven. I can feel my brain melts and drips from my ears! Seven complete minutes absolutely nothing, but some guys are a psychedelic version of space travel, again with this triple cursed choir! We got the idea at the beginning of the sequence! Why pull it out for so long? If he doesn't want to make LSD users psychotic and setbacks. <br /> <br /> I don't even try to explain the end, mostly because I can't do it myself. He is said to be in an alien research laboratory and teaches him deep and profound things when he is older and older, and then sends him back to the country like a cosmic child of celestial space. None of this falls in the film. All you know is just a sequence of images that have no purpose or plot. A lot of the film felt so. <br /> <br /> For the first time I watched this movie halfway through. The second time I apologized for this film was to help my wicked sequences to see how long they lasted. It's so boring. <br /> <br /> If desired, call this tough movie "Art". I wouldn't. I've seen more interesting art in the local museum. And I have never ever been committed to such suffering.
