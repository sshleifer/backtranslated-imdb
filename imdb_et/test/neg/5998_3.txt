Jackie Chan's movies are typical examples of how supply is higher than demand. In this one, Jackie Chan is no matter what her name is, I doubt she even knows, and she's a driver of a racing car. Well, she drives 10 miles per hour and then the film material is accelerated so I can do all the tricks myself well. At the time of the big finals, when Jackie Chan wants to arrest a scammer, beating him at the race, we can finally see how dirty this production is. Chani's struggle, especially in the casino scene, is decent, but when we talk about special effects, dear Lord. stupid. And here it is not really safe for drivers, not even a concrete wall in the neighborhood. And do not start me, what a terrible story it is, I mean, it's Hong Kong, it was probably written on a gun point eight years old, but still what a mess. I like Chan as much as the next man, maybe more because I saw "Rush Hour," but his slow down cousin must really choose his projects better.
