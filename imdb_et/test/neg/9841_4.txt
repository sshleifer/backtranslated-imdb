"Stick Around" is one of the short films that tied Bobby Ray to Oliver 'Babe' Hardy before Hardy's immortal news with Stan Laurel. Several critics have said that Ray and Hardy - a gigantic little man and an overwhelming man - were the prototype of Laurel and Hardy, but that is not true. Ray and Hardy play well, but there is no team; in all these films Ray has more material and is probably meant to be a hero while Hardy tempts him very differently from his later "Ollie" character "Stanley". It is very clear that the relationship between the small Bobby and the great Babe was inspired by earlier Chaplin films, where Little Trampit was tortured by a huge Mack Swain or a brisk Eric Campbell. <br /> <br /> But "Stick Around", Hardy sports a hard hat that is identical to his later "Ollie" title (though with more sophisticated mustache), and he and Bobby - after much of this movie as opponents - will become a drunk comrade . <br /> <br /> Bobby is a paper holder for Matz and Blatz, where Hardy is his boss. When Tardy Bobby tries to pretend that he immediately appeared, there is some clever physical business between the two men that reminds me of the routine that Roscoe Arbuckle and Buster Keaton have done in the Garage. Shortly afterwards, Bobby Ray, whose briefly acting career has never developed into a personality of the screen, is an "impossible" gag that would be inappropriate for Stan Laurel when he pulls a longer ladder out of much smaller toolkits. /> <br /> Paper manufacturers are going to work in a sanatorium and there are normal unrealistic images of mental illness: one resident demands to sit with toast because he thinks he is a poached egg! There are also somewhat racist (and inconveniently unpleasant) gags accompanied by a black man who empowers prisoners to break nuts on their heads. When he sees the image of a lion *, not even a photo, you think - he goes all the cows as if it were a real wild animal. <br /> <br /> "Stick Around" is quite terrible. Most pantomime and action are much wider than it must be for small comedy; even Hardy, a very exquisite actress already in 1925, pongs badly when he is acting too much here. There are several bad examples of matching images. I was impressed by an unusual camera design when the fat pedestrian face is cluttered and we see our reflection in our mirror image rather than its actual face. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS. During his short interconnection, Hardy usually played Ray's boss or opponent or both; here, once, they end up as pals. This is a nice ending, but it doesn't compensate for what is really a bad movie. My rating is only 4 out of 10.
