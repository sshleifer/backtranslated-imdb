It's hard to say exactly what to ever suck and say about eternal film. The story is predictable, if not completely ridiculous. All this is a question of "conscientious gestures", which, as presented here, bear no conviction. Yeah, MGM's "production values" are proud, and yes, Mrs Lamarr was fine, but she and Spencer Tracy have absolutely no "chemistry" together - and that's the only thing that would have made this clich√© parade all effective ... My understanding is that this movie got bad when it was originally released; the passage of time has not improved it.
