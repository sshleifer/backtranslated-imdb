The quality you remember after watching Big Knife is how claustrophobic it is. Its stimulation is sacrificed into a single texture text. This is an extreme call. Modern viewers feel that every point has been made (and then some), but the film does not move forward and does not benefit the viewer and changes the landscape. It's very inert. At the 45 minute mark, I was sure I watched two very slow hours. My reluctant answer was, "Good God, where is it going?" It seems that Odets paid the word ... <br /> <br /> This is a good place to notice a dramatic decline from the highest point of the 1940s through projects of the 50s and 60s until the real decoration of the film was discovered again in the 70s , but disappeared again. Here, from Steiger, Lupino et al. and the camera moves in advance to satisfy the excessive practice. This is due to the increase in the method; an unfortunate tendency to sacrifice the value of every other film, to give the participants their selfish desires. "Good actor," ho-hum, has killed the mindset in the movie. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance's forehead and pompadour retract and push every time he reacts. It's annoying. <br /> <br /> It's a terribly boring thing.
