Revisionist history - making the evil marquis de Sade a half-heroic romantic - is reasonable enough. But horrible, amateur cinema and terrible copying make this movie painless. The only reason is that almost all the women in the movie are proud. And, astonishingly, torturing these days, the hands are binding, not likely to harm a woman's beauty, hairstyle and makeup. I think the producers mostly filmed in Russia, choosing women for their looks - and willingness to work cheaper - than to act. If you decide to watch it because you have nothing better to do or if a film student who is looking for bad examples is moving quickly through any scene that doesn't contain nudity.
