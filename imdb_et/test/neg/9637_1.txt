After watching Stop-Loss, I feel disappointed in Hollywood for making such a stink. Gone are the days of the glory of the 1940s films, which made one proud to be an American, to fight evil that wants to be conquered abroad and at home. What we have left is a rushing froth in the mouth of rabid-anti-Bush radicals. The story is about three young men coming back from war. One falls to the controlling madness that ends with his death. The main protagonist abandons his country during the war and at the same time destroys his best friends. The third is really the story of a hero who decides to continue the fight that was on our shore almost eight years ago. What makes this film bad is not the acting, but the underlying assumption. We have to believe that the decorated soldiers are the enemies of our country. Desertion resembles treason during the war and the main protagonist flirts with it throughout the film. The purpose of this paradox is to weaken the audience's reaction to the central act of the film. We don't have to find King because he's wearing medals, but his actions aren't just worth it, they call it. He's not a hero. In order to accept the film, the audience must accept the rightness of desertification because the story paints the king as something other than a hero. I can't accept it because it's like asking me to call a bright blue day. What's more, the actual hero exhausts, a man who revives and continues to serve his country. I would only recommend this stinker to someone who needs convincing Hollywood break-up, as this is a clear example of this. No wonder it went bad in the box.
