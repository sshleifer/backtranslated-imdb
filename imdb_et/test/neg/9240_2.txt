I just watched it yesterday and wanted to read the shameful comments of other nations, but I found some high signs. <br /> <br /> WHAT ??? This was probably the worst horror film I've ever seen in Asia. <br /> <br /> Spoilers * The story was just as much of a basic problem. Many Asian horrors have twisted spirits that try to help but just look scary (remarkable exceptions: ring and ju-on). This is where they are not scary. A beautiful Asian woman who looks a little pale is not scary at all. The "Munga" sign directly explains everything that is a natural lifecycle; nothing like that. But the woman just can't get it, she would rather kill herself and her baby, then let this poor ghost again. My friend and I just laughed when he jumped twice from the building and the ghost was waiting until the second time he told him why he had been watching him. This information would have been nice to know before he started jumping, but whatever. <br /> <br /> * It said I made a few parts in the middle. First of all, he rides a taxi with a taxi (taxis are riding a taxi?), Which has a whole range of hair that is inexplicably horrible. Immediately after that, at the bus stop you have to see it because it is rather confusing. <br /> <br /> All this movie is a complete bomb, I gave him an extra point for these two scenes above. This is a bad-quality Asian horror that can make ghosts almost beautiful in women's wombs, trying to scare the same images.
