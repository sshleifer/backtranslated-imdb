I'm not quite sure where to start. From start to finish, bad, smelly bad, like stepping on a port-a-john at 100 degrees. If you force yourself to look at it, as I did, hold some of Vicodin's pains at hand. I never understand how this bad tie changes its cutting room without getting the whole roll to the floor. The film is cross Gumby wearing Pokey, meets the terminator, meets Wally Beaver, who plays cowboys and Indians without cowboys. I've seen better animation in Blob's original section. You'll get more entertainment when you look at Gone with the Wind when you suffer and hang. Poorly functioning and hockey lines will hit you and want you to have rented Peewee's big rentals or looked back at every episode of Gilligan Island. UGH .. I'm going to cut my wrist now.
