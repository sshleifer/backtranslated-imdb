Where do we start with this offer? I almost said a movie, but it goes too far. The only thing about this movie is that it is definitely a marriage between hell, nothing and pointless, peace and balderdash. These films should have a physiological health warning to not harm your mind to a point where you might think that all the good filmmakers have left the planet and their resources have been handed over to duffheads who have done this classical trash just like it is in sister weapons. Twaddle. They are neither fiction nor fact, entertaining or provocative, humorous or compelling, but located in twilight zones where there is no access to any and all accessories that attract people to give up their precious time, sit in a dark room, and generally become more enlightened, liven up or happy at the end. If we were to get "Turkish" points for such films, it would have laughed because we went through turkey, ham, potatoes, germs, sauce and all the other decorations before we got to the bottom.
