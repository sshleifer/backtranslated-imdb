Four things were of interest to this film - firstly, he is a Carly Pope ("popular" celebrity) who is always happy to watch. Secdonly, this is a great New Zealand actor Rena Owen. Third, it has been filmed with the New Zealand Film Commission. Fourth, a friend suggested it to me. However, I was completely disappointed. The whole story is absurd and complicated, with very little resolution. The Pope is doing well, but Owen is not being used unfortunately. Other actors and actors are fine, but I don't know all of them. Apart from the nice puzzles that are under the movie (and the Pope and Owen), this movie is not very good. So the story of morality is ... don't look at it if you really don't want to.
