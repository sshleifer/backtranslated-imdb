It is a shame that so many children, as well as parents, so idolized, should manifest themselves in such exploiting, wagon-jumping drift. I often do not know whether Mr Wisdom, in his later years, looked back at his apology for a film with pride. At least Sally Geeson had the trick to retire to do something that was useful after this low budget waste. The long-forgotten pop-like real things can't save the movie from this cumbersome. If you want to invest in 60 nostalgia, "Here we go around Mulberry Bush," soon Barry Evans and Sally's sister Judy.
