It is a shame that the script of this movie had more holes than you could shake (metaphor deliberate), because Kinski and Coyote - both highly talented performers who are capable of very fine and subtle - are wonderful chemistry together and always provocative Fairuza Balk didn't interfere. also a mixture. Jeremy Piven would also have been great here if his character (and all the other supporting symbols) were not written on the plot. In the case in the main proceedings, the writers simply did not know how to create an innocent or innocent tension for Kinski's character - instead they gave us confusion, contradiction, and hope-viewers of the finals. - Don't tell the stroke.
