I was watching this movie this morning on a DVD and I was so disappointed that I even thought it was a good joke for the audience. In other words, the creators made comedy not drama. Finally, I finally realized that Mr Tony Giglio was serious about this film. Sorry, because: the dialogue is ridiculous, the actor is poor and inanimate, the story is a peaceful story! Poor Ryan Phillippe - despite his efforts, his character in the film is probably his worst performance! What to say to Jason Statham - the lack of any skill to develop the role of imaginary fiction ... For this reason, I vote: 3/10
