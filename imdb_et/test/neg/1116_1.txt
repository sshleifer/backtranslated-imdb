Even with the low standards of dedicated blowers, I found this movie terribly. It was a big disappointment because it was one of eight Horrorfest movies. I only hope the other seven were better. I was actually shamed for the friends I was able to convince, and these are the same friends that I watched the Wicker Man remake. It has every cliché in the book. In fact, it went on its way to involve them. Let's start with characters. Instead of one young woman in distress, we get three: single, hot mom with two daughters? A flourishing but meaningless teenager and a cute but creepy little girl you just know is a "special" skill, including supernatural knowledge and the ability to communicate with dead people. The little girl is the same as in the remake of Amityville's horror. He was a bit annoying, but not nearly as irritating as Dakota Fanning. <br /> <br /> In general, these characters seemed to escape the LifeTime movie. I thought, although the horror films had moved from scenes where female characters would go to bed and run in the dark, telling their presence to everyone who has ears but not that. I also find it unthinkable that none of them will interfere with the safe opening of the front door day and night. To give you an idea of ​​how I relate to these characters, I spent most of my time thinking about how cold it should be, because everyone was hairy even in my own houses and how white teeth were. /> <br /> Despite all the schematic diagrams, the film doesn't build any kind of relationship unless you know when it will end. The local G60 has more atmosphere at midday midday. As far as dialogue is concerned, I could have tried to quote quotes from ten other films and rumble with a better, more credible discourse. Gore level, eye candy for the horror blower, was at best minimal. Without these small weapons, "zombies" were not dangerous at all. Probably you can drop a couple of them. <br /> <br /> What really kills is its banality. Fear films, more than any other genre, cannot survive in the middle of the environment. Give me a horror movie that is comically intuitive or overwhelmingly up together. I can even bring new things to the cause of my torture. At any time, I appreciate the truly frightening, everything other than that.
