In fact, I'm not talking about the main plot in this comment, but with only 2-3 sentences I get it as a spoiler. OK here they are - <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is just 85% conversion from Hollywood from Cellular to Bollywood using the software Vikram Bhatt. The title does not match the story, but it goes towards the thriller. That's it !! It does not deserve even a single-letter imitation, imperfect casting, bad standard and predictable story. Undoubtedly, I can now say that Viram Bhatt is losing his director's status slowly because no mature audience evaluates his recent works, including that. Next to him, Aftab saw Shivdasan's prospects as a comic book comic. Who knows how long he's going to stay in the film industry? Occasionally, the standard of performances and cinematography is lower than the C-Class. But the most supportive role was played by Zayed Khan, which was somewhat identical to Chris Evan's role in Cellular. The innocent face of Sanjay Sur has no contribution to the film because it has nothing to impress. That's why I want those who have already watched Cellular never want to waste that time again.
