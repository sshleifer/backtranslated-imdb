I rented this movie from a local library without any prior knowledge of this book, based on this book or film, based solely on the possibility that it is one of those rare, neglected gems that can be occasionally discovered and truly enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is not one of those movies. I'm not sure whether it is sentimental or worse, deliberate, but some of its elements made it impossible to dive. It should represent a struggling community of migrant workers trying to cope with the difficult realities of their lives. This is a good prerequisite and it could have captured the story, but the execution made me alternate and amused for its ridicule. <br /> <br /> Here we have a simple community of farm workers who migrated to the United States to look for a job and who repeatedly use white and white men. And when I say evil - I mean EVIL. All the white people in this film are sinners, racist, sadistic, abusive devils whose sole purpose in life is the sexual mismatch that is embedded in the exploitation of poor immigrants. It would be a sad story if it were not so inadvertently grotesque and therefore fun. <br /> <br /> Imagining immigrants is also a worthy example of exaggeration, except that it goes in the opposite direction. Immigrants are holy, clean, and could be a sage boo-boos and around the world. I couldn't laugh when I saw those "farm workers" who probably dug in the ditch all day with their notoriously clean clothes and the haircut on the raised hair art. A little restraint and a more unbiased hand on the steering wheel could have made it a much better film that would create some of the planned emotions rather than the sarcastic snickers.
