I'm the animator myself and the whole media outlet, so when I saw this movie on the $ 5 bin, I thought it was worth adding to my picture. Although I do not regret having a new attachment to my animation book, this movie was definitely disappointing. <br /> <br /> There is enough potential for the assumption. The penguin named Hubie finds the perfect pod, which she gives to the girl she loves as a penguin, which is equal to the engagement ring, but before she can give it, she is cast by the evil rival and lost at sea. He then communicates with another penguin who helps him find his way home. It's not great, but it's enough to create a fun adventure. Unfortunately, duo uses are never really big and everything gets quite repetitive. Most of the situations in which they find themselves are really endless and lack of creativity ... and bonding the two is exciting and forced. <br /> <br /> Animation is good, but not Don Bluth's usual standards. This is the man who gave us the secret of Nimhi, the Earth before the time and the American story, all of which had paid attention to details that often surpassed Disney's grandfather of feature films. This does not mean much more than the integrity of high-end television. <br /> <br /> Music is fine, but pretty forgetful and voice-minded people are all lost talent ... Martin Short is here with a leading character. who, despite speaking as a worshiper, is a virtually straight person throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is obviously very attractive to very young children, but a good family film should turn to all ages and unfortunately it didn't get what it takes.
