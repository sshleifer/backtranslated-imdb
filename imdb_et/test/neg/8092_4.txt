Just then. This movie is totally inconvenient for the drummer, the gags of other films, the songs from other films (Blink 182's "Mutt", Grand Theft Audio "We Luv U"), the unlikely leading man, the ridiculous plot and flat parody movies like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty . Redeeming features? Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly. That's enough.
