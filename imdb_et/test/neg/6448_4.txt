Amanda Bynes is an enormously talented actor and I have really enjoyed all my roles in the past, especially in the fantastic "She's Man". For that reason alone, "Sydney White" was a great disappointment for me. The real reason why I don't like my movie is bad use of characters. In a very fun teen comedy, it's perfectly good to have all the pretty realistic teen characters. In Sydney White, this idea is thrown out of the window. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes makes a fine for Sydney, but she really has a lot of drawbacks that usually make her shine as an actor. I blame it on a script that makes her character too sharp and restrained, and a hair / make-up department that gives her a despicable plastic look and a tedious hair style. The seven "dorks" that Sydney finally faces are much worse. They are so inconvenient that it is impossible to love them or even respect them as a character. They are basically repelling gag-feeds. As well as the story of "Prince Charming", who is characteristically incredible and about as cheesy as possible. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest star-to-be (possibly with the exception of Amanda Bynes) is Sara Paxton, who is really good when Rachel Witchburn. It's just a shame that script writers didn't make him a little more gray than black. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically 'Snow White'. What kills is that it is too dull and obvious transformation. The "snow-white" connections are thrown to us as much throughout the film as they are finally irritating and overwhelming. Prince Charming is unrealistic charm, "witch" is too despicable witchcraft, seven "dorks" are too dorky and Sydney is just too clean. Now it doesn't mean that the movie is all bad. Although Bynes is forced by the script, he still has moments. Like Sara Paxton, who brings to her scenes maximum physical comedy. Sydney room mates, called "Dinky", are also very fun. This is somewhat funny in parts of the movie that are ultimately just too cheesy and desirable.
