From time to time, the indie, who has a fantastic cast and story that sounds really interesting and unable to ignore, but the film sucks. Some recent films in this regrettable category are "Levity" and "Object Safety", and now "Leland United States". <br /> <br /> Said awesome cast by Ryan Gosling, Kevin Spacey, Don Cheadle, Jena Malone, Lena Olin, Michelle Williams, Chris Klein and Kerry Washington. Gosling plays the son of the famous author (Spacey), Leland P. Fitzgerald, who commits a disturbing and unforgiving crime (child of a child in murder) but does not remember it and does not seem to be a motive. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle plays a teacher in the Juvenile Hall who tries to understand Leland (and take advantage of it by writing a book) and Jena Malone is her former girlfriend. We see their deteriorating relationship (due to its heroin addiction) in rebounds. Looks like a fantastic little drama? I thought that too. The fact is that this movie is just badly written. Dialogue and narration are painfully pretentious and burdened by "life" with irritating spreads, all characters are two-dimensional indie clich√©s, and although he can make some sense of compassion for Leland, it shines over his crime. <br /> <br /> Usually there are no problems with operation. Gosling (who was "worthy of Oscar worth" in believers) is a tremendously talented young actor, but as they are written, none of these characters (the least Leland) knows even real people, so he can't do much, but grandma your ridiculous features and see sad. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone is the most memorable one. He has one of the most obvious faces I've ever seen. Even if he plays such a bad movie signed character, he can break his heart with one glance. If he has good material to work with (like "Donnie Darko" or "Dangerous Life Altar Boys"), he is really amazing. But this is not a good material. Maybe after a huge rewrite, something could have been worth it, but, as it is, "Leland United States" is pointless, inert, and for a movie that seems to be in love when "deep" is really low.
