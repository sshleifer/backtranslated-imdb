Yes, this strange feature is written by John Sayles. In the city of Toronto, this is another concept of the 1980s, the city jungle, where the police are afraid to go and homeless and criminal classes are the only inhabitants. This is a mixture of the myth of Wild Thing, a young lady raised by a lady after a murder of her parents, by a dirty policeman (Maury Chaykin) and Chopper, a local criminal (Robert Davi). Mix local do-gooders (priest Sean Hewitt and helpless social worker Kathleen Quinlan) and you have a recipe for some rather unmistakable sequences of action. Davi is a lover and Rene Verzier is doing a good job. Otherwise, it is a pretty lumpen action pic that doesn't match the action fans and leaves the jaws to Sayles' admirers.
