I don't recommend watching this movie. This is a movie that is filmed without being played between actors and actors. The sex scene at the end of the movie explaining the actor's reluctance (played in the movie) to act as an actor (played in the film) is a dark repetition of the same scene Breillatis movie Fat Girl. Everything that was played there with more delicacy than you can add to the delicacy for the sex that works like that. A typical French expression of comedy in sex is Oh la la! Breillat's Brief Crossing also has a sensitivity. Sex is a comedy that I don't see in real sensitivity, and the clear graph of the film is not designed to have a pretty loose story with an end to disappointment.
