It is so depressing when filmmakers try to be cool and here is so obvious. It has below-average, ridiculous dialogue, shared screens that are hard to watch, and many tombs that have been trying to be a time film and autobiographical. This movie should be avoided at all costs. I was told not to see this movie. I wish I had listened.
