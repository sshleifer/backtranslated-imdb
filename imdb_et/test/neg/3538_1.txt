The only reason I saw this movie was that he had Giovanni Ribisi and it was supposed to be "Horror". Don't be fooled, this movie must be the worst "horror movie" I've ever seen. This is about the people who go to a secret place with this "Monster". A monster is a man with a deformed face that runs around a blue sweat pants with a craving for the brain. Some people die, some people don't. Finally, they throw the monster out of the plane and then fly away happily. IF NOT! MONSTER AFTER PLANNING AFTER PLANNING! Go spend 2 hours in other ways like drying the paint on the wall, trust me, it's more fun than that.
