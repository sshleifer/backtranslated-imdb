The heart of darkness, the short novel written by Joseph Conrad of greed, corruption and traveling to Africa, was at least an annoying reading. The narrator follows Marlow, a sailor sailing deep into Africa to rescue Kurtz, a somewhat cozy ivory trader who allegedly went crazy, this conclusion came when Ivory Coast stopped at the main port. This story is based on Conrad, who writes about the surrounding taste, he puts the scene in a wonderful way, but maybe a little broader. The story seemed like a watercolor painting, as it was added to the slow mourning soft action Conrad had to put forward. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, after reading a book, you may be looking at this feature to help bring some ideas into line with the book or vice versa. Not with the heart of darkness, even with the supportive role of John Malkovich, the masterpiece of the masterpiece, I was more confused, there were no real main characters in the film, no one was left with others, and no extensive symbolism was explained. It was rather gentle and drudging to say the least. <br /> <br /> First of all, respect the author, The Heart of Darkness is a real short novel of the novel, it touches on some very serious topics, Marlow's lies. and Kurtz's greed. It's not a book that needs to be taken lightly, and it puts you in a rather strange mood. Such a book that I feel can be difficult for many people. However, I recommend this book to those who desire a sad pseudo-action story without the happy end of the textbook.
