In the 1950s, gay photographer Bob Mizer (Daniel MacIvor) established a male model agency that released the "Physique Pictorial" and men's men's magazines, and many of these models became prostitutes. "Beefcake" shows the rise and fall of this pervert. <br /> <br /> The 50's intermittent film material, the multi-model testimony and Bob Mizer himself today, director Thom Fitzgerald used this downhill to show nude men and a lot of penis along the 93-minute ride, in complete bad taste and very stupid . I've never heard anything about this morally corrupt Bob Mizer and I don't know what AMG is. In my opinion, this boring and pretentious film can only hear gay and very specific audiences. My voice is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carne Fresca" ("Fresh Meat")
