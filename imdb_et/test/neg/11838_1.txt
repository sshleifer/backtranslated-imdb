This movie didn't even deserve 1/10 This movie was a scam. <br /> <br /> I swear that for at least 30 minutes the movie was first copied to Carnosaur 1, 2 and 3.The entire movie "Raptor" was based on a movie and it was really a pathetic attempt to be a "thriller, action packed, dinosaur" copy. I loved this movie series and see that it is put on a movie that can't even afford or ready for COPY without making models there, what America is coming up with. I suggest you see the Carnosaur movie FIRST (all) and watch it, and you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Spencer
