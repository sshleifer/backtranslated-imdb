I had a great hope of walking into this movie. After all, Ocean 11 was a really great Hollywood product. With this quick fire jokes, incredible star power and a tight script, this is one of the most fun caper movies I've ever seen. Of course, all the money was done on the road and I was excited about it. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I was completely out of this movie. Runaway, when terribly wrong things can go. This movie had everything to do; cast the entire original, return the same director, news about curious and off-set antiques. How could this have been wrong? <br /> <br /> It starts immediately with one of the most uncomfortable and unnecessary opening sequences and goes down there. After a reasonably short scene between Pitt / Zeta-Jones and Clooney / Roberts, the film spends several minutes watching the scene of Andy Garcia's scene from scene to scene, telling each member of Danny Ocean that he wants his money back. Believe me when I say that these scenes are just here to run Andy Garcia's working time, because without their ridiculously uncomfortable shots, his screen would take five minutes. <br /> <br /> I had this movie. Stimulation is so inconsistent that characters have been completely dropped from the story and only sometimes later returned. The Bernie Mac sign drops the script early and never comes back, except for two short scenes with no dialog. Garcia appears in the first few minutes and finally returns to a very short scene. Roberts appears in the beginning for about 5 minutes and is not even mentioned until about 20-25 minutes. Even Clooney himself spends a large part of the film in prison. <br /> <br /> All this would be excusable if the movie was funny. Overall. 90% of the jokes are completely flat and those who do the job are best at crying. "The plot" is indisputably worthless and left me deceived. At one point in the movie, the team will work for $ 2.5 million from almost $ 100 million, which they need before Garcia's two-week deadline. Many characters even recognize how absurd it is to spend time doing this job, but they still do it! The film, which lasted more than 30 minutes, revolves around the work they shouldn't even do, and it feels like this part of the plot was just added to working time. In addition, the equipment they use to pay for this work out of CLEARLY is funded by millions. Wait until you see what they are doing and understand that it would cost much more than $ 2.5 million. Obviously, in order to make money, they have to take away several jobs. The beauty of the first movie was one big and how brilliant and complicated it was pulled out. Here they draw so many jobs in so many different ways that they hurry all of them, because explaining them would make the film long hours. We all know that entering this movie is a big twist at the end. So the essence of capricorn is. Twisting the twelfth end of the ocean made me laugh; not because it was funny, but because I couldn't believe how I felt the fraud. I'm not giving it away because I know most of you are stupid enough to throw money down to still see this movie. <br /> <br /> I say it does most of the 2 hours you've been sitting in a completely irrelevant way. <br /> <br /> I was delighted to see this movie, being absolutely respectful of the ocean 11. I left the theater, as I had been a really big con conquered by this film team, trying to think that this movie would actually be worth. I've never given IMDb.com movie 1, but for the first time. Think of warning yourself ... 1/10
