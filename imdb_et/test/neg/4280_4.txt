Like an avid Disney fan, this movie wasn't very impressed, certainly not motivated enough to catch it in theaters. However, I'm so glad I got it on the DVD and looked at the special features. <br /> <br /> You have to check "Moose Comment": the whole movie can be viewed with comments from Rutt and Tuke. Create a comic relief expressed by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas. Two famous Second City comedy troupe veteran ad-lib-in-character - one and a half hours of the movie they clearly love. I laughed all the time. The joy of this comment was entirely related to the cold reaction to the film itself. Do yourself a favor and listen to it!
