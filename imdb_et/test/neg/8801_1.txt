I don't understand how some people can play "Half-Life: Counter-Strike" when there are so many better first-person shooting games. <br /> <br /> "Counter-Strike" is a game that does not use any creative ideas for its weapons. All the weapons in the game are real weapons, but it could have been at least a scam that allowed players to use a "supernatural" weapon, like the omnipotent BFG Quake & Doom games. <Br / Another problem is that the player has to reload the weapon manually. It can become extremely annoying, especially when in the middle of a fire when you're so close to killing an enemy. The delay in reloading also gives the feeling that the weapon is slow in performing its task. <br /> <br /> There are not many choices available. When I remember correctly, there are four types of signs for terrorists and counter-terrorism forces. This means that many characters look like each other, which really reduces reality in the game. <br /> <br /> The game is quite sexist when it comes to character selection. In the early version of Counter-Strike, she had a choice (in the choice of Terrorist forces) that was good for female players. In the latter versions, however, the female character was deleted and replaced by another male. Interestingly, the women who played the game were disappointed by the latest versions. <br /> <br /> Finally, the game cards are very small. The biggest card seems to be a desert map, but it has a standard detail. In fact, all game cards have normal graphics. In other words, something new. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think "Half-Life: Counter-Strike" is the most creative first-person shooting game ever. There are many better and more imaginative shooting games to play, so why waste your time on this boring game? You better play Unreal Tournament, Quake and Doom games. Avoid this overpriced and over-jumped game. <br /> <br /> I'll give the game 1/10.
