The monster looks very familiar to you. So the rest of the movie, if you've seen half a dozen young people in movies. Okay, so they're not teenagers this time, but they can also be. Three pairs decide that it might be a good idea to look at an almost abandoned ghost town, hopefully finding the gold that people were killed somewhat a century and a half ago. You think some interesting things might happen with the title "Miner's Massacre". They are not. In fact, only about 1/10 of the film takes place in the mine. I had anticipated the terrible miners' teams who despise their lives for the innocence of their jobs, praying that Black Lung Disease would get them before The Grim Reaper demanded his terrible revenge, but I got a twenty-year-old whore, and one case of afforestation The collective IQ moron gang would have difficulty pulling the Cracker Jacks box out of a plastic ring, a lot of abandoned treasure from an abandoned mine. There's no intercourse, fear, and a few embarrassing performances. No one forgot to tell the writers that "Fool's Gold" refers to the reality of gold, not to the people who are looking for it. 3/10
