Last night I went to my cousin screening for Badland. We were very excited to learn when we got there, the director / writer, the producer (his wife) and several cast members were present, and that after the film there was a discussion and Q&A. and the movie wasn't changed well and it's too long), my cousin and I got up and left without consulting each other. We discovered when we started talking outside that we both felt so angry that we didn't just want to stay in the discussion, but we couldn't even look at the cast and the team who were near the exit and who we went right as we left. <br /> <br /> I thought the roots of my anger were planted in a scene when Jerry refers to his daughter Celina's palm with a big knife so that his blood can be used for a fake trail. It was inevitable to associate in my mind the physical pain he caused to his body with the emotional pain he caused to his spirit, murdering his mother and two brothers in his presence, saving him and taking him with him. I've sliced ​​my palm in advance (accidentally); even a rather superficial cut is incredibly painful because the palm is so sensitive, and it is very slow to heal if you don't keep it motionless because you just open it by trying to go your life. But after a very short time, when only a narrow strip of cloth was harshly tied around her palm and a big scene with a stand support, it was as if she had never been cut. My anger reached its peak - in Celina's last scene I don't break this moment - <br /> <br /> I was angry because Celina is the most sympathetic character in the movie (the actor is her good); I was ?? and you can't tell me that a good scriptwriter doesn't know that? and the scriptwriter, addressing Celina's emotional pain so insecure and disrespectful, touched me on the audience, cavalierly and total disrespect. <br /> <br /> Of course, the script has tiny moments for Celina and some dialogue that tells us that she has hurt somewhere. But by that time we will be so manipulated that we have closed. Manipulation in this film begins very early when Jerry's family dialogue reveals to the public that Jerry had psychiatric problems. Rule 1, Scriptwriters: Give your audience some credit. Let them do their creative work well. Tell the story; don't explain to us everything we should think and feel. We don't like it. <br /> <br /> My cousin also knew that he had problems with the film early, in dialogue, when Jerry and his wife talked to each other a little other than f *** that f *** that you ***. Some couples really find themselves in such a bad relationship that the f-bomb comes out of the mouth of every other word. But it is like comedies that are very passionate. Some of them are really funny; Curse is an ancillary activity. But some of them replace humor with humor, and this scriptwriter who has come to the conclusion of the metaphor is not Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> This spouse and husband team decided to bravely overcome the tricky story. characters. But they do not seem to have understood that the meaning of the story, especially of the complex, is different for every audience member. Successful storytelling requires attention to important factual details, not working desperately to interpret the meaning of the story to the whole audience. <br /> <br /> I've been working with Vietnamese veterans for five years, I've heard more stories than most, and I'm always happy to see movies that bring my stories to a wider audience. It is important to hear them at all different levels. But I'm less glad that this storyteller decided before the movie, what Jerry's story meant, and it was very difficult to write it out with us. Next time, pay more attention to detail.
