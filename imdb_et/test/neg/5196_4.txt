It must be one of the most irritating, arrogant, poster films I've ever seen. What kind of budget and waste of participants. Angelopoulos has come up with new profitability. It is clear that there is practically no plot, even if this part of Greek history is great for movies. He just thought he was thinking symbolically (actually shambolic) and built a whole movie around them. Death is the main subject and is repeated by ad nauseam with lithos, processions, etc., which should be just a film tool, but unfortunately this film itself is. Fully inconsistent result that leaves you only saying "ah?" or "oh dear" every two minutes. <br /> <br /> There is no character development, nada, zilch. I usually complain about some two-dimensional characters for films, but oh boy, he managed to create one-dimensional characters. It irritates us and lowers some participants. He was even able to make one of my favorite Greek actors, Giorgos Armenis, from wood. <br /> <br /> And going to the center of Angelopoulos movie making: No, we're not idiots. We don't want to chew food. Please someone says this guy's insignia must be subtle. Do you really underestimate your audience or are you just incompetent? Personally, I think he tried to create the Greek "Underground". No matter how he tries, he can't get to Kusturica. <br /> <br /> Only sustainable arm: photography, costumes and music.
