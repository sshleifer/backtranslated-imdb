Much of the comments on this table revolve around the validity of the comparison with the R DOGS on the DVD cover. Forget it all ... This movie-- er-- home movie is absolutely terrible. How can someone with credibility claim that it is 10/10 ?? No plot, no. I couldn't believe I spent money on renting it (more on that later) and that I was deceiving myself believing that it had a potential (box cover and a certain film festival). The only thing I really remember was that, unbelievably, one of the tedious main characters was supposed to be in the head, and he was able to survive the wound and ultimately in life. Wow. And apparently, Killers has a sequel. Actual story - I actually denied so much that I was wasting my money and vitality at the time of renting because I kept a video tape for what has been six months. I told myself that it didn't really happen. The video on the TV was an illusion - the spiritual symbol of my self-expression. If someone said that this is really real and I have to grab it, I decided I couldn't just leave it. I thought, "How many others have I denied suffering from watching this masterpiece by killing the killers themselves?" I had to do the right thing and return the hell it came from. So, as I imagine that most of the IMDb people would be in the same situation, I have to go up with greater courage and traveled to a video store ... at 2AM. After being convinced that nobody was around, I got out of my car (I was still running of course), slid the film into the droplet slot, and booked hell back from there. <br /> <br /> I think I expected some of the ghosts from Hollywood video companies to search for me ($ 1,238.67 by then) so I went away from the region. But by chance, like the Killers story, nothing has ever happened.
