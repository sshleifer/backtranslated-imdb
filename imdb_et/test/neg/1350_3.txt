I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's something I haven't done because I've never slept in movies. <br /> <br /> I love the original and have seen it many times and recommended it to everyone. This may be a problem, but I don't think so because there were a few bright spots that showed they'd done the right thing. <br /> <br /> Bette was under-used and Anne was finished <br /> <br /> I don't know why this English or anyone else will not let it in this situation. <br /> <br /> They did it as Sex in the City, but better? Not the chance that I liked Sex in the City and cheated this movie. <br /> <br /> So don't waste your money on this movie - go see something, but do it!
