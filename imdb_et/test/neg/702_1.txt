This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, don't look at it even if your life depends on it. hang. Incredibly boring film, not nearly funny. <br /> <br /> This was the last Laurel and Hardy movie, and this is a very small remark to end such a great career. The 40's were not great, this film was made in 1950. If you want to remember Laurel and Hardy, remember them in your 1930s. Short films are better than full-length movies, my favorite is "Me and my pal". Another reason why this movie is terrible is that it is dubbed. The actress opens her mouth and the words come out three days later. Absoulutley's crap, but we'd end up with a high star, Laurel and Hardy, I think, was the best double action.
