I'm a big fan of the first Critter movie. The second episode is good, but it's not as good as the first Critters. The third episode is a bit boring but cute. And what is it? What the hell! It's stupid and really boring. This is the worst of the series. I can't look at it again because I first felt asleep. And Ugi's evil side ... eeewww ... this is one of the most terrible moments of the movie. In the first 50 minutes, we see little, furry monsters, which is why the audience fell asleep at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> It could have been much better. <Br /> <br /> 2/10
