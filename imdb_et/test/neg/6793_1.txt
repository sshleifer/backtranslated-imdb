This exhibition is the worst show! Norris and his family write it, produce it, direct it, etc. etc. The only reason I ever see it is that my joke woman likes it. How many times can Norris fly if the air is normal to land in an obviously dark cable? There are no trees, no building, just ..... thin air. He always solves the case or is best at any skill. No letters will ever be honored. Its all Norris. It's really obvious that Norris is terribly intrusive and doesn't allow anyone in one scene, no matter what content. Terrible action, terrible script, terrible series.
