I bought this rental back for $ 1.99 in Hollywood and overpayed. I didn't expect much, but I thought it would be something to sleep at least. I quickly noticed a very weak scenario, everyone's general misconduct (no one talks about it except cartoons), and a seemingly strike-su-up-as-we-go-along. I know that the participants in this confusion must feel very embarrassed and I am sure that it will not help a career. As in the case of the 35-year-old film buffer, it is now ready to answer the worst movie-ever seen question. <br /> <br />
