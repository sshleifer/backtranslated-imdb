This movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life! I'm wasting that time. I was watching this movie completely when I was punished for that. I don't know how Suneel Darshan could make such a movie? it has no continent. It looks like he just takes scenes and joined them in some editing program !!! The music is good, of course, but the movie doesn't need so many unwanted songs. Kangana Ranaut looks fake and I don't know what role Celina Jaietly plays in the movie? Bobby deol is good. at least he can act! Upen Patel needs action lessons rather than shirts in almost every scene! The end was the most pathetic! <br /> <br /> I looked at Shakalaka Boom Boom after watching the "300" movie so you can really imagine what I know about this Bollywood movie. <br /> <br /> I really respect Bollywood, but please the executives and manufacturers to be real, not all fantasy!
