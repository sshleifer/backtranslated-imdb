The net is a film I didn't see at liberation, I remember giving it mediocre reviews and since then it has been here and there, when it has been on television, noticing. Seeing it now, fourteen years after its initial publication, I am a little buggy about how time flies. Being in the middle of my 20s, it felt my childhood's ancient feelings. I felt like I'd probably be accustomed before my body began to pack fat in all the wrong places. Reduce fat and sugar. Too much coffee and cigarettes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was the best part of the film experience for me. I'd say that for the first 30 minutes of this movie, I was held in a busy retro sky. Look at those big cans that they call computers. Look, they chat in chat rooms! I remember those tank heads! They look ... stupid. And hey, it even marks Sandra Bullock. First Bill! Would you look at it. <br /> <br /> Like the movie, Net is just an unimaginable, normal and completely routine Hitchock cat-mouse thriller. Nothing archaic about this, they did as much as they do now. Bullock plays reclusive computer nerd, who has the task of assigning software to people who cannot "get the whole computer thing". As it happens, he stumbles over some delicate information and after the end of his holiday trip, when he almost kills a sexy guy who turns out to be a killer (played by Jeremy Northam, and he should have suspected that they are in American film and the man smokes and is British accent) !) He can wipe his "identity". His house is empty for sale, and checking it reveals that he now has a new identity. Convicted prostitute and fraudster, not less. <br /> <br /> Now you can say it's unlikely. How could they do it to him? Even in 1995, it's impossible! It's true, but back in the '95, many people didn't even know what the Internet was. I can see how this is the hole in the plot that you could have accepted. But what is much more catastrophic is the contradictions that are not related to technology. The film probably owes much to Hitchcock films (one of those thrillers with a nightclub), but Hitchcock is always convinced that his films are plausible. The characters did not work in the confused maniac when they tried to prove their innocence, and the plot did not fit well for a structure where one obstacle inevitably leads to another. The characters also tried a bit before the whole rouge. Is Bullock's character really not friends, what is it ever like? Were no old high school teachers able to confirm their identity? Or like ... his closest pizza boy? Oh, he orders a seal online. Do not mind. You're drawing a movie pretty quickly. There seems to be hope in the former boyfriend. You really think? You should always consider at least one surprise. Net offers none. <br /> <br /> The Internet is a big threat, this movie seems to be predicting. But if the film was made today, imagine what the problems have to go through the bad ones to wipe out the identity. Not only do they have to do all the boring things to have their own Facebook member, with at least 100 friends or so, and pictures, not to mention that he may be on YouTube or linked to his video blog like 150 daily hits or his webcams and his videos on other people's cell phones, webcams, web downloads ... his IMDb membership?
