I just saw a terrible movie called Sleeping Dictionary. One "Four Word Film Review" (www.fwfr.com) reviewer was right when he wrote: "From A to Zzzzzzzzzi." The story relates to the English colonial jerk that comes to Malaysia to "civilize the savage" so that it speaks and fall in love with your sleeping language. A sleeping vocabulary is a native English-speaking native prostitute who serves English-speaking colonists and teaches them in their mother tongue in return ... well the film does not really make it clear, but I can only assume that he is giving his money or something. Needless to say, the film focuses much more on the "sleeping" part than the "dictionary" of the job description. The complicated things of our young hero become complicated when the forbidden love affair changes with his culture, his domestic soap opera, and his infinite foolishness in all the decisions made in the film. <br /> <br /> So, yes, the film has some major drawbacks, but on the other hand it gave exactly two things that I rented it for the first time: a beautifully photographed exotic location and a more beautifully photographed and exotic woman playing a sleeping book, Jessica Alba. My friend told me that this ugly film was her most beautiful and she was right. She's not a big actor and she doesn't go well to Malaysia and it's obvious they're using nudity twice, but who cares? Jessica Albal is this rare face and figure that is more than just sexy, but also beautiful, with Vivaldi's violin concert or Rembrandt's painting. <br /> <br /> (PS Sorry to all of your feminists who don't care about women, "men's gaze, etc." but I hope you understand that I don't understand any disrespect.)
