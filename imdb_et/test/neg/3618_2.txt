I usually like movies about animals or reptiles who turn to old people threatening the environment, but I have to say that Snake Island was in great decline. <br /> <br /> The assumption is interesting, a group of people, including the writer William Katt played, goes to the island called duh, you thought it was "Snake Island" and left what the island lives by its name. This is one thing I give to this movie, there are snakes, lots and lots of all sorts and sizes of snakes. So part of the movie fairly lives up to its name, but writing, acting and directing are SOOOOOOOO flat, it's almost painful to sit. <br /> <br /> The characters are so unlikely that I asked the snakes to stop these terrible people from putting us all out of our misery. There are a couple of scenes that are so surreal and ridiculous that they are believed to be plausible - snakes that sparkle truly terrifying disco-music, while 2 women dance together in the workshops and the scene with a snake with some dialogue with one actor is absurd . I think the writer was trying to be funny, but it just came out like a weird LSD trip ... <br /> <br /> I remember William Katt a year ago when he was playing "Carrie" which hack he was it was ... that he was never a big star, but it was reduced to that rubbish, I know him. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like a plague if you are not really in the movies with lots of snakes and really terrible people.
