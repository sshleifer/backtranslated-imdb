I grew up in the 90s; that is why you must understand that for the first time I saw the premiere of the biggest DCOMs. I was there when Brink! appeared, Zenon, Halloweentown, Johnny Tsunami, etc. These films are my childhood. If these films came, not just me, but whoever I watched, would stand for 1h30 completely frightening, talking about the week that will arrive and next weekend again. I don't think the words could excite Zoog Disney. <br /> <br /> Even if I look at them now, this dialogue does not seem to be so bad (so effective actually that I actually remember a word that is literally a word about movies I saw more than a decade ago) . The characters are plausible, funny, they have a small stereotype, but it does make Disney's charm ... <br /> <br /> I sat down in my little brother Disney channel to try and understand my feelings for DCOMs. Enter Stuck in the suburbs ... my brother looked at me a little confused, asking if I had always been gay. I feel more frustrated and betrayed than what I could compare? When Han Solo found that Lando sold him out to Vader ... <br /> <br /> Half of the movie and I'm not exaggerating is a setback. In these young participants (some of whom are older than me) there is no talent. The plot is ridiculous; it seems that the old rotten corporate people sat at the table, asking themselves, "How do we see the hip in the young?" OK, maybe all the DCOMs were like that, but they made little effort to not realize that they think we are totally idiots. <br /> <br /> And apparently this type of film ... Nearly as much in the neighborhood as Zenon or Airborne. How is it possible? DCOMs even got cheesers and people prefer them now? (though apparently it is enough for some people to give this lack of words) Christ, this is a completely different generation.
