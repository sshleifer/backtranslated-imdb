Although it would be easy and accurate to go for the reason why "Reba" is in its heart, which refers to many "family-oriented sitcoms", how it pulls out of other better knitters, the real truth is that the show is repetitive, full of more fun and breakthrough exhibitions. is completely out of his element. Although I am sure that Mrs McIntire can sing and has a fan base that supports being a sitcom, shooting zingers and calling her to the next Lucille ball, it is far from reality. <br /> <br /> Reba itself does not have the presence necessary to prove that she is cast on a woman whose entire family is in the middle. But after watching some episodes, there is no real connection with the character. I could take less care of my adventures because his whole character seems to be MIA. Reba McIntir has no screen presence and looks very short-sighted to show her around and shows most of the "family-oriented" programming: push men-fool / women-all stereotypes that don't like anyone but those who can't afford the cable. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is a waste of time. The only good thing is that it is at least better than the usual PAX ripoff.
