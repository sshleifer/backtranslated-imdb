This movie Oh my God, this movie is so poor, I'm surprised I managed to see it all. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that Vinny Jones should only play London's End of the End, which is the end of the story. <br /> <br /> Pisttolero is so incredible with its almost comedy. Beating the Dennis bunker and David Carradine did not record this movie .. actually I think it's a comedy and comedy deserves this one star. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs .. Vinny Oh my god , I thought I saw all this while playing this Irish Tinker: P <br /> <br /> I think the average viewer understands that this movie is perhaps never a movie type. I don't see how anyone could hold that mess
