This film is sometimes a wild comedy of 80s college sex comedy, other sweet romantic ... Then they have moments of serious drama and then sprinkled in scientific dashes ... It's as unequal as it is almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But I would bother as one of the worst films I've ever seen, except, of course, that they poured Peter O'Toole. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to work for him here. Poor dialogue, bad performance to work, poor everything ... And yet he's fantastic ... There's not one good thing about him, but he's doing it only if he's just pure charm. <br /> <br /> The fact that he was so little so little to emphasize how many others did not succeed in this film, making it even worse when I think it really is ... < br /> <br /> If another actor was in the role of O'Toole, I would have forgotten this movie and never thought about it, but Peter O'Toole's subtle performance despite all the coefficients ensures that I remember this movie for a long time to come ... If only the film could have been good if someone who participated in it was almost half as good as Peter O'Toole.
