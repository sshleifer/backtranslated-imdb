Okay, when I bought this flick, it must be the final b-movie, a monkey in space that lands on Earth and starts killing people right away! Well, it was almost all I expected, a typical low-budget sci-fi movie from the 60s. Action must be the worst I've ever seen, especially a girl who plays a leading role and a girl who played a waitress made me laugh at my ass. <br /> <br /> So why isn't "Night Fright" in the category "so bad that it's good"? The reason some scenes were just too long and boring. For example, a scene where police officers are looking for clues in the forest was just a few minutes walk without a goal. And then in the grand finale, people are waiting for the monster for about 5 minutes and if the space monkey seems to be getting in twenty seconds, the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, 'Night Fright' is boring, but it got a few funny moments. I can recommend this movie to anyone who liked movies like "Zontar, Venus Venus" or "Swarm of Curse". <br /> <br /> I'll give 'Night Fright' 4 Space Monkey 10. . <br /> <br />
