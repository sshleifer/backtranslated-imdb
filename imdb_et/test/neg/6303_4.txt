Shaggy, a friendly, but depressing film is the same old message: if you want to do it in this world because your imagination is not enough, you have to live in your place in society and that means living under (heterosexual) rules to rule us. The royal comedy drama from Australia is mostly a cheerful trip from three men traveling through Outback to their pink bus, baptized into Priscilla. Although it is not a formula film in itself, there are mandatory "road-image" sequences (gluing with fires, downs, etc.). Writer-director Stephan Elliott follows every potentially meaningful moment with small humor and compassion, but there are amazing loopholes in his narrative, the relationship between the fear of the geihe of his former wife and the pre-sons of his ex-wife (both with whom he is comfortable - and the child wise - with his lifestyle) and the third it is without energy. It has some malevolent transvestites humor and pretty games, but a script that seems to miss the way. ** from ***
