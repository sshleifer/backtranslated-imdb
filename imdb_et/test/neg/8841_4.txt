Obabakoak is a series of short stories with the only common point: the small Vasque town of Obaba. In this film, the director tries to explain some of these stories using a young reporter. The result is a strange movie because it has any major character (the film spends about 20 minutes each time) after Obaba. Any story is really well explained and the fact is that they are very boring. It was the best film of the year in Spain, but that doesn't mean too much. The only good thing about the film is valuable scenarios. It's filmed in a very valuable valley and it's more fun to spend time looking at the scenario, not the story.
