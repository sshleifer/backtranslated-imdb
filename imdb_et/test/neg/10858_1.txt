Writer / Actor / Director Larry Bishop focuses too much on camera, music and visual images. The film hides nonsense ramblings and vulgar monologues that seem to have any purpose other than boring and irritating audiences. Actors are experiencing a troublesome ride, from the beginning to the end of the movie, and are caught with a dreadful smoke screen. Hell with driving. The movie is a bomb. <br /> <br /> Victims are presented as frustrated vigilants seeking their justice for what they see as lawless. They are cyclists, heroes and protagonists. Pistolero, played by Larry Bishop, is the revengeful leader of the pack. Gent (Michael Madsen) is trapped in his chaos and psychosis. <br /> <br /> Comanche (Eric Balfour) is loyal but mysterious. Deuce, which was directed by David Carradine, should have passed the ride, and so should the buyers of the tickets (if you decide to see the movie, sorry, but you can find out why). Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) is a lewd and poisonous character that is full of contempt. <br /> <br /> What makes me think about puzzles is how this film, which has all its constant shocks and vulgarity, will ever invest in anyone. a ride that absolutely goes somewhere. Ticket Buyers, Take My Advice: Don't Pay For Driving. Please do not make the same mistake as investors. <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes of the movie are confusing and incomprehensible. A dialogue that quickly becomes a meaningless monologue makes no sense. The whole movie is a devil that has bowed down. Poor Dennis Hopper is caught in the midst of a real confusion. He should also have passed the ride. There are decapitated heads, truncated throat and wrestling of a naked woman. It is clear that the bishop does not know where he goes with the film. He's completely lost. But by the end of the ride you just don't give up fucking. Mama Mia! Stay home. And under no circumstances do not drive. I appreciate this movie from 10 out of 10, but this movie is so terrible that it deserves zero.
