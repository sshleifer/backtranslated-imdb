Yesterday was one of those days when we decided to go to the movies. We chose "Ik ook van Jou" more or less randomly, but we were interested to see the current Dutch film production. <br /> <br /> The film is based on Ronald Giphart's book and I must admit immediately that he is not exactly one of my favorites. The film features actors best known in the Netherlands for performing in soap operas and / or talking about the afternoon. At least one of them (Kamerling) has done quite decent things after leaving the soap world. So we decided to question this movie. <br /> <br /> And what was wrong. This movie doesn't work on all fronts. Bad Behavior (The best result is actually a guinea pig, which claims very convincingly that he is dead). Flat, uninteresting story with inexplicable and uninteresting aspects (Why France? Why talk to a woman from Uganda?) Mistakes (black people do not have to use sunscreen when I know, and heating systems in the Netherlands do not produce clouds like New York, even if it looks good for the film, people in northern Europe do not wear T-shirts on the eve of new years. There is one funny moment that involves two small dogs, and that is the case. <br /> <br /> So I think, but more importantly, it seemed I heard one of them saying he was extremely disappointed because he liked the book so much, I didn't read the book, but my advice should be: reading a book, not seeing a movie.
