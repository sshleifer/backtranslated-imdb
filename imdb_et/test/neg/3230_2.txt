okay, my question; who is the idiot who wrote this movie, giving it the same name as Dean Koontz's fantastic book? its terrible, something like a book ... you have a dog and an observer, but the similarities end ... may be good if you haven't read the book ... but it deceived me, but. <br /> <br /> They should make a new one and let koontz write it ... now that it would be a good movie ... I'll say it again, this movie was angry with me ... absolutely disgusting to me. it was terrible, it wasn't like a book. I'd never see it again.
