I was hoping that it would be Das Boot's caliber and reflected the creative realism created by German director Len RiefenStah, recognized in his documentaries, unfortunately I was monumentally disappointed. The story is incredible and unfaithful. The RAF aircraft is landed and somehow found at the Dresden Hospital. Give the sister, whose father runs the hospital and starts working with the doctor she works with, falls in love with the aircraft and they love. The next evening, the Air Force opens up an Air Force, who is hiding as a German officer and dancing with Anna. Although it is well targeted and worked, for me the lowest order soap opera.
