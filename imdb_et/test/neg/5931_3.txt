Weaving to Baxley DP to look like a real movie, for the first time in this series (except F / X scenes). When he came closer to the film's production values, he lost most of the value of the first two entertainment. They were in a very scary movie entertainment category "so bad they're good". Is it possible to claim that "believers" simply tried to make a general feature film with prayer? There are so many times in the film that they are annoying their belief system. If all that is happening is the will of God and they are just his instruments, if the virus-infected people have it as part of their plan, right? Apply it to every situation where a person of faith does not give God's will, and you get a pretty hypocritical little movie from Director of Action Jackson.
