Very strange. But it was supposed to be. This director is his own man. Even through there there are strains when Polanski, Bergman and Kafka at least episode 6, peeping tom one. What made it so strange and recalling the three artists mentioned above was that it went all over the place, you didn't know where it happened, and it could have ended everywhere, and finally, when it ended, it could have continued. The end is almost final, no one can say what these two characters would do even in the next frame. Another thing to say about the director is: No wonder Kubrick found him exciting. There are many Eyes Wide Shut in this episode, which is a direct approach to the character of both realistic fantasy elements. Kubrick's placement on the camera without any harsh effects, much more to wash and rush, not to be closed. This means that at first this man still has something to say and says well. But for some reason, there is no scene I ever want to see. He certainly didn't feel that he was looking at it at least once. But I still got the feeling of three or four other leaders who moved through the parade, blurring everything. The warning is that it was just the sixth episode: the other nine could give me a completely different one. But as this episode turned around in the peeping, looking at, then I say that the absolute domain of the film does not take any ordinary route, definitely went its way, ensuring behind him many good directors.
