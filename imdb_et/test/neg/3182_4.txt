I rented this movie because I enjoy watching them with Lauren Graham. Well, he was highlighted. All others seemed to be separated from the picture. You watched you watching the movie with you, what? But he gave some clarity because he was the only normal character in the picture, which really doesn't talk much about the movie. Personally, it was too much for me. However, I am glad that I rented, even though I would never like it. I still feel that Lauren Graham turned out to be a strong actor and even thought he was not the main character, he seemed to steal the movie. My husband and I were happier and more caring about their character, which came to Joshi's character when we were about two main characters.
