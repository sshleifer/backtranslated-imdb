If wealthy people are different from us because they have more money, filmmakers are different from us because they think the world cares about their every thought. <br /> <br /> This self-conscious trick seems to have been precisely because the director felt it was time to make another movie and someone would finance it. Not every trivial idea or reflection is worth the film (if you are not a college film student trying to finish the course). If you have nothing to say, sometimes it is best to stay quiet. <br /> <br /> Visual images are not breathing. They are quite common. Dialogue is ugly and incredible. They speak words that no one would have in a sequential situation that represents imagination. Germaine Greer's zipless f ** k is finally brought to the screen. Even if you believe in love at first glance, no one would get into bed as easily as these signs. They screw before talking. Even more incredible is an aging, cluttering director who finds direct sex with the city's most beautiful chicks, even though gravity is already approaching the youthful Miss Marceau.
