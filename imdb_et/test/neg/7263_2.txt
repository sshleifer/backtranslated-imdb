Roy Rogers (like Roy) and Raymond Hatton (like Rusty) joined Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders. Soon they will be stopped to round off the "Mexican-US" partner "Eddie Acuff" (like Tommy). the border; they discover creepy gold runners in the process. Note how, even paused, Mr. Rogers can get Rough Riders to join his Round-up! <br /> <br /> This is not one of the best Roy Rogers westerners. Fighting scenes look like choreographic dances. Rogers sings / speaks "Ridin's Trail", one of two relatively ordinary songs, and a general condition. <br /> <br /> ** Rough Riders' up and up (3/13/39) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, Raymond Hatton, Lynne Roberts
