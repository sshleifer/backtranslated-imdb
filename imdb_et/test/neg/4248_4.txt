Although usually I would not prefer romantic dramas, seeing that this film was a bit short for me. <br /> <br /> It was a promise, characters and relationships could have explored much more thoroughly than it was, but the story didn't seem to understand the direction he wanted to take. <br /> <br /> The story of comparisons and parallels, especially the three generations of the family, had a lot of potential, but somehow he was unable to reach out completely. It could have made the film much more easily related and affirmed, which is the purpose of a movie that has recovered from lost love and life. <br /> <br /> IMHO, I think the film suffers from writing in the absence of direction, although Harry Connick Jnr and Sandra Bullock desperately tried to breathe life into otherwise flat symbols. <br /> <br /> It's not that it's a bad movie, some parts leave you aware of the different reasons for plot development, its just that this movie is undervalued, and a little general.
