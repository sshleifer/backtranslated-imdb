I'm almost indignant to allow CALIGULA to see twice. Production problems are almost too big. The script is non-standard (it's easy to see why Vidal tried it). The direction is worse. Most of the film consists of long frames cut with close-ups, mostly with uno-erotic pornor cross sections (more common in "uncut"). Cinematic art is especially submissive, giving the whole production a cheap blown look that undermines some of the complex shapes. The film should be much better. The general concept of placing namesellers in what would be just an X-rated film (Guccione called it "paganography") is thin after the first hour after Peter O'Toole and John Guilgud leave. Bob Guccione obviously dragged it a lot of bucks, but everything seems to be a big waste. If you want a much better understanding of the Roman Empire in the 1st century, check out the BBC's output, CLAUDIUS ... in the mid-79s, and if you want porn, jeeze-Louise, look somewhere else.
