Heavily inverted dolls in this are mainly dull and annoying outings. Guy Rolfe, as fantastic as Andre Toulon has been three times in a while, and Richard Bandi's awesome tunes when the dolls are just a few minutes in the movie. At the beginning of the film, we introduce Bodega Bay Inn (Gordon Currie) caregiver and some of his young friends (many of whom are Canadian and all very well, unfortunately, rather undesirable roles - Mount Teresa is quite a nude). Totems, the witch Sutek of the Egyptian God, want the mystery of the life of animation, and the dolls (if they are under the surface) are working in the past without seeing wisdom to try to destroy the ugly and very computer-seeking Totems. Totems simply complicate the series and draw attention to things that made the series so unique - they do not share the strange beauty of the dolls and are therefore incompatible. Tunnelers drill, classic and about this movie goes. The fifth film was filmed simultaneously to wait for similar mediocre and Toulon performances that seem to have been filmed in different timing (or even galaxy). Guy Rolfe deserves better, and serial fans definitely do. Grrrrrrr.
