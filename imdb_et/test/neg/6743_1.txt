Absolutely nothing is redeemed from this entire waste bin and the only thing worse than seeing this movie is to see it in English. It is literally one of the worst films I've ever seen. It ignores and contradicts any of the topics that may occur, so the story is really really boring. God has passed by the 80s and God, when a man was actually born as "James Bond III".
