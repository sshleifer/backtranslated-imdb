This is by far the worst British comedy, how it did this first episode, not to mention that the pilot is beyond me. The action is weak when Ben Miller plays Sarah Alexander (fantastic coupling) straight through. The plot / story was awkward and very predictable, using a lot of worn out ideas. A very painful line that can withstand, but unfortunately it was set between two excellent exhibitions. describing it as a UK response to "Meet the parents", it is a service to "meet with parents" and is as fresh as the old shoe that has run the family with the dog. The United Kingdom should have learned that attacks from other countries would never work when looking at American sad trials.
