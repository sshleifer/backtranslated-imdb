There are already many comments that have already been posted, saying exactly how I felt this movie to keep it brief. <br /> <br /> "Grinch" I thought it was wonderful - Jim Carrey is a truly talented, physical comedian and a versatile clever actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers, on the other hand, laughs because it is annoying. I liked it very much on my "Waynes World" and "So with a Marriage Slayer" days - but I've never liked Austin Powers and "Cat In The Hat" has just finished me. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible - gags were terrible! Not only is the content for adults suitable for children, but the fact that some of them were so dated that they didn't entertain anyone for 50 years! The plot was filthy, messy, messy! This shame is really because the children were very much like "mother". Apparently, they could have had a better cable than Alec Baldwin - but he could have pulled it out if it hadn't been Myers' bullshit, provoking a call for a cat. <br /> <br /> I mean - will Myers even look at the script? Was one written? The other actors seemed to be one - but the cat seemed to be wings! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I would like to mention that the kits and props were wonderful! But unfortunately, they can't save this movie. <br /> <br /> Poor Dr Seuss - Man was a Genius! Don't destroy your reputation by adjusting your work in such a dirty, dirty way !!! <br /> <br /> 1/10
