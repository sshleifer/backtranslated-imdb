The film is not bad in itself ... as long as you see the original film Hitch (2005) in which Will Smith plays. The film is a straight copy even with most of the film's dialogues that are simply translated from English to Hindi! The primer in the original is tightly filled. The Hindi version can't be considered interesting by viewers. It seems that David Dhawan's gigantic comedy has hysterically called over Govinda all the time ... sometimes it takes more time to understand the cause than the plot. :) <br /> <br /> If you know English, what I expect you to know is that you read it, see the Hollywood original. See at least "Hitch" if you've been following a partner to compare. This is the least we can do to support creative geniuses whose work I am sad to say is shamefully raised by "inspired" people like David Dhawan.
