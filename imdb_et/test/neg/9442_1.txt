I can't believe someone gives a good rating for this movie. In addition to the terrible action, thin (non-existent?) Plot and slooooooooow tempo, this movie would be a watch if you really got to sleep with TREING. The brain of the writer and director must be fried eggs so that there would never be anything terrible. Based on the summary of the plot of the DVD case, the assumption really seemed promising. But in the first ten minutes I knew it was a lost cause. If you want to see a regional idea, check out The Hills Have Eyes Remake. Dreamland will soon be hiding because all these nasty movies are doing. NEXT !!!
