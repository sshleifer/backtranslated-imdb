I looked at the first episode of "home at home" because I thought it was worth "Arrested Development", a boy, was disappointed. It should be clear to everyone that this exhibition is clearly hanging on "grounded life", "Titus", and "married ... with children" because they are all similar on land and in general mood. The so-called "stroke lines" are all repetitive and shapely, moreover, these "stroke lines" aren't even funny at all, to me, they are more like lines like crass and crude. The main character Dave Gold acts like a white trash bin, who thinks he's funny and cool, which he's not. (Even Hillary (daughter of Dave) said this in the episode "Gaza Strip"). <br /> <br /> In the episode "Dream Crusher", Hillary wanted to be a singer, but it was really bad, Dave, and then Vicky was happy to break his dreams by telling him he was sucking. He then wanted to be a child psychologist and planned to go to Harvard after telling Dave and Vicky and leaving the room. In the first episode, Dave Hillary, a boyfriend, said, "Does he really think we'll let him go out with this guy? I'd rather drink my urine" that this line is the narrowest line in television history. And Dave is always entertaining Larry (his son) when he breaks the fourth wall because he thinks he is gay and is a geek. Let us not forget that he also created a Larry girlfriend. Dave is the father who should stand against the boy, no matter what he does. "War at home" is undoubtedly the worst TV show in the family. This clearly explains why the display should be canceled as it spreads racism and homophobia. It's like the show wants to be funny, that whenever someone says it's a foolish laugh, but the lines are all somewhat forced, idiotic, and pathetically juvenile. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the show's terrible actor is Mike Rappaport and Kyle Sullivan are terrible, terrible actors. Rappaport must always move his hands when he is in front of the camera, not only at this show, but also at Boston Public. Sullivan speaks and acts like a robot every time he acts (he did so in the middle of "Malcolm"). <br /> <br /> So all this wrapping has all the reasons why this exhibition is wrong 1.This is unigiginal 2.The act sucks 3.This is not even funny 4.All jokes are the same 5.On bad script 6. Signs are pathetic and unlikely 7. father is rip-off Archie Bunker <br /> <br /> FOX must take it out of the trash because something is better.
