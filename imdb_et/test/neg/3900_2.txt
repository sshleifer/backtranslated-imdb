When I started to look at it, I noticed immediately that I did not understand what someone said. I started up the volume. I heard voices with the background sound that is now flourishing. What are the actors? Isn't the movie duplicated? Do they speak Spanish? After some confusion, I understand that it was English. At least, I think so ... Amazing Jess Franco has placed the microphones too far from the participants. As a result, we cannot fully hear what they say. He's done it before. But maybe it's Franco's intention? Without knowing what people are saying, we are thrown into some mystery about what's going on, and they have more visual tips ... Maybe it's me, but I would have wanted to know what's going on! How about some hints? The main premise (I refuse to call it a "plot") concerns the young American exotic dancers Paula (played by Amber Newman), who has a boy who is invited to a small island belonging to some stupid person. It's somewhere on the Spanish coast. For this visit, a great cash payment for the boy is allowed for Paula. Then he escapes from the island, but later returns. Why? Pay attention to the scene where the boy opens Paula's US passport. Though his hand tried to cover it, at the bottom of the passport you can see the actress REAL named Amber Newman! Anyway, back to "story": The island is visited by some other foolish, rich, beautiful characters with ambiguous motifs. We are witnessing sadistic games (whether real or counterfeit) and unpleasant eateries. But the food must be good if it is a fake French cook! There is a young woman who runs naked and never speaks. Does he really silence? And do we care? Of course, all women in this movie are mostly naked ... Oh, we can at least thank that men (50+ and overweight) are dressed! In addition to the dim sound quality, what I always wondered about Jess Franco is his amazing ability to shoot beautiful naked women with the viewer turning off completely. This movie is no exception? I need fresh air after that! Finally, I am pleased to announce that, whatever Mr Franco can dream of, I am still attracted to women.
