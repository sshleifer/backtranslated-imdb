Another version of the mother of gangsters - The Classic "Godfather" and another leap in the media circus. Sarkar, Ram Gopal Varma's 13th Hindi film director is also the weakest of his Underworld trilogy, including the other two being excellent-Satya and Company. Karisma, the two Bachchan magnetic personalities who play Daddy's duo for the first time on the screen, is definitely a care. Not only strong performances, but their perfect chemistry is the biggest scoring point here, for which Varma should be commended. However, the same duo equations are missing from other movie characters. The reason - other characters are cartoon cartoons. Representative Bollywood bad guys. A noteworthy sign is the older son played by Kaykay but again unable to keep it because of his semi-character. . Drama and conflict are brought about by excessive use of close-ups, which rightly brought claustrophobic effect to the atmosphere. A strange score (Amar Mohile) and sound design (Kunal Mehta, Parikshit Lalwani & Anup Dev) with dark and dark backgrounds overlapping powerful powerful images (Amit Roy's camera work) contribute to the visuals of Ramu's style. However, the music is too big, although luckily there are no songs in the movie. But can the interest of today's "intelligently growing" audience stay on only two performers and strong visual shoulders? I do not belive. Surely, the audience "maangey more" and here the film can not offer. In any adaptation, the greatest prerequisite for adding a new dimension is Scenariff, which is slow here and is not at times crisp and therefore the pace slows down quite often. What ultimately comes to the audience is a very predictable, very ordinary drama with very little surprise. Top Stunt director Allan Amin Ghani is not in his best form either. Some scenes that require different treatment are - the minister speaks against Sarkar and the son hears; Very Amateur Shooting in Sarkar Prison, Sarkar Jr. fleeing from his enemy ties, the Son easily motivates his father to kill, the son is secretly entering his father's room to kill him, police officer Sarkar Jr - this requires a more realistic and difficult approach to creating the necessary conflict. Dialogues, for example, are weak. check out the amateur line where CM tells Sarkar Jr. "Wo already a police chief who has got a reputation for hata diyale". Uninterrupted negotiations on criminal activities, when Sarkar is with his family, are also appearing at times. In fact, the film follows a graph that is quite similar to Ramu's own production - Ab Tak Chhappan. Politics is ignored when depicting the battle between life, law, police, administration and politics between good and evil. Certainly more content is expected. Here the film will definitely stay short and will not rise above the average price. Dear Ramu, you agreed that you would now laugh at your bank, that you must make some drastic renewal measures in your film production company before it's too late.
