When I think of a film from the 1970s, I don't think about it. I don't want a monotonous, one song Robin Trower soundtrack; I want to make a soundtrack with top-40 songs on the day of the 70's epitope. Particularly annoying was the general karaoke style disco during the promose scene. Functional (if you can name it) was very wooden and it seemed to have read the monotone script. Movie quality and camera work were terrible; dirty, the script seemed to be thrown away without much thought and the plot was thin, if not nonexistent. I can't believe people give him high ratings here. In principle, it is a forgotten, bad attempt to restore the beloved era of the past. Two stars are all I can do. Sorry, guys.
