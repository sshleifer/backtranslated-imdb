Would I be too tricky if I was to be told the word "STUPID" over and over again? Probably. <br /> <br /> This is by far the worst film I've ever seen. Seriously. Mystery Science Theater 3000 has better movies. I saw this movie for the first time during a friend's birthday party when it was still in theaters. Although it was actually * with friends * and on one of your * birthday days, I had to leave. I really had to leave. I just apologized and went out. Fortunately, some parents did the same thing, so I didn't look like a full jerk ... Anyway, this movie is terrible. Nothing like this. It is painful (as it actually causes physical pain) slow and bad (literally causes vomiting) uncomfortable. For Tom Arnold, you are almost sorry, but it is not because you remember he was actually in the movie. It really hurts me to even think about it. I remembered why I first stepped out and felt guilty of raising my ratings even by one viewer. Gags are not funny, characters are not interesting. it is just a nonsense of confusion and stupidity. If you think that removing your face from fat with ice cream is brilliant, then in any case rent it. But if you have any dignity, avoid this great confusion of STUPID. SCORE: 0/10 ... maybe negative 1.
