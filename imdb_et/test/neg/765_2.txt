I was assuming it was a cat and mouse duo, but it wasn't something that shouldn't have been done even by that time. They hide themselves in the "blackface" because they travel to Africa and they even act like Stepin Fetch and all the other rolls. There are some racist cartoons, but they are classics, being a mixed woman, I have the right to say it, but if you are in the historical aspect of these cartoons, try Merrie Melodies "Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs" or "Angel Puss". because distributors allowed them not to be mainstream, but they can be found on the YouTube site. I do not recommend that the children see it, but if you want to see if the early America was racist and ignorant, then these are better proposals, not to mention this particular cartoon with bad animation, I know it was 1932, but I have seen the time better. <br /> <br /> "Plane" is not necessary. -1 out of 10.
