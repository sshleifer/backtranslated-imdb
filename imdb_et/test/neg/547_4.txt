I found this to be a fascinating story with a tremendously disappointing version. I thought the action was generally pretty good. Reginald Owen chewed the terrain as others have mentioned, but I found him moderately amusing in his short scene. TCM has given me a fan of Ann Harding and I thought she was normally good here. Jessie Ralph had a field day like an old battleax, ordering everything around, and Frank Morgan, as always, played with Frank Morgan's brilliance. <br /> <br /> For me, the problem was scripting and / or editing - the transitions were awkward, motivations were blind. The movie was too short to give the story right! I felt completely down, especially since I had later versions.
