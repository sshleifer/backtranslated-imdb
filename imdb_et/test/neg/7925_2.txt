This movie is so stupid that I want my $ 2.99 to pay back !! First of all, this film begins with a wooden actor, performing talents as they got out on the street, because "real" actors didn't show a ridiculous script, or they just couldn't desperately get that movie done! The music of this movie is enough to sleep you, not even flute music for fans to dance in the desert! And the boy who has seen Satan looks like he's all dressed in a K-Marti Halloween costume! There are no dead scenes except for some flat scenes. When I saw what the horrible killers showed, like the face of Nosferatu, I laughed! This should escape the city once a year! This movie is one of the worst demonic movies I've ever seen. Avoid it!
