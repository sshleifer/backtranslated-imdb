How dare you? Adam Low, without the obvious shame, puts it on fake respect. It is not even a serious study or analysis of Visconti's work. Yes, it's long and steadfast, yes, we have some great clips from the movies that most people have already seen. But the longest lasting impression is the rumor. The last and most loud voice comes from a third German actor, hustling and robbery. It was called by Mr.Low appropriately, hoping that I think I would get better ratings than his previous, more point, but deadly boring documentary from Kurosawa. Well, I have news for you, Mr Low and your cohorts. You forgot the great opportunity and I won't give you another one.
