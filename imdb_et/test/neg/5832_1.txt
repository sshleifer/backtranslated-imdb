I'm from Bangladesh and here is C.Costigan is a fantastic sex goddess. All the fun, friend and I were awake in the middle of the night, watching movies on the Encore: Action channel when we found a series of sci-fi-esquire flicks. There was RoboCop 2 (not bad ... not bad at all) ... then judge Dredd (Stalone almost destroys his career), then a movie called Lethal Target. One might think that the title "Lethal Target" could only be given with a really cool and truly cheesy Rambo hit. But this is what I would like to call "semi-soft, semi-pseudo-action, semi-sci-fi movie" ... actually I think I can say it's not even a movie. Had it not been for the harsh heat of the main character, my friend and I would have turned off the film as credits. <br /> <br /> I have some questions for people (I wouldn't even dare to say "specialists") who made this movie. - One, in the future, why are they using the weapons used in 1999? Oh, wait, I'll get it, it's all they could get, ... better ... then, well, why the main character carries what looks like a regular daily linen shirt and vest like this one, what did people wear in the late 1990s? ... oh ... I get this ... in the room, it must have been a fashion statement .... well, then ... WHY, OH, WHY the main character pulls the 3.5 floppy disk one point in the movie, so he could you upload some fuck ?! wtf!? ... we have progressed so far that we have space travel, but we have still not moved to 1.44 megabytes of space ..? <br /> <br /> I think I just ask too much. Question 2: Let's just say that yes ... it's soft porn porn. Then why is there only one real sex sex and why does it last for 2 minutes? <br /> <br /> I mean you are taking REASON people who stay in the middle of the night to see this crap (daring to say "movie" anymore?) ... and beat it for less than 2 minutes. Hell, they would have had to take this sex scene and sell it to another porn movie, and they would have made more money for STILL for this "crap" when they did. <br /> <br /> CCCortigan is hot. And an insult to the actor, but he works as well as I do. and I have been mentally slowed down and I have only one testicle ... (C. Cortigan, ... e-mail to me ... we have lunch) I'd write more, but I'm empty.
