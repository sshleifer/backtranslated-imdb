A really bad movie with very little good moments or features. <br /> <br /> It starts with the shaved Linda Blair, who runs along the corridors to escape, which may be monsters or heroes. not sure. She jumps through the window and wakes up and we see she is very pregnant. The extent to which she is pregnant is very different throughout the film. <br /> <br /> He and the tedious and perhaps slowed little boy I thought his son was traveling on an abandoned hotel. Italian horror leaders find the most irritating guys who put their movies! The island already has David Hasselhoff and his German virgin girlfriend (you know how Germans love Hasselhoff ...). She takes photos and she thinks she translates an esoteric German book on witches. <br /> <br /> Going to the island is also an older couple who has bought it, and a realtor and a woman I thought was their daughter. Apparently he was an architect, Linda Blair, and the boy is the children of the older couples. I think they all went to the island together, but it seemed like Linda and the boy were separate (maybe they were filmed separately). <br /> <br /> The hotel looks clean, definitely on the exterior, but it's not accustomed to any great effect. The old woman's bad make-up and black carpet show her boyfriend and sometimes sing in German, which he finally records on his Sesame Street tape recorder. <br /> <br /> People start to kill either in their dreams or suck into hell or something. Some of these gore scenes are OK, but not enough to recommend the movie. Although the observed copy indicated that it was uncovered in the box, it seems that the death of one of the characters whose veins explodes seems to have been cut. Much of the scene shows the reactions of another character because we don't see anything of our own. The amazing scene is where a man or demon who has a really dirty mouth wound is wasting someone. He seemed particularly disgusting. Linda Blair possesses a ridiculously and painfully bad scene. I wish the horror movie could be captured by him, they would do something original on their own initiative and let him leave Exorcist behind him (except for the annual conquest conventions). <br /> <br /> The strange, largely Italian, tradition of saying that it is a stage that is not related to it is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2. That means it's allegedly Casa 3 - Followed by Ghosthouse, La (1988). also a better movie than this). La Casa 1 and two were The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987) - again associated with Witchery and La Casa 3 (and much better). There is also Casa 5, La (1990) AKA House 5, which seems to want to be another counterfeit La Casa series and House: House (1986) House II: The Second Story (1987), The Horror Show (1989) AKA House III and House IV (1992). How does the Horror Show fit in? This is not really, it claimed to be a sequel, thus requiring a real serial number to renumber, causing less (or more) confusion. Strangely enough, the Horror Show also has AKA Horror House and La Casa 5 is also AKA Horror House 2. Is your head still painful?
