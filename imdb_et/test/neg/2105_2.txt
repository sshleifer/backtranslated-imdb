I would probably like to give this film a zero, if not for the peak that really does not include the snakes on the train, but rather the train snake. A prerequisite for making the beer was much more likely after hearing about magical mattresses in production (it was actually released to coincide with the release of this film). Nali is probably not lost to those who are looking for it; I do not think there would be a soul who could consider it to be a serious action competition (unless it is ironic outside the ability of rational thinking). It is about a Mayan curse placed on a woman who has left her family with another man, and will soon be seen as sick and coughing green mucus, which is, of course, snakes. He and his beau train drive to Los Angeles to train, and very soon after the more than the clich√© characters get on the train's shady snakes - when the initiator's wife turns into a snake. <br /> <br /> If I would like to know more about the movie, but I don't have enough time during the day. In terms of quality factor it can be said that it is almost non-existent; there are short films for students with a bigger budget. Perhaps it was a smart calculation at the end of the filmmakers that the copies sold would be as much as a mere joke factor, so that they could reconnect to their budget for the first weekend. As you look at the set (the trains change randomly in the middle of the scene!), Show actors (if you can name them, just one other actor - very thin hair who hits one woman) for the whole film that got the benefit of the slip), is FX ( also not being by making an impact on Star Wars on the Snakes plane) and the actual CGIs themselves, along with the ultimate huge deer trunk, something to see in the sci-fi movie channel. <br /> <br /> It all basically means that every step is a laugh of rebellion (especially if the cruel, if it sounds, when a little girl becomes involved in the snake's attention), a very good taste disregard works well for your benefit. That said, it is also 100% disposable, like a B-movie sour-flavored lollipop.
