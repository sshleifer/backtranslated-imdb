With such promising pain and the director I have heard about the great things, I was completely disappointed with this film. It started with big epic gangsters' stories and became a completely confusing confusion with many unanswered questions and completely ridiculous and pointless scenes (and yes, I looked at the full length version). I love Robert DeNirot and, as usual, he did a good job, but in all the other gangsters, no matter how many people he killed, I still had respect for his character, but in this movie he was a violent drug addict. , a rapist who has no one but not himself. Some other fine actor James Woods also had completely ridiculous scenes for him. I thought the parts where Robert DeNiro called him crazy, and he turned out, were completely out of the left, and finally the writers just wrote with a random comment about how his father died in a nut house and why James Woods didn't. as it is called crazy. So much has not been developed in this film. Also, we never find men who are trying to kill noodles, and we never know more about Joe Pesc's character. It seems that writers threw out about five different stories and never explained them completely. The only quality of redemption was the story when the characters were young children. The story ran smoothly in this part of the movie, and the kids did a great show. In general, I was deeply disappointed with this film and I don't see how anyone could compare it to the godfather 1 and 2 or even Goodfella. I'm sad that I wasted this movie in four hours
