sdiner82 hadn't seen the film for decades and his memory is terrible. His attempts to paint Mark Lester's shaving site suspects are totally wrong, as are his wrong comments about the bad boy who "slips on the child's body". Lester is dressed all the time when a man is in the room, and the man hardly gives him a glimpse. <br /> <br /> The scene is a raw attempt to show Lester's innocent curiosity about the man's body. > <br /> Like everything in this movie, it's badly done, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> Even sdiner82's comments on Savala's character who "accidentally sent a German family to death when they had taken their trailer off the cliff" is meaningless (it was a woman, she was already dead, and she was in the car ). <br /> <br /> I suggest that sdiner82's review tells you far, far more of its own, far from liberal thinking than it's worthless about the movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I even looked at it was curious to see if it was done before or after Kojaki. <br /> <br /> Film is a worthless piece of 70s trash bin, but the sdiner82 review is the worst slander. He covers his view of pseudo-intellectual "facts", but the only fact is that he is wrong in almost all "factual" things he discusses. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that sdiner82 saw exactly what he was looking for, what was annoying. Now he can return to the burning copies of the rice bushes.
