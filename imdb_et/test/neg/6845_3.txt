This film was so stupid and slow that it was slow. The only good part of the film was the girl's fine gold pants. There was no gore whatsover and what is the 80's horror movie without a small gore. In addition, the killer was not scary or murderous at all. But if you want to see the worst horror film in the world, that's for you. Don't waste your time as I watched it.
