Hmmm! is this the worst movie? so some of them are ashamed to see them in such a movie, but hey, if you pay the bills, why not, as well as the movie. OK cg effects don't harm this cheap movie, the music is cheap OK for the movie, the final credits are OK lol <br /> <br /> BAD for many on the list but cast, acting, set, script ends ... what the fuck, Drac .. ........ worst Drac EVER !, much more, but they can't be disturbed to put them all down. <br /> <br /> The idea was fine, but needed ten times more budget and more thinking and much better lighting and style, and I change all the bad points, but I still say to see this movie so you can say, "What FU% The $ was that all is "credit cost." this must be seen to see how bad it is.
