I ran over the film last night from a local TV channel. Frankly, I've never heard of this movie. Just, I lost Seagual's last movie footage, because each of them is the worst than the previous one. Here we have again dull Seagal as if his girlfriend had demanded this film and he praised it vigorously. The plot is ridiculous, operates below zero, and no aspect is the decomposition of the film. I just don't know why Seagal did this movie. Man, it's even the worst than "kill"! When you watch this movie, you start to know Seagale. He seems to run out of ideas, enthusiasm and money. Avoid this movie and do something worthwhile.
