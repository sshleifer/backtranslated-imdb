Oh, I was really disappointed. I did not plan to see this in the movie theater and I wish I would stick with that plan. In fact, it should be a movie made on television. I was very excited to see it because I'm a big fan of Fairuza Balk, but this movie didn't do its justice. I'm a little disappointed with how it works. With the terrible roofs of Fairuza Balk tattoos, I was disturbed every time I saw her shoulder. <br /> <br /> The movie didn't flow, it was very difficult to get into it. One of the scenes we are angry with, we want to get up, we want blood, expectations rise, just then the manager takes us to the second scene to show love between Annie and Bobby. It would have been more enjoyable to follow it as a three-day comic. <br /> <br /> There were also little logic behind the characters chosen to play some parts. The leaders of the gangsters were tough guys, not very believable. Matt Dillon Head of Mobile Organization? Come on, give me a break. There was simply no intimidation there. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack .. wow. I think it's one of the worst musical points I've ever heard. What a terrible guitar solo, my god. My teeth grinding was more pleasing to my friends, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there is one positive comment I would like to make about the movie. The settings were well done. I liked the colors, the good work that gave me that time.
