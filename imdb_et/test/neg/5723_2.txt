Withdrawal: As the warrior Queen Gedren raised and killed most of Sonja's family, she has taught the art of sword fighting. Now, Gedren has taken a very powerful talisman that threatens to destroy the world if he does not destroy, kill Sonja's sister in the process. Now Sonja is a revenge and salvation world. On his way, he meets a very similar Conan (but not Conan, no!) Kalidor, Prince Tarn and his bodyguard Falcon. In the beginning, Sonja refuses any help, but later she is forced to accept it and together they will save the world. <br /> <br /> Comments: When you watch this movie and you think it's a story it's the best element of this movie, the movie is a big trouble. Because 1) such a film should be based on good sword games and influences, and 2) the story is really bad. It is simple and simple, and really does not offer anything in terms of character formation or even distance. It is predictable and boring, and the obvious couple Sonja and Kalidor are not at all chemistry. And the boy is just annoying. And most scenes are pulled out so long that they become boring. Although the film is not very long, it is not enough time to complete your time. And so back to point 1). The fight is slow, endless and really bad. This clearly shows that most fighters who clearly block opponents' attacks, which are in front of the opponent, have even begun to hit. I honestly think that I believe most children who fight with sticks will make more exciting struggles with knights when it was made. All in all, this is a very bad spin-off that should be avoided by anyone who likes Conan's movies. <br /> <br /> 2/10
