It could have been a great movie with many teachers around the world about teaching, biology, science, science and creative work in Darwin's life, but that's not the case. <br /> <br /> The scenario is mostly historically inaccurate and transforms the true story of the Mexican soup opera melodrama. Although it is true that Darwin gradually lost his religious beliefs, it was largely due to his findings during the Beagle trip and not only to his daughter's disappearance. Certainly he was disturbed by his loss, but it did not literally make him crazy, misleading and separate from his friends and family. This representation of Darwin is the invention of the script writer. So it can't be used in any way to learn a bit about Darwin's life and psyche. According to most historians, Darwil's theory was ready at the end of the Beagle trip and kept it open because he wanted to further develop its consequences and check more data. In the film, this is Darwin's imaginary conflict for his religious beliefs and mental illness, which he developed after his daughter's death, which kept her open to the public. <br /> <br /> Film brings a modern situation, creatine debate between scientists, Darwin's life and times, so it's anachronistic. It depicts Thomas Huxley not as a person trying to develop further understanding of biology, but as someone who wants to "kill God," his own words from the movie, and destroys a church that would accept evolution theory for such purposes and not because it was the synthesis of many disconnected data . Huxley is presented as a very arrogant and unreliable person whose interpretation was an attempt to ridicule active atheists who speak against religion. In real life, Huxley Darwin's ideas were only gradually accepted after publication, and before Darwin's work he thought there was not enough evidence to support evolution. His first evolutionary support was published one month after the origin of the species became public. He was agnostic, but did not consider it necessary to "kill God" but thought that there was not enough evidence of supernatural faith. Discussion artists vs. scientists appear throughout the film, and communists, such as "It's Only Theory," are part of the debate. Of course, there were no such disputes or catch sentences. In fact, the Anglican Church gave a positive view of the statement of origin that they saw God's work in evolution in a sense quite in contradiction with how the spiritual figure is depicted in the scenario. <br /> <br /> Another terrible aspect of this movie is that it gives the public a false impression that a lonely crazy guy who just writes a lot is doing scientific research. Nothing can be further from the truth. Theory of development theory was due to the in-depth observations of Darwin's life forms over five years at HMS Beagle, and was progressively developed, as can be seen from Darwin's travel notes. Although the Beagle trip was the only most important part of Darwin's concept of "Origin of the species", at the beginning of the trip only one is mentioned and no attempt is made to show that the book is accurately analyzed for observations. To make it worse, Darwin has been shown to perform one theory (pigeon breeding) to test his theory and finally stop it. And I'm not quite sure if such an experiment actually happened. <br /> <br /> Great disappointment. It is in no way a tribute to Darwin and science.
