It seems to me to be in this minority, but I found that one real thing is the smalt, alive and generally unpleasant. Not that it was so bad, but the characters seemed a little more than archetypes (a bad father, oh, but wait, maybe he's not bad, maybe there might be a resolution at the end ...). True, the woman with whom I loved the movie, so you like it. But I didn't.
