Man, man, this was a piece of a dog. I read some examples here after seeing a local video store, and I thought ........ Ah it seems half a decent movie.Vampires.Swords. Thailand.How do you go wrong? Is it? No, no, somehow f * cking wrong. Jesus, if I only get my eyes out and don't remember this movie, I'd be happy. The leading actor ever had the voice of THE whiniest, gay. It was really bad .... "Amandaaaaaaaa ...." My friend and I changed the Audio Track on the DVD to Portuguese so we didn't have to hear the man's voice. Subtitles and everything ... and it improved the movie. I'm serious if I like something and thought what the movie was like STOP WONDERING. I have an answer. WORKING VAMPIRE MOVIE EVER! No good activities, no good honor and only the smallest nudity. Just clean sh * t 90 min. Don't rent it, buy it, think about it or watch it at 3:00. It just doesn't cut the cake ...... at all. F * ck this movie and see all anal 7: real deep cover. You would have a better time. I'm sure.
