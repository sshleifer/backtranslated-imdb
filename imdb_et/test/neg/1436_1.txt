Sometimes I do not know whether today's horror films are based on torture by people to fear people. If so, there is a sad future for fear films. Dee Snyder tries to make you feel scared and scared, this movie does it exactly, but not well. Now there are a few moments in the movie where Snyder can save this movie hole, but let's face it, this movie didn't get into the hole, it was already a hole and Synder doesn't try to get out of it. When you have finished watching this movie, you are left sick, depressed, dirty and crazy. I feel like it was the purpose of this movie. What is lower than dirt?
