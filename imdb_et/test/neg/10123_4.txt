I never understand why, when a studio is buying music, it kills the screen. My first thought in seeing Ava Gardner and Robert Walker was starring when I saw something that MGM did the best at that time. The boy was wrong and disappointed with me. <br /> <br /> One touch from Venus, which celebrated Mary Martin, Kenny Baker and John Boles in Broadway, played 567 plays in 1943-1945 and Gardner, Walker and Tom Conway played the roles Martin, Baker and Boles did on stage. Kurt Weill-Ogden Nash Nashi and S.J. Perelman was a means of returning to Mary Martin, who restored herself as Queen of Hollywood's disappointing Broadway. <br /> <br /> See the names that went to this exhibition. Considering who was responsible for this book, I saw some sparkling wine in this production. Instead, I got a pretty pedestrian scenario, it was like all that spirit had run out of it. Eve Arden plays Tom Conway with her regular girl on Friday, but it's too much for Eve. <br /> <br /> The story relates to department store windows, Robert Walker, who is a very valuable Venus figure living in Ava Gardner. Of course, when the shape goes missing, Conway shouts for the law and doubts Walker, who is the last figure together. The rest of the film is Walker, who deals with Gardner and what happens to both. I do not understand the reasons that Ava was of course named Eileen Wilson and Walker sings only a few lines. Dick Haymes and Olga San Juan, who play Walker's friends and co-workers, are singing. Of course, Broadway's songs have been made by singers Mary Martin and Kenny Baker. You think Haymes is playing at least the role of Walker. It was uncomfortable to say at least. <br /> <br /> Only three songs survived the score, don't look now, but my heart shows it's low and incomparable. Haymes's silk baritone is best shown in Speak Lowis, which was sung as a duet by Martin and Baker Broadway. For some reason, Ann Ronnell made the words of one of the greatest men of the last century, Ogden Nash. I suspect the infamous code was at work here. <br /> <br /> The Lee server biography Ava Gardner mentions his brief escape from Ava with Robert Walker when he was spit with his current man, Howard Duff. . When Duff and Gardner reunited, Walker took it badly and didn't talk about Gardner at all. I am sure that the fact that both of them were not in their best work will not help. <br /> <br /> Hopefully a repertoire will make one touch of Venus and you will see it in Weill, Nash and Perelman wrote it.
