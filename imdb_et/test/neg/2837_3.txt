... Brian? What the hell did you do when you did it? <br /> <br /> I saw it recently at the festival and was greeted by ridiculous laughs. By the time the credit ran, tears flowed into the face of many audiences. <br /> <br /> The plot is' E.R. and "X Files"; as cynically directed to the television audience as possible without suing. The sequences associated with robbery are fun - both Yuzna's staging from a "floating bed" and "screaming Mad George's pathetic foreign aliens pulled an incredible, devastating laughter. <br /> <br /> Limp, Camp and Stupid. My only hope is it was aberration - as terrible as the "return of the Living Dead 3" was good. <br /> <br /> Steev
