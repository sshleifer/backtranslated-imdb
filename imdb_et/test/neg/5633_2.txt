This film must be seen when it arrives at the stage of production and becomes the money of the Redgrave and Jacob on board the ship. I can say that they had nothing this week. Jacobi bucks it so that only Jacobi can do it, and I thought he seemed more like an actor that he parked in Fraser a few years ago. Vinnie Jones is not exactly bad, she is just the leader in her depth. He's really quite friendly, and if it was a TV series pilot, maybe it was. However, Scipt and camera work were terrible. The reason why this "jounalist" and Met press officer never cooperated has never been explained. It certainly cannot be due to sexual chemistry, which does not exist. There is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and far-drawn plot that can be exploited originally, but the whole thing is just so understandable that these two stories don't make any sense. It was like two stories that were confused to make two hours. Look a little dry for a few hours. Your life is more filled than looking at this garbage
