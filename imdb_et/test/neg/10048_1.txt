The English translation of the title of the DVD version of this movie is "The Tomb of Whores", but I think it must be a mistake. It should have been called the "Tomb of Fright". The terrible act, the terrible editing, the horrible story and the terrible music make it a terrifying film, which is the best terrible tomb. <br /> <br /> Dreadful.
