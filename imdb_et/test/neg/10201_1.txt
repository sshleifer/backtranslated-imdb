This movie changed my life! Hogan's performance was not unbelievable and I have still not recovered from the exclusion of the 1990 Oscar candidates. And as bright as Hulkster looks in this movie, you can't hide such a masterpiece from brilliant writing and heading into the film's highest achievements. If you haven't seen this movie, then let's do what you're doing right now and get yourself a copy. I guarantee that it will hit your mind. And if you don't like it, I only have one question for you .... Watcha will do when the 24-inch pythons and Hulkamania run naturally on you!
