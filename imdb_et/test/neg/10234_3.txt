Wow, it was hard to see the RACKETER version! Although none of the other reviews have been mentioned, the public version under consideration was seriously flawed. The audio track was turned off in about 10 seconds, meaning that dialogue and action never came to match. So you would hear something before you saw it - a very confusing proposition! The worst thing is where you hear the gun shot and only after the boy gets into the taxi to death and hit. <br /> <br /> Although this film seriously damaged it, it also dealt with the simplification of the dialogue - and also showed its serious shortcomings. The dialogue was just terrible - it was often a slip or a feeling in some way. As one review said, it was like playing high school. Some of this is understandable because the sound was a new medium, but the dialogue in this film was bad even when compared to other 1929 films - really bad. And like many of these early sound films, the film was too talkative - with a gentle and too melodramatic language, and just not much in action. And you think the title like "The Racketeer" that there would be some action !! But this is really a messy romance - very little action. <br /> <br /> The film finds Carol Lombard associated with an alcoholic musician. He himself steals to take care of him - and dwarf Robert Armstrong is there to help him. When Armstrong tries to deceive his cards, he covers him and then helps the drunk brother to get to his feet - and of course he falls for this process. The problem is that when drunk fit, he also wants Lombard and he has to choose between them. Wow ... renewable drunk or mobster ... talk to a few great prospects! All in all, it's a bit difficult to judge when I saw bad printing. But even if you ignore it, the film has a lot of problems because using the dialog is too weak and too talkative. And ... it was too cute.
