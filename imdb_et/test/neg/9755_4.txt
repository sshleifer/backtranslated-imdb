Step Up is a fair dance film for some children who get their great results. The film is scarce in every respect for the viewer. Jock struggles with external prejudices to become a dancer with a partner and teacher who sees something special. Action was good, but there was little added to the predictable story in dialogue and leadership. However, you still feel pretty good about the results of the movie. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about the dancers who went overboard. This is a Class B movie with moderate continuity bugs and dialogue disruptions. The landscape was good and the characters were alive. Like to watch such a movie.
