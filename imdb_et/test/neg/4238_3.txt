Perhaps the day of this movie was special. But five decades later, it seems weird, just another terrifying cinematic remnant of the 1950s. Stereotypes are abundant in this buzzing story of three female gold diggers who are building a shop in Manhattan's penthouse to attract wealthy men. <br /> <br /> I don't mind the low topic. But the film's premise is flat. And the performance is worse. It's a romantic comedy, but I found a little laugh. The plot point for extremely short-sighted bimbo is the only wise element in the story. General dialogue is smooth and so is delivery. And the script's structure is disturbing. The plot jumps back and forth between three women. It would be like the writer couldn't mix the roles of the band quite well. The result is a plot that seems uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Marilyn Monroe was a good choice for him. But Lauren Bacall was too old for her role. And Betty Grable, with her nervous voice and terrible hairstyle, was just annoying. <br /> <br /> The color cinema is normal. However, there were a lot of frames in the back projection that helped date. Visuals are made by even worse costumes that represent the "glamor" of the 1950s; they are just terrible. Viewers have to endure a fashion show, a plot point that amplifies how the film director is hit by these trashy joyful sluts. And then this is the orchestra. What is undoubtedly the worst thing about opening a movie in cinema history is the orchestra on the first half of the film, playing some louder voice. First of all, I thought I was looking at income for future attractions. But no, it's actually part of the movie. And the orchestra plays forward and on and on. It has nothing, absolutely nothing, a story. What did they mean? <br /> <br /> I liked Marilyn Monroe with a breathing voice as she bimbos her way through the plot. But the film would have been much better if they broke the role of two other ensembles, set aside this orchestra, stepped up the comedy dialogue and reduced these tough cheesy costumes.
