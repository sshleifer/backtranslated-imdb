Being a huge fan of horror, one of the hardest things to look at in the genre due to the lack of good movies, and having seen hundreds of them in my life, I have to say that Dracula 3000 is by far the most intrusive, flat and badly made trash I've had to see. AFTER THIS FILM! It's so bad that it's not even ridiculous. Special Effects (did I say "special"?) Apparently a couple of big, actresses were terrible and the script should end in the trash after first reading in the studio that decided to take this unfortunate project. The whole film was literally filmed in stock. Also, the R-classification must not deceive you if you love nudity in your movies. If you think you have a chance to see Erika Eleniak even half-way, then you're wrong. She's dressed up all over the film. And the cover design is completely misleading! There is no scene in any part of the movie that even resembles the very fantastic cover art they put in the box to pull the unsuspecting horror blowers. <br /> <br /> The rating is too bad for only 1-10. this movie is -10. Be warned. Don't waste your money or time here.
