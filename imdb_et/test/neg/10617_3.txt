I watched this movie, which I really thought it was a promising start, but then I was finally disappointed. The problem I think about this movie was that the director tried to make this movie a bit strange and original. There were too many setbacks and too many bad effects that irritated me through the movie. I like Debbie Harry and Isaac Hayes, but they deceived me in this movie, they could do much better. This movie seemed promising at first, dragging the middle and finally disappointing. The film was never able to win Stanley Kubrick's genius when it comes to controversial issues, strangeness and originality in films.
