If I was British, I would have a disgrace to shame. A branch of the specialty who can't protect himself from an ill, unarmed and untrained attacker? The Ministry of the Interior sends one "Research Advisor" to investigate a possible fourth-level biological hazard, and that "Wizard" does not even feel a mask and gloves? Totally unprotected London police officers working with technicians alongside biologically safe suits? "Counselor" and his bodyguard who suffered a sociopathic doctor who is experimenting with people without backups? Pooh-leeze! One does not know whether manufacturers can afford to hire technical advisers, or if they decided to reasonably imagine the principle to be hopelessly incompetent. Even my wife, who has no medical or law enforcement background, spent her eyes incredibly. After the first episode I was discouraged; Now that I've seen two episodes, I'll give up.
