Gordon Scott made good Tarzan movies, but that's not one of them. <br /> <br /> As I looked at it, he worshiped the bad, obviously internal, and hollow wooden "clones" when they allegedly walked. dirt tracks and biased dialogue and worse behavior among supportive casting, I thought "Sheesh! This is the TV show level!" Then I find out that it was indeed three pilot episodes of television programs that were woven into one completely. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Scott get out (alone) away from the flat. scenes; and the struggles have some pretty nice moves ... but oh, ow and like in the dialogue. And did I mention the actor? Heck, Cheetah (or "Cheta" in this version) was a better actor than most people. <br /> <br /> And that doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> This is a stitch to see a younger Sherman (ie Scatman) who works as a native speaker. But obviously this is not an investment of the general time.
