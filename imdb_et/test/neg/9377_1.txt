This is the only movie I think of where, after that end, I was trying to hate myself and all the money and time involved with it. No wonder Alan Moore refused Vendetta (phenomenal film) V to do anything after that attack. It's bad that you want your eyes to go up. Primer holes according to the size of the planets. The worst script in memory. Terrible action by the actors. Visuals that should be large but somehow flop. <br /> <br /> It could have been so good ...
