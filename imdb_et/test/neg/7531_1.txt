Saw's movie was shown by Lawrence, Kansas's premiere. This disgraceful story of groups of dissatisfied universities that killed the prom queen competition was just terrible. It fails for several reasons - bad behavior, bad script, clear point. But most of all, it seemed that the filmmakers said, "Hey, I have money, so we make a movie!" - without actually thinking about it. Carefully the most indie movies that don't do that just under this mentality. They just don't seem to realize that making a good movie takes more than money ... or even being traceable. With this film I am not ashamed to say that if I didn't know the team, I would have walked out. It's easy.
