This movie is very similar to every other contemporary horror movie. It is predictable as it evolves and progresses and simply fails to display anything original or shocking. This is really the biggest disappointment of the film, which was generally a promising main concept for a film. <br /> <br /> You can call this movie a great walk in a modern horror cliché. It has all the elements that often make today's horror films very big. One of these aspects is the grieving and very naive little boy. Why do they put such things into movies? The same goes for aspects of drama that involve the family. It just doesn't work for the movie and is by no means interesting or effective. Often it will cause the parts of the film to drag and become annoying. <br /> <br /> So it has all the clichés, but it can't bring any of these cliches to the screen. It's just a very poor movie as a movie. It does not handle its horror and tension very well. There is very little to be enjoyed by genre fans. The story of the film is not too well connected and built up inside the film. Too often, the film lives in parts, and it will never let your horror be completely hit. <br /> <br /> Film is often too dark (undoubtedly an attempt to hide its rather small budget). ) and it also shows very little gore, mainly due to the fact that you don't always see things very well. <br /> <br /> You can just say this by looking at what the director JS Cardone does not have a lot of talent for the genre and does not know how to handle his current ingredients properly. He has done some experiments in the past, but all his films have been unsuccessful so far. he's just trying unfortunately. Who knows, perhaps, the people behind the camera (like the Tobe Hooper who was originally directly connected) would still have been decent. <br /> <br /> This is a poorly cast film that is mostly unknown to it. The biggest name of the film is Ben Cross, but his role is just too small and in a way that is not appropriate for the film and its story. It didn't even look like he was having fun playing. <br /> <br /> Just skip it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
