This movie is just terrible, the movie was just an hour and the film, about 25 minutes long, was simply useless for random snowboard clips that didn't even connect to the film. The story is completely "restored", my 5-year-old cousin could probably write a better script. I don't understand how anyone could finance the production of such a movie ... terrible. This is certainly the toughest film I've ever seen throughout my existence. I think the director just took some random kids out of the street to act in this movie. Managing, acting, producing and writing this movie is all very bad. I feel bad for people who have wasted money to finance this garbage. U couldn't look at this mess again.
