Dark Harvest 3: Scarecrow: 1: 10: Einstein's theory of relativity is from the point of view of time. (Or I have heard) In other words, this film seems much longer for an hour and a change. Even when you move fast (and you get to this fast forward button) it's time for an eternal place. <br /> <br /> When you know the Lionsgate project Greenlight's own version (this is where they buy home video but its fancy cover and sneak it into your local Wal-Mart horror section), it's not surprised at the value of all the entertainment complete and complete absence. <br /> <br /> The line (I refuse to call it) is even terrible. This is a collection of dead fathers and removers who claim to be on a film between Schlitz jars. The work of the camera is a drunken father who photographs the quality of the holiday film and although the special effects are okay, the most frightening effect on breast augmentation scars is the naked scene. <br /> <br /> The story is terrible, the kits come from haunted Halloween by ADHD high school students, and once more to read the line (keep in mind that it doesn't work any more than the bottom of the pool is swimming), it just disturbs words. Avoid.
