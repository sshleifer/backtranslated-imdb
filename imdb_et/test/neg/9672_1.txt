Just when I thought something could not be as offensive and / or irritating as Billy Mays infomercial, I had an intellectually destructive experience of renting this garbage. Peter Barnes and John Irvin should be brought up for criminal charges for smuggling this script in a public place. Participants must be required to be part-time participants who earn less than one lifetime in the eyes of the public. <br /> <br /> This production provides a limiting sentence: "To achieve a dramatic effect, we have taken a literal license with certain facts," or any such inadequate statement to fully assure you of an absolute rewriting of a Bible story that does not require any drama. What they did was enough to change their I.Q. lower three full points every five minutes from viewing time. <br /> <br /> The "Poetic License" that has been taken is such a strange sign, you don't recognize anything but a few names, and of course, for some reason, both Noah and Lot live in Sodom, so perhaps Abram was on a skiing holiday in Switzerland. Lot's woman, played by Carol Kane, is a harp and when she's turned to the salt pillar, Lot breaks her finger and carries that circle that seems to be empty baby food. If it's "poetic" then I'm kumquat. <br /> <br /> When Noah - who has now started to drink wine in drinking water, which can help the ship to swim - it awakens the hard work of building. One morning it was found that God has given enough preliminary work to ease his burden. At least I think it was God. It looked like a supply of 84 wood that was stacked and bundled properly. Maybe 84 wood is really God's representative ????? Instead of bringing you with the cargo, I regenerate you with a pirate attack on the ship. Do you think this is inconsistent? This movie is full of such offensive crap. After an unforgettable time, Noah hears a pirate ship that's right for them. And who could be a salty captain? Well, this is Lo, of course! My only surprise was that his uncle Abram was not on board. If you intend to kill a plot line, kill it all. The trial of piracy has failed and swashbuckling was pathetic, not poetic. I think this sign was that my nausea prevented me from punishing me anymore. <br /> <br /> Dirty, pointless, and moral distortion that is something like a Bible account. On a scale of 1 to 10, this film is cautious of mind abuse. Stupid and offensive, you're more entertaining than reading Yellow Pages.
