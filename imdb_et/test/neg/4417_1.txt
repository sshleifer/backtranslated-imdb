For me, this is a case you never understand if you don't live it. So read this to find out why I would have such an unlimited anger. <br /> <br /> I heard a lot about it (Bruce Lee) .. my dad loved him .. my mom hates a little violence him, her! and how he still talks about his "The Big Boss" or "Fury of Fury" and the experiences he's watching in Egyptian films in 1973 with all the giant advances. Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story - 1993) .. so I found myself crying: where are your movies in Bruce? !! <br /> <br /> I went to a video store .. and it was a stupid move .. (You know why!) .. and waw .. I found many Bruce Lee movies .. I chose one name (Bruce Lee New Guineas) <br /> <br /> I did it myself and watched it. OH GOD please forgive your servant .. I hurt myself but didn't intend to make a decision. if i knew this evil harmful! its mythical level! After that, I didn't think at all about the big noise of Bruce Lee as a great immortal star, why would anyone care about whether he was here or there ... this hero (from whom I've watched!) Is not talented and not genius and of course be it sexy ??? Until my dad saw this star and asked me to stop in any of his close relatives and after he studied his face a little ... he told me very definitely - this is not Bruce Lee! So I got too confused to ask: who is this stupid guy anyway? <br /> <br /> It was 2 years after the first entry into the IMDb database, so i immediately tried to find out who the hell this guy ... and i discovered the truth .. he's not Bruce Lee .. My dear friends, he is Bruce Li !!! <br /> <br /> And what a big .. so big difference! I just want to know who can love this bad clone? I love their repellent movies .. I watched them out of 2 and couldn't finish the third finish! ?) .. and I have the original one, the only Bruce Lee who is really such a big star and Oh BOY, he was sure i immortality .. and no less.
