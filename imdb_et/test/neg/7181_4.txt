If this is the best Hamilton filmmaker, I have no curiosity with others. <br /> <br /> The film's greatest tools are his eyes, but when Peter Stormare wants to show great emotion, he closes so that we can admire his eyelids for five or six seconds, while his feelings remain unaware of them. Lousy act as a technique. <br /> <br /> Stormare sometimes throws away when he fires a gun, turning his head off and fastening his eyes. Watch carefully. James Bond can easily rest with such competition. <br /> <br /> Other actors have interesting supportive performances but are not enough to hang the whole movie. Cinematic art has a good appearance, which makes the Nordic Cold Cold. Even the Sahara winds cold. Maybe Hamilton carries her climate. <br /> <br /> Here are some good things to do. Unfortunately, the only sense of humor on the screen is the villain that makes the hero a big hit. James Bond's jokes may not be particularly good, but at least he doesn't see constipation all the time. <br /> <br /> One positive point in the film is that psychotic, tortured, cruel hatred against Israel Guillou's books have been omitted. What has been said is the noble, heroic worship of the PLO, that it shows us that it works in Libya without the knowledge or supervision of the dictator Khaddafi. It is hard to believe this fantasy because Khaddafi pulled the PLO out of Libya for four years at a time. And at the end of the movie, Hamilton gives PLO a very worrying gift. Where do they use this gift? Hamilton doesn't care. <br /> <br /> We are a long way from here to "Who's Some Taxes" here. <br /> <br /> Commander Hamilton remains a local phenomenon. Although Henning Mankell's books sell well worldwide, Jan Guillou never has the same success. <br /> <br /> As for this movie, Bleeeahahhhhh.
