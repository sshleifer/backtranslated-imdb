Brass pictures (movies are not the right word for them) are indeed somewhat brass. Their appealing visual features resemble expensive high-end TV commercials. Unfortunately, brass photos are feature films whose eavesdropping desire is to attract viewers for over two hours! They do not succeed unhappy, undeniably, but rather soft and loose than the evaporating, erotic qualities that do not last. <br /> <br /> Senso '45 has the same title as Luchino Visconti and Alida Valli and Farley Granger are in the lead. The original tells the story of meaningless love and lust in Venice and its surroundings during the Italian War of Independence. Brass moved from the 19th century to 1945, exactly, so Mussolini's murals, black shirts, German uniforms or partisan dirty rubbish. But it's just a window covering material, the historical context is completely negligible. <br /> <br /> Anna Galiena plays an attractive aristocratic woman who falls on an immoral SS man who always puts too much lipstick. She is an attractive, versatile, well-trained Italian actress and clearly over the material. His widespread facial expression (signal transmission from boredom, enthusiasm, joy, fear, hatred ... and ecstasy) is the best reason to see this picture and two stars. It basically carries trash things that have an amazing amount of dignity. I want some very good parts for him. He really deserves it.
