I got this movie from the library and saw it had many actors (John Cleese, Ian Holm, Ralph Richardson, etc.) so I got it and watched it. I was expecting Cleese to play a big role because she was the first settler, I was surprised she found she had about five minutes of screen time with everyone else she liked. This movie is amazingly meaningless, the characters are noble, the plot is non-existent, and the end is one of the worst end I've ever seen. There were some funny parts, but that's it. Stay away from this movie if you want to avoid "What?" and "Huh?" And if you don't want to waste your time. Ignore people who say it's a very funny movie ... it's not. Just stay away from it ... please.
