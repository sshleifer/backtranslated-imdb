While I was watching it on Italian television for some time, I found it to be a surprisingly tolerable potboiler this time, supported by an international familiar face (including confused Joseph Cotten as a baron) and, contrary to many other films from Euro-Cult sub-music, a randomly packed plot of lethargy. instead of pace. <br /> <br /> The creature itself looks a bit annoying and Cotten is a bit too old to be taken seriously by an avid scientist who still lives out of the bodies when creating forms (he might have thought he would have made his own army now and not fight for improvement of his technique), but Mrs Neri looks in costume Reliable Herbert Fux is probably best than a terrifying robber / presser.
