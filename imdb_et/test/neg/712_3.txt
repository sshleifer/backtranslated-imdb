Released at a time when Duvivier was again strong in strength. "Black Jack", which was skipped between the extraordinary "Au Royaume des Cieux" and the dazzling "Sous Le Ciel de Paris", Dumbler himself hated, which is not surprising.It is almost nothing to write it dud.We may notice that : <br /> <br /> 1.Orson Welles previously admired Duvivier.It can explain why Wellesian participants were featured in Duvivier's films: Joseph Cotten's "Lydias" (1941) and here completely wasted Agnes Moorehead. This is the first time I haven't enjoyed Moorehead's performance! On the other hand, Welles lent his Desdemona (Suzanne Cloutier) Duvivier "Au Royaume des Cieux" for his "Othello". <br /> <br /> 2.Every Duvivier movie has one or two useful sequences and this is no exception: searching for caves where Duvivier's mind mystery miracles (for a short time) when Dalio reaches th Fishnets. can also feel unhappy to the end. <br /> <br /> For the rest, as my dear ball writer writes, this is a black joke.
