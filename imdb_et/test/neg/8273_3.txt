I couldn't laugh when I saw what the public might think about the fact that in 1996 there was an email. And some other "technical" aspects are ridiculous funny. I swear a high-tech communications center, where he actually has some Commodore 64 monitors. Almost like watching Hackers nowadays, I think that despite the fact that most of the film is directed by the actress to the illusion of disabled people, the last part of the film is the inexplicable use of her legs, which in no way can be ignored. I mean, why add something so stupid? Anyway, in summary: the plot is quite predictable, bad behavior, the killer quite likely. But it may be interesting in Mystery Science Theater 3000, as I think.
