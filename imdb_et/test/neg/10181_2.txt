The only reason I gave this film a 2 and not 1 was that for some reason I felt compelled to carry it out! Basically, I wanted to see if there were any foreigners, no UFOs, in the title of the movie, the cover of the movie and the beginning of the movie. I was very disappointed that religion was thrown as it was. It could have been used as a film advantage, but I felt that this movie tried to send me unconscious messages! Finally, how big was this casting cabinet! I became so confused how many different and extremely bright shirts were in every new scene I started thinking about whether this movie was not really considered "bad comedy". <br /> <br /> Toe thumbs down!
