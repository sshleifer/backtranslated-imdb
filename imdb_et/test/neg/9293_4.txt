Former East German informant graduates from Mexico in 1971 as a student group spy where he falls in love with one activist. This is the first Mexican co-production with Germany, and although it is a good picture of the ideals that have been celebrated and continue to label (at least for CGH), young people, so many finishes that are something vague, because the inner dilemmas of this face are dark brown (Noethem ) like her passion for ideals, which Adela feels (Campomanes) as soon as they see, if she wants to assume, with a language barrier; and lack of experience with it. The reason why there is finally no specific identification that causes films that were even documents like Red Dawn, which is another film; although I want to make it clear that there are many assistants in the room in an exciting conversation with the director, who tells me that they are no longer young or have changed my ideals.
