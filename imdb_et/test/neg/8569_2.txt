I didn't buy it, I didn't rent it, it was on PPV, and someone burned it and borrowed it for me, so at least I didn't waste that money. Someone who did the darkness, the nameless, the devil's back, is a pretty flat movie. It seems to have something to do with the girls who were in the monastery that day, and now they've all grown up and are caught and killed one by one with a nook out of the kitchen sink, toilet, and even negotiating on the hotel's revolving doors. And what makes this nun so thoughtless and nasty (and wet?) I can't, it was so boring that at some point about half past I just stopped it, put it away and looked at something else. It wasn't even interested to know it. Oh, sure, there are some beautiful young women who watch but have two lesbians? I think a young woman's bedroom has a nightstand in the picture and what self-respecting horror movie wouldn't be on these days without a lesbian couple? Yes, whatever. From 2 out of 10, if you want to see a useful nun-horror movie, try "Desecration", "Dead Waters" or "The Convent" (and by the way Adrienne Barbeau, not John Malkovich).
