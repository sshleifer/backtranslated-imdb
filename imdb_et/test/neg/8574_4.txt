The biggest mistake in this Spanish language / shock is inside this script. In the first semester this is a great effort, building some gaps and fear and fear. We even have nice killings! Then it goes downhill and becomes a complete "your main class clich√©". I have to admit that I was quite disappointed because the trailer promised so much. The last thirty minutes consist of some killing and abandonment of a lot in the abandoned monastery. It should have been so much better (though the last scenes in the flooded room are pretty okay)! <br /> <br /> First we have a dialog. This is a terrible part of the time (here and there, when I saw it, there were quite a few strangles) and just enough elsewhere. It is barely audible during many scenes, drowning under the sound effects and soundtrack (but it may not be as bad as taking into account the stupid features we have to listen to!). There is one line in the film that refers to "I know what you did last summer", which shows that filmmakers wrote it all in one big joke, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> End, but some hate it, others dig it. For me, this was mainly a question of the former, because the last twist comes from non-existence! If the audience had some clues about the mental state of the girls, it might have been thought otherwise. It also casts all out of the logic window, because the killer could never be in place for some killing! But like an avid horror blower, I've learned to live with these contradictions in Spanish and Italian films. <br /> <br /> But it's not bad. The appearance of the film is great, mainly thanks to the excellent cinematography (scenes from the past really look like here), tight editing and the atmosphere. While most of the actors are pretty bad, Anita Briem is an exception that does the most work she has to do. Real screen presence! <br /> <br /> And as I mentioned earlier, killings are enough for fans of such things and usually have very good special effects that include water images (but "water theme" tends to get tired in the end). <br /> <br /> So, to finish this review, it's a movie that is quite fun in a "bad, it's good" way, and it's also pleasing to the eye, but don't wait too much because it doesn't produce if you think it probably taking place by evaluating trailer and plot descriptions.
