1st reviewed 6/24/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Stefan Rujowitzky): OK thriller but a little too predictable. This story is in Germany, where the film is going. It is a young medical student who gets to Heidelberg's premiere school and comes up with some strange things. Someone he's met on the train and recorded there will appear on the school's experimental table and he suspects the game right away. He explores and his friend's disappearance leads him to a secret society called AAA (and not anonymous alcoholics) with anything to do with an anti-hippocratic oath and used to test the lives of living people, which a doctor should not normally do. He discovers that his grandfather (who was a dean at school) was a big part of its creation and that it is quite easy for school members to fill. This is an interesting story, but the problem with this movie is how quickly the audience is told what is going on and then this is a fear film that the heroine is fighting against this group of bad boy who takes things to the next psychotic level. Although this film was made in Europe, it plays a young American audience, focusing on gore, sex and the premise of horror movies (which is really a big downturn) and explaining why it probably made good money and created a sequel, but it doesn't. Don't necessarily do a good movie.
