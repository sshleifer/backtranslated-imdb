I'm new to Argento's work, and if it and Suspiria are a sign, Argento has much more experience than the story. In his films, characters are placed in grueling and mesmerizing horror contexts that literally saturate the logic of a saturating world. The camera literally travels gently through sets, like characters running, stumbling and stifling the way to a potentially terrible conclusion. It worked really well, suspended. For some reason, it didn't work here. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that although the protagonist gets help in approaching the police and helping friends, he still seems to refuse to "get help" when he actually tries to find a solution to his problem. The detention of this movie is that he is trapped in a killer little game that he easily escaped ... not making himself so easy? In a strange way, the character seems to want torture, which the killer gives him what is, in some sense, a point and could have worked, except that all of this psychology is thrown mostly because of what Argento feels. > <br /> As a loving tribute to "Opera for Opera", it's definitely interesting and unique. For all his values, Argento also enjoys operative movements, which also reveals action. It just doesn't make sense, especially since it's going to be completely useless (yes, I know it refers to Harris' novel Red Dragon. No, it doesn't work). Why should this character go from one terrible experience of adhering to the wish if the director is outside of me. It seemed to be almost self-serving for Argento. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, this is a fun experience and more between it and Suspiria than ready to continue Argento's production. But this is not a movie I would like to come back to or remember. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
