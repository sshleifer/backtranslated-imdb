I can't believe that this terrible movie was made by the same people who made Lepa Sela Lepo Gore. Look at it and skip it. The plot is confusing and characters are mostly two-dimensional stereotypes. I suspect that the editor went on vacation for half a movie because of the rapid, pristine cuts that would confuse things rather than explain them. The end does not make sense either. <br /> <br /> This is predominantly a propaganda film for which Serbs can apologize and condemn America for the 1999 NATO bomb attacks. our allies during World War II, claiming that the whole world is unfair to them and ignoring everything that Slobodan Milosevic said and did, like the war with three neighboring countries. They seem to have the intention of making a political film, but only show a few seconds from Milosevic on a television screen without sound. The nationalist agenda was obviously over all artistic issues that were not the case with Lepa Sela. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I recommended this film to a teacher when he played at Seattle International Film Festival last week. He also referred to poor editing and confusion, and I had to apologize for bad advice. You have been warned.
