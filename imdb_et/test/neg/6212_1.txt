This movie is widely called because it is a copy of the Will Smith function of Hitch. This movie was boring. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as empty or intolerable. Govinda looks like his prime minister. He's not in his best duties. Likewise, it is not convincing if his performance is Deewana Mastanas. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan is the "best" in his eyes. And this is a couple scene where he remembers clothes. It could only have been through nepotism that this eye pain can be saved from any movie cutting floor trash. Another case where the majority of the Bollywood audience tortures themselves, striking it.
