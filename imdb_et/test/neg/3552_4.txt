Plot that is incredible. It must be said, however, that it must be admitted that executives perform their role as Shakespeare. And that should be the case. It is not their fault that the writer seems to be in a coma. <br /> <br /> Hats, which are the most insidious of Joanna Kerns. He proves that simply because it is not on the page does not mean that the role cannot be confiscated or sued. And he does it with pleasure. Good for him. <br /> <br /> Feel Christine Elise, who is called to be a little more than confused and crying, but goes beyond what she is asked. <br /> <br /> And for the Grant Show. Graduated from day-to-day and premature soaps (Ryan's Hope, Melrose Place). He is always versatile and underestimated. His main drawback seems to be his impossible to ignore the good looks. He is a strong and well-grounded actor who can give much more than usual. <br /> <br /> The rest is basically a window cover. <br /> <br /> The direction is sufficient and the script, as I pointed out, is quite idiotic. <br /> <br /> See this to enjoy three good actors who are cheering with some of the much needed landscapes. This is fun.
