Eaten Alive is followed by a young woman (Janet Agren) who is looking for her missing sister. It turns out that his sister has joined a sect that has disappeared into the Borneo jungle. With a Vietnamese veteran Mark, he went to find his sister. <br /> <br /> As usual, the actor is not of the highest quality, but you get the cannibalist flick poster Me Me Lai. time on screen with her breast, female head Janet Agren covered with gold and abused, among other things, a snake dipped in blood. Now you have to read something! <br /> <br /> But I have to say that recommending this title is a bit difficult. If you are a fan of the genre, you are likely to recognize every single gore scene in each film plan by choosing one. And I mean it literally. Many gore scenes are lifted directly from other cannibal films such as MAN DEEP RIVER and LAST CANNIBAL WORLD. There are probably more movies that are stuck there. If you haven't seen any of the Italian jungle movies, it would be better to watch CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and if you are an avid fan, you have seen most of the gore scenes from other movies.
