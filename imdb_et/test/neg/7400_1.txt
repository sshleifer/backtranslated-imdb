What a bloody nuisance! You don't get such topics with TV budgets and some smartass directors who can't tell the difference between Lanc I, II, and III. All the stupid clich√©s are well placed; On the character and human level, this story is so weird and incredible that it is painful. And all those responsible will be happy to make great judgments. Specifications: Garbage. This close flying Lancs would have been thrown away from each other by the sky. Single engine night fighter attacking track: ridiculous. As I said, the director, who I never heard before, was named Lancaster and some boys who turned to Lancs for a looting duck. But these are small things compared to the overall mediocrity of this film. Though it may be too harsh, I dare say that it will pay damages to those who died on both sides. TV nonsense, entertaining stupid masses who don't care anyway. Shame on those responsible. Use your brains the next time. And enjoy the profit from it.
