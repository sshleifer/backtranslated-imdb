All of the movie's commentaries say the movie is balanced. This is their main reason to give the film high speed. But the film is not balanced if the analyzed main criminals give the last world to every substance. The director admitted it at the first San Francisco film festival. He justified this by saying that he could not waste the opportunity to gain access to Fujimor. This may be true, but if you show so much of Fujimori's stuff, it will make the film clear to Fujimor and unbalanced. I dare to prove all the other comments with this false advice 1: arguing that Harvard professors, intellectuals and Latin American diplomats agree with you will not help your argument (use logic). Tip 2: Accepting a director does not help your argument (the director says he thinks Fujimori is charismatic and patriotic and therefore he depicted him so)
