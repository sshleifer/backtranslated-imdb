This story begins at the end! So the film's opening credit gives us. Unfortunately, this is not the way we are treated in about 70 minutes of typical B-science literature from the 1950s. The story is tough; The plot is very weak and is clearly filmed with a low budget, as was often the case these days. <br /> <br /> The story could include situations where people take refuge in an isolated house and are threatened by someone outside. It just happened to fit into a sci-fi story. <br /> <br /> The landscape was made up of some rocks, shrubs and smoke. - Oh yes, there was a body of water. Someone wore a rubber mass that looked like a face and looked like feathers. <br /> <br /> Lou Rusoff wrote several sci-styles during this time, including The Creature and conquered the world Filming ended in a few days, leaving participants time to take advantage of their symbols. Low budget constraints also hindered the potential of this film. It could have been a much better film than what turns out to be. <br /> <br /> Mike Connors and Richard Denning brought the film to life, but even they could not bring this movie to this category where you could say - "I enjoyed this movie" Richard Denning's acting career began in 1937. He played with Gregory Peck and Deborah Kerr in what was later remembered, and later he became known on television in the series of Hawaii Five-O and The Flying Doctor. br /> <br /> Director and director is Roger Corman, who has many films. He has made good films and still does them. He became very well-known for the direction of Edgar Allan Poe from the northwest, often starring Vincent Price. He also made other low-budget films; some were good and entertaining for one reason or another and most of them were much better. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. <br /> <br /> September 10, 2007 Darnmay <br />
