I have no idea why people are so crazy about the show. It's so boring. Jokes are not even close to what we usually joked about. It's like, Alex says something that is not funny or interesting and then suddenly there is a laughing sound background. My friend and I looked at each other with an empty view, as if we had asked each other, "What's so funny?". Seriously, every time we looked at this example, you wouldn't hear a laugh or cough. Just a blank look. So we stop watching it. I personally am a fan of sitcom, so I tried to watch this play. But show us such disappointment. This exhibition can be one of the worst comedies ...
