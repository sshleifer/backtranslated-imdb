So, as I gather, this episode tries to make a statement about how real villains are very bad people, and it's as scary as paranormal. The "paranormal" image associated with Donnie, a villain, is purely symbolic. In fact, he is just a normal person. <br /> <br /> The problem is that I just don't buy it. Donnie is not just normal. He's not even so scary. Like a man who seems confusing and weird, not malicious, loves dead girls and hair and has only recently become a murderer, he is far less annoying than most known real serum killers (eg he is like a very dehydrated Ed Gein version). That's why Scully's horror is something to see, but the body of the hair and nails are cut off (something that doesn't differ from normal personal hygiene) before anyone is even killed or hurt, is completely non-existent. He sees things a hundred times worse in almost every other episode and barely flinch. <br /> <br /> Just like the Comic Book Guy says ... "The worst episode of EVER!"
