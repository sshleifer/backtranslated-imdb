Maybe it was the fact that I saw Spider-man a day before Duce Wild's sight, but I don't think this film can be as bad as it was. It was cast in there, but it seemed that when they found themselves in the right pain, they had to try and match the film. The only problem was that they didn't fit. I didn't like any characters and the story was the best. I was wondering why I spent my money on this movie.
