I saw Bogard when it appeared in the 70s. It was one of those images that got X-rated for violence. We drove to our local floor room and we still saw it. Pretty good picture. A lot of blood fights in the street, though the cheap sound effects of the strokes took it away. And lots of sex. I remember one early scene when Bogard meets this beautiful brunette in the apartment she shows. Unsold word, he picks him up, puts him on the window sill and nails to him. From what I remember, the picture went further from this point. So when I discovered that Bogart was also called Black Fist and it was available in VHS, I ordered it online. I was very disappointed. Black Fist is redard on television. There were so many scenes I remember, I was wondering if this is actually the same picture.
