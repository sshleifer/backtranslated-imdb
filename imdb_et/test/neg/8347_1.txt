L.A. The story of a volcano erupting in the city center sounds like a beautiful plot for a catastrophe. But this has been missed for a long time. The film looks chaotic, it is a story that is difficult to follow or believe, and the actor was very bad. <br /> <br /> I agree with many comments that Lee Jones is only good at turning people into a leader in a particular area. In it, he leads the emergency service. The head of such an office is, of course, a good idea to bring your daughter to dangerous scenes. Intelligent thinking. Ann Heche touches the walls and walks through tunnels that assume they are 678 degrees. Yes, right. Apart from bad acts, these factual errors make the film almost as stupid as Armageddon. The only good thing about this movie is that there is no Ben Affleck to make things worse. Avoid this movie at all costs.
