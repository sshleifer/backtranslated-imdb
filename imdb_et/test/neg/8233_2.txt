This film has been classic in my country because it was filmed in my own small town. I now have many friends who are the guards of Dixon Correctional, and I worked in the SuperAmerica shop for 3 years next to the Krogers store where the old lady was. But it is still a dumb-out movie that has ever been made by Gilbert Godfreid or Rhonda Shearer if it hasn't been. Slightly trivial, Illinois doesn't even have passwords to listen to, and Dixon Prison is a medium-sized security feature that hosts burglars and vending machines. Classical Fucking / seduction scene is probably the most entertaining writing I've ever seen, especially with constant build-up
