I can't believe how this movie really is. The story (written by Kira Knightley Mom) is what destroys the movie extreme. it is boring, absurd and absolutely no sense ... <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad for most, especially at the beginning. the story was always on hold and their daily flirting with each other, often it seemed to the three. in this movie you have a tedious couple (poet and his wife) who are complete from the start. The woman is sleeping with other men to come to a head, while the poet is perverted, who flourishes cheap boos and women. a woman who waaayyyyyy too quickly gets friends with her former childhood lover (played by a kira) suddenly gets jealous, knowing fully that these two were lovers because they were kids. nothing seems here .... i mean, come on ... get the program with the lady! what did you expect. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: the former lovers will meet their new husband again, surround it, then be jealous, then the former wife's lover will marry and her husband will be jealous, will bomb the mad drunk couple home The crazy wife will call the police and they will arrive at the court half of the charges for murder. this is a brief summary ... <br /> <br /> this movie was moments like quality and good acting by cillian murphy, but otherwise I can't believe i watched it ... i complained about it during the movie and some family members who watch it with me stayed asleep. I decided to give him a chance and I should have kept my first instincts.
