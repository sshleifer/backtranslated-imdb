I would like the Depardieu to be able to finish his book and see that it becomes a blinding success. At least he would have finished something. <br /> <br /> The film hit me nonsense, buggy and very stylish, like some of the latest French films. Don't knock it. The latest American films are pointless and talkative and have no style. I think we should be grateful for the photography that awakens the European city in the midst of the wind-blown continental winter and the elliptical conversations that set our ability to understand what's up. <br /> <br /> Be too good. Golubeva has been found to be standing in the immediate vicinity of the sea in the middle of a cold evening, continuing with bad pressure on dreams and such. (There are some sequences of dreams that include things like swimming in a river of blood. You love it when you're Vlad Impaler.) Many people die. Catherine Deneuve dies with a motorcycle suicide. I do not know why. Golubeva's young girl also dies and I don't know why she dies. He gets on the face, falls on the sidewalk and dies. <br /> <br /> There is also an explicit sex scene. I have to take that word because, although it is stylishly photographed, it is photographed in style in almost complete darkness. Don't worry that kids are shocked. In any case, they are asleep at that time. <br /> <br /> Depardieu is not a bad actress. As we can see, he wears a carefully cared for a beautiful young man - well, beautiful, except that his nose does not seem to be out of his way - a sliding, murderous, hairy physical wreck, we feel sorry for this man. Golubeva has a beautiful face with huge semi-covered eyes and wide cheeks like a doll. His next film should be Lewton's "I walked with Zombie." Then this is the mysterious man who heads the band. I think it's a band. As far as I can do, the band consists of about a dozen drummers and ten musicians playing electric guitars. Every viewer thinks that the resulting sound is interesting, but non-cultured listeners who like "easy listening" may not enjoy it. If you do not like music, there is a fee, because the dark composer and the leader will come on top of the Depardieu walking stick. <br /> <br /> I have to say I found it hardly worth sitting on. (And it is also long-haired.) Sometimes it was like waiting for a car on a level crossing while a long long freight train was slowly, sometimes completely stopping. I wish he had some jokes.
