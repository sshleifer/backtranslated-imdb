After a while I realized that it was just a slow drop of my IQ. Frostbit is one of those pathetic films where someone and I don't want to even try anyone. Did I put the dorky hero in death to the trash (how did he get there)? "Characters", although I use the term loosely, are so exaggerated and one-dimensional that they could also use cardboard cutouts. "Jokes" (I use this concept loosely) is just fun. The boy's peer causes an earthquake. Roflcopter! Our "hero" gets acupuncture with Traci Lords butt. Oh God, I can't breathe! Blind man uses F word repeatedly! It's too much !!! <br /> <br /> Say what you want to talk about actors, but I thought Adam Grimes was doing a good job of playing a challenging snowboarder. In addition, the only entertainment value here is chest. I think I counted three movies, maybe four pairs throughout the film, scattered over a five minute screen. It's five minutes to look at 83 minutes of inaccurate waste. Don't look at it. Watch Barb Wire with Pamela Anderson - at least this trick has a lot of nudity and action (r # 26)
