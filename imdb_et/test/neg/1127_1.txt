Quoting Clark Griswold (on Christmas Eve): "WORSE? How can things get worse? Look here, Ellen. We are on the threshold of hell." Little Chevy Chase did not know that she described "stage" to one of her best films. Christmas Vacation II sets a new high in bad movies (or maybe it should be low). My wife bought this DVD thinking that it would actually be original, but we were seriously disappointed. This movie is LAME. It is not like the original, it is an absolute waste of film and embarrassment for otherwise good actors who had a failure. It must have stored the worst recordings in the IMDb. I really think we have a good case to win a class action to recover the money we are wasting on the film for the consumer.
