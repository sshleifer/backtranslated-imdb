This horror film starts pretty promising and is the moment when I thought to myself "it's really good". Eventually, however, it becomes quite fast. The action is pretty good, as well as the location and story start quite well. The problem is not enough on the screen and ends where you have a monster basically tail and running. I wanted to see more, especially after a very good sleeping bag scene where I thought the movie was picking up and winning. Unfortunately, the film showed that after the movie showed little monster and lied behind the DVD when he told me that the human desert literally came alive and was able to eat his flesh ... now what would have been a movie, almost inevitable situation. Allow this to make the viewers uncomfortable and it can raise tension, but that's what horror movies should do! Instead, we have very few shots of beings or beings as it was and when we see it, it is primarily a defense. However, it wasn't all bad, it just needed more horrors less hunting and more.
