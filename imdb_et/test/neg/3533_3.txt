A scientific experiment aimed at creating a supernatural nature has gone wrong. The creators are trapped in the distant desert, followed by their creativity relentlessly and mercilessly. James Stockton, a scientist whose research was used, despite his demonstrations to create a monster, has called outpost to help bring back the horror that is now in the dark room. James, along with his son and daughter, will soon find themselves trapped in an attempt to survive desperately. there is no way out ... "Outpost" / "Mind Ripper" is very unigiginal.Sets are pretty claustrophobic and there is a bit of gore.However, when the horror it failed at almost all levels.There is zero intercourse, the script is weak and full of big holes and end is extremely predictable. So-called Captain Wes Craven produced this one - I don't know if he is happy with this waste. Joe Gayton leads without any style. Art is terrible, only Lance H enriksen can act at all.OK, I'm a big horror fan and was bitterly disappointed. Avoid it like a plague-it's just the same old boring mess again!
