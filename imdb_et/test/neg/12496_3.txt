Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret service provider who prevents the senator from murdering while he finds a conspiracy and has a tail viewer. The tracker is bent upon completing Phillips. The most obvious inspiration for this low-budget cheeseball action flick, of course, is Robocop, and while this movie was a bit of imagination and real energy, it's just a real-life kickboxing champ run robot. The film is not so terrible that it is just empty and repetitive. The story is written in clich√©s and characters are created to reduce them by different fires. Don Wilson, as usual, is terrible in leadership. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 4- (Poor)
