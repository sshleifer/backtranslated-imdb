Absolutely the worst experience I've ever been through. I think my eyes started bleeding. I saw it looking sick at night. I don't even have a movie. Movies should be worthwhile and entertaining. It fails. I couldn't do it all over the film because because the end may be the biggest phenomenon of movie films, it gets a little chance 1. Otherwise it would be a flat 0. <br /> <br /> I don't see how the National Lampoo or, let alone, sponsor this fear. Renting this DVD is currently one of the worst mistakes in my life. Just watch it if you ever want to make another movie you will ever watch. <br /> <br /> This is the worst film I've ever seen.
