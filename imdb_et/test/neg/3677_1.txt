Where do I start. I rented this movie because it sounded like something I was watching. In the film starring Val Kilmer, I wondered how bad it was to be? It must be the worst film I've ever seen with such a big name. I wondered why it split through the cracks and I never remember it when it first announced it. It starts quite good and somewhat reminiscent of the bourne identity intro sequence, but after the first 30 minutes or so it gets worse off and then it is WTF land. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and don't rent / buy it if you're not masochistic or trying to see every Val Kilmer movie out there. There are many more titles that deserve your time. This film (if you can name it) is a waste of time in good faith. I want my 82 minutes ago.
