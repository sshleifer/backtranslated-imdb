After reading Fool For Love in his drama class, I waited to see how Sam Shepard's wonderful game would have been translated to the screen. For my fear it was as fun as the game. The film seemed to be dragging, the music was inappropriate for the film's tone, and the raw energy that emerged in the game seemed to be sucked out. It is a shame to see that it does so even with the involvement of Shepard, playing the role of Eddie. Do yourself a favor ... look at the game the next time you do it in your area, or just read the book.
