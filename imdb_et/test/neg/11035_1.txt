I watched this movie together ... with 5 audiences! There was a choice between Lakshya and Asambhav ... (realized then that I should have gone to Lakshya). A typical plot ... India v Pakistan .. but just not cricket because you are in the middle of Kashmir. The Indian superhero goes on a mission to rescue the Indian president from some Pakistani rebels involved in massive drug trafficking. I left the movie halfway because it was just boring and the plot was confusing and all over the place. The songs were also terrible, the film tries to hide the mistakes with its special effects, but unfortunately they are outdated. <br /> <br /> In general, this must be avoided if you can, the worst movie I 've seen.
