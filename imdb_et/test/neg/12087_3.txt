THE AREA is a fickle periodic piece, a ridiculous story of a Jewish woman who, after her father's death, dates back to 1830 to Scotland, depicting a pagan job to support her family in London. <br /> <br /> Rosina - or Mary, if she calls herself a not too fine piece of symbolic writing - is a rudderless child, a society with dreams of being an actor. He connects with his employer and randomly solves a major problem in studying his photography. They have successfully started stopping and discomfort, while the elder son of his parents loves him hopelessly (and inexplicably). <br /> <br /> And like a child, he doesn't understand his consequences. Activities - Finally, those who are deceived by him will betray themselves to make life. <br /> <br /> Many say it is a feminist manifesto, but I disagree. Whether it is or not, this film will only resonate with me if I think it is a deterrent. Finally, Rosina's greatest disappointment is the truth - she lied about how to help a man whom she wanted to be both a father and her lover, and finally nothing but destruction. So the end of the film gives me the impression that something he didn't do, someone he used, didn't make him happy - and that's exactly how it should be. <br /> <br /> Do I need this movie for so long and teach me to teach this lesson? Not at all. On the contrary, if there had been no excellent cinematography, a unique score and my hope for his coming, I would not have stuck to the end of this film. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver fans are likely to be disappointed with its uneven performance but may still be able to see it; I doubt that Jonathan Rhys-Meyer's young female fans will be able to keep awake for the anticipated reward, and I cannot think that it is too little a cultural detail to make it even interesting to photographers. The 3 points I received for the award are only for this visual style and score. Because of the strength of the second job, I assume that the performers' performances are both disappointing due to a bad script and poorer management, but they are finally noticeable.
