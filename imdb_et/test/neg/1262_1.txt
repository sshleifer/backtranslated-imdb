Do you ever know what the worst film is? Stop thinking. I'll tell you, Michael's it! <br /> <br /> It's not "heart-warming", "entertaining", or "Travolta's best". It just sucks. If I had kids, I'd let them watch Michael's deep throat before. <br /> <br /> John Travolta, washed and wedged by William Hurt, and dies at any time when Jean Stapleton is highlighted in the movie claw. <br /> <br /> But wait ... you'll hear Andie McDowell's song! Yes, yes. Hollywood really s ** t over us!
