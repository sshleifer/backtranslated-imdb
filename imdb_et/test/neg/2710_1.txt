for people who have no idea what comedy is. It does not only cover the people who liked this movie, but the people who did it. What could they think? Madonna playing Judy Holliday? Please, he can't even play MADONNA (if there's actually Madonna). I hope Griffin Dunne was well paid. He earned every penny he got, because if it didn't kill his career, nothing. I'm sure a few people who actually paid for watching this movie felt their pockets were chosen. Madonna has probably passed since the feeling is embarrassing because of her virtually complete lack of talent as an actor, but you cannot be confused. He has no connection with the rest of the pain; it seems he showed that he was ready and said, "OK, I'm here, I have to torture myself when you make the absolute worst Judy Holliday impression that somebody has ever seen, now stay hell out of my way" do. I know the phrase "rotten Madonna movie" is superfluous, but it definitely fits. It is painful to look at a completely meaningless and talented "actor" who makes himself completely stupid, but apparently does not bother him as he does it again and again. <br /> <br /> The only funny thing about this "comedy" is that he managed to find the people who gave him money. Now it's funny.
