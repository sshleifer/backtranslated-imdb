The combination of Dan Haggerty (Elves) and Linda Blair (Exorcist) is enough to make every film a joy. And if you see the cover of the frozen zombie movie coming out of this critical chamber, you think you were B-Movie Horror Heaven. At least this is how I go to this movie. But boy, I was in shock. I love horror films. I also love B-movies. Nothing changes my day more than a hairless zombie, monster, murderer, such thing. But to say that this film was missing is an underestimation. This movie was a clean trash. You think the zombies would look a little like the box cover design, but instead you get the actors with masks that are clearly sold on every Halloween screen. In addition, the script is farther than bad. Our main character, Joseph, suffers the loss of his wife and son and is looking for comfort with a warm heart in Mary, played by Blair. Never does Joseph's character see any sadness or discomfort. Instead, we see the head of cryogenic laboratories, a man named Dr. Miller, who wants to get dead bodies and experiment with his organs. There is no emotion or anything that would make you believe that you should give this movie to someone. <br /> <br /> All and all, very disappointing. All the elements that made a great horror movie were there. You had your zombies, your decent actors and your story. But the lack of a good written letter and little if any trend it screwed up risen royally. Generally 4 people out of 10
