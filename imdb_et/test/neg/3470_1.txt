I'm sorry if I have someone telling me what to say about a TV movie. But I paid for the film and it turned out that this movie is a disaster. Management is really terribly bad. But after I looked at my information here, I realized that the low quality of management and production could be caused. Maybe they don't have a budget, but there was still little money for Ang Lee's mind and sensitivity, but it was a blow. The director of this film made a story telling really bad work and the film was not able to keep rational continuity in itself. It keeps me out of the scene. Maybe someone has to do a hard story / table. The dubbed sound is also terribly bad. My God .... Normally, I appreciate every movie because it's behind the ideas and perceptions of the individual. but this time I'm just crazy, "I really want to catch something." ... Just don't work if nobody can do it best. Bad art (it's not even the art of what it is?) Really hurt people.
