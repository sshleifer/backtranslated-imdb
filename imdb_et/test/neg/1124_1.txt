** WARNING ** POSSIBLE MOVIE ** WARNING ** Before Christmas, a nut manager decided to attract us by sending this movie "for entertainment" on television. What did God mean was what he thought? <br /> <br /> This movie is full of terrible humor, despicable actors, funny jokes and a landline disaster. Randy Quaid plays an idiotic role like Cousin Eddie Johnson. Eddie is a brain dead person who is unable to perform even the simplest tasks. He was fired because he was stupid as a brick, but the company he worked for was sorry for sending him and his family on vacation. But being as stupid as she is, she managed to make her a disaster. <br /> <br /> All of this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I still have a nightmare of evil action and even more unhappy jokes in this movie. It's so sad that you have to see ALMOST ... But don't. My nightmares are much worse than the other nightmares you've ever had. Trust me ... I hate this movie so bad that it works, humor, jokes and story. The only good thing was a nice landscape. <br /> <br /> Well, this is my opinion and I hope everyone agrees with me ...
