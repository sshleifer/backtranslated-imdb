I watched this TV a year ago when I was sick (I don't know if I tend to be more comfortable watching my TV when I'm sick, too much trouble using the remote control). <Br>> <br /> Of what I remember, every part of the film - pain, acting, writing, leadership, etc. - was at best badly recommended. I could have forgiven historical inaccuracies when this film created a sense of what it was like to work with Trinity; but it wasn't. The scientists were trying to humanize, but they were inadequate and never exceeded the cartoon. <br /> <br /> I didn't know very much about the people who took part in the Manhattan project, but the images of the movie were so comic that I was interested in learning about real personalities. And I did. So I think this terrible movie has made a very small amount of good. <br /> <br /> This is not a thorough overview, but FMLB does not deserve or demand it. You can enjoy it if you are a fan of bad movies.
