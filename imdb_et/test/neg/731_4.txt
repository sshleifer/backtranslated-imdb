The uneven assumption of this flick is associated with Argentina, which in 1982 guaranteed the failure of the Falkland Islands, impregnating European women with Argentinian sperm, diluting ethnic cleanliness until it preferred Argentina. Yeah, of course. The investigation is carried out by our hero / wool and cad, Fabian, who carries his fish-eye video camera from the pillar to post secret films with Falklanders, including his wife and one wife, Camilla. Unfortunately, the indie and fraudulent documentary, this flick favors us a lot of boring tourism shot hip ... yada, yada, yada. The film has no plot potential and it will only become interesting if Fabian and Camilla go through moments of ordinary discomfort and insecurity when they get into a handshake. "F * ckland" is only intended for those cinema purists who appreciate the joyful, uncomfortable, jigglecam oyster Dogme indies.
