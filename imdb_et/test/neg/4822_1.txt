Other experts with the lowest rating have collected this wastewater, so there seems to be little to add. I have to emphasize that I have only had the Cockney Filth, which my children visited, who are calling for a Sunday Omnibus. My God, it's frustrating! Like all soaps, it consists of completely unlikely characters that are unpleasant to one another, but it is ten times as bad as the next worst. The reviewer, who mocked the "real life" image shifted by his defenders, was on the spot. If someone lives in such a social environment, they will cut their wrists during the day. And I can assure anyone who doesn't know the real East Endi that it is 'ethnically enriched' rather than you see here. Take my advice - Avoid the British TV industry's lower. It's EVIL.
