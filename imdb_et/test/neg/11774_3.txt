What is a drug addiction that first attracts filmmakers to offer their own theme? This topic is made to death. Drug abuse is bad. We get it. The drug is a painful look. We get it too. But the dark theme doesn't give the filmmaker a license to make a sloppy movie. Every movie doesn't have to be a Hitchcockian cinematic masterpiece or use Orson's Wellesian deep focus, but it's still a narrative film. Verite does not mean a pseudo-documentary. Even consumer mini-DV cameras are capable of producing white and black blacks, and this filmmaker is simply lazy, photographing any contrast with the existing lighting: the subject is gloomy without being stuck artificially. And even documentaries have sound. Vera Farm is very talented, giving the right material, but the director obviously surpassed her and sucked her life all her life. Addicts can live in the fog, but they still have emotions, but none of the characters seem to be out of the screen. Supporting players just offered their lines without creating real people. Sorry to be so tough, Debra, but some things are true whether you want to believe them or not. I'm sure your next movie is better - but please, not another drug film. :)
