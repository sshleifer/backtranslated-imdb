I got it from The Horror Six-Pack in Echo Bridge. This is not the worst film ever made, but it still sucks. In fact, this film sucks so hard, I don't know how I write this review, especially since 1. I put it out of a DVD player because I couldn't even look at you and 2. Hurricane friggin 'Ike is coming and God knows how long it will take to conduct a review. The film begins with a researcher and his wife. The scientist gets a valuable artifact and examines how this supposedly Urban Legend, known as the Skeleton Man, kills him and later his wife. Then ... I'm sorry, but there's really nothing I can say about this POS, except not to worry. I am currently using the disc as a bedrock and if you see it, you might want to do it. Casper Van Dien and Michael Rooker must have the money ... BADLY! <br /> <br /> PS. I watch movies on movies and watch a new review of Ghoulies IV.
