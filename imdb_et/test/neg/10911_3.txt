and a totally scary movie. Characters don't care at all and most of the time is spent in the car. The dog is the best ugly, never really scary. For the sake of interest, there would be a need for more threatening threats, at least some people you care about and some emotions. And no less, something interesting must happen. Something unexpected. As it is, this film pulls on and on, which seems forever. Perhaps Saint Bernhard was not so sharp to choose the terrible threat of life and society? <br /> <br /> In most frightening movies / thrillers / mystery, no genre must have characters that interest you and want you to know what happens. Here you really don't care, just wait for it to stop, and wonder if there's anything else to see. One of the weakest King's adjustments.
