Why do I have to go and buy (yes buy!) JACK FROST 2: MUTANT KILLER SNOWMAN'S INCOME ?? Maybe it was a burst of a temporary mental attack? But I think this is because I enjoyed the first JACK FROST. It was a silly but funny horror comedy that had some good consequences for Screaming Mad George. And the fact that on the back of the lake it was a nice picture of this giant ice lace (it came out of his mouth with lots of blood and everything). So I thought: if it's as idiotic as the first, and it has some nice splashes, it should be fun, right? Well, I was so dead wrong! Let me first say that the film deserves some credit, that it has a huge crazy and slowed plot. I mean, a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that produces mutant killer baby snowballs that can be killed or damaged by bananas? As much as I love the premise, I hated the movie really. First, when the first JACK FROST looked like a real movie (probably capturing it on the real movie and everyone), this sequel is the look and feel of tertiary soap opera. This is such a slippery video look. Lighting is just terrible (bright white spots in daylight and night colors like blue and green). Work ... don't even go there. Dialogues range from rigid to extremely ancient (this Jamaican man was simply moral, saying "man" after each sentence). And when it comes to the killer snowman's voice, I think it was the seventh Chucky child's game that created a stupid and supposedly clever single-layer before he killed anyone. <br /> <br /> The best joke was one man asking, "Why are you talking to your watch?". And the best scene was undoubtedly where the beautiful Asian chick jumped out and swam in the pool completely naked (thanks to God!). Oh, yeah, and this little scene over the final credit of these two Japanese dudes with a badly duplicated miniature ship, I also laughed. But the worst thing about this movie was: Where was the gore and splatter, everybody talking about? It was many times to show some decent murders. Many people were killed here in original ways, but all out of the screen. As I have read in many other comments, it was really a good explosion setting, a broken body, a broken eye, a tongue pulling out ... but at decisive moments when an editor with some blood cuts the floor to the floor or not at all. The British man (the back of the DVD) was not even in the movie. I only saw the specific killing that was filmed from behind (that is, I didn't see sh! T!). Waiting for the whole movie to happen, and then I see nothing?!?! What's up! Could it be that I saw the cut version of the movie? It would be disgraceful, because only a good number of spraying games could have saved this movie when you asked me. Seeing a lot of killer snowballs that have been reduced as a bloody slate just didn't cut it for me. They talk about these snowballs: they were very badly done. They made MUNCHIES like the newest animatronics. But I think it was the whole point. At some point, the special effects team even turned to some ridiculously bad CGI. Boy, you really have to believe it. It is best not to see it because this flick is too bad (okay, I smiled at it because it worsened and worsened). Just stick with the first JACK FROST (1996) and you're okay (just remember it's pretty stupid horror comedy, but fun in its own right). <br /> <br /> It's funny, but the writer / director Michael Cooney must somehow understand that he was a pretty director after JACK FROST 2 and then focused on writing. It turns out he wrote two pretty good thriller scenarios for THE I INSIDE (starring Ryan Phillippe) and IDENTITY (starring John Cusack). So it seems that the man has some talents. <br /> <br /> Now it would be too easy to give JACK FROST 2 the lowest possible rating. So I say one point for this naked Asian babe who makes lean watering and one point for their fully slowed snowball kids. How to Go to Cooney!
