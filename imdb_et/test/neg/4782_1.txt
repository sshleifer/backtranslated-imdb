God! Where do I start? From the beginning to the end, I couldn't hate this movie. Vines? The vines that make mobile phone noise?! Oh yes, I'm so scared - I'm getting rid of the land! Come on! The plot went somewhere, When the group discovered the destruction and the villagers (who had not been prescribed) came to warn them and with their arms in front of them, don't worry, Amy (Jena Malone) was ready to shoot! This whole scene really meant why he didn't take his beau, Jeff (Johnathon Tucker) pictures of Matias (Joe Anderson). When the idiots first put down the rope after Matias, how the rope was at least ten feet above the ground, but how it was just two to four feet from the ground. I can't cover everything that happened wrong about this movie, cover it. I say graphics as much as gore was terrible, but it wasn't because the actor and script were so frightening.
