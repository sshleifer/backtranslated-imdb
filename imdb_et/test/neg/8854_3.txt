This film is about the gap between the real world and the world of the dead. There are many mumbo-jumbos on the Internet (i.e., when you install a program on your computer, you see dead people - much like you play a video file you die in RINGU). Frankly, most of it seemed pretty silly and lost me. Interestingly, the dead are living on their own - being completely alone forever. It was amazing and exciting. <br /> <br /> I love Japanese movies and have seen a huge number compared to most Americans. But one of the genres that has become popular in recent years, which I just can't relate very well to, is these horror films. I know they are very popular - especially because they seem so often in the countries. I've seen both RINGU and RING, JU-ON and GRUDGE and, despite their popularity, are quite ambivalent. The only recent horror film that really liked Japan was SEANCE - a great British movie recycle, SEANCE ON A WET AFTERNOON. And what, I think, made SEANCE different? Unlike other films, as well as KAIRO, the money and gobos didn't wear special effects and didn't try to scare the audience - instead, the story was emphasized. The bottom line is that these other films are like American films like HALLOWEEN or Friday 13th - with frightening things that only jump to the audience to scare and the plots are purely secondary (at best). For me, I want a story - no cheaper thrill or ghosts than the main focus of the movie. <br /> <br /> With a relatively high rating, I know I'm in a minority, but I just can't find it to be a very satisfying film. Too often, there are small things that can somehow astonish you - but the characters start yelling and crying and acting like saying, "it's a terrifying film that has ever been made to shake you better. Well, I think it's just trying too hard and I want it to be more focused on the after-effects and progression of the plot - not intimidation tactics.
