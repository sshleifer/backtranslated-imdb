How LIVING THE DREAM managed to get to Laemmle in West Hollywood because it is the worst film I've ever seen in my life. I should have known when the first scene opened in Eugene, Oregon, that this movie with the characters you want and apologize for their exclusion from the high school, but can't, because they are such losers, is so woody and frightening as dialogue is worse. <br /> <br /> Then the clich√©, the three high school losers will arrive in LA and here is where the film could have been realistic, showing that they are trying to find a career in action. But no, one works as a used car dealer, the other is a real loser in a magazine sales center. Even where the place is, there is more audience than the terrible actor with a terrible foreign accent. And they get money from the insurance indemnity for fraudulent purposes in order to create a recruitment company in the absence of experience, simply showing the "supposedly good life" at LA night, attended by both wood and bad actors. Cards ... <br /> <br /> I can go ahead and go on this bad movie, but I ended up out of the theater where I had six people and when I left four, they were the only public. I wanted to like this movie, but I didn't find the story, the characters, the writing, the dialogue or the actors of one value. Anyone who gives this movie should retire. Amen ... enough ...
