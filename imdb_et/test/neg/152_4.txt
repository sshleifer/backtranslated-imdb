Such a small sum of money and a friend with LA to solve the problem, access to this cinema manufacturer's highly protected house and office, the establishment of a telecommunication system overnight.Does it seem plausible? This is not. Well, it's a children's film, but the kids aren't that light. <br /> <br /> Big Fat Liar delivers some joy to your target audience.
