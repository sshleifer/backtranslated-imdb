If you don't want to push the dead half. I have never been a fan of Gus Van Sant and some of what the previous posters have described as a new generation of young people was very disappointed and somewhat angry with the stereotypical portrayal of the film's characters, especially as they were used to make the film a ridiculous story that really reaches the audience that skateboarders are social rejection and should be blamed for crimes. As a skater himself, watching a lot of skate films and filming during skate scenes, which is obviously a large part of the plot, when the chief protagonist is skateboarding, was terrible and Bourne's identity-highlighting camera technique was used with slow motion to give a terrible effect. This movie is just full of ridiculous stereotypes, as shown by the "emo" soundtrack that just adds to the media myth that all skateboarders are white rockers. Just a very bad movie.
