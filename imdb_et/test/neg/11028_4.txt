If I bought 4 DVDs for Â£ 5.oo in a local store, I should have warned that this movie did not meet the standard of David Selznick Productions. I was waiting for a real suitcase with whales that contain names like James Stewart and Carole Lombard. As many other commentators have said, it is a strange mixture of plot and scenes that are not quite convincing. HOW I am so glad I saw this movie because now I have a memorable saying: "Don't let the seeds enjoy you watermelons." to live. It should bring together everyone's life. Choose these seeds or spit them out or swallow them - and then enjoy the watermelon - life itself.
