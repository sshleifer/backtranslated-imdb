I am a reader of Kathy Reichs Brennan novels. As such I am very surprised that he even consulted at the exhibition. <br /> <br /> It's bad compared to books. Roughness The character of Brennan is a downturn in books, which restores the alcoholic and divorced mother of her older daughter. In "Bones" he is arrogant (rich in rhymes) who is not a mother in a typical P C fashion. The emphasis on his assisting staff, with the passionate details of who has found sexual exploitation, is completely at odds with the books. <br /> <br /> Considering full respect for computer movement, it represents the US as peace lovers (!). Some of this information is not even true, for example, an active member of an Arab-American friendship group from Afghanistan. Since then has Afghanistan been Arabic! I am convinced that negative references to "disadvantaged minorities" or women or GLBTs should be presented, but producers / writers / directors of the exhibition should apologize. But in a typical left-wing way, all racial slaves move to the highest-reached minority group - the Asians, as David Boreanaz's agent Booth constantly refers to Angela Montenegro '<br /> <br /> forget this stuff and forget about this show. After the episode of "Man SUVs", I thought I'd try another episode to see if it was better. It only worsened! I don't even care about whether the teenager was murdered or committed suicide, and I never follow this example.
