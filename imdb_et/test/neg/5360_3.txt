Let me first say that I am a believer in ghosts and I know they exist. I have enough experience with them to find out they are there. <br /> <br /> What I hate is people who bring the Bible and religion to this whole. People forget that there is more than one "Bible", thousands of religions and beliefs, and different ways of interpreting what the Bible says. Not everyone believes in God, and not everyone believes in stereo-typical faith. <br /> <br /> Religion does not do all the facts, one of the things I should mention in the Bible, that many do not know that even the most restrained Bible user violates the rules written within you. you should never wear more than one fabric at a time, slavery is OK, and in some cases you can measure your neighbor. None of this: "Oh it was the Old Testament, and now we have the New Testament." If the Bible is God's word and cannot be changed ... there should be no changes or versions. Religion is full of misinterpretations, mixed facts, and people who follow blindly, "There is no other way." The excuses used by these blind followers are either pathetic or they cannot explain the discrepancies themselves, but instead use the excuses given to them by their pastor or teacher. <br /> <br /> But despite that. I'm a good fan of "Ghost Hunters" and when I heard this show soon, I was quite excited and thought it had some potential. As much as I like "Ghost Hunters", I don't like their members, and I don't like how they remove the place as haunting, but can't explain what's going on. Just because your research equipment doesn't pick it up does not mean that the camera is shooting an example. I'm glad they're skeptical, but it's like they don't realize that just because you didn't get anything from your recorder and movie, this place doesn't make you haunted or not. If the spirits were so easy to grasp, it would be known as fact, not faith. It's a "right place at the right time", but there's also something that makes you think it's going to "get you"? This show is kind of stupid. Usually it is boring and there is a lot to talk about, many psychologies, but hardly anything happens. The headman's filtered narration is usually boring to listen to, or is basically unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Addiction to psychology is also too rich because I believe that very few of them are really talented. Silvia Brown is one I definitely believe, but most of them are sometimes hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to show it, but I'm still not surprised by the few I've seen.
