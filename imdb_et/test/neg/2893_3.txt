This is really a very bad movie. However, it is good to laugh at terrible ideas and "special" effects. At the heart of the plot is the EU Space Agency, discovering the 10th planet that orbits directly against the Earth. They send a manned mission (they have been on Mars and haven't discovered this planet yet? Is anyone stupid enough to do it)? Most of all is predictable from this point. You can honestly say almost anything about the title of the movie. The only surprising thing here is the manned space program run by Eurpoeans. So it's good to laugh or maybe when you're in a state of consciousness.
