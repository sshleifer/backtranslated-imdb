"Escanaba in da Moonlight" is the first to write and manage Jeff Daniels talents. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse debuts, but it's not that big. <br /> <br /> "Escanaba da Moonlight begins as a decent parody of this part of American culture. If we follow Rebuen Soady (Jeff Daniels) on the eve of the deer hunting season in 1989. He will go to the nearest oldest Soady record to never bag." <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the top regions of Michigan and has all the usual clich√©s, but there's the heat that tells you it's not meaningful. <br /> <br /> Well, Reuben is moving to Soady Deer Camp and before her husband (Kimberly Norris Guerrero) gives her a native American necklace, her happy hat and two liquids that you probably don't want. <br /> <br /> Anyway, she really is the only one who believes her. Finally, he arrives at the camp, where his father, Albery Soady (Harve Presnell) is waiting, and his brother Remnar (Joey Albright) is about to show. <br /> <br /> Okay, faster here. when I laughed loudly, but most of the jokes here are sometimes used several times. <br /> <br /> But the biggest tag revenge is spiritual / indian. Just when you think these strange things will appear. However, the special effects are so cheap that it is very large, there is a big light flash, and then head back quickly. <br /> <br /> And the end, well it's worthless. <br /> <br /> The movement itself was not bad, a peculiar character and a fun parody were good. But it should have stayed there. Instead of getting stupid mental awakening that looks like rejection scenes of some demons. <br /> <br /> I give "Escanabale da Moonlight" from 4.5 out of 10.
