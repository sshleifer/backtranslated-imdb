Woody Allen (who has to admit at the beginning that I have never been a big fan) drove this quad-documentary film about the life of a jazz guitarist of the 1930s Emmett Ray (Sean Penn), whose star apparently looked for a while, quickly faded. Penn performs a credible job in this role, depicting a complicated and somewhat neurotic man (unlike Allen who might explain why Woody would attract this project) who are unable to maintain relationships and whose twins (in addition to the guitar) shot the rats in the landfill and looked trains. <br /> <br /> The story is not very consistent. In a sense, this is spoken by a series of contemporary jazz experts (one of whom is Allen himself) who associate their different theories and interpretations of various events in Ray's life. The end result is a wildly inconsistent conception of the fictional man's life, which seems to have been a rather interesting biography from the creators, who would probably have had to do a better job with it. <br /> <br /> Jazz fans and Woody Allen fans will probably enjoy it. For me? The best I get is 3/10.
