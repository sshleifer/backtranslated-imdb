Why was it supposed to end like that? Laurel and Hardy's latest film, which is a dirty cranko-up cuckoo issue (erroneous credit Hal Roach) closing the "Nice mess" / "I couldn't do it" schtick, it's a duo as a grotesque parody itself. In the meantime, their relationship is formed only by insecure, asinine dialogue, and by a semi-hearty blow. People are blaming the King of New York, but Chaplin's final bow was not nearly as worthy as that. <br /> <br /> What really hurts someone who loves Laurel and Hardy is the look of two comedians. The video cover I hold shows them on their main, all the boy's smiley and glowing skins, on the back with the letter: "This sleeve is for illustrative purposes only and may not reflect the content of the movie." If necessary? It's not even close. The actual film sees them at least fifteen years older than their sleeves, Ollie is heavily overweight. It is not humorous or comic, as it usually appears, but badly seen and on the edge of obesity. He would have died seven years after making this film, after a series of strokes. Meanwhile, Stan, who suffers from prostate problems and dysentery, sees ghoulish as his weight has dropped sharply. Every time something bad happens to her, as between the lifeboats and the boards, you are afraid of your life. Even Ollie gives her a normal blow that scares you. It lasted fifteen years after the end of this film, eventually ending with a heart attack in 1965. It is disturbing to think of such shakers who age and die of painful death. And it is tempting to look at their deterioration in health and performance on the screen. If I and I are sure that almost everyone else is thinking of Laurel and Hardy, I think you are doing Western, busy bodies or our relationships. Seeing them in such a physical state of health and carrying out terrible routines at the end of their career is the blast of these happy memories. <br /> <br /> The warning signs are right after the launch, which is not only for four writers, but also for someone who comes into contact with this concept, and a credit for "gags". So when Monty Collins wrote "gags", what were the other four writings? And in that case, Monty Collins paid a fee, considering that there is no "gag" proof in the whole movie? Over 40% of the film is spent on its name, where we experience some of the most painful scenes that the boys had ever participated in. When I saw the bat, I want to bow down and die, so great this childish intuition. But what kills dead filmstone is that all subsidies are duplicated, can't speak English. Not only does it make the movie inseparable, it also significantly reduces Stan's and Ollie's reactions to their star cards. Definitely geared towards amazing movies and absolutely terrifying editing, it is completely dubious for the $ 2 million that was spent on it. To be honest, it seems terrible, and even though the DVD can clean the picture, the sound and picture quality is far worse than any of their Hal Roach work. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie's "friends", Giovani and Antoine are charismatic cages that stand out against Laurel and Hardy's outdated repertoire. This is another big problem with the film, as none of the supporting characters are funny or the boys' innocent mentality is turned on. The dubbed harshness ("your - fat") shown to L & H makes them a distinct social misconception rather than a lovable sub-anarchist. There is evidence of some darker political satires - though it is not Duck Soup - and the concept of the island without rules is an interesting topic. Maybe it is more important now than ever before, the film that looks at the problems of immigration and the American Constitution suddenly becomes more topical in 2003. Unfortunately, besides the amusing scene where Stan is chosen for "the people", it is not really everywhere. And this somewhat black humor has its harsh edges - or is Laurel's and Hardy's film, where rape is directly related and Stan threatens a man in a bottle to involuntarily touch someone's glass, your idea of ​​good times? After Stan and Ollie had shared their years in bed, we also get a solid reference when Stan can accidentally kiss him - Ollie wipes the kiss in disgust. It is also worrying that Antoine, an illegal immigrant friend from Stan and Ollie, will end his life that the lion created. Remember, I never thought I could see Laurel and the Hardy movie, where they were hung. The need for intrusive and inconvenient narration is another indication of how dirty the whole thing is, as the American press release (the same version is available on video) is hacked in 16 minutes to fix it in vain. <br /> <br /> The almost unobtrusive, terribly done, relentlessly unsuccessful movie is just about destroying Stan's and Ollie's reputation.
