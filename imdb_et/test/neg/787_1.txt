This is my first review on IMDb.com and probably the first written review of the movie I've done on my own - not in any classroom. I think this fact alone says something about this movie ... not good! I am not an experienced journalist or critic (although I have seen my fair share of films), but I found this particular film so painfully painful that my own peace of mind was needed to get rid of the experience. How better to do this than IMDb? When I forced myself to sit through the film, physically twisting from the failure to merge the points, I was sure that at the end of the tunnel there would be a "light" - a revelation that explains what the steppe .-. was going on. The movie ended and I was as illuminated as dog ****. After several rewinds for reviewing certain scenes, I can still conclude something reasonable. I found that I want to race "Does it make sense to anyone?" I would recommend not wasting your time, but when I was you, I would probably like to experience it myself. If this is the case, bring a crossword or something so that you will not be eternal.
