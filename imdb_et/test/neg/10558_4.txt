What's cast ... and what it is wasting. Seriously, if this film includes Gabriel Byrne, Jamie Foxx, Thandie Newton, Stuart Townsend, Hal Holbrook, Melanie Griffith and Sylvester Stallone, then wait for some quality. The film, however, is a big confusion about an unlikely story that doesn't seem to stop the twists and turns. Yes, I think they thought they were really clever about it. <br /> <br /> The story is not only dirty and unlikely, but it is also not terrible. It uses elements from earlier and much better poker-based movies. But for me, the movies that did it really were a lot of useless twists and turns. It made the story so unlikely. In addition, the script is still full of many foolish poker game mistakes and things that just don't make a terrible sense. Why anyone would like to play against a card player known to be the best player. This is what the film speaks and builds, but it just didn't make much sense to me. <br /> <br /> Even though the film has excellent light, it still seems that most of the participants were unsuccessful in their roles. I don't know what it is from Stuart Townsend. He is a good actor, but in most cases he always plays inappropriate. Maybe it's his look, I don't know. In principle, it was also the reason he replaced "Lord of the Rings: The Circle Scholarship". Thandie Newton is also not a "good" woman. And in what sense was Melanie Griffith on this issue? Oh, I think I could go on making a movie about my casting, and even learn more about how Jamie Foxx's character gets out of time, but I think you're getting your point now. <br /> <br /> Damian Nieman is simply not an original writer / director and, moreover, she has not handled her material very well. Scenes often feel disconnected, trying to make too many characters and everything about the film is low and predictable. In addition, the film sometimes has some bad edits that do not help to look like a seamless whole. The film was also a big shell bomb and it's no wonder Damian Nieman hasn't made a movie ever since. <br /> <br /> Too much confusion to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
