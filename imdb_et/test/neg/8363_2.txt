I rarely see such a lie, such a potentially strong story and the most sold book that has been weak and somewhat illegible ... <br /> <br /> The premise of the story is like the Brent Easton Ellis novel - a lot of drugs, hopeless and self-inflicted tragedy as a young Elisabeth Wurtzel (played by Christina Ricci) attempts to cope with a suicide loser that does not seem to agree that she actually lives for life and is basically pathetic for such a child ... <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci plays not only the tragic personality, but also the tragic actor whose shouting and intimidation for the majority of the film really want to shout - kill yourself already and let us get credit on the run ... The director has no help, because he supplies absolutely no pace or story don't know what this fucking girl really is about. The director was obviously in directing Prozac's film imitation, and let the film autopilot, making it an unbearable confusion. <br /> <br /> The only salvation qualities are the lovable Jason Biggs, Wurtzel's boyfriend (who fortunately decided to himself self-destructive egocentric egomania) and the incredibly good Jessica Lange as the mother of crying babies. Apparently, Lange's terrible script, leading and terrible companion cannot be downgraded. Clean class. <br /> <br /> I don't know if this is really what Wurtzel is or was, but the film has made me completely uninterested in my writings. <br /> <br /> Finally I finished watching this movie and started thinking right away: OK. Time to see something that is really about real problems ...
