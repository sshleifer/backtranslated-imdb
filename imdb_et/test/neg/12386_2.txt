OK, this "horror movie" was supposed to be a joke, right? Please tell me that it was going to be a joke then I understand. <br /> <br /> A big bird with giant claws - or one claw - anyway, despises unsuspecting people on the ground and humps them up. Mara Corday and Jeff Morrow were interesting enough to keep things interesting, but at least you enjoy a joyful sniff when you see a "monster". It looks like a cross between a chicken and a Mortimer Snerd. scary. I prefer to think - and I hope it was the first. <br /> <br /> P.S. The Linde needs a hairstyle.
