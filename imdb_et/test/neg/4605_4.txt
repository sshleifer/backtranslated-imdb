Perry Mason: The head of a glass coffin finds Raymond Burr defending David Copperfield / Rick Blaine as a wizard of Peter Scolar's murder involving one of his assistants. The trick, which involves cleaning the glass in the air, goes awry and Nancy Grahn's body comes out. <br /> <br /> Nancy was one of the six female assistants who worked on the deed and we learn two things about her. The first drunk at the moment of weakness was Scolari him and he claims he was impregnated. Secondly, he lives under the assumed name and has a secret from his past. <br /> <br /> Billy Moses, who probably never thought he'd make such harsh things back to the law school, gets into a couple of good mixes of old boys looking for the truth in Grahn's hometown. A little more than usual Ken Malansky, he can almost kill. One big mistake in this puzzle is simple forensics. The medical examination report should have provided concrete evidence that the victim was killed so that Scolar could not do so. The police should have looked differently for the killer. <br /> <br /> If you see who the killer is, he doesn't blame him for blaming the individual, but you also see how James McEachin, the investigating officer, got it wrong from the start. It violates this mason film.
