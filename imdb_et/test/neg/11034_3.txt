What has Rajiv Rai Himself done? When Tridev and Vishwatama-like directors hit a movie now. I was initially excited when I thought Rajiv Rai would return to the genre, but it soon collapsed. As a fan of Rajiv Rai, I thought I should go at least, but I left in one hour. One of the reasons why I left the film so early was that there was no Pakistani film in the film, it was not a Rai earlier venture. <br /> <br /> Many leaders have tried Pakistan but I did not expect It was Rajiv Rai. Rajiv Rai has always been good music so far. There is only one good song and this is Tere dekh dekh Ladgayan. The performances are not scratch, not even Rai Loyal Naseer-Uddin-Shah. Tickets to avoid are once my favorite driver.
