This movie stinks. IMDb needs negative numbers in its assessment system for proper assessment of turkeys. Action is wooden or top; the movie is probably not written by anyone; and the scenes of the monster were at best mediocre. Even as a monster-scenes movie, these shots were so disappointing that they couldn't inspire any sympathy for the rest of the movie. I want an 80-minute life back to steal this movie.
