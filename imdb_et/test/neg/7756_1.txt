My only regret is that the IMDb movie can't be taken to 0. "A Price ..." would definitely be worth it! LEAST. <br /> <br /> SPOILER? * The movie starts with a number of people entering the crypt to wake the old vampire. If the guy interrupts himself and the blood drips and falls on a rotten and dried body, which should be a blood crusher, a metamorphosis and a vampire occur, with an ANIMATION-like effect (would you believe it)! more human form, just to reveal that he wears tux and waistband! BOW-TIE, yeah. Red when my memory serves me right! I tried to review a little random scene, but it didn't get better results than opening sequences. This is when I turned off the movie, I was afraid I hope I can see a vampire movie. This is definitely not one if you are not 5 and you can take such stupidity seriously. <br /> <br /> So if you like vampires and don't want to feel upset or even nasty, learn from my mistake and don't even try to see this garbage!
