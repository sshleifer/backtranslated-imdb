If you are a little masochistic and want to waste time, you should try it. I wasted myself enough time so I don't waste any more explanation why it's so terrible. Be warned !!! Oh, I see I have to complete 10 lines or more. Here we go: every year, or some people think it's fun to start with a small budget movie of terrible monsters, which I hope will be a hit. Cavern is one of them. I had no great expectations for this, but doing so is so bad and production so bad that I am seriously thinking about applying for a refund. Phewww ... one more line of pointless movie ... Oh, I'm ready.
