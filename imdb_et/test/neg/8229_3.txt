It's not a very good movie, but it's just the best Troma Studios movie I've ever seen. Lloyd Kaufman - "Brain" behind Troma - is not tied to a good plot or even a moderate entertainment movie. His main concern is to do something odd. And his concept of bizarre often reflects the definition of my fearsome cinema. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the title is Luther - whose favorite way is not baseball, but to abandon the chickens' heads, getting his release locked. The board found that he had been restored, despite not talking - he was just like a chicken - and he had razorblade prosthesis at his disposal. Of course, if Luther is free, he will be lost, first in the grocery store and later in the farm. <br /> <br /> COMPETITION: $ $ $$ $$ (A lot of violence often unleashed by Luther sinks to his razorblade poor parent who is waiting for a bus stop and then spends the rest of the movie that terrorizes her mother and daughter on the farm). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$$$ (Stacy Haiduk offers some remarkable skin in his picture because former Lois Lane (which I don't remember which Superman edition was) gives us a shower scene, followed by a boyfriend boy-boy who just does not. You have no chemistry with Mrs. Haiduk, there is an extended shower scene in the DVDs, which gives the viewer a lot more Stacy, she's pretty much something. <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (Forgettabout !!! Whitey Styles' scenario may just be the worst written, but the way Luther is released from the shelter throws it completely trustworthy. Ogue is something that a preschool educator can write and that he writes for his characters at the absurd border. like styles spent ten years without human contacts and forgot how people react in certain situations). <br /> <br /> MAKING: $$ (The film belongs to Edward Terry, who actually does a decent job in Geek. fashion Joan Roth as a mother does a great job, but Haiduk's and her boy's inadequate chemistry made her roles uncomfortable at best.
