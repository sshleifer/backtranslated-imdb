As a great fan of major contemporary fantasy movies, I was very much waiting for it. I didn't know this character, though after some general stories about the style of the comic and good review of the movie, I thought I was in for the actual treatment ... <br /> <br /> From the moment the wizard began to speak with its forced husky voice, I can say right away that I'm not going to enjoy this movie. I found that the story was weak and predictable, the poor actors, the effects were very good for a small budget movie, but didn't do anything for the general plot. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is a comic book fan more than that, otherwise I would advise you to skip it and not waste the price of this boring adventure cinema.
