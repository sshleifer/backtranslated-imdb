Although Saturday morning was killed, HBO "Looking For Lola" came. I decided to do it, although the movie description seemed pretty bad. It was even worse than I thought. The film was incredibly unbelievable and there was absolutely no screen chemistry between the leading actors, which I shake almost every 10 minutes. Mike Greenbaum (leader actor) in scenes where he leaves the bill in a fancy restaurant and where Lola (leading actor) allows him to use his boss to fool his parents into thinking he's rich was almost as bad as his "dreaming" about about the people around him who make macaroni (that is, HORRIBLE!) and two participants who finally love. I wanted to change the channel, but I tried to give him a chance to get some cute love story with a couple. He never did it. In fact, it was so bad that I decided to end it, so I can say that I was watching one of the worst films ever made, rather than criticizing him for not giving him a fair chance. The last scene where Lola's dance piece tries is the culmination of the film. She gets married late (even the scene where Mike tells the priest to hurry and then just beats the papers claiming it was made with the film's credibility) and then "convinces" the judges to look at her. Two male judges have already been laid down, how late it is. But after watching his stage on stage (ok, he's dancing fine but not too impressive), all Lola and Mike families, other dancers there, and even the judges cough. Bad, terrible, terrible. It was so bad that I had to write. See at your own risk.
