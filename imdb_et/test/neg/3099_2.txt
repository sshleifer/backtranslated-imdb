What is the story on the screen. First of all, I have to say, don't touch this movie, it's best for you (it sucks). And really, what's the story, it seems to be fine at first, but after ten minutes it will get worse. And that's not all, barely seeing what's on the screen, it's too dark all the time. <br /> <br /> Don't touch.
