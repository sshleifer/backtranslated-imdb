I'd give this film a zero if I could. How can anyone rate it higher is next to me. Until I saw Rollerball, this was my choice for the worst movie in a big studio that had a real budget (claiming Mangler 2 or Leprechaun Hood, because the worst would never talk much, they should be bad) <br / / <br /> Tim Curry's mother needs to have surgery or something to accept this non-sensual waste. I'm not really sure what happened here. The novel was great, director Frank Marshall had solid results in life and arachnophobia (perhaps they should have changed the title "Africa"), it was good and the budget was there. You think someone would have worked hard to read the script. <br /> <br /> You'd better watch the battlefield: Earth again as you waste your time. Congo will make you return to MST3K for a long time
