The piece is good and can be interesting. The music is so big that it became the music of the TV show IRON CHEF (although it is WAY too much and too intrusive in the movie). So how did this movie end so poor?!?! Well, the plot was about 95% predictable and the characters were about one-dimensional. And dialogue?! What person would actually allow to receive credit for STUPID macho bull-crap, which wants to be a dialogue? Most cartoons get a lot more realism! The bottom line is that this movie has some good points, but it is attacked by hackneyed clich√©s and rotting dialogue, so it becomes fast tiring. And it is a shame, because firefighters deserve better respect than this confusion! If you don't believe me, check out the number of stories listed in the IMDb for this movie - WAY that goes beyond what you wanted to find. They just don't care about developing all the gifts and problems. Thus, the film appears to be in a hurry and needs to be rewritten and edited.
