Debbie Boone had a monster hit by her pop music "You Light Up My Life;" but the Didi Conn movie was a terribly embarrassing flop. Conn plays a stereotypically hunt-home vulnerable girl who is in love with Michael Zaslow, who plays a stereotypical yuppie-wannabe man. They are busy, but everyone knows that Zaslow is not married to anyone who is not blonde and built, so only Didi is surprised when he throws him off. Needless to say, Didi is quite embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Luckily, he has made a little song in his spare time, and he has found a tune he thinks is quite nice. He calls it - do you think? - "You are illuminating my life." He hops in the car and rides to the big city to sell his song and make a new life. Now I remember sitting in the theater and looking at her in the car to drive to the big city, and I thought, â€œThank you very much for the sky, we've finally got the whole exposition out. Something interesting can happen now. "And something interesting happened. Credits crashed. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was. Not only that, the movie worked badly, badly written and badly filmed, but ended in the middle. This movie is really, deeply bad film, and we're not talking about a cult movie here. We're talking about a flop, a real jerk from beginning to end. If you liked Debbie Boone's song, buy a copy of it. But don't waste your time or money on this flick. what glad you are missed. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
