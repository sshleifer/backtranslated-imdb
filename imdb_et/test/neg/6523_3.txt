I didn't like this movie. I rented it, hoping it would be like the 10th kingdom. I was disappointed when I discovered it wasn't. I found it just nervous. Action was bad, characters where incredible and time jumped. I recommend this movie only when your mood sees a crazy guy around, but I'm sure the same thing has better movies. I can't believe I wasted my time on it.
