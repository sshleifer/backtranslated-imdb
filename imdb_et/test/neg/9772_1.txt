I think "Bone Snatcher" should go after someone is involved with this movie. Looking at it, it seems to be the longest 90 minutes of your entire life. The plot is boring and stupid. There were no scenes that were terrible, even from afar. If you manage to endure this fine cinema experience until the end, you are either very frustrated or dead in a hysterical laugh. I bought this movie based on another reading I read. I wish I had the money back. What a skunker. If you are looking for a horror film that will keep your interest, see "U Turn". It can be based on a kooky plot, but it is full of those scary scenes that keep you jumping from start to finish.
