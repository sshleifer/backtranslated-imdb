Based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel, AT THE EARTH CORE offers little more than the chance to escape and rest your brain. Victorian scientist Dr. Abner Perry (Peter Cushing) is discovering a giant digging machine that he and his American partner (Doug McClure) are using their way to the deep ground to explore what secrets it may be. They will soon discover a lost world where there are decent beings in conflict with the ancestors of the ancestors. <br /> <br /> Cushing becomes a professor with a lack of thinking, which is disturbing. Instead of being a bold adventurer, he is terrible. On the other hand, McClure exceeded enough to make himself ridiculous. Caroline Munro plays pretty princess Dia, who is refusing her world near the ground. Godfrey James, Cy Grant and Michael Crane are also cast.
