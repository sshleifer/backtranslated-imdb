He gave him two letters because the DVD cover was good enough to buy this horse pass. I paid a dollar for a local DVD exchange and I want my money back. I have a couple of good films (at least I think they are good) who have never seen the inside of a video store. After I see it, I actually insult it. Light years are worse than anything I've ever seen. I can't even recommend it as a campaign joke. It's so bad, instead of making you laugh, makes you angry. How did this terrible movie find any distro? I can only believe that it was common if the authors of amateur DVDs wanted to. It is obvious to the producers of this "movie" to get out of business that he has no talents.
