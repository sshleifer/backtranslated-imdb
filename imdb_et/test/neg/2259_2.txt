This movie was not like a book. I think the scriptwriter must have wanted to work to write a sequel that has gone to the wind and has been rejected. It was his way to get his ideas anyway. The only similarity between that film and its image was the names of the principal terms and the location of the main proceedings. None of the events on the film happened in the book. It was deeply disappointing with the wind blower (both in the book and in the film). If you love Scarlett, don't look at this movie, hoping to play it on the screen. They only share a common title.
