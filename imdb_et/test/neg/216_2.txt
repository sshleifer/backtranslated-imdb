How do you experience experienced, well-known actors and make such a stupid movie? Nimrod Antel has the answer: armored. An employee of six armored army companies decides to steal a big cash shipment by themselves. But as they first start with their plans, everything sounds fast. With such a scheme, you think it may not be at least bad, at least for the action film. But within the first 40 minutes or more, we see what appears to be 6 normal daily types. They joke, they laugh, they have some drinks together, and so on. Then we suddenly learn that they are going to rob their company. The hero Ty, (Columbus Short) is sucked into the system because of the cold cruel world, although he is a decorated veteran, a nice man and a trusted worker. Oh, oh! In the last 40 minutes of the movie, these former traditional boys are almost just a money-breaker who is ready to make each other's money. In the last scene, Mike (Matt Dillon) continues to commit suicide for reasons other than killing his former friend. The viewer has no hint before the end that these men are merciless and bloody. It is absolutely incredible and "B-film" is almost too kind for this type of cheese piece. I'd say you don't waste your time - too bad no one gave Laurence Fishburne, Jean Reno or Fred Ward the same advice before taking this picture.
