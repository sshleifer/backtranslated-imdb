Allows you to get one thing out. I'm a big fan of Bruce Campbell, I have the Evil Dead series, I have active figures and I've seen Bubba Ho-Tep. I'm a fan of fun, ridiculous horror and know how to understand the whole "it's as bad as it's good" to deal with. <br /> <br /> I want to say the same about this movie. I watched this movie with great expectations, I wanted it to be good, campy, something from BC that we all know and love. It started pretty promising, but after the first 20 minutes I started to look at the rest of this regrettable apology for the film, as if I had just finished the tranquilizer darts. <br /> <br /> The idea itself is not bad; two men, not reaching, both killed by the same psycho wife, half of the man's brain transplanted to another head, they claim, disagree and comedy occurs. <br /> <br /> What killed me is how extremely unorganized and boring it was! It had the potential even if the camp came so much better than it was. The plot was boring, even Bruce's natural physical ship could not do it. The word cannot even properly express the ridiculous robot that Bruce reaches the woman's brain. Just the worst looking robot I've ever seen (even for a B movie). The whole idea is stupid. <br /> <br /> What the hell went through in Bruce's mind when he made this steaming pile over me. Why Ted Raimi did not go to his bigger brother, asking him somewhat somewhat to defeat Bruce and not to say a little about making a nice budget out of my budget. <br /> <br /> Shame on you Bruce !!!
