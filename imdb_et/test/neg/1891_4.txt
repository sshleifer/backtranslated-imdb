I think the previous "House" movie was a hit that prompted Universal to make a few more drops of monster money from the cow. The creative team must have been in a recycling environment, starting with the opening plan raised from "Franken's son" and some film-scattered film material, such as one inadvertently funny business where Glenn Strange's footage is a monster blended with Karloff's braces from the 1935 bride and compared to it how the robot Strange moved, Karloff seems to be moving like a cheetah. <br /> <br /> The previous film continuity has been thrown away as a result of the miraculous death of the gentleman and Drakula's cheating, but when Dr. Edelmann & Larry Talbot discover the Frankenstein monster with a skeleton representing Boris Karloff, he recognizes at least some The history of the film of the past, although Talbot has never sharply mentioned the Karloff meeting with Dr. Niemann. <br /> <br /> Since it was supposed to be the last of Universal's horror cycle, the supernatural elements of Wolf Man and Drac (convincingly) become medical disorders. Drac is told that he has a blood disorder, a very rare disease that allows him to become a bat or evaporate when exposed to sunlight. >: -] And Larry Talbot has little pressure on the brain. Of course, this is much explained by the "lot" of medical jargon that is involved in many scenes. This proves to be the biggest obstacle because somewhere along the way filmmakers forget the real horror or entertainment that gives monsters conditions that seem to be treatable as flu. <br /> <br /> The great fan of the old universal horror is rare to feel that I look at them. The whole thing just seems like a movie that's been made just because it might be, but if that confusion hadn't been put together, the monsters would ever have met Abbott and Costello, so I think it was good.
