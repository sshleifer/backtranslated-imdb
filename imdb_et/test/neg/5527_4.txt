The problem with making such a movie is, however, that the fight between the two ships of the finale, the cr√®me-de-la-creme, must be done well. Disappointed, this Ironclads scene has obviously been made in a tub that has grown up with a small model paddle. There is no effort, little explanation of what is going on and what is the time frame. <br /> <br /> The film is surrounded by a little story because all the true stories have been rebuilt into a movie, such as a Union traitor, and especially Betty Stuart (Madsen), Virginia belle. <br /> <br /> This is an opportunity to make a decent movie that contains an interesting story of preaching for the slavery of slavery. It was a failure in this historical drama and it was a cheap view to bring female viewers. This only reduced the positive results of the film.
