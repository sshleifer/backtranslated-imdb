If someone wants to have a character in the movie that is a disturbing sexual encounter that would be a shame that there is a character in a later life that has remained a unique shame, it is now the best and now it's done. Some of the other comments did not even succeed. I don't remember one funny scene, although I have to admit that I had to turn it off before finishing. I looked at some of the director's commentary and it seems that he was as surprised as anyone that the film works well. If you want to get the same feeling you get for this movie, but only cheaper, stick your head on dry manure and breathe deeply.
