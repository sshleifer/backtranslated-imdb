I'm a fan of horror movies, no matter what hemisphere it comes from. I know what to expect from the West, from the East and from the midst of horrors. So I got a DVD in Acacia, and I suddenly waited for an ever-increasing tension and scary children to build odd hiding hidden under the boat. <br /> <br /> The main point of sale for this movie was that it had a much more linear story than many of the ilkis - you get the characters they're from and what they do. You get the basic information (nice couple, no children) and you realize that the premise is too normal for something unpleasant to happen. <br /> <br /> And then it will be bad. The first complaint is that the story is OBVIOUS. I got until the child hugged the tree. I knew where the film went and was even able to predict the order of death and for what reason. <br /> <br /> Editing is shocking and unfortunately not for the movie. Even though I was still thinking about the events, the tension must not be built, because the director seems to have got a new editing kit for his birthday and wanted to use it as much as possible. <br /> <br /> And my final thing is .... the tree was unnecessary. It would have been a very good story of a subtle horror when a couple broke down over a child's death - the title tree did not buy anything new or exciting for the film. So I finish where I started - my overall impression was "Oh."
