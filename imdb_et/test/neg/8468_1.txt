It's a complete mess. I have learned Nazism and read many manuscripts from the day - "parallel" use most of the classic apocritical myths of Nazism and compare it with the full characteristic generalizations of what constitutes 1/3 of the planet. It is designed for a Polly-Anna satisfaction audience who feeds heavily on a spoon-fed giant, terribly thinking about arguments, irrational conclusions, erroneous ideas, and meaningless logic. <br /> <br /> Who made this hit peace? Easy. <br /> <br /> When everything is said and done; Que Bono? That means who will benefit in the long run? <br /> <br /> You don't. You sacrifice money and rights. Muslims do not, they get our bombs. Try again. Answer it and you have opened a big door.
