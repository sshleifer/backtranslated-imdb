it is unfortunate that many of the other detectors of this film are influencing previous prejudices. (ie, anger against homosexuals, I thought the French thrillers were bad, etc.) I admit that I am familiar with the novel, but after about 45 minutes I filmed my eyes. hopefully I will be able to explain my complaints in writing sufficiently before I can spend this movie for 2 hours during its current length (2 hours, which seemed like 3) I don't get wrong and half the silent movies, 3 hour epics, I don't have I also have a short focus, and I am not a mtv-born generation, which I appreciate for a fine and slow build film. here's a list of complaints about my groceries. first off, end. Yes, it had a scooby-doo-esquire, the sign explains everything at the end. Now I think this movie is necessary, it was necessary .. the film had so much plot, emotional manifestations, new facts and discovery .. one reviewer said it well: ".. is, it is a very logical story, but without great important feedback (their childhood readings, 3 parent relationships, the relationship between two lovers and the Big Man son), it just doesn't feel right. t throw too much spoiler here, I could name the specific revelations I thought was not necessary, but According to the reviews here, there are many people who really feel like it, so I don't want to give away anything. I personally can't stand soap operas. The complexity and complexities for me canceled out the effects that the final revelations could offer. there wasn't necessarily any open ground hole in it, it seems like a great book, writing is completely logical, but if I had to believe it was real, nothing would inevitably sit on pieces that are randomly inserted. Too often, I felt that important characters we never knew were tried to make the plot even more difficult, to increase emotions and to develop a secret. acting I had no complaints, management, no, not bad, but plot and especially its development, SEVERELY missing. I'm sorry for those who felt it was the perfect thriller, but I couldn't get it. I just gave it 3 just because I don't want to feel completely unfair and has moments of light intrigue and excitement. <br /> <br /> * MAJOR SPOILER * and I have to mention it ... but when Dad makes his revelation to alexandre and JUST, if you think the plot doesn't fit in another twist. "" I'm not going to die in a fatal accident ".. I PLAY .. if Dad ever developed or even really mentioned a lot? Are you serious !! As already a complicated graph that includes all the family signs and their relationship with each other was not enough !! is the main character PLEASE another emotional pile he has already fed?! Sorry I had to throw it into this spoiler, but it plagued me as much as I've ever been in a movie.
