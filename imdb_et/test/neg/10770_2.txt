I don't know why they even kept the name. How could they call the "Scarlet Pimpernel" series after deviating from the novels? The character names are the only things they kept, and even then they changed some of them and mixed them and changed Percy's relationships with them. Indeed, I only looked at it for about two hours, but it was enough to realize that this series was not like Baroness Orzcy's portrayal of her characters, and she would probably be moving into the grave as filming and venting. Poor lady. I hope that if the next person wants to make a book / series of the book, it will not break it as it did in the series.
