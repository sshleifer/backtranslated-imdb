If you really enjoy movies with ants buildings, eating non-ants and conquering the world with a voice transmission, this is a movie for you. In principle, a couple of scientists working through the bio-domain are communicating with highly intelligent ants (the most intelligent participants in this film), trying to prevent their plans to capture and destroy them. Throughout the film, two scientists (and the rescued girls) use everything they have at their disposal (computers, green color and frightening), but without results. I think they just can't afford any pesticides because the movie would be too fast. <br /> <br /> The movie's title "Stage IV" is a mystery. It's not a spoiler, but "Stage I" starts right after opening a credit, while you can't reach "IV stage" until the credit ends. Apparently, the director knew that the film would be tedious to go through and place the phases 1 to 3 throughout the film as certain progressive reports: "Activate a friend! Only one more step to the final credit!" For MST3K episode it was not very good for two reasons: 1) This is from KTMA 0 in the season when they first started, so reefing is not as good as in later seasons; and 2) this movie is so bad that even J&TB can't make it easier. There's one or two Gamera references because they just finished 5 Gamera movies. <br /> <br /> The film has a trick / surprise, but I was so glad I finally got away.
