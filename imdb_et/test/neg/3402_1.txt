In principle, it was clearly intended as a promotional material for a film produced by the same dreadful director, which happens even worse than this documentary and the absolutely worst film I have ever seen, so it is not done in any way. > <br /> This documentary is fun; fun and obviously misleading! Most of the "historical" cinematic footage is probably the historical film of completely unrelated events that, unfortunately, were cut and pasted into this documentary to make it more dramatic than it would have been. There is no doubt that Waverly is a pretty interesting place with a lot of its own fascinating history, but the production of a documentary for the local market and its related products is terribly useless due to the lack of better words. <br /> <br /> And yes, I've lived in Kentucky all my life and I've visited this location several times. Waverly Hills deserves respect; and this flat documentary does not respect anything.
