Retro Puppet Master starts in Kolewige in 1944, when Andre Toulon (Guy Rolfe) and his live dolls plan to escape from Germany, keep Inn's puppet theater in Toulon's memory of his early life and the moment he got the secret of secrecy back to life of dead objects In 1902 in Paris, when his younger (Greg Sestero) ran Theate Magique. He describes a fateful night when he met the 3000-year-old Egyptian witch Afzel (Jack Donner) and the love of the giant life of young and beautiful Ilsa (Brigitta Dau). She talks about how Afzel gave her a life gift and gave her wooden dolls that were part of the Theater Magique show. But the gift of life was also a curse like the old god Sutek, whom Afzel stole in secret, wants it back and everyone who has learned to die ... <br /> <br /> Late I've been a little Puppy, being the first three big fans who decided to watch the rest of the franchise and as I have seen Puppet Master 4 (1993), Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter (1994), Puppet Scout Curse (1998) and now Retro Puppet Master in a couple of weeks and the boy had trouble review all of them , especially because it is worse so far. Retro Puppet Master is familiar with Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge (1991) and Configuring this Period & Puppet Master 4 & Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter, where Sutek tries to kill everything related to the secret of giving his stolen life. There is not much continuity here, yet, in previous films, there is no green serum, and despite Andre Toulon, who committed suicide at the beginning of the original Puppetmaster in 1939, he was in 1944 in this life and well. Most of the story is about rebound and focuses on Andre Toulon, not the dolls, the film focuses on his relationship with Ilsa and with him who learns the secret of life and is all quite boring and annoying. Even after only 80 odd minutes, the Retro Puppet Master feels long and cushioned, with no real pace and not a central concept, because the plot is never down at all and a lot around hops. Then, of course, there is an amazing decision to completely redesign the dolls I found unbelievable, I wonder why the makers should take one of the main things that made the Puppet Theaters so memorable and complete? Dolls are briefly seen at the beginning and end, but otherwise we can get these brown wooden cartoons that are almost as cool as their modern reprocessing. It has never even been explained why these dolls were used, not the ones that all Puppet Master fans have loved, although it is suspected that Full Moon hopes to make another sequel to this issue. <br /> <br /> How bad the story and the total lack of our favorite dolls was not bad enough Moon decided to make this PG-13 rating for the Puppet Master, whose only Puppet Master movie is not rated in the US (probably others countries) have their own film rating systems) and therefore the whole film does not have any blood, no pups kill, no fear and nudity. It's darker than the baby stuff. In addition to dolls that are garbage themselves, the special effect is also the strongest in the series, with no stopping animation, no CGI computer effects (certainly in 1999 was CGI cheap enough?) And all the consequences are rigid doll-doll effects. I mean, when you see a puppet walk, the camera is always in place when it is waiting, so its feet don't have to be shown and there is obviously some production assistant who just pushes it, it's as complicated and modern as the special effects get. <br /> <br /> One of the positive things Retro Puppet Master has done is that it looks pretty nice, period production design, costumes and props are actually quite impressive and it's a pretty nice movie to look at at times. Apparently, it was filmed in Bucharest, Romania, which doubles quite nicely for the turn of the century in Paris. The actor here is a terrible and perhaps the worst series. <br /> <br /> The Retro Puppet Master is more or less the final Puppet Master as the next Puppet Master: The Legacy (2004) basically edits the previous seven movies and is a pretty funny way to turn off a series that started so well for three with a great and distinctive little killer doll. Don't worry about it, just look at one of the first three and just remember the good times ... Killer Dolls Return To The Dreadful Spin-Off Flick Doll Player vs. Demonic Toys (2004).
