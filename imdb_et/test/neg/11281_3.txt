This very loosely recalling of Carmen begins with a high note featuring Senegal's prison "Carmen" and his female prisoner, but it is a glowing, sexually sincere dance. One minute is Karmen's sexual predator, the next she dances against her unfair government, and then she is suddenly a smuggler on the high seas ... Although the film deserves affection for the first carnivore "Carmen" posture, the wide-ranging shocks that are so vignetting and not supported by any narrative coherence that the film comes out like a schizophrenic, undisciplined "Basic-Instincti" melange, which corresponds to Bound, corresponds to the Bollywood music version of Africa.
