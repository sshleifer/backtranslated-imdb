The "open graves" plot is very simple: it's about the board game Mamba, where players die in real life the way they die in the game. Severe death scenes include killings of computer-generated crabs and snakes. cardboard and deliberately annoying and not even a little tension. I liked Eliza Dushku's "Wrong Turn" but here she is completely wasted and unmemorable.The extreme CGI witch come from the sea is completely ridiculous and stupid The only reason to see "Open Graves" is some interesting camera corners plus sexy Eliza Dushku. If such films are the future of horror, I will seriously give up. Give me any 70s or 80s low budget horror with this modern piece of Crap.A generous 3 out of 10.
