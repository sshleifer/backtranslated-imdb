In Khalid's Muslim country (fictional), his benevolent leader / dictator Reed Hadley as Amir is dying of cancer. Amir dies and a desperate plot opens. His body is packed in aluminum foil and taken in secret operations (the population does not know his death), which consists of his doctor (Nigserian) and Mohammed, who is at risk of transplanting the brain. Surgery is carried out by disgruntled Dr. Kent Taylor, who believes there is no mistake and there are two assistants. One of them is about 3 feet high (Master Blaster really went to Barter Town) and the other is the injured and traumatized 7-foot giant named Gor. What could go wrong ?? <br /> <br /> Did I forget to mention Amir's death-bed American, blonde-Barbie wife, Tracy, or that Dr. Kent has a prison with testers and dignities of female slaves? How about a brain transplant that didn't take? There's a lot of double dealing in this, and people are killed, but I don't want to lie to you anymore: MISSION USED. The endings justify the means. If you can agree, you won't have to go 80 minutes. I hope this is enough warning. Don't tell me I didn't warn you. If you need to look, don't look alone and have plenty of medication. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
