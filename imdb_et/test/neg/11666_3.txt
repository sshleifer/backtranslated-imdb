This is undoubtedly one of the worst films I've ever seen. But it is also one of the most unintentionally fun. I would like to compare it with Plan 9 because it can be so bad, so terrible, so stupid, and the waste of time I laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> One of my biggest problems is that it is Robin Hood's complete ripoff and let me honestly say I love Robin Hood with Errol Flynn and Robin Hood: Men in tights. But let's face it, Peck's forbidden love (who definitely slips it. Although all fairly it was a few years before the masterpiece to kill Mockingbird) and a female character (who is probably so forgotten that I've forgotten my name), the last scene where good The boys dress as monks that foolish boys scream "ROBIN HOOD" all over it. <br /> <br /> But I don't think the film is worth it. On the contrary, I think it's one of the funniest movies I've seen for years, even if it was involuntary.
