It was one of the most dishonest, pointless and non-peaceful films I've ever seen. Secondly, the Israeli representation was racist, inverted and unfair. First, the song played on the E.S 'car radio, which was pulled alongside the right-hand Israeli leader, was "I was put on you" by Natacha Atlas. The style of the song is quite Arabic, but it appeared on the Israeli compilation CD, and I've even heard it on the Israeli radio. Many Israeli songs (as well as architecture, food and slang) affect Arabic culture, and there is no reason for an Israeli Jew to be offended or angry by a nearby car playing this song. How E.S. it seems so calm and his sunglasses and cool glare, long, still being photographed, are meant to force the viewer to see the Jew as revenge and racist and E.S. like noble and moderate. <br /> <br /> I have traveled over Israel and have never seen an IDF recruitment poster because the service is mandatory. But there is not only a recruitment poster in the film, but it represents the stereotypical image of an Arab terrorist and the words "want to shoot?" This is a very inaccurate idea of ​​the mentality of the majority of Israeli and Israeli soldiers, and such "advertising" would not even exist on the occasional Israeli highway. Including this, the President's goal is to convince the audience that Israel is a society of anti-Arab racists that has been murdered. <br /> <br /> The Ninja scene was free and unnecessarily violent. A Hollywood-style action involving Israeli soldiers firing on Palestinians would be the same unwanted Israeli-led film because the ninja scene should have been. But for some reason, unrealistic, non-comic, and violent scenarios will be able to capture images from the audience, because the director has so much to say to Israel that killing Israeli soldiers would be welcome. The director has no attempts to build bridges, depicting "the other" as a person or working for peace; violence is the only solution. This is facilitated by scenes of explosive tanks, fall protection towers and other accidental destruction. One of my best friends serving in the Israeli army and the targets in firearms are never Arab women dressed in black or other quasi-civilian canvas. The soldiers at the checkpoints have no fire at the approaching Palestinian leader unless it is clear that their own lives are in danger; According to my friend, the method is a warning vote, a fire in or around the air, and when everything else fails, shoot the leg and then listen and hospitalize. If the film shows that a woman is remembered, this is not the right method. <br /> <br /> In addition to these inaccuracies, the driving style was also bad. Repetition became repetitive and was no longer enchanting. Symbols, such as a balloon with Arafat, are forced out of the structure of any plot or effective integration into the setup; balloon is a Palestinian who invades and returns to Jerusalem and what E.S. The ambulance being controlled by Israeli soldiers, followed by Israeli ambulances, passing the checkpoint, is an over-statement by the director about Israel's double standard. The director's attempt to show life in Nazareth as harsh and meaningless has been made redundant; showing casual people routines over and over again, even with little change, and stressing that no cast member smiles and is minimal in dialogue, screams almost the purpose of such scenes, the harshness of life, without allowing much room for personal interpretation. Contrasting the "section" of the film, the daily life of Nazareth, the second section, the Ramallah and the Israeli checkpoint, the director delicately accuses Israel, but never gives any direct evidence as to why such guilt is properly I spent hours trying to understand why music suddenly ended and started suddenly and why many modern fashionable and metal racing tracks were added. I still can't answer. I felt that the music was stationary in this movie; the contrast between quieter scenes and intense scenes was actually annoying and not influential or thought-provoking. I understand when the director wants to play music for certain scenes in a comic, but I found that the Israeli soldiers had no comics that shot targets or fought with the ninja, or a woman who had to walk the other, but disgracefully. In fact, I was tempted to close my ears during intense scenes and frustrated that there were no points during quiet scenes. Regardless of the director's intention, it only gave the audition a sense of sound throughout the film. <br /> <br /> This movie has no legitimate political message because it gives the other an inaccurate and extreme representation and ignores the real problems. This is a propaganda film because the director intends to express sympathy on the Palestinian side with a variety of symbols, styles and scenes, while at the same time demonstrating to Israel with cruelty and inhumanity; The living atmosphere, packed with Hollywood scene or intense music, has been shown in any Palestinian violence against the Israelis, so the almost inevitably positive and exciting feelings that music and cinematographic audiences leave are on one side. Audience does not think, ponder, or understand the understanding of the conflict; emotions are simply pulled on one side and kept in a "good vs. bad" cliché chart. I believe that this film lacked the depth, quality and power of other Palestinian films, such as "Paradise Now" and "The Wedding of Galilee".
