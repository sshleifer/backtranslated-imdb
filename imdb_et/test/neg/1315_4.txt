The output values ​​of this movie remain below the Hollywood blocking status, and the script makes it less than the cult status. The tired, formal attempt in the genre of the catastrophe, which disappears with the rise of the river, remains. <br /> <br /> Decent casting is either left out or distracted. Beautiful Joanne Whalley is unable to bring any gravitational police commander to the role of Nashi, who carries the most irritating appropriate waistband over her skirt. <br /> <br /> Jessalyn Gilseg plays the tough part of Thames Barrier Director, who is convinced that it is refreshing. floss. His Canadian citizenship and accent were probably designed to appeal to the transatlantic audience. He, and he can't. Its initial appearance in a tight fit, when he arrives at work, is striking. <br /> <br /> "Siren's old git who was right" is played by Tom Courtenay as if he was acting in his dream, and the various plot twists for his son's struggle, played by Robert Carly, fights him for any response. <br /> <br /> Nigel Planer firmly sees the devotion to a devoted ritual for his shortcomings such as the director of Met Office or his acting or both, and only David Suchet will appear as a deputy PM for some credit. <br /> <br /> The story was enough and and the effects that have made a decent effort. Unfortunately, it didn't happen.
