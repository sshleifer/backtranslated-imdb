Oh, horror, the indescribable horror of this movie. If you can even call it a movie. It looks like a first-year art training project that is fast-knit together. <br /> <br /> The "talents" here are subjected to painful mixing with subtlety and superfluity, and virtually all scenes were terribly animated <br /> <br /> The film does not reflect the Malaysian culture or social conventions in any way - anyone even not talking about it here. I live in Malaysia, BTW. <br /> <br /> Spinning Gasing seems to be tailored to get a prize in the outer film category of some western film festivals. And unfortunately, this work seems to have worked. Some observers would undoubtedly describe it as "exotic", but a more precise word would be "cruel." <br /> <br />
