Viewers of independent films know that once or twice a year they see stories about inappropriate families and they have been waiting for them and are becoming a growing challenge to keep them fresh, but here, despite good light, it just seems more like the same. The story tells of Travis's family trying to restore Matt (Kip Pardue) suicide, a very promising high school swimmer. Ben (Jeff Daniels) is a father who leaves everybody and never treats his other son, Tim (Emile Hirsch) or Matt, but he interacts with (some) his mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) who finds his stash pot and starts to smoke it. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Sandy will also flirt with a lot of younger men, such as a checkout box at the grocery store, but when he tries to buy more marijuana he can get away with and imprisoned. He doesn't tell anyone what happened, but he finds Tim's bodily bruises and also that Ben has left his job. After all, Sandy gets sick and lands in a hospital where her life is in danger, forcing Beni to realize she may have to lose the second part of her family. <br /> <br /> This movie is written and directed by Dan Harris, who has worked with Bryan Singer on "X2" and on the upcoming Superman movie, and while his script allows them to express their pain and confusion at real moments Story (For Me) Just Too Much Things The script touches on so many different areas you need in the scoreboard to track all of them, including drugs, sex, love, infidelity, abuse, neglect, homosexuality testing, and life-threatening illness. If not all of these scenarios are enough for you, Harris will eventually drag the plot, which should eventually gather and explain most of Timi's feelings. Though I looked at least 2 or 3 times with the script to turn one thing one after the other, I have to admit that I didn't hate this movie and I have to act for it. Everyone has at least one good scene in the film, but I want the story to be more focused on Weaver and his character than Hirsch. Weaver is extraordinary and with a sharper script, it could have played a role that could have brought the Oscar candidate, but instead we get an endless scene from Hirsch's parties or his shenanigans with a neighbor's neighbor. Harris shows that he may be a good writer / director, but with this effort he casts so many different things to the audience that the material just starts working.
