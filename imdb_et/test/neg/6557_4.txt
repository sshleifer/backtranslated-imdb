I've been eight years old, I was a big fan of the company's original team. I watched all the movies and appreciated them for everyone they kept from the old series, and further develop the characters (and the Star Trek universe in general). Even in the "Undiscovered Country" I thought that the aging of the characters was well handled and the story was worth the release of the theater. Nevertheless, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is the worst of the original team. I agree with many that the marriage between Kirki, Spock and McCoy is well handled, but the general script, William Shatner's direction and special effects are nothing more than a television episode. It's a "friend movie" and sometimes almost recognizable as a Star Trek movie. The sequences are not permanent and therefore cause little or no tension. Dialogue is weak, although it provides some smiles that are both designed and not intended. Klingon seems to have been thrown as an afterthought. The whole concept of "Sha-Ka-Ree" is just silly and Laurence Luckinbill, an exquisite actor in everything else I've ever seen her, is absurd about this movie. The symbol where Sybok depicts Spock's pain and McCoy's pain breaks the image of the characters as we know them. Spock would never be such a fool and McCoy trying to save his father, who is full of violent, superfluous dialogue and wastes the full capacity of DeForest Kelley. The whole scene is wasted and really shows us something new and something we want to see from these characters. I understand that Shatner did not have the luxury of working with ILM for special effects, and the budget for this film was tight, but it does not allow such a bad story. In some ways, I think this story fits the old series, but the movies, including "Star Trek: Motion Picture", are much better. It's a shame that most other characters have so few lines and little to do with most of the film. Focusing on Kirk, McCoy and Spock is nice but more usable. The old team seems to be non-existent. I liked the old Klingon general and hairy Romulan. I liked some humor and the idea that Spock has a half brother, but that's it. If it were a TV episode, I could accept a lot of mistakes. As a film, it's just a bad and intrusive film. It is also a shame, because I want this film to be good. Even if it were at the "Star Trek III" level, I would be happy, but this movie makes all the other films in this series for Shakespeare's work.
