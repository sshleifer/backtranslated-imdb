As a big fan of Jim Carey, I took the cinema optimally. After all, it seemed like having fun with Dick and Jane are all the raw materials to make this another Carey success. After opening, the five-minute humor seemed to offer this film, but it went wrong when the plot started. The idea that a charming, charismatic, top VIP employee can suddenly start working in the nearest supermarket is just so hard to believe and then to get his head around, this man has also become a captain offender, practically impossible. The actors also seem confused with the situation. Of course, the operation's stereotypical, abundant and unmanageable driver does not interfere to one degree to draw its one-dimensional character, but for Carey and others around him this work is much more difficult. One minute is seen as Dick's office project, which is stuck in obsession, the next minute he is in a terrible confusion who can barely put two words together and eventually becomes a small early man who can quite happily put a gun on another man's head. Jane is just as confused about her role and her character never really does. The idea of ​​this story is such a good one and it is a shame that this film has failed to do the job. A strange comedy moment can be found, but it is usually more natural humor than anything clever or smart. Carey is trying her best to save the drowning ship, but her comic talent can never flourish with holes in her personality. Carey shines when she is presented with a strong and courageous character (A Truman Show, Ace Ventura), which the film never showed her, despite her best efforts.
