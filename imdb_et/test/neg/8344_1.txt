I saw this movie and I thought it was a stupid movie. Even more stupid is the thought of the idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles? The fact is that there are no volcanoes in Los Angeles. This movie should not be filmed in Los Angeles, it must be filmed in Honolulu, Hawaii. Hawaii is a volcano, which is a real fact that this film must be made in the capital of Hawaii. This movie has to be filmed in Hawaii because it's a real idea and not in Los Angeles. There are earthquakes in Los Angeles, but there are no volcanoes. To be honest with you, it's an incredible mess and very silly. In conclusion, I'm not worried about this movie because the Los Angeles volcano is nothing but pointless.
