Stay away from this movie! It is terrible. Bad action, a thin recycled plot and the worst end in film history. I look forward to watching a movie that makes my adrenaline pump upset, in fact, the only other film that comes to mind right away is the second person on the aircraft (Airspeed). Please, don't look at it because it is completely and completely pathetic from start to finish. Helge Iversen
