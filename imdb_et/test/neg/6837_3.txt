It can be the worst remake that Hollywood has ever produced, and it says something. I take it further and say that this movie is so amazingly bad that it has to be. I don't know if I'm even able to do anything wrong with it - just like the election director seems to be pulled under the hat, or Richard Gere's indicator is allowed to walk scores at the end (I'm sure people will say, "It's just fiction who cares "wouldn't be a problem if it was a former Al-Qaeda operative who just wants to return to his homeland - so I dedicate my review to the ultimate fun, which is mainly the scene where Bruce Willis tests his weapon. <br /> <br /> In the original version, you will remember that Jackal is using a kill pumpkin. Pumpkin explodes on impact, known as "underestimation". In this version, Willis creates a pumpkin, but he does not use a sniper rifle - he uses a giant remote-controlled cannon that costs tens of thousands of dollars and can only be saved at the back of a grand minivan, which is a challenge. He opens the cannon by pulling the intermediate head where Jack Black, who is there, watches, jumps and says, "It's ROCKS! That's the thing ROCKS!" about 18 times (I think Willis did not have to disassemble it, he just lifted it, piles and everything, on the back of the bath, even though it probably weighed several tons). Then the scene turns into Austin Power's film when Willis leaves the pumpkin and takes out the tree, then Black has passed through the mud, dropping down the pants, blowing the black whole hand. The pumpkin falls to the ground without damaging it. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend this movie to the ONE for a non-ironic reason, it is a harsh Russian character characteristic of Diane Venora, who is romanticly associated with Gere, despite being a face-disfigured - bold action Hollywood feature . In the middle of the movie, he liked this character, so it was a shame when he came to kill. I would have liked to see a movie about him. In addition, this tombstone is only useful as an objective intelligence test. 3/10.
