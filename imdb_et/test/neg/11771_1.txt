Well, I thought the film was blah 1/10. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the best part of the movie's first 5 minutes with fun or any girlfriend, this is the part guys watch her was great hooters, I thought it was a really casual actress? Heck no, it wasn't really a model called Larissa McComas but u already knew that <br /> <br /> So it made sense but it was about this rest of the movie (that i saw anyway) didn't care 4 and no bothered to look at this rest This is what I needed to make C happy, so 2 of those who care to enjoy it there
