This movie seemed to be an excellent pre-processing idea. "Let's make a movie from one of the greatest and most controversial athletic trainers of the modern time! There the film went terribly wrong. Why cast an actor who doesn't recognize the man he represents? And why, why not let this actor get his character not Coach Knight but Brian Dennehey's red sweater? Since I was sitting in this movie on ESPN, I didn't find myself believing that this man was actually a coach knight. She didn't look like she did, she didn't talk to her, didn't act like she or even walked like her. I couldn't circumvent this and I couldn't enjoy the movie. When Paul Newman and Robert Redford were assigned to the laws of Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid, we didn't care if they were accurate historical models of their real characters, because most of us had never heard of these men until we saw the movie. But somebody who has Coach Knight in today's media needs to do better. When Anthony Hopkins was given to Nixon, it was the same. But Anthony Hopkins made us believe he was actually Nixon. Dennehey didn't even try. It could be a great movie that became sour. In addition to trying to make a four-letter word that "Saving Private Ryan" was breaking, it collided. Too little real knight's trainer and too much embarrassment for the shock value made this movie "season to turn the broadcast halfway." The only good thing is that it was a television movie. I didn't waste my hard earned money.
