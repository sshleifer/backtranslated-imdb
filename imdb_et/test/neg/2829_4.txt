After I got this DVD from a Sunday newspaper, I was hoping it wasn't an ordinary duffle that wouldn't be given away because no one would ever buy it. I was wrong. Sheens act is equivalent to producing a ten-year-old pantomime and the same applies to most. Neill is satisfactory but plays Russian and is not helped by his hybrid Northern Ireland / New Zealand accent, nor are the rest of the KGB characters who all sounded like a Cambridge Footlights reunion. In fact, the only ones with real accents are the extras that offer an odd word here and there, which gives us a good idea of ​​at least where the hell is happening, which is otherwise complete. The "espionage" factor is mostly impressive and consists mainly of various ridiculous disguises from Sheen, while trying to mix with the background, quickly becoming not only boring but ridiculous. The plot has potential, but the rest of the confusing production elements kill. It could have been so much better.
