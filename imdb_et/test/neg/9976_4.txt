Giallo fanatics: Be careful and / or proceed with caution? this is not exactly the case for this movie. It certainly looks like Giallo, whose juicy VHS covers (shows a busty naked girl and a big bloody knife), a rhythmic title and the names of two veterans of Italian veteran (John Phillip & Fernando Rey), but it's basically just an erotic thriller without a lot of plots. The revised version is likely to be severely censored? running time is barely 77 minutes? but then there is still a serious break, the evolution of character and the most sadistic (and usually Giallo) carnage. "Eyes Behind the Wall" can be briefly summarized as collecting perverse characters and extending their sexuality problems. Despite this, there is an interesting effort, as the writer / director Giuliano Petrelli (his only film) clearly tried to do something special, but the overall result is dissatisfied and unfortunate. Inspired by Hitchcock's "rear glass", the main character is a disappointed writer for the elderly and wheelchair. He and his younger mistress get their sexual beat from spy for over one-half of the living male tenant. The tenant wants to put his load around the house while they are naked and have clear bisexual desires. A wheelchair boy sends his wife and has sex. Then there is Ottavio Butler, who repeatedly rapes schoolgirls. Does the story contain normal characters? Well, of course not! The film is always favored by the evil atmosphere of moody sound and amazing photography, but none of it is ever present, so it's just sex and sex without meaning. At the end of the story, there is a truly bizarre / revelation, but it is too late and too casual to improve the overall quality. Not recommended for fans of Italian horror / culture cinema, but maybe it is a great view for psychology students to analyze Freud's styles.
