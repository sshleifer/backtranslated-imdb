After the lush and inspiring snapshots that moved quickly when opening the film, it slipped forever and to the end of a tone. <br /> <br /> Where to start, I'll start with characters. I really enjoyed them in the book, here they were all types and one-dimensional moles, which were either "top" or "twisted". No one has seen through the store owner Lealand Gaunt (Sydney hammy and on-site performance) outside of me. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks excitement, difference, and in some ways, yes, entertaining values. It goes too long, not much to pay. Why introduce too many annoying type-type symbols and then forget about half of them half way? Almost everyone in the book met in the book. Here, besides the only proper scene, which was also translated well from the novel (fighting between Wilma and Nettie), it was a hit and it didn't have much balls. I am sorry, but after that I did not have a one-time death of the screen, a boring shot and some beating, and then a few explosions. Unfortunately, the book had no brutality and no average wit. The explosion of the church scene was so up and down, maybe the whole city was hit? It didn't make sense and the characters that are not being used are those who are these people and why should I take care? <br /> <br /> The story is all over the place and none of the scenes had any boost. I thought Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedeila were good at that, but the film doesn't give them enough material to give me a damn. Amanda Plummer was plausible but too pathetic to really be compassionate (in the novel she was sad and depressing). J.T. Walsh was fun, but the role was far from interesting or layered. Too predictable. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack was too strong for the material it supported. It looked like a painful thumb. Easy there friend, simple. Something a little less theatrical, which I expect, would have worked. <br /> <br /> I admit that some of the gore that he managed to do was good enough, I think the director seemed to have kept a lot of time though. If you intend to make a movie that reaches the 2-hour point, it's definitely much more going on than it is a catastrophe related to the adaptation of kings to a better novel. were supposed to be taken seriously (Ed Harris at the end of the call or character Hugh Priest in general) and were bored and not interested in most of the other times. Personally, the director should do a lot more about this story, his approach is too tedious and hides behind the creepy cinema to become a decent film. The film looks good, but not the look I think this story deserves. I mean, this guy ALASKA is not a good sign. <br /> <br /> I just read the book as you should, as it would be much more fun, layered character development, terrible violence and chaos, nasty humor and much more. This is a version of the meat industry that doesn't have much to offer. <br /> <br /> ** Off ****
