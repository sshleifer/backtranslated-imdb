For some reason I gave this movie four stars. First, I felt that this movie was definitely preaching and I hate it. However, it is my own fault when first viewing a Christian film. Behind the case was something of a spiritual battle, someone opens a border that lets demons to our world and so on. Something I really care about. This movie hit almost the target. It was more of a target edge, more of a tree than a target itself ... <br /> <br /> The main picture of this movie is two pairs who rob a terrorist group to become a victim. Because their experimental serum is derived from a researcher who claimed to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and the spiritual world, couples can now feel, smell, hear, and see demons from the spiritual world. In this order. Obviously there is no sense of taste in this sense. <br /> <br /> This movie is a very clich√©. They took the title seriously because the men who had been linked to the beds demanded that their women look behind them, because there is something there. <br /> <br /> Although this is good, I think special effects are much better. The female smiley demon was literally fun. The husband was uncomfortable with hell and everyone in the room was almost happy when he died. We all hoped the other woman would lead him in the chair. <br /> <br /> The message is something I don't care to comment on if I think Christian filmmakers should have found a better medium for it. <br /> <br /> And so I give him four letters because it's not a movie fault, I'm not a Christian and I don't like this type of message, and I got a kick out of commenting. My friend and I looked at the MST3K episode when watching this movie.
