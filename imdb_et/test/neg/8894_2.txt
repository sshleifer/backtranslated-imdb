The Russian cinema fan has a hard time believing the sub-parameters called Mashkov and Bodrov Jr. Most symbols move through the film as they have no idea who they are or what they do. It is also sad to see that Jennifer Jason Leigh's operational skills have not developed because RIDGEMONT HIGH has FAST TIMES, and his screen exposure is gracefully limited. It's a terrible mafia movie; so much that it makes GODFATHER III a winner. To see the best Russians in the best way, look at the work of Bodrov's jobs (including Jr.) PRISONER, Mashkov's VOR (THIEF) and Bodrov Jr.
