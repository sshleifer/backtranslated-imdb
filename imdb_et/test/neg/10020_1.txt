Of course, most of the films of the 1980s were not worth the pulp they were filming, but this video nightmare may be the toughest. <Br>> <br /> Six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping. Of course, <br /> <br /> and you know it already, they start to kill a mysterious stranger one after another, <br /> <br />. At the peak, there is a hunky forester who tries to reach teenagers in time for the last cute girl who gets a buzzard. <br /> <br /> John Carl Buechler, my least favorite B-filmmaker, made an insane <br /> <br /> makeup here. The cast features are Carel Struycken, "The <br /> <br /> Eastwick Witches" and Family Addams Movies. Unfortunately, he does not jump to <br /> <br /> until the end of the movie and is covered with <br /> <br /> makeup, making it recognizable. Steve Bond (somebody reminds him of it?) There's an early role here as a victim. <br /> <br /> Brown's direction and the script he cowrote, so smells like <br /> <br /> the brown bears in the woods. He puts the movie together with so much stockpile destruction, as I thought I accidentally rented a special episode of reciprocity in Omaha's wild kingdom. Much of the cast is sitting around the campfire and eating, then walking and sitting and eating again <br /> <br />. The keeper is involved in a strange scene that has ever been placed. <br /> <br /> She speaks of a joke from a wide mouth to the baby deer. Jackie Coogan, who had to forget that she had ever worked, has two scenes with silent cinema legends and it is related to <br /> <br /> another strange scene in the movie: she and the <br /> <br /> hunky forest keeper is talking about the cucumber and <br /> <br /> cream cheese sandwiches oatmeal ... yes. <br /> <br /> There's not one minute here. A killer, a forest fire <br /> <br /> A partner who is looking for a companion will follow students behind the backgrounds <br /> <br />. We know it's a killer because filmmakers have duplicated a heartbeat effect that helps to awaken somewhat <br /> <br /> every few minutes. Jump on this bunch of pine juice and rent <br /> <br /> "Halloween". <br /> <br /> It's rated for physical violence, light weapon violence, gore, <br /> <br /> some embarrassment, short female nudity, light sexual content, sexual <br /> <br /> references and drug abuse.
