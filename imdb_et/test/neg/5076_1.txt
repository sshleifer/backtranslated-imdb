"Chaos" is the name of Chaos's theory of chaos, as explained by Gleick's 1988 pop science. What does a book or something related to the contents of a book do with the plot of "Chaos"? Something. The filmmakers seem to have searched for the book (obviously without understanding it) by searching for a "topic" to combine a series of daily activities that go beyond the sequence of twilight events in the film. In this respect, the film "Choas" is similar to the Canadian efforts "Cube", where prime numbers act as mystification of the audience, so that the plot's ridicule is not observed: "Cube" bunch of prime numbers have come in so that viewers attribute their lack of understanding of the lack of knowledge of the prime: the same approach has been taken in "Chaos": Separated extracts from Gleick's books throw away that the bad guys in the film would look smart. Of course, this is an offensive and uneven treatment for the audience, and every literate viewer "Chaos" who is able to sit around the film is confused. How could the film be so bad? The novel "Chaos", written as a novel, obviously does not change it even at the desk of the secretary of the literary agent. How could (at least) hundreds of thousands (and probably millions) of dollars be thrown into what can be considered a waste of time for everyone except those who took money from the movie? As far as the film is concerned, every performance is called. Save with technical failures, it would be amazing if more than one scene was used for a single scene. The story is equally meaningless: the last time I saw the story that was interrupted, it was literally eight years old. Among other things, there are major drawbacks: a bad boy leaves the police to follow the clues. He has no reason to leave such hints. Police officers do not carry or use radio. The bad guys duplicates have no reason to act with the bad. Let me urge someone to watch this movie. If you have any other movie you want (or just don't hate), check it out.
