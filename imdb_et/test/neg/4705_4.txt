In one mine there is no doubt that this film is a stupid and funny joke, but tell the truth that it is quite fun (when you first look and try to do nothing) The whole film has very good ideas but poorly written. <br /> <br /> The story of two losers, waking up to find out they don't remember what will happen to them the previous day. Only to find out later that they are after they are angry twin-girl friends, aliens, transsexual strippers, alien nerds and some gangs. <br /> <br /> Isn't it like Bourne's identity? Yes, yes, I know - how can I compare two movies, but what the hell? They both have no memories; the peoples were after them and so on. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is stupid and it's just for the viewer who likes to fool the film. Reason: · The burden of young talented participants, · Very stupid (after you know it's a stupid movie, why not make it extreme) <br /> <br /> Reason not: · If you want to analyze, forget about it away, · talented young actors become bad, · good plod becomes really bad <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 (rating: E ​​+) <br /> <br /> -------- ---- ------------ ---------- ---------- ------ --- ----- ---- ---- <br /> <br /> 'Dude Where's My Car' - Wait for what you expected from the Ashton Kutcher movie. I think almost every person got the same answer - "Really stupid movie". In addition to showing in the 70s that this guy doesn't really have something to offer to his fan. (She should thank for the series for this reputation). "Dude Where's My Car" is one of his trademarks - "stupidity". Somehow his film is even worst than Adam Sandler's films (can you imagine it). The film is really no-mind, no story or anything. Mara Sokoloff, Jennifer Garner, Alison Sweeney and S.W.Scoot should not have wasted their talent on this garbage. They even came out "Seriously, Dude, where my car". This shows how movie companies die for money, not quality. <br /> <br /> Maximum: 4/10 <br /> <br /> Recommendation: Borrow it for your friends or just forget about it
