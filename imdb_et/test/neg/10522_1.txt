Even my five-year-old was bored. <br /> <br /> Very predictable and excessive. This movie couldn't remember whether it was a tiny or funny comment about the state of "piss-wee" sport. <br /> <br /> The characters were underdeveloped, could have made more bond between the father and the son both coming from the orphanage. <br /> <br /> I didn't like the reference to the goalkeeper who slips into his teammate laxative ... it makes sense for a child's film. <br /> <br /> Typical "mafia" behavior was boring and stereotypical. <br /> <br /> The dog was so cute cute !!!!
