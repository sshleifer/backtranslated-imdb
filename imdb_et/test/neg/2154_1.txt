I'm not sure who is more fun, the people who wrote the comments or the film's director. I couldn't read this comment anymore or watch this movie, I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I see a low-budget western movie made passionately and with interest in a detail, but using a garage with an art deco letter, pastel colors, actors who seem to be falling asleep because the script is so boring and booming on the road of every two on the scene, this is definitely not my concept of "one of the best Western films produced in the new millennium". <br /> <br /> Please, if anyone of you who had friends in the movie said it!
