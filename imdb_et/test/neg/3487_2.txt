Bad news: The Beast In The Cellari Canadian version I saw was poor quality. Dark and wash, it seemed to be accidentally duplicated from VHS tape. It even leaves one point because some are missing frames. <br /> <br /> Good news: this movie is so bad that the poor quality of the DVD was reduced by the pleasure of watching it. This horror film does not create tension or fear. This is a horrorless horror movie. Although most scary movies have a limited dialogue, Beast In The Cellar is so much of a gabfest that the character repeats something we've just heard, with two other characters. It is expected that all chit conversations will work as fillings for a very low budget, unimaginable movie. Unfortunately, the dialogue is not worth the dialogue.
