This film (even calling it a movie is superfluous) is ridiculously terrible. Typically, Eric Roberts' big fan of "B" in the movies, this flick tragedy puts me in doubt the power of his true B list! And Charlie, please go back with the hope that instead of diagnosing the resurgence of the murder ..... you can't blame the indescribable eye candy (uhhum ... beauty contest) for participating in this weak movie, but you are a former TV star man! Pull yourself together. Don't let me start Stuart Bankin. Everything that is good for Stuart should have seen it not necessarily a real movie! Bryan Michael Stoller is an example of an absolute genius only because he was able to invest someone in this picture (money or time). <br /> <br /> Really, it was not a parody or a spam, although it is trying to level 2. In most cases, it is poor writing and functioning, and the camera is working and editing and ... well bad. I watched it because I read in an sweet article as an agent of MJ involvement and my interest was higher because of the case in which he was involved. I do not know now whether the only reason they show up on the film is that he showed, just as in the trial, in the pajamas on the bottom and barely passionate (wait for you, was he really considered passionate? Deviation). And Agent MJ? Is it the best thing they could name for their character? Sheez. With amazing originality! Or maybe it was going to be funny? First of all, I liked the fact that taking the Marriott movie was a nice touch, but it was superfluous and tedious. t warns you.
