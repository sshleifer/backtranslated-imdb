... with a movie that succeeds in opening titles until the studio logo labeled at the end of the closed credits is terribly terrible. It was such a film - just the type that you can't look at when you're afraid that when the quality has fallen slightly, it's gone. <br /> <br /> Forget the low budget that is shown by the slow, monotonous opening sequence that shows secret service providers who travel with a presidential car that has no crowd, traffic, or location. Forget that the clutter logic, even for remote control, seems plausible. Forget that Roy Scheider offers some unpleasant dialogues but can't completely hide his shame. <br /> <br /> This clunker is terribly up to date, bombarded with a score that is just ridiculous and seen by a third grader. All at the same time turning scenarios to cover the most difficult thing about filming the presidential film cheaply: made her feel like a presidential election. <br /> <br /> I sleep briefly on the last reel and when I woke up, I ran back to no torture. Try this Drinking Game: Take it every time you see that it boldly reveals another better movie. Even when I have seen such a joyfully redeemable project by 'Man' w / Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy. I can give copies as Christmas gifts. Zero stars. A thousand laughs.
