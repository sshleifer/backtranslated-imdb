When traveling by train, the woman (Stéphane Excoffier) ​​mistakenly goes out to the remote station when the train stops in the middle of the night. Earlier he finds that the strange lonely pimple (Jim van der Woude), who does not speak his language, is the only person in the area and that was the last train on this track. The man presents him in his house and creates an unusual wordless relationship between them. <br /> <br /> De Wisselwachter is an overpriced boredom with a different but uninteresting story that doesn't go anywhere. I like Off-Hollywood movies, but this story is too absurd and has no message. The sexual tension between the two controls is currently funny, but too repetitive. I saw this movie in the old VHS and the picture is too dark; I don't know if the DVD would have a better picture. Finally, I was completely disappointed with this feature. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Homem da Linha" ("The Line of the Line")
