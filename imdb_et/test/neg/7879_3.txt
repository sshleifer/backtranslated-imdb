Another French film with absurdity. Baise-Moi (F * ck Me) talks about two young women who come together to kill and f * ck. One of them is a porn star that escapes from its community after rape and killing his boy. The other is a whore who kills her solid companion and sees her boyfriend dead. After these incidents, they meet at the subway station (both between the last train), then the whole thing begins. They find a connection and come very close. They abuse men sexually, take drugs, drive across the country and have a lot of sex. It's really Baise-Moi. We see that they have no mercy on these victims. They even kill money for their money. Both actors are real porn stars in France that affect the film in two different ways. They look so comfortable in sex scenes, but they can't look at the whole movie, because for me, the film no longer requires performance. This is the second version of Thelma and Louise. I could recommend that you do a lot of things instead of watching Baise-Moi. So, bother watching if you want to see a pointless, kinky movie. * out of stock *****
