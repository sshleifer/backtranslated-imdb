Mr. Hughes gives us this film about a young couple, if they can't seriously try and move into adult movies. True, it got in every book in this climate, stupid fantasy stuff and all that, but more importantly - it's Elizabeth McGovern. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the best actor has ever appeared in John Hughes movie. he gives him a weight that sometimes raises stupid material. Kevin Bacon (and his hair) is pretty good for his wife, but McGovern is stealing the movie with his quiet, real honesty. For other Hughes films, I was doing a "make movie" fun place - like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were 9 but keeps them if you are 15 years old and want him to find new material . But I'm going back to McGovernment's presentation because it's really mobile. The most interesting films by Hughes are the actual actors (some kind of wonderful, breakfast club) and if his material fights against true talent, some wonderful things can happen. If he only trusts that it doesn't have to be foolish to put things together.
