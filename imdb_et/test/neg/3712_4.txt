If you like a poor SE, (some) bad behavior and lack of credibility, it's a movie for you. So really a cheap movie, but I liked it. Why? Because I like these movies. I can't smile somehow when I see these movies ....... What were the producers, actors, directors, and people in SE who thought about making a movie? Don't wait for "Abyss" or "Alien" but for a (very) low budget horror / adventure movie. <br /> <br /> There is one nice "spray" moment when the boy's head is taken off, but the most horrible thing is quite annoying. The final monster is also pretty cool. <br /> <br /> It's only 73 minutes long so you can go wrong there. You may be able to get it to your local videotape or watch it on TV. I'm sure you have that time to watch. <br /> <br /> But don't say you didn't warn .............
