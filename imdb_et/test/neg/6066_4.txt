Am I the only person to see and remember Amadeus. Every "Copy" scene has its colleague Milos Forman, Amadeus - from galactizing wagons, accompanied by crazy strings, to the entrance to the dark corridor, preceded by a man with a key, until the signing of Anna at Beethoven's feet in front of La Salier before the deadly Mozart. Does anyone recall the dialog for this script: <br /> <br /> "Time?" , Mozart "Common Time". ..... "We start with strings ..." and so "copies". <br /> <br /> Remember that Cynthia Nixon leans against the door clamp, the tears that fall on her freckled face - the same scene, just to replace her with Beethoven's nephew. Even scatological humor (fart jokes) are the same. We even have a cardinal, surrounded by a plate with a plate, which reminds us of the Salieri banquet hall. Does anyone else remember? !!!! <br /> <br /> And the scene where Anna cries to God, "Why did you give me this gift?" ... Salieri said the same thing! <br /> <br /> And beyond that, we have a juvenile script that has an exposition that is similar to characters that contain a children's story. "I'm Mr. Beethoven. I'm a composer ...." <br /> <br /> And what, after all, is the bridge builder's goal? Non-technical contrast to the artistic ... a comparison that has not developed at all - probably because it does not mean anything, especially when it comes to Beethove, who was a technical master. <br /> <br /> There's only one big scene - ninth play. First, the music that in itself takes you to tears. But then Anna has a very erotic communication with the time of holding the copier and Beethoven's leadership, which goes beyond the explicit sexual closeness. So intense, it's almost embarrassing. <br /> <br /> But please - the rest of the movie - Where's the collective memory of the world? You've seen it before ... and better!
