Wow ... I suspected it was bad ... But now I just find myself losing words ... Frankly, no word can make this movie fairly ... <br /> <br /> I'm trying to say something ... <br /> <br /> This is a truly unique pearl. One of the worst things. <br /> <br /> Lash La Rue - if he's an actor in the background - makes the Toltec witch-zombie fight at the top of the movie ... ??? True genius, no doubt. <br /> <br /> Rarely do I watch a movie alone. This happened several times. <br /> <br /> The accents of the actors, the human, the accents ... And the dialogues I heard they were talking about ... And acting by themselves ... I just couldn't believe what I heard. <br /> <br /> This greasy uncle swings so loudly (as if walking in the house with his little brother to the house) in some way obviously ... <br /> <br /> Tits! Yes, there is titties! And the female ass! There is also a naked chick in the bath who eats beer ... <br /> <br /> The "stretching his mouth over his face" was a bomb! Real highlighting. <br /> <br /> The comedy aspects were just tough. I just couldn't believe what I saw and heard. For some time I thought they were involuntary shaking my head incredibly. But about half the movie, I started to get a bigger picture. I think it took me half the movie that was just below my brain to finally get it. <br /> <br /> It was very hard for me to believe this movie ... But that's good, really, I think. It was one black chick walking up to a very small closet, opening it and saying, "Wooow, look at all the storage space!". And he said he thought about it. I mean, this is a good dialogue and good action, right? <br /> <br /> Oh, and maybe needless to say: Lash La Rue's whip skills suck great BACK. It's really sad and pathetic. This is of course a part of comedy. Or wait, I may be wrong. No, yes, I'm wrong. Lash La Rue was amazing with whip! It was the editor's fault. She mixed it, cutting her lashes together and all. Or wait, it may be a camera operator. He filmed the wrong corners ... Then why did Phil Smoot say nothing? That's it, it's the director's fault. <br /> <br /> But that's a good movie. <br /> <br /> I'm just talking about talking. I have nothing to say except that I hope my brain will recover from this experience ... for a while.
