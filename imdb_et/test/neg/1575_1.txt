Put the movie down and back slowly. Functional contestants are high school games, the plot is worn and production values ​​are slightly higher than community theater. Goofs are so rich that it gets ridiculous. The rooms are switched, dead movement, dogs are used for wolves, men shoot the point with empty, with. This is the movie baaaaaaaaaddddddd. When I saw the average rating, I went almost out. The taste is ignored. BTW has no nudity.
