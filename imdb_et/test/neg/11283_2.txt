Although it is advertised with one of the most sincere Turkish amateur films, ice cream, I am more than a caricature of sincerity. <br /> <br /> The plot opens with Ali, a traveling ice dream. a cream maker in the city of West Anatolia, where she sees herself using the same marketing methods as large ice cream producers. She dreams of playing her product on television with beautiful models in bikinis, dancing around her. As her dream turns into a nightmare, she wakes up beside her big erection with her giant woman who rejects her for six years for no apparent reason. Is it because he is not successful in his work? Obviously, because he says he was selling better on old days when there was no pressure on global ice cream companies. But he says it; we don't really see him suffering so much: he still sells good, traveling to neighboring villages, while his apprentice stays in the shop, selling ice cream to the inhabitants of the city. Ali accuses large companies of using sweeteners and colorants when he uses a real "sahlep" (powdery orchid powder roots). Ali buys a motorcycle traveler with a bank loan and advertises on a local TV channel that prefers to even send a newsletter in a local dialect. Her husband does not love his business, they always quarrel, and Ali threatens to make things very bad at the moment. <br /> <br /> On a very successful day, his dirty bike has been stolen by the bad guys in the city. When searching for his stolen bicycle, Ali goes to the police, blames big companies for theft, but nobody takes him seriously. The woman she wears his wife goes to the tavern and drunk. One of his friends at his desk, the urban wannabe socialist, gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism, and without a real connection, the global freezing issue jumps. Ali returns home and decides to kill the poison. His wife wakes up and obstructs her. An old neighbor takes him for a walk at night and gives him advice on life. According to him, Ali can even sell a hot sink drink when the world is facing global freezing. When he returns home, we suddenly see that his wife understood his worth by treating him as a hero and glorifying his masculinity. Meanwhile, sick boys were getting too much ice cream. They testify to the doctor that they stole Ali's wheel. Ali forgives them and there comes a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Although the plot may look nice, it's a story that makes this movie rude and joyful. First, the director does not show a lot of work to tell the story visually; all based on dialogues. Dialogues never stop to show us that cinema is actually a visual art. Even Ali's troubles are not convincing because we don't see it, we just understand it from his words. The director markets his film Ali for a fair fight against big ice cream producers, but there is nothing about big companies in the film. We do not see their pressure enough. The film actually speaks for Ali, believing that big companies are behind the theft. And once his motorcycle is found, it solves all the problems: Ali becomes a happy and powerful spouse. Not a real criticism of globalism. Secondly, the film is a raw humor due to cheese. Perhaps the people of this part of Turkey are so much passionate and do so many vulgar jokes in their daily lives, but vulgar language and raw humor are not making the movie fun. Maybe I took it as if they were both vulgar and "smart", but they aren't smart at all, they're just roots. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe the American people might be like American Pie style humor. But American Pie never had any claim to be a candidate for the Oscar, nor a political message! If you think you can laugh when you see your short men as a big erection (and we had to endure it twice) or an old villager who says "f ** k you" then this movie may be funny.
