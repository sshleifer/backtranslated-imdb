I can't believe Isaiah Washington and Ice-T were in this mess! The plot (and I use this term very loosely) in the middle of a rat army that terrorizes the city complex - at least I think it was just that. The script didn't make any sense at all, I couldn't care less about the characters and the camera work consisted of repeatedly showing shady images on my hind legs or running rats. Running is what I should have done. As an African-American male, I often read the statements of my brothers and sisters to "support African-American films." I'm trying to help but that's enough. No one should look at such waste for any reason. Please, brothers and sisters, do not produce more of these videos. Please!
