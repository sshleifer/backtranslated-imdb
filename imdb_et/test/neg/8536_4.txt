After problems in Chicago, Solomon's family is moving back to the North Dakota farm to start again, but their attempts at idyllic farming have been interrupted when their daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her 3-year-old brother Ben see and attack the supernatural beings who don't let to live in peace. <br /> <br /> Messengers begin properly, though eventually they become a general horror film that is more humorous than scary. After reading the assumption I thought it might have been a decent film because it sounded creepy and had the potential. Unfortunately, the film didn't live up to its potential, although I should have waited for it because the trailer was terrible. The scenario was probably the worst part. It was full of stupid sequences and empty dialogue. The characters were not developed at all, and most of them acted like a bunch of idiots, so they had compassion for them. <br /> <br /> The drivers made terrible work in the mid-term review. They mostly relied on cheap fears like white noise and accidental jumps. The music was really up and it made it easier for the viewer to have the next "scary" moment telegraph. I also didn't like how they just used one location for the whole movie. The house was the center of the story and most of the filming took place, so it was a bit boring for some time to see the same area. I also didn't like the close-ups of the participants. During the conversation, the camera continuously pulls the character into the second for five seconds and got really annoying. Directors create a decent atmosphere and get some points to make your movie stylish. But since we have come a long way in terms of style and effects, the film is obviously not good to do, especially if you work on a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> The actor was scary and when this movie was released in December, I am sure it would have received several Razzie nominations. Kristen Stewart showed some talent in the panic room, but you couldn't say he had a talent watching his performance in Messenger. He was scared and it is so. The rest of the time was dry and convincing. Penelope Anne Miller was just terrible when she came up with everything. It sounded like his lines were reading and he had some of the worst facial expressions I've ever seen. Dylan McDermott was just wooden and he didn't show almost any emotion. John Corbett gave the best result and had a few good scenes. The twins who played Ben were also decent and managed to deal with many adult players. All in all, this flat horror movie hasn't been viewed because it's bliss and lazy movie making. Rating 4/10
