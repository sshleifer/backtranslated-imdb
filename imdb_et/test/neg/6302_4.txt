"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" is always an Australian cinema masterpiece. I found it quite disappointing. Leading actors are great - Terence Stamp is getting older, Guy Pearce should do more comedies he chooses, and I've been a fan of Hugo Weaving because I saw him playing Oberon eons back. The cinematic art is great, but if you've ever been to the back of Australia, you would know that the air is so clear and so bright that it could have taken this box to the Brownie film equivalent and it would still be impressive. <br /> <br /> What is my problem? Well, three things. First, the film does not have a sympathetic female character. A woman who has to serve the ping-pong balls of her living entity out of her private should deserve our compassion. Tick's wife doesn't get much better treatment. Secondly, the scene where they sing to the Aboriginal group "I Live" is offensive. Trying to draw any parallel between the pulling forces and the almost complete destruction of the Trannies and the Aboriginal culture, which I expect the scene should do, shows the historic understanding of Paris Hilton. The latter and the biggest drawback of the movie is that it is not funny enough. Did Stephan Elliott actually speak of any thrust when writing a film? Anyone who knows a dragon (or three or four) knows that most of them have a rapier-like mind and they are not afraid to use them. Now, I understand that many of the dragon races would probably have been banned from the movie, but Elliott should have enough "suitable children" to complete his movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a good idea and a big cast of waste.
