Nothing is breaking up here, but it can be a SPOILER so be careful. <br /> <br /> Special effects were at the video game level - about five years ago or perhaps the original Star Trek. The actors were simply pathetic - some cheeses were looking for blondes who watched over the desert, while the voice in the background droned. And forward. And forward. It was a trek and a half way I actually did. Success is interrupted by some struggles. Ships are blowing each other for no real reason, which is episodically obvious. Again, this is not a real struggle to expect from a movie, rather a cheap video game. Boi-ing! Boi-ing! The ship explodes. Next ship. Obviously some ships are looking for a blonde. In the distant future, ships have to be short-sighted and astigmatic, as many of them move directly from the stylishly dressed futuristic baby, but never see him. <br /> <br /> Then there are a couple of choreographic struggles that look like high school kids. Again, the mentality of raw video games is outstanding. The fighters are shifting to "fighting mode", paying for their wrists, and the loud computer-based voice sounds and flashes in "fighting mode". This should be a dandy design when you try to slip someone. Then you go to a large power plant that looks like a current powerline tower and plug in to back up. LOL, I'm not joking, you can't do this stuff, it's like watching a nice video game from about 2000, but playing is better in the game. <br /> <br /> More banging. Then he appears in "City". (Lame sound trek goes even on the cam.) He goes to fight the future mech robot, who can't beat him with his big gun, even though he runs right in front of him, about five feet in front of him. Obviously, far from the future, robots in the fight are as useful as toasters. He throws the sand into his eyes and strikes it as a stone by throwing stones. rofl, I was about 95% tolerant, my nausea chains blinking red. <br /> <br /> In the next scene he will hit some rope with a rocket. I'm not doing you, tied directly to the rocket from the outside. It should be an advanced mode of transport. At this point I saved. <br /> <br /> This movie is now a shameful film. Just shameful shame. There was a dirty story, but the movie pulled it away - somebody constantly dragged on the "mother". <br /> <br /> I gave it to two because there were a couple of scenes that showed a bit of beautiful art fiction from nature. Unfortunately, the plot, action, action, cinematography and narrative were left out of this work and worsened. Without joking.
