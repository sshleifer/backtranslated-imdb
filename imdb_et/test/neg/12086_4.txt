Despite the strong performance of Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson, this film does not expose the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br /> By the way, what has changed to Mrs.? He had such a film industry potential. <br /> <br /> It was almost like the 1850s Yentlie version without a musical fan. With the death of his father, the leader takes over the governorate of a Christian family, hides his Jewish identity. <br /> <br /> Although I understand it is a period of peace, it was terribly boring in England in 1850 and in Scotland. <br /> <br /> Mother's lady is most irritating with her song song. I waited for him to refer to the driver at all times as expensive. What is Mary Blackchurch? I know that the driver is trying to leave himself as Christians, but does that name mean the whole way? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Mary finds a young reward of love for her father (Wilkinson) and her emotionally unbalanced son. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the only thing we see is that Mary has found her family photography profession. Did we really have to go through the whole film? <br /> <br /> In the 19th century England, the early scenes of Judaism were practiced and eventually it was possible to play cholera epidemics. The Wilkinson family knows a definite sense of anti-Semitism, but it must never come out.
