It is just when the band traveled, and it has only one original member. It's not the same as the classic line. All new players who play the main roles of Ragi, Scotty and others, Ashby is almost the only returning face of the first movie. And he was the only little sign of the first flick, the only redeemable group of three men Scotty tried to meet women. The film is poorly written, which has the darkest dialogue on this side of Armageddon. Even for an R&D movie, it's turkey. Not even dying for fans of low-budget 80's movies would like to sit through this film with no plot, and a lot of bad behavior. This movie would never have been released. Just bad.
