It was an interesting adaptation of William Shakespeare's last known solo game, but in my humble opinion, it was terrible. Jarman tries to change the characters at first. He makes Miranda unrecognizable after he has been stuck on the island for so long, Prospero is no different - madness and self-pity. I couldn't imagine that Shakespeare thinks his characters are something like Jarman's portrait of them. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Caliban is perhaps the only thing he was right about, but then again I had the impression that Caliban was a tortured, deformed monster, but turns out to be crazy, northerly, constantly chaining, not so as I would have imagined him. Ferdinand makes a short look, naked most time and silence. <br /> <br /> In fact, until I stopped looking at this terrible adaptation, they had cut so many lines. If anything, I think Jarman tried to rewrite Shakespeare and add his scenes the most time. In the first part there is so much text cut out that it is not a Shakespeare game, but a load of 70's melodramatic, reluctant garbage. <br /> <br /> Trying to interpret this game more realistically, but this game was never realistic and did nothing like the text shows.
