OK, all the movies are so excited that I hardly dare to add a negative review, but I just didn't enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I have to see a movie in Russian overdub so I have some dialogues but not much. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's a nice thing. There are some fun moments (for example, Elvis's embodiment). The actors also look good on the Russians. Efremova is great and Goldblum is very good. What brings us to the shadows of this movie. First of all. There is hardly a story and an end we already know: Yeltsin wins. So there is no drama or intercourse. They tried to solve this problem with the above-mentioned participants, but this story evaporates. <br /> <br /> Even more importantly, the film does not represent reality. Russians in politics and society depicted in this film are not funny, they are serious and dangerous. I am ready to believe that flying some countries' spin doctors helped Yeltsin to win his campaign, but the real interesting questions that should be addressed are: who funded the campaign, what they received in return, how the opposition was separated So what we have here is , is a film based loosely on reality (but strangely avoiding something that could make the film historically important or just a very good political thriller) without a plot or sub-block.
