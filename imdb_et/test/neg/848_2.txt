View 1 of 3/17/2002 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Mario Pinzauti): Silly, a sex-filled master and slave, who has too many intimate relationship movies. This movie seemed to take care of sex more than a story and a story about sex. The ridiculous copying of the original Italian language in a version I looked at with a ridiculous end in an attempt to make a slave statement (or I should say one line). What a waste of time for anyone who looks at this trash.
