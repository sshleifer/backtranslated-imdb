Laughed at my ass, but probably because I was stoned. It's aside ... it's in no way a horror movie, there's no horror in this movie, and the plot holes are so big that even under the average IQ person would think it was stupid. In addition to that, I live in Denmark and have been in my whole life and I can assure you that Denmark is too small a country you need to find GPSS and maps if you lose. I think that if you do not really do this, you will never be farther away from the city or other people than 3 hours on foot. Secondly, I do not believe that any part of the film, except for the two pictures in Copenhagen, where none of the participants were, was actually made in Denmark. Raba's wife speaks Swedish, not Danish. The first bog body helmet is brand new. The girl they find in the woods hides some types of rocks that aren't in Denmark. It's just stupid.
