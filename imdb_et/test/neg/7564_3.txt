This movie is a real low-budget production, but I'm not talking about it anymore because it's already covered. I give this movie a low rating of the story, but I met the director at night when I saw the movie, and he gave me another reason why the film didn't like it. He asked me how I enjoyed it and told him it wasn't easy to like. My main objection was the lack of a basis for the relationship between the two main characters; I was never convinced that they were close. I also told him that the scene where the main characters were played when the children became friends was too late in the movie. <br /> <br /> He told me that the setback scenes were not in the original script. That they were added because he felt I was doing that the two main characters were not close. He explained that these scenes were not filmed with his satisfaction because they were in money. I agree that they didn't do much for the movie. <br /> <br /> Another fact about the movie that I didn't know is an actor who had a manager writing a script based on his personal experience. This is usually a bad move because some writers do not consider the emotional response of the viewer. The story is so close to home that the writer makes too many assumptions about the audience's reaction to his tragedy. And the story is tragic. But it didn't work for me because I never cared about any characters, the least leading. What was filed was two evil people who made the bush in any way, no matter who gets in. When Mr Youn's character decides to give up his evil way, he seems to be doing it because he is ineffective, not because he knows he's doing wrong. If the film has a message, I suspect that only the writer is aware of it.
