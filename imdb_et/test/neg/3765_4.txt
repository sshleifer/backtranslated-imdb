I like this movie and I've been looking at my copy twice since it's been a few weeks ago. But you have to look at it in the right context. <br /> <br /> I haven't checked on dates, but I can bet that this movie came after and definitely about the popularity of Collier and Walt Disney on the vision of space flight transmitted by W.Von Braun. This is reflected in the attempt to seem factually correct and scientific. But while certain ideas (such as step-amplifiers) are moving correctly, other things are wrong. <br /> <br /> For example, we are told that a rocket will rise to a height and then turn 90 degrees into space ... as you reach the stairs and turn to landing! Then it is said that by turning the Earth in the direction of rotation, the overall speed of the ship increases accordingly. <br /> <br /> It's a fun misunderstanding about what's really happening. Most space launch centers are located as close to the equator as possible, where the Earth and all its surface rotate about a thousand miles per hour, including all the missiles that emerge into space, eastward (the same as the planet's rotation)). Of course, once the ship would turn into space once into the West, its speed would be higher than the Earth's surface, but it would add nothing to the actual speed of the vehicle. This movie is "air speed"! Similarly, we are told that passengers feel free when they reach the ground thousands of miles outside the planet's gravitational field. Again, comic wrong. Most of the crew's spacecraft do not move more than a few hundred miles up, but as long as they (and their contents, including the crew) move at a sufficient speed, their impulse outward directs gravity pulling inward. orbit free fall. Of course, driving far enough away from the ground and even a slow object moves well out of the gravity of the ground, but requires a "escape speed" outside the Earth orbit, such as the Moon, about twenty-one thousand miles per hour. Thus, the vehicle has already reached the definition of "orbital speed" (and "weight balance"). <br /> <br /> But the film has a lot more fun. Someone decided that it would be more fun if they could hear the technical problem, stay asleep for a few days, and then wake up that they had accidentally gone to Mars! The captain then points out that it must be a divine intervention! Then, any scientific being is put into small pieces like confetti and thrown into the wind, which is a cheerful dance of a tougher plot. <br /> <br /> The strength of such a movie is actually illustrating "how far we have come". At least attitude towards women. The patronizing drivel of a female team member is both fun and shocking. To think that such attitudes were so "normal" so recently. <br /> <br /> As I said at the beginning, I find this movie very fun as late at night, come romp through romance travel in space, from the perspective of the day before it actually happened. The antidote to the cold routine of space light, as it has now become in the twenty-first century. <br /> <br /> I'm not asking for an end. It's a bold and shocking film about its vintage and character.
