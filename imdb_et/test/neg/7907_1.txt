Frankly, I didn't think there was anything humor in this movie. It was really flat and poorly made without a plot. Surprisingly, Malcolm got some smiles at the beginning of the X terminal, and that was what it was. Seriously Soul Plane made even the worst films as Gigli looks like Emmy's winner. This movie is not really worth seeing, if of course you wouldn't be like Johnny Witherspoon, who played the dark movie (another sad character). I suffered most of the stereotypical jokes and destroyed Tom Arnold and D.L Hughley with this movie. This movie can only be summarized in one sentence. Nashawn wins $ 100,000,000 and creates his own airline, sex, drugs, homosexuality, more sex, drugs, did I mention sex? If I could rate this movie in negative integers, the beginning was fun, bringing this movie 1/10. Making a T-bag!
