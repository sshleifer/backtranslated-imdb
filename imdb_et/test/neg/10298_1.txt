I don't know what today's movie visitors expect, but after 68 years of watching the movie. (Maybe I didn't watch many movies in the first 9-10 years, so do 58 years of watching the movie) entertainment, not tears get bored, constant embarrassment (every second word) and idiotic violence scenes for some other purpose but show that blood squirting and body parts are mango. Surveillance is one of the films made by people who have no imagination, little or no talent, the complete inability to put scenes together and the unreasonable feature of leaving the scene further and longer after the end of this goal. That someone would think it was worth the movie if it was nothing but Hollywood garbage over me. Fighting as a veteran I've seen violence, blood and brains in many forms, and movies like we were soldiers are about as violent as the film gets, but it has redeemed the value. Monitoring must be dreamed of drug-induced stupor who has no writing ability, no board training, no movie editing experience, or no real contact with reality. Just a stupid movie of two successive killers who are FBI agents, creating a scenario to kill some silly friend, etc. High cost garbage that only idiot might like ...
