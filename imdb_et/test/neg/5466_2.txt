Of course, I like some indie movies. Actually a lot. I don't always understand them and that's okay. Not all of them had to be understood, especially the mainstream people like me. I'll probably show you my ignorance, but I'm still puzzled why it's called a book of revelation. I love those stories of the end of the world and the only thing I saw like the end of the world and this movie was torture that it took to do that. I'm not talking about the subject; maybe I'm the other torture / porn that I've seen. It was just an incredibly slow story, one hour, 15 minutes long, stretching for nearly two hours. (Large spoilers are on the front) A hetero-male dancer is kidnapped, seduced and raped six times from three encapsulated women on Sunday or in this case 12 days. After his release after his somewhat frustrated dancer / girlfriend barely (after falling glass) after he thought what he was no longer left behind: he or the cigarettes he originally sent for robbery. Still, in a state of sensible shock, he refuses to speak, and he continues to work without so much hugging as something would happen and he takes a good shower. The problem. As much as he tortures his own setback to his "attacks", he has equally awakened. Allowed that I am not tied and not used as a toy, but I doubt that "I would be in the mood." Oh, I forgot and how does he deal with this crime? Enjoy as many women as she can to try the birthmarks or tats of criminals. I see where they go with it? show male rape from male POV. Well, you don't know this man, really. Only a sustained grace was a good act of LifetimeTV dancer / cancer teacher. But even he couldn't save the movie.
