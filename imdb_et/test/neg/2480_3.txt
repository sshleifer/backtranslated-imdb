I have seen every episode and the characters have remained the same because they have been thinking, there is no evolution of character in 5 years (pregnancy is not development if you are still the same daddy girl, only now Delinda throws Danny because Dad is not around) Sam Never change or grow, which makes her boring, repetitive, and just as annoying in his illness after the 3rd season, Danny is a typical soft character that everyone in his life orders (he has no principles) his morals), especially Mary and Delinda. The old boring clich√© that they won't let them turn on and off cannot really get bored very quickly. <br /> <br /> James Cann can act and his character is good to look at, he is just another hacker's dream, a former CIA person with great contacts and training, etc. so he can stop any previous known thief or a scammer, even though the cameras can't do half of the time for a while, but after five years, the writers are buggy, why? Because they have all this expensive and high-tech technology, but no easy walkie talkie (communication is fast and easy), you never see walking on the floor when the situation is there, and maybe everything is easy there. <br /> <br /> The plots move very quickly from fraud and casino robbery in one way or another, to the terrible typical boys of American boys on ships, the same thing as the world-wide deaths, they have sex, but I hate you, I I've always loved you, I think I'll do it, but I love him / her, but what if maybe one day blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> I recommend 'Hotel Babylon' to people like Las Vegas who are so much more because the characters are interesting and not forced to cure for less than 6 months a year. <br /> <br /> Am I happy to be British? I see the same actors in 5 different stages rather than 5 years consistently in the same situation.
