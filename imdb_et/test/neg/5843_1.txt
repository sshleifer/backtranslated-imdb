It was one of the biggest mess I ever had to look at. I mean seriously. How would somebody else feel they were in Woody Harrelson's shoes and your husband would also think it would be a good idea for another boy to sleep even for a million dollars. After all, he talked about it in bed and said it would be good for them because he could build his house or whatever it was. Woody did not fully accept this until he spoke to him. How do you trust him? Who the hell would think if they were married? I don't care when they were desperate. This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life. Then he slips on him. Obviously he had no right to trust him, except for the fact that his wife just got up with another guy who is very rich and beautiful. Wait and wait, he should ask HER after the divorce, so he can be with him he's tall. Of course, Woody has no right to say anything to him or to trust him, especially after he still has a Roy Hobb card in his wallet. Then, at the end of the movie, he's probably so in love with Woody and leaves him so much that he's not going to leave Hobbs before he made a ridiculously stupid story to try to leave him, and he's bleeding thanks to Hobbs ???? Are you kidding me? Was he under contract like his sex slave or something? I mean what air? Oh, and wait for it to improve. He can recognize him before his car leaves. Yeah, he's not a whore. Thanks, thank you for letting me go, let me do that for the last time for good oil. Smooch smooch, smooch, although I'm still married to the boy I left the rich boy. I've never seen it in my life. How should we feel hell after this terrible end? What should this film represent? NOT A COMPLETE LIFT! It was the most pointless film I've ever seen in my life. Two pathetic desperate people. If I were Woody, I would say he was going to sink into the water they had. Apparently he had no self-respect. What the hell Roy Hobbs was thinking about, taking this terrible role. I feel after watching it. This movie was so bad, it was really ridiculous. I want these two hours back from my life to look at this **** piece.
