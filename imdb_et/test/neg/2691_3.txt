I have to admit that although I am a fan of Shakespeare, I never knew this game. And what I really can't say is whether it's a poor customization or a bad choice for a movie. There are some nice companies, but filling is very tough and the plot is obvious. The theme of the game is the nature of debt, using the financial idea of ​​debt and justice as a metaphor for emotional issues. This becomes clear when the ring issue becomes more important than the business associated with Shylock, which, unfortunately, falls into an anti-Semitic garden, despite Bard's best efforts to save him with a few nice monologues. <br /> <br /> Outside Jeremy Irons' dignified move, I didn't think the bunch had a decent performance. Pacino Yiddish consists of a slight twist at the end of each announcement, and some of the better Shylock scenes are reduced to standard variations "Pacino gets angry" in the scene his fans know and love. But Lynn Collins is completely embarrassing, as far as I would have thought they had taken pictures early. If he's an incognito man, it's hard not to laugh at all the things we shouldn't laugh at. When Joseph Fiennes stood there trying to look sincere and complicated, it is not difficult not to make devastating comparisons with Gwyneth Paltrow's performance "Shakespeare in Love". But the big problem that all moves in this movie is simply the lack of emotional focus. It is really hard to say whether this film is trying to be a somewhat serious comedy or a strange silly drama. Certainly, a good amount of summer stock would laugh more than the material production. The actors seem embarrassed that they are trying humor, and not sure where to put the dramatic and comic pressure. All this is basically the fault of the director Michael Radford, who seems to think the material is much harder than it seems to me.
