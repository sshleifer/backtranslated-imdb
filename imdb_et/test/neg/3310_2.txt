Great music, but aren't these people PATET?!? True period piece "Trippy Sixties", and it was left behind by me. The director paints the wrong side of the life of the jetset and soaps the grooves of the hornet. When the culture of time made five people to do these things, it seems to me that it was all a journey that was not a discovery but a despair. I was trying to really try this movie, but these people are not on my page anywhere. Yes, it would be nice to see the world, go away for a while, but I always plan to come back. Drugs are not the cause of the fall of these symbols, is it their bad attitude? these men passionately drink their poison. They cheapen their lives and ultimately cheap travel that is life. Has romance ever been so dark? <br /> <br /> Health: Interesting landscapes. Pink Floyd's great soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Warnings: Dated. Drugs. Depressing. Absolutely insignificant characters; they are not the kids of the flower. <br /> <br /> Only curious as most packages are a Pink Floyd connection. (Rare Floyd stories have never been heard before FM is not what it was.) Rating: Two Stars.
