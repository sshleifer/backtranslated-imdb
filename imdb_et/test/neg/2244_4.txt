The first half of this movie was pretty good. It was interesting and tense. The other half was pretty bad. The comedy revenge story came in full circle and we see a lot of comic Nazi characters and some badly acting "good guys" blew them out. There's a lot of violence in this movie. I'm not violent about violence, but I think it should have at least some purpose in the movie. There was little violence here, except to create a genre movie where we see many people mowed with rifles. We should be interested in this. <br /> <br /> I recently looked at reservoir dogs. There was a film where violence was used effectively. It was a realistic film created by the world. There was never a general sound effect. It was a criminal movie that played it directly. Inglorious Basterds should have played it directly, but not. I drove my eyes on how violence was exaggerated with sound effects and additional bullets on the head and face. just Nazi hunters. We really can't get any of them because they are too busy to cut the scalp and face people. It's all about "revenge" and very little. <br /> <br /> There were 2 1/2 hours to work here, but few bombs were really thoroughly studied. It seems that it was just a revenge that was pure and simple. We saw it on Tarantino's last flick "Death Proof", which I didn't care about. It has the same problems. The characters were almost interchangeable. <br /> <br /> The first half was pretty good again. I wanted to see what the exploitation of Inglorious Basterdside is all over Europe. I was presented with a lot of camel-film resistance movement, which was a revenge for some comic book Nazis when they all went to the first premiere of a movie in France.
