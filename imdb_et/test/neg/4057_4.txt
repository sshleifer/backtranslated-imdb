It is amazing what you see when you wake up at 2 and turn on the TV. I didn't know they showed such movies. I immediately thought about Roger Corman, who repeatedly used films or used other films for his films. <br /> <br /> Making this movie can just shake the corners of the camera and add some time and a XXX movie. <br /> <br /> There was no story, just a minimal dialogue that led to removal and sex. I bet there were no 100 words in the whole movie, but there were certainly a lot of great busts and hot lesbian activities. There was also a man / woman action, but it was only about 25% of the movie. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing to remember was watching a movie that might be of interest to those who buy hi-def DVDs. Sony refused to license Betamax to adult filmmakers and adult films came out of VHS. You can guess what happened to the beta version when millions of videos are made by the adult film industry. Sony has again refused to license Blu-ray to the adult film industry and have signed a deal with Toshiba. You can guess which high def system will disappear.
