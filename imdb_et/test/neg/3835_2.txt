I admit it now. This is one of the films ever made. But in the defense of Mr Sjogren, "not really" was a reasonable all bad! <br /> <br /> And you have to love the effort to go to Sweden to find a sweet Swedish 15-year-old blonde who speaks Swedish as a Henry Jewish mother (dennis bunker). <br /> <br /> What makes this scene so perfect that Henry's father meets a German Swedish-speaking girl in German ... for a mother, this is a woman who has no experience but still produces the most convincing results! <br /> <br /> All and all, this Flick is nostalgia for me, it is ultimately posting the IMDb database. : D <br /> <br /> // Feelin like a movie star *
