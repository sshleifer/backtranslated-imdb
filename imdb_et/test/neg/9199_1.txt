It's just a bad movie. Not as bad as R.I.C.C.O. but bad. It got me hooked to a beginner, then totally lost me after that. Action was the way out, then the way goes out. Don't see this movie at all costs, TRUST MY ALL MY HEART !! The brothers are not the following HUGHES BROTHERS who really did great movies like DEAD PRESIDENTS, HELL, AMERICAN PIMP and MENACE II SOCIETY. The only person who watched me was the action of Campbell, Paris, who is a great actor one day when he makes better films than it did.Christina Caparoula did a good job of what he got. I hope FITTEST is 10 times better than this piece!
