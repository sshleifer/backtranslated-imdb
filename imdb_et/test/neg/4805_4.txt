It was only the second year of the Academy, but they already voted politically - Jeanne Eagels' brilliant performance in this madness at an early stage had to make the Oscar nominee and the statue went to the worst achievement - Mary Pickford's COQUETTES. The only existing print was a print job with no music or final editing, but wherever it was shown, Eagels strikes with its amazing and powerful performance. He is so convincing to the witness that although we know he is lying through his teeth (we did after he saw him kill), we believe in our innocence, like jurors, before we suddenly try ourselves. It's a big deal. The movie must be made available on video so that the world can enjoy this terrible activity again. (Jeanne's silent existence in archive print - MAN, WOMAN AND SIN - and his only story, JEALOUSY, is "lost", so it's the only document we have about him. In the early 1970s, NYC's archives for the Village Voice full-page review, worshiping Eagels' performance).
