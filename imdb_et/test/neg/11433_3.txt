In my opinion, a good documentary - especially about controversial political issues - should be informative and as impartial as possible. The point should be to reveal the truth. Above all, it involves involving experts and representatives of all parties on the topics to be interviewed. This movie has failed in this respect. Most of the interviews in this film consist of "outside men" explaining the peace issue on the Holy Land. The assumed object of the film itself does not provide any serious treatment at all. For most interviews, the interviewer just waits for an approach and asks general questions like "what do you think on the wall?" - She doesn't accidentally approach people near the wall or ask them how it has been directly affected. Outside one interviewee, the general of Israel, who is responsible for building a wall, we have no "experts" on this topic who would give us a wall context (eg how and when the project started, whether it was successful, what groups are successful) and what the project is about etc.) <br /> <br /> Outside the interviews, a very large part of the film is made up of frames from longer, outstanding scenes, such as wall-to-frame shots. the wall and the people who get off the bus. I think these pictures take too much time. It's nice to see what a wall looks like, but filming a wall (and only a wall) for 20-30 minutes is too big. It is clear that these shots (along with the Arabic music that suffers from mourning) are only involved to make the viewers feel comfortable against the wall.
