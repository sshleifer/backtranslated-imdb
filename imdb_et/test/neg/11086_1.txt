So you have a spoiler warning --- but I argue that you won't get spoiled for what's already rotten. I assume they changed the name "The Cavern" just when the "WIthIn" reputation was before. <br /> <br /> After renting this movie cable, I kept my household waste month and sent it to the writer / director. He had delivered his garbage to my home, so I thought it was fair to do it back. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a suggestion that the scene is in the Kazakh desert. I'm not sure why they chose Kazakhstan; maybe the writer is a fan of Ali G Show. But they should have been in the caves, because Kazakhstan was probably not outside. It was the first idea that I was going to hate the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has no redemption features except one: it's consistent. Everything is terrible. Writing, directing, acting, cinematography --- all aspects are just bad. And I like bad movies, funny movies, B-horror movies. . . but it was just bad. And stupid. And hackneyed. And predictable. And boring. <br /> <br /> To get to know the movie, go to your laundry room with 5 friends and turn off the lights. Put the flashlight (on) in your dryer and start it tumbling. Now you are all yelling and yelling at the top of your lungs. That's right. <br /> <br /> For complete reinstatement, 6 out of 6 people in the laundry room have died on the floor. Toss Karo syrup for them. Turn the lights on again (stop the dryer). Now enter the room with the gorilla costume and rape the last person. <br /> <br /> FIN <br /> <br /> ADD: Reading other comments, many find this movie a remarkable little budget. It's not remarkable. Making an amazing movie with a huge budget is significant (Waterworld). Making a good movie with a low budget is remarkable (like Blair Witch, which I enjoyed thoroughly). Making a budget with a low budget is not a little surprising, and you can expect more than these people still make movies because I can't imagine someone giving them money. br /> <br /> Is a low budget an excuse for a terrible movie? No, and this is definitely no reason to look at it. Would you eat sandwiches from dog manure just because it was cheap? <br /> <br /> IMDb rating for this movie is interesting to watch over time. It should go further down, but only if the number of unsuspecting innocent viewers can exceed the ability of filmmakers to ask their personal friends to give him 10 stars.
