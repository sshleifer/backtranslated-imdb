It was a terrible, boring film, even a documentary. Sometimes it gave an overview of life and it also had humorous moments, but generally it was not worth seeing. Every time I began to feel sympathy with Mark and began to hope he was successful, I would be disappointed by his lack of responsibility and the abuse of drugs and alcohol.
