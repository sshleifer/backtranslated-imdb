This film has 7.0 ratings on IMDb, so even I felt that its synopsis was rotten. I decided to try it. Which waste is 100 minutes. First, the 80s was not a good decade for the crime and thriller genre. Most of these, these days, were badly made with fool (if they were), so there are very few who can stand out, and even if they were good, they are still not very good. The hit, however, suffers from everything that made foolish crime images foolish. It has a poor character, an unlikely plot and is not written or guided properly, and if you have such shortcomings, it does not work. Stephen Frears often tried to imitate the new wave of French in English-style filmmaking and two were not suitable. <br /> <br /> First of all, Terence Stamp has been hiding for 10 years because she admitted her former partners to crime. He hides in Spain, in all places. Finally, he is caught and when the first stupid Spanish criminals have been kidnapped, he has to drive away only two of the hit men who should deal with him. These two are John Hurt, who should be hard boiled, a stone cold killer, and Tim Roth (in his first role) as a devil trainee. They do not kill Stamp right away, they first command the "three Amigos", they should not have hired, and then they travel to the temple in Paris because one of the friends he confessed wants to confront. OK it is possible. But even if Stamp is such a dangerous indicator that they had to hire four men to win him, they do not bind him, do not make him in any way incapacitated and ride with him as he is one of his friends. The Stamp has no objections to Paris, but does not use one and a half options, as these "specialists" offer him to escape. If it seems that Tim Roth is just a schoolboy who makes the idea of ​​a high-crime boss, where he has come across, like John Hurt, even more unlikely, especially in such an important job. But if John Hurt himself is not that hard core, he spends 20 minutes of movie, killing or not killing the remainder of Australia, played by Bill Hunter, whose only purpose in this film is to introduce lovely Laura Del Sol, his lover (whom he says is 15 but he looks more like 25) and whose role in the story and the ability to act suggests that he was offered a role, but based on the fact that he was then the mistress of the director or producer. After much debate, Hurt kills Australia but takes his mistress for no apparent reason. If she wants to kill her, but Roth convinces her not to do so with her "fine ways", so she even tolerates her, bites her and scratches her all over the film, she remains deeply buried. <Br /> <br /> If you have common idiotic scenes, like when Hurt and Roth lock the car from the outside, trying to prevent people from getting out?!?! Anyway, the movie will drag on. Tim Roth is sleeping, watching Terence Stamp with his gun on his chest, and Stamp is waiting for a waterfall, looking at the waterfall. When the whole plot reaches the point where everything we've seen in the last hour and 20 minutes just goes through the window. To sum up, the whole point where Stamp is not being killed (except for the movie) is to bring him to Paris so his former partner has the last word with him. And the whole point that doesn't run in him is that he's ready to die, saying, "It's just a moment. We're here. Then we're not here. We're somewhere else ... maybe. Why should we to be scared? ”But my friends here is where the plot turns, Hurt kills the man in Spain, and we ask why we struggle and drive every day, he could have done it in the first 15 minutes and if his philosophy contradicts, the temple is very afraid of killing, so we ask again why he didn't run and had many opportunities. Roth is also killed, but he shouldn't be in the movie at all, and Del Sol, he's only allowed to play a role in this movie for romantic (read sexual) reasons, so he's still alive, even when he attacked Hurt for the 15th time in the movie. He killed everyone else but not him, he must have the maximum screen appearance. The film was made from the shoe strings budget and it shows, but if you don't have the story and the cardboard testimonials, it will show even more. And yes, Fernando Ray will appear and will go through the movie as an asterisk, which has one tone dialog. Awful
