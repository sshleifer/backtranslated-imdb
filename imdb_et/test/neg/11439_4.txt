Quite a light horror movie; if not a few sexual scenes, it would have been just a TV movie. The holes in the image are plentiful (one example: why would a 18th-century secret road lead to the ground floor of a house burnt down and a new building laid 200 years later?) That anyone whose IQ is larger than their shoe size does not it ... <br /> <br /> It's some fun moments, but in general it's a sub-par movie that was able to get Roy Scheider because his bills were due. If you are looking for an extremely formulaic, predictable film that can offer some laugh, it may be worth it. If not, it's not for you.
