The figure of the Austrian Empress Elizabeth (1837-1898) is indeed mostly related to the trilogy of Romy Schneider and Sissi, Ernst Marischka (1950), where beauty, tenderness, sweetness, as well as history ever exist. It was Sissi, maybe some myth; however, a powerful imagination. The spirit of Habsburg and the spirit of simplicity and simplicity in Bavaria influenced many of these films. They just have a soul. But the film by Jean Daniel Verhaeghe, made 50 years later, seems to be the false image of the Empress and his life. It seems to be an attempt to show something different to show some realism as a sweetness treatment; it doesn't happen how much to add but leaves the whole story a lot. Let me analyze this in more detail. <br /> <br /> In September 1898, Sissi begins a harbor in Geneva. He accompanied his judge to visit Dr. Mayer (Didier Bezace), whom he intends to talk about throughout his life to find himself in this tragic life. Activities include setbacks to important moments in Sissi's life, but these moments are chaotic, and therefore someone who is not very aware of Austrian history may become completely misleading or confused. Great attention is paid to Sissi's bad marriage with Emperor Franz Josef. Her wedding night scene is a failure. No one met such a empire (I mean undressing and paying). Misunderstanding of guilt is right historical, but the points that his views are different from other judges are not real. Where is his desire for peace? Where is his love for his people? Where is his charity? Sissi seems to be quite elegant, modern, liberal (21st century). He takes care of his appearance, which is not historically true. Siss had an inner life that wasn't shown in the movie. "If women wear trousers," the sentence he says, which is the image of the guerrilla in the film. Sissi ignores the monarchy, which is a notable criticism of the film about the Austrian Empire. What's more, he partially accepts anarchist movements and, to my surprise, he accuses his husband, Emperor Franz Josef, of their son Rudolph's death. Where is the history of Sissi in Mayerling? Sissi's relationship with Sophie, mother's law, is better, but the scene of Sophie's death seems barely genuine and the conversation is a little clich√©. <br /> <br /> Sorry to criticize so much, but another important aspect of the film that I find weak is performances. Although Arielle Dombasle has his own inner moments, he does not generally meet this role. She looks like a "femme fa tale" as a tragic empress. His part is seriously inaccurate and most of his gestures as Empress. Malik Zidi is slightly better than Rudolph and can be considered more generally to enhance the value of performances. But Stephane Audran does not do a special job as Sophie: you just don't get the impression she is blaming Sissi. He despised him for his youth, crowns for his behavior, lifestyle and his beliefs. Partly it will appear in the movie, but certainly not enough. But I think the biggest mistake is Julien Hans Capua as Andras. Andras was a pride, an honor, a patriotism ... here, he seems to be a kind of liberal thinking just to love his queen. And the depiction is so weak that this performance is very pale. The exact choice is Tatiana Ivanova Catherine Schrattina, she really fits her look and her gestures. But unfortunately his role on the screen does not require much time. <br /> <br /> The good point of this movie is some costumes and pretty authentic places. The port of Geneva is well presented and Sissi's death is a good surprise for the film. It looks like it wasn't really; At the same time, from a symbolic point of view, a good moment ... the Emperor walks and knows nothing that this is his last moment. So he must know it so that one crazy man destroyed part of the size of the world. Another good moment visually was when Sissi talks to Corfus about his son Rudolph. But these moments are rare. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's not a good movie. It distorts a very prominent historical figure, an important historical time, trying to treat the sweetness of the guilty trilogy, but it seems to offer something creative. Charm is gone, grandeur is lost and history is ignored! Not particularly worth looking for! 3/10
