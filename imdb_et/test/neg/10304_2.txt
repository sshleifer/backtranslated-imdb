Fox is pretty flat. They cancel the wrong exhibitions. It's strange that they would cancel a well-written program, such as "Arrested Development", and still keep this example and "War of Home". I feel Fox loved that they broke the barriers when it was hungry for "Married with Children", but now it's just ridiculous. "Loop" is meaningless and boring bells and their funny jokes just drop off. In order for the nervous comedy to work, you have to come jokes. "Family Guy" and "Simpons" work because there is a constant flow of jokes. Fox must pull his head out of his rectal cavities and stop writing his relatives on this mediocre route. I mean, if you are going to invest money to make some fun, make it fun. Also, stop using "non-named" participants. It is great if you have contributors, but you have to show an exhibition with famous celebrities. Duh, Fox.
