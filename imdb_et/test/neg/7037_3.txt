Although I've seldom flown myself, I'm interested in the interests of aviation ... and this film has added a lot of valuable laughter in the air. <br /> <br /> 1. Why does the captain do ground checks? Why does he even measure the engine oil level? In commercial aviation, as short as 15 minutes, it is not an ordinary pre-flight check. <br /> <br /> 2. Why does Captain KICK make an aircraft against the tire? Strange pressure control. Or anger management :-) <br /> <br /> 3. The cockpit has a 3rd team. All large, western, two-engine airplanes built in the 1980s have a crew of 2. Now try guessing how old the script is. <br /> <br /> 4. Helicopter manages to fly next to the plane. Must be quick ... and the words of the captain explaining the "maneuver" to the passengers are really fun! <br /> <br /> 5. Attached lift trucks can always lower the aircraft nose. This happens, for example, when any aircraft moves slower than the stop speed. <br /> <br /> 6. Lift trucks have hydraulic drives. After a collision with a commercial plane, it would probably have interrupted the hydraulic hoses and thus rendered them useless for steering, but did not set them in a certain position. <br /> <br /> 7. The fire in the back galley was a stupid idea. It was meant to show that only gentlemen were asking for a fire extinguisher and fighting with fire, regardless of who actually trained it? flight crew. <br /> <br /> 8. During the collision, the aircraft lifts would have been in a neutral position. The film could have ended here ... <br /> <br /> 9. The engineer (a third person in the cab) has three bars on his uniform. In fact, there are two aircraft technicians. <br /> <br /> 10. Why does the captain slip into the cab casing to investigate the damage? I thought it would have been a duty for the aviation engineer because he should already do the technical checks before and after the flight. <br /> <br /> 11. There is no unused space on each aircraft. At least, commercial aircraft cannot afford a luxurious space that can be filled with tons of water. <br /> <br /> I can go on and on ... but finally I laughed hysterically about how scenario-makers depict plane disasters! Woooohooo! Most aircraft disasters happen in such a short period of time that you just can't do 90 minutes of them. But in 90 minutes, it is always possible to be crazy and mad, regardless of the genre.
