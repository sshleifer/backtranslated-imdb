The first DH wasn't that big, but I didn't really expect it. But this terrible movie was just beyond criticism. I really try to look at the bright side and give such films a chance, but I just couldn't find anything good about it. I appreciate what Bill Cowell was trying to do, but this movie was just boring. The story of the movie isn't really that bad. In fact, it is somewhat original. But the form of the movie is really as bad as many people say. In my opinion, this is the right place for "The Off Season" and "Dracula 3000". I know a lot of people really dump and put down such movies, but I really don't think anything good about it.
