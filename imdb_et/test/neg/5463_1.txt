First, the title does not matter to the film. It started with good development, but it was annoying if she couldn't tell her girlfriend what happened to her. Even his attempt to tell the police was unable to add to the value of resentment. There were too many pregnant breaks in the film that seemed like stuffing rather than something worthwhile. The plot has never appeared to anyone who committed this crime, although a good plot would have allowed disclosure. Finally, there was nothing more than "hey, we've run out of budget, stop it now!" ... If I wrote a novel that ended in this way, I would be up. TRASH TRASH TRASH !!
