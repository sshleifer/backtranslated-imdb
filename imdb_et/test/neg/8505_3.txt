I enjoy gay movies where the characters are not stereotypical, and that is what attracted me to this movie, this and the main actor, the only reason I give this movie one more star if it deserves (though not because many people complain about cinematography, but the camcorder feels that the film added me some "underground" quality and there are a couple of scenes, usually sunset or sunrise, and the trains that would make the film reddish the screen . <br /> <br /> But the actor is a cardboard, the music is repetitive (I got the second part of the movie, listening to the soundtrack from another movie), you have to wait almost twenty minutes for any dialogue and then it's inconvenient and amateur. could have used this film perfectly if it had been gently used and the art itself would have been more intriguing, but it is not the worst. The film simply crawls back to its silence and dies. The forgotten movie.
