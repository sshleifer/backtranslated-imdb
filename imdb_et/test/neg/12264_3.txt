This movie follows a very similar scenario to The Warriors, but with a less intense and rather bad effect that is nothing to write at home. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, the story is not so bad, based on a small Aussie gang trying to get out of town, when one of their members is designed to rape another girl's gang. They then have to fight on the streets, while they are ridden by several rival gangs. It could be assumed that writers have taken the page out of the Warriors book and wrote it again, but as mentioned above - not nearly as much intensity. <br /> <br /> The action as a whole is not very good in my opinion, and it is obvious in many cases that they really do work ... the fighting scenes do make it, but then the bad sound effects that accompany them bring it back. <br /> <br /> This movie has nothing that was "Once upon a time warriors". <br /> <br /> Low budget, right story, bad action, write something home.
