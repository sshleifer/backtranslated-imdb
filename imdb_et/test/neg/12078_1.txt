The 80s were the best and worst times for James Karin, he played one of the best cult theft comedy "Return of the Living Dead" and a year later he was acting ... a bad film. To continue to Hardbodies (but not in fact), the group has quite unlikely signs that are trying to make a movie in Greece. Through design or laziness, the line inside the film and film is not only blurry, but the scene is non-existent (which would be confusing if I was interested in something in the film) Unfunny would be too generous. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nana, Fabiana Udenio and many more extras get topless, Brenda Bakke shows T&A <br /> <br /> My Class: F <br /> <br /> DVD Additions: only "Hardbodies", "American High School", "Strike", "Virgin Territory" (the first film has double DVD, masochistic) trailers.
