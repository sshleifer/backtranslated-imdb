My parents used a lot of horror films during the child. We also loved to watch them when they were bad, that they did some enjoyment. It was one such movie that was hard to review because I've only seen it once as a child, but I don't want to track it again so I can get a more in-depth look. The story is some old horror actress legends are dying. It seems to me to remember that he acted a bit like Vincent Price without being pleasant and stylish. He makes murders and dies, but what is it? Is the movie already over? No, as some kids catch up for some reason and are ready for a fun night when the tomb kills away from the grave. I remember that after the first couple of murders there was nothing special and I remember that this movie was quite disappointing. He seems to have a good premise, but it just couldn't deliver the goods because more cool killings were needed and the super horror actor had to add some to his repertoire.
