The somewhat warrior brother of suicide finds that he and his mother despise much in the same way (acting out), but the father is terrible and accuses himself. Writer-director Dan Harris gives us a gently distracted family that carries signs of sewing, characters with question marks on them, and then puts all the story out with the most obvious words: suicide! Secrets! Gay shame! Family disease! Ultimately, Harris tries to wrap with a flat bow that we don't leave a trick, initially giving us thoughtful material to reflect on, but then write everything through elementary, sentimental fashion. Sigourney Weaver's embarrassed performance when the family's matriarch is unleashed and she's happy - that means Harris gives her a surplus (with a reasonable new hairstyle). This is the equivalent amount of the film that is despicable even on the head. ** from ****
