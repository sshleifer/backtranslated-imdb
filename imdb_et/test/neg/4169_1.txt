Bad dialogue, slow story, scenes that are dragging and completely pointless. I can't believe that a lot of money was invested in this badly written movie. Leadership and action could not save this bomb. <br /> <br /> 50% through the movie and you're still waiting for it to start. They lay the foundation with the foreword and then spend the next 40 minutes. You look at 40 minutes of material that is totally out of order, trying to do it, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Much of this movie is like watching a really bad French movie where nothing happens and the characters are just kind of boring, inanimate, and egocentric, living without purpose or carelessness. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. Anyone who suggests it will disappoint you and you will no doubt doubt their taste and depth.
