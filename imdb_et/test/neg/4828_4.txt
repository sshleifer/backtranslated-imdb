I watched this movie about thirty years ago, and it's still stuck. When I got on the DVD, I didn't hesitate for too long because I had a predisposition to Belmondo's early clips. But what a bad surprise! Some films should be allowed to leave public exposure, to preserve a certain memory, and not to hit the audience. <br /> <br /> One of Chabroli's rare cynical works is welcome. watching it is ... boredom. Some movies are not really in style. But with movies that didn't have any sense of style at all? <br /> <br /> The shortcomings of the script, seemingly inactive - probably due to lack of direction - are a kind of design of production. does not deserve your name, less than mediocre photography, and the last but not least of the oldest editing work that makes it really difficult. there were a number of people who had too much money and equipment, but obviously there was no idea or skill. It is really a surprise that it did not end the Chabrol career dramatically. Do not blame it for the overall poor taste of the 1970s, which is itself a crappy and worthy competitor for the most used celluloid waste.
