You have to be a fan of a small man, but I found Carmen to have a boring, unimaginable, and totally funny Burlesque. <br /> <br /> Chaplin is again Carmen's story and plays a big role as Don Jose. This is the story of men and women they love, although it is not clear why a woman like Carmen would love her because she plays men against each other. <br /> <br /> As I said, I don't believe much of it. Chaplin made dozens and dozens of better films so you could leave it on the shelf. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I'm curious about the difference between this movie and the 1915 version ... or is it just an IMDB error? <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10.
