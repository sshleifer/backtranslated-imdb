My husband and children were settled at their own Cosby show at 00, but unlike the latter, it was unusual and intrusive. In fact, it is so badly written and some jokes rotate around Michael mickey, taking Michael Jr's stupidity and the fact that he is a loser that got more and more annoying and annoying when the display went on. <br /> <br /> What was to be a promising hit that eventually turned out to be a fool and a stupid show, where ideas became both OTT and ridiculous. And as with the other Claire, I didn't get this character so pleasant: she became a corrupt, childish and sad teenage brat of most of the later episodes. <br /> <br /> MWAK was not a Cosby model guide, but rather, according to general standards, was just a bad black sitcom.
