I jumped with joy to finish this show. This exhibition was very irritating. None of them had one quality song. Damon Wayans is probably the most reliable one. Kisha Campbell is ... Kisha Campbell. He's just as annoying as he was in Martini. <br /> <br /> Children are also very annoying. The eldest is an idiot, the oldest girl is stuck and the youngest is frustrating to listen. But that's about it. <br /> <br /> He made the world a favor, ending with. <br /> <br /> We pray that Wayan never means another show ... EVER.
