This film should be about film-making disappointments. It certainly deceived me for endless boredom. It is an attractive Spanish seaside resort with a large, large cast. The script is very poorly written or maybe there was no script. Just all ad-lib. <br /> <br /> A much better film-making disappointment is Francois Truffut's "Day of the Night" in 1973. This shows all the delays and the way the casting can behave in an intriguing way. It didn't carry the viewer and you get sympathy for the director who somehow has to finish the movie.
