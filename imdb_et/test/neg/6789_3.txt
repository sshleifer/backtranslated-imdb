I would never have thought I would have missed it: But I think the dog "Bounty Hunter" is more fun than the 90's police drama. Walker is very melodramatic and actually determines "High Octane" police events like CSI, CSI: Miami etc. I'm not saying that all these shows are bad, but they're not good either. I like the karate chop action that Walker shares with the enemies of justice, and versatile characters as much as the CSI science technology. But there are some elements that I hate in such an exhibition. Stereotypes / Types of Types! That's right, stereotypes / opposite types! Unfortunately, this exhibition is for moderate people in Red State America who refuse to participate in old prejudice, especially when it comes to crime. For example, there was an episode where a child with psychic powers gets to Dallas where he experiences children in Goth / Punk clothing and starts harassing him. Now! It is this Central America that perceives the culture of Got / Punk. I mean, come on, how often people dress like this and steal from people who just do their business there. Whenever the land is black and Latin, there is always a gang in some impoverished neighborhood. Okay! Not everyone who is a minority is hopeless recruiting with crime, drugs, poverty. Again, this is what the Middle East American sees from these people. Finally, why is Trivette a bumblebee, can't you make a sidekick an equal ass kicker?
