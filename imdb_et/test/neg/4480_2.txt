OK, it's traceable if you're sick in bed or nothing else. However, the unbelievable suspension of this film is significant. First of all, in today's modern society, do you believe that college joint studies will YOU commit to this time, even if you are a "virtuous" habitat volunteer who likes an autistic child? And the 2-week romance flourishes in the correspondence that leads John to "conflict" about recruiting after September 9, 01 ... OR? He asks what to do? Every champion we know does not sit down when these towers fell (my husband was one of them and I love him and I am proud to go) John's character is so flat. He's almost out of the movie. He is good looking, but not Spec Ops ... he's not sure he's not sure, quiet, not a bouncer, instead of tattoos, gets into a "fight" preppy boy who is nothing but a pushing game ... almost without the movie is almost uncovered ... and there are military technical errors (epaulets upside down) everywhere. War scenes are stupid ... John and another boy who is heading his ... huh ?, then another boy is shot and John drags him 10 feet and starts helping friends before securing a region or backup, or even behind a cover ... this is a loss of arms for God, you don't end the fight until it is over ... hell I wanted to shoot John. Back home when the truth has appeared and he casts wine ... we hated him to remove his shirt in his presence ... WTH? to break his heart and then tease him for adultery? He's the headquarters trollop. The best part of the film is when he travels away from him ... at least he had his own self-respect and honor. In general, an incredible story and we generally did not care about these signs or their love. Dismal!
