Not a real bomb? The only thing that was missing was enriched in uranium. In fact, the script "may" work when the leading roles were involved in younger actors, but the drama of aging Diane Lane that works as if it were a teenager (or even twenty) was too much in the stomach. Every time he (Adrienne) jumped into Richard Gere's hands and pulled both heels behind him, you can see almost faced pain when he thought, "Oh, my pain ... this babe definitely doesn't weigh 125 pounds!" The characters are clearly unlikely, especially Richard Gere: the self-absorbed plastic surgeon (Dr. Paul Flanner), which was some sort of "soul-purpose" after he left a dead patient after surgery (a senior woman from a small farm). Then his angry husband and son had to be dealt with to explain what happened. Dr Flanner is on the way to meet this angry wife (at the request of her husband) when she meets Adrienne. She has recently left her unfaithful husband (shock) and assists a friend by looking at her beach house. Of course, Dr. Flanner, who is staying and they both fall in love with MADLY (especially after he discovers that he is a rich doctor and plastic surgeon). Between the romantic interweaving and the nausea song / dance routine that Lane (Adrienne) performs while listening to the old LP (no CDs?), They're both trying to figure out how their lives are so completely twisted. Dr Flanner was not much of a father and he has a son (who is also a dr) who is angry with him for not growing up with him. (Of course, Dr Flanner was interested in his medical career at the time he pulled the painstaking, distracting boy.) The long (predictable) story of making a short cut helps Adrienne in front of Dr Flanner in front of his internal demons and vice versa, the angry husband and son of a woman who died at his operating table ( after removing the "routine" cysts from the face). Dr Flanner is finally able to say to his wife (playing exceptionally sympathetic Scott Glenn) that he is sorry for what happened - though it was all this anesthetist. "I told her she was too old for this juice!" Glenn's character (Robert Torrelson) seems to accept Dr. Flanner's apology. It's hard to say, because his emotional response is so passive by that time that you don't know if he even hears a good doctor or thinks about some area he needs to plow. Then Dr Flanner decides that he must improve his relationship with his son (who is now practicing medicine in a third world country). Unfortunately, this means that he must temporarily offer Adrienne. Of course, he writes a letter of love to Adrienne every hour for the entertainment of Timbuktus indigenous people (who almost miss like a school girl every time he gets one) and tells him that the hardest thing he ever had to do was say goodbye to him . Apparently, the excuses for the death of Robert Torrelson's husband were the second most difficult thing. Ultimately, he can kill a nice mud in the slide (poetic justice like a mud pack?) And he only has memories of what might have been ... hopefully more Gere / Lane!
