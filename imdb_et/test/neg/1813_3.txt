Despite the great pain and potential of the story, this film has failed at many levels. I was convinced that the director was a beginner. The film is very poorly edited, shows a lot of insignificant and tedious flashes, is very visible and has no intense atmosphere. The question that appeared repeatedly in my mind was: "What then?". I didn't care less about the main character and what happens to her. It's not that the story isn't convincing, it's just how it's spoken. The film tells the story. PERIOD. It's like an actor who poisoned his lines without knowing what he was saying. The film simply says events without a soul. And the director is guilty. She doesn't know how to do something interesting or suspicious or enjoyable. (And believe me, I'm not someone who wants to see a heavy 8 or 2 fast 2 crap deaths. On the contrary, I like particularly slow-paced movies.) So I was convinced the director was a beginner. But I have the surprise that this person has years of experience and has worked as an operator or camera assistant in many admirable productions. Guess he had a bad year then.
