Another winner of the 50s, 60s I love so much about the comic value they give every day .Korman doesn't let you put down these movies, they take themselves seriously and have very low budgets, a recipe for good viewing definitely. Ed Nelson, who is a highly competent actor, started with Corman and many other favorites who look up in Superman and many of the western parts of the day. The costume is pretty bad and the alien's speech, well, was reverb a bit behind, but it is its beauty. Making a movie against this love, not looking for perfection, but complaining about making it, comes through. These movies are a fun time! Even better is the MST3K version!
