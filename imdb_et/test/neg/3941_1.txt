Frankly, I was a big fan of the Stay Alive trailer when he was released a few months earlier. I told my friend how this movie has a great story, and maybe good. Anyway - this film is somewhat lower than my expectations. <br /> <br /> The plot has great potential, but how the story evolves with a functional, leading and bad CGI - this movie is a disaster. Ghost makes no sense and includes killings - it's all just too fast, creating an "unrealistic" feeling for the audience. <br /> <br /> This movie may be scary for some audiences, but fear for shock (due to sound effect, etc.), not for fear of certain factors in the film. <br /> <br /> You should watch this movie.
