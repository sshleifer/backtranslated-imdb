How Offensive! Those who liked this film have probably never opened the Bible. I can imagine those in the NBC saying, "OK. Let's make a movie to attract these irritating Christians, but they never know the difference if we don't have any factual or correct chronological order." Well, they were wrong. Anyone involved in this cruelty must find a church and regret their participation in this pious cruelty. I gave this movie only 1 because I couldn't give it to 0.
