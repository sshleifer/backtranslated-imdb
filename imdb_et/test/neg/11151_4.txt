I like Arnold, and I love this, but it was a very disappointing movie. When I first saw the previews, they were blind and ominous, and Arnold's name was not even mentioned. But I felt it that made me believe he was making a movie that had a more serious, agonizing mood. That it wasn't just another Schwarzenegger action car (although I admit that most of it is pretty good!). So far, he had prevented films from any true religious theme. And I was excited. I was wrong. It's just another activity, an explosion, a gun fire movie. And it's pretty bad.
