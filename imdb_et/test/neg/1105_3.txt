I wanted to like this movie. The film that the zombie children come out of me to kill people at night seemed like a great idea for the horror film. Unfortunately, the movie was at the bottom of the films under the horror festival. <br /> <br /> Mother and her two daughters are trying to move on after her husband / father has died for a lot of money for her family. They have to adapt to their new environment. They get into trouble because of the whole environment for various reasons. (Crazy Zombie children go to this category) The film never gives sentimental confirmation to anyone who lives or dies, the film does not create fears or jump worthy moments, the film hardly shows children doing what they should do ... Kill! With a bigger budget and better casting, this movie can count. So far, pass it on. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10 actually.
