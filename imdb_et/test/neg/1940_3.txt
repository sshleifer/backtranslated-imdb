Bass Margera Jackass's celebrity is back with her reality show and not only as funny as Jackass, but it's also amazingly stupider! It must be one of the most boring examples ever created. Of course, the reality is worse, but none of them is enchanting or stupid. <br /> <br /> Bam Margera has made it big and his parents decided to announce the bank. Bam and his parents, an uncle, a team of idiotic friends, live together, and while Bam and his buddies interrupt things and get into trouble, his parents are usually at home. If Bami's parents are not lazy at home, they are tortured by Bam, especially his father. To add humor, we are being treated by his fat son Don Vitto, who has been constantly out of it, and never pay attention. <br /> <br /> This exhibition is really like a tinted version of Jackass ... toning down that there are no tricks out there, instead of Bam and his friends just breaking and doing flat tricks, and in the meantime, the music that makes even bigger. It's not at least funny. I can't imagine it looks like there's no dream here. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Bam Margera and want to see one of the many follow-up / Jackass series cash order. <br /> <br /> My rating: * out ****. 30 minutes.
