This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen - it has no good features at all. <br /> <br /> It seems to have been done in about 20 minutes and the second time in the title graphics. <Br /> <br /> A driver who has become a deadly superman - what are you <br /> <br /> Other than what is completely predictable and not at all interesting. <br /> <br /> I left the cinema feeling cheated. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I couldn't move this movie to anyone
