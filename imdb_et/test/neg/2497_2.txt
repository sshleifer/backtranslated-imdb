Six stars about Paul Newman's general Grove depiction, negative four to include a very fictional event, where the truth is well documented. Michael Merriman didn't really exist. His nature - or at least his destiny - is loosely based on Louis Slotin, a Canadian physicist who did not come to Los Alamos until after the war. He carried his deadly dragon tail through May 1946. This is a critical point. The effect of hard radiation on the human body was not known until it was observed in the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks. If someone died in Los Alamos before the Trinity experiment, radiation poisoning is very likely that scientists would have stopped their work suddenly and history would have changed. Only speculation can be better or worse. Someone should ask the producers and the director if they added Merriman's character to the dramatic effect or were given an anti-nuclear message. For a more consistent and accurate look at the Los Alamos events during the Manhattan project, see the TV Day One or better yet, read Peter Wyden's book on which it is based.
