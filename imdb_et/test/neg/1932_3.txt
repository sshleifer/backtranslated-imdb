This film has more on its disc than the sumo wrestler and the viewer results in indigestion. There are good results, but the sub-blocks are remote and largely unresolved. <br /> <br /> In addition, I found all the characters unlikely, and if you can't identify with at least one character, there's not much to get excited about. All in all, this is a classic example of trying too little to do too little.
