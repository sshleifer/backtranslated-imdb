If there was justice in the film universe, director Lewis Schoenbrun will never be allowed to make a movie. It seems inconceivable that anyone who spent two decades in the editing room, where LS started his career in the film, may be so completely out of the way in any sense of momentum and dramatic performance, but this film is evidence. <br /> <br /> As bad as it is, it's so exciting. From the opening scene where the nurse is covered with a costume that is only suitable for a porn film or a Mexican variety event, the viewer is forced to see how low is possible. The answer is not far away, because in the next scene we are going to a funeral house where the next stunning fashion statement is a sexy fresh black dress worn by one of the griefs. <br /> <br /> An aggressively inappropriate costume is not the only mistake in the movie. Dialogue is the treatment of poor writing professionals. "Turn my tears into wine," is the pearl of the sample. The actress deserves the Oscar for being straight. <br /> <br /> The director reinforces every scene of a cheeseball with what is probably the most scanned scanner score that shifts from shamefully maudlin dialogue scenes to cheesy groovebox wannabe rocknroll transition scenes. <br /> <br /> The script introduces characters that do not have a rhyme or cause, and the story hits as if it were a broken heel. <br /> <br /> Don't forget it's a horror movie. Our characters come into the forest where Dr. Chopper and his two "scary" women are studying, who should be some Frankencreatures, but look just like the Valley Girls with the counterfeit blood that their Supercut sharks are. I have honestly seen a scarier-make-up for eight-year-olds trick-or-treating on Halloween. <br /> <br /> And again, we get the costume designer's malicious craftsmanship like Valley Ghoul One in the pseudo-Victorian polyblend when his friend carries a non-writable band that could have been almost fashionable in the corners of the 1980s with less hips. <br /> <br /> Dr. Chopper, however, makes a great fashion statement, looking like a Crisco cowboy who disappeared in the woods with his big black Harley, covered with head-to-toe, zippered black S&M leather. <br /> <br /> If it sounds intriguing, all the tools will control it. There are many side-splitting and belaborous dialogues (such as a valuable "elephant grave" scene or "intellectual" discourse in Ginsburg). <br /> <br /> To be fair, cinematography is good considering what was put in front of the camera and the actors try (with wildly extreme results) to do something about clich√©s and failures. You don't know if they were really stupid or just blindly desperate for not walking on the device when they saw their 99 Cent Store weapons with ridiculous bad guys.
