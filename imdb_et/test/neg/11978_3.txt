So I'm not a big fan of Boll's work, but not many again. I enjoyed his movie Postal (or im only). Boll probably bought the rights to use Far Cry long before the game was even ready. <br /> <br /> People who have been killed by kelp and a tropical island secret laboratory should be warned that it is not Far Cry ... This is something Mr Boll has with his legion Schmucks .. Loneley feeling Boll invites three of his countrymen to play. These players are called Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller. <br /> <br /> Three names that are actually in the movie biz. So the story goes like this, Jack Carver plays Til Schweiger (yes Carver is German's all-raging bratwurst eating dudes!) But I find Tils acting in this movie is pretty bad. People have complained about how he actually is not on the entire Carver agenda but we only saw the carver from the perspective of the first person, so we don't really know what he looked like **. <br /> <br /> But this is a story about the film being demented. We see Dr. Krieger, an evil mad scientist, played by Udo Kier, making genetically modified soldiers or GMS as they are called. Conducting a secret survey on the island that reminds me of "SPOILER" Vancouver for some reason. There are no palm trees here. Instead, we got some nice rich forest. We haven't even gone FAR before I started a CRY (mehehe). I can't go any further. If you want to stay with Bolls shenanigans, go and see the movie you don't have to disappoint. Most of them are suck. <br /> <br /> There are some things worth noting, which would mean that Boll did a good job in some film fields, like some nice boats and fighting scenes. Until the entire chromed / albino GMS team enters and everyone just makes me laugh. Far Cry tricks the scheisse (it's the simpletons for you) fa, r if you want to move on from the hero. BTW Carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you shoot on his screen for the first three minutes.
