Only three words are really needed for this review: chick piece. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy watching a movie as a child, you will find this movie a complete waste of your time and money. The best thing about your two hours in the auditorium is the feet that are stuck on the floor. <br /> <br /> Yes, they use all names and catch phrases. Male name is dog "Shoeshine" (referring to dogs in "Shoeshine Boy" figure). They call Polly's love of interest, but she's not Miss Sweet Polly Purebred. <br /> <br /> My wife and son drugs to see. They should have seen me. <br /> <br /> The original Underdog was expressed by Wally Cox, the ultimate nerd. This is expressed by someone who has a "smart husband teenager who knows more than all adults". <br /> <br /> As an independent film, it's terrible. For the Underdog, it is even worse. This is not respect. This is not a repetitive story. This is not a story update. It is purely attempted to collect cash into a known name and to trade. The next time I go to the store, I'm afraid to see Underdog toys, pajamas, towels, plates, clothes, and so on. McDonalds and Burger King probably took this child's right to eat. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is the soundtrack. SHOW AN IMPACT WORD TO RAPI (read the silent C at first)! Great, now that we are destroying something, we go completely. <br /> <br /> I knew it would probably be bad before I went. My fears were confirmed when I arrived at my local 12 plexes and found that they opened the first day and for the first time show their smallest auditorium (and one out of four without stadium seats). Even the theater men knew it was garbage! Save your money on tickets and invest it better when you leave and buy the original series on the DVD. It is more fun and has better product values.
