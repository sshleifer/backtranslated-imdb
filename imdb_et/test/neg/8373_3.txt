Maybe we have a completely different sense of humor on the Aussie and my only problem here is. I have a database of all my DVDs (including those received as gifts - what it was) and so when you enter a new one, I always refer to IMDb such as genre, run time, director, leaders, etc. I noticed that it was comedy and I decided to watch it at a time when I wanted something light and laughing. Well, it wasn't! Was absolutely NO laughing at all and an unreasonable amount of unevenness (was it really radio transmitters allowed to spread such slag that Steve Jones feeds? What to do when a decent child happened to tune his station?). <Br>> <br /> Instead of enjoying a good smile (or even a small strangle), I found the whole thing deeply depressing. I've given it to 10 out of ten, but frankly I don't know what these 3 are! I think the basics of lighting and sound were not too bad! <br /> <br /> We have a seemingly hardened loser (Giovanni Ribisi) who still seems to be able to drive a reasonable car (who pays for fuel?) and lives, which could be a nice apartment (who pays his rent?) Taking into account the possibility of designing what would have been a nice meaningful relationship with what turned out to be a nice girl, she even blew it! Maybe he was (Lynn Collins) who earned 3 points! The fact that she works as a hairdresser rather than a hairdresser is one of the few thoughts of this film that makes sense ("I'll do as much as one night with a two-week hairdresser"). <br /> <br /> If you don't want to squeeze and forget your teeth, forget it!
