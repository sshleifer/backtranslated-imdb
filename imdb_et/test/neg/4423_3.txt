This movie is a waste of time. Although it has participants who have the potential to do something proper, acting in the film is a sub-par and has a clich√© point. "You never know what will happen tomorrow, so live your life completely and do what makes you happy." This sentence saves you from wasting your life during this movie. People who like this movie are the same people who would enjoy sitting for two hours before discovering that the whole movie was a dream. If the most important part of a movie doesn't even happen at least, it's at least a pleasant look and fascination. There is a reason why this project did not bring the theatrical excerpt, and while indy films may prove to be very good, it is not even close.
