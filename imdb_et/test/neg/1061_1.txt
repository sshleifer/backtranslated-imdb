This movie is amazingly poor. It was on television when I tuned in during the action phase and finished the tasty macho dialogue, waiting for Leslie Nielsen to appear. It took me a few minutes to realize that it wasn't really a comedy, it was meant to be serious. It should be remembered that someone actually sat down and wrote this film and even worse - other people funded it and gave it a green light. <br /> <br /> Rutger Hauer probably doesn't read movie scripts until he registers whether he's bad or bad. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, this movie is so poor that you find yourself staring, wondering how it really got, and how the TV channel should be right to encourage it. The dialogue between the hero and the baddie, trying to take each other out of the sky, is especially painful when the dialogue sounds like the Texas Speak & Spell apps. <br /> <br /> The Hollywood money machine is the worst. Funny though.
