If you saw mercy, then another mediocre ghost movie, you should know what to expect, worse, much worse. Instead of staying in Japan with all English-speaking people, we are in Spain with all English speaking people. Interestingly, no movie actually looks out of Spain and could have been filmed entirely in the studio. Oh, and the place where swings are, because there's a good 5-minute film about swings, one of them, oooohhh how horrible. <br /> <br /> It's terrible in every respect. Lameinator's mother and father do nothing at all. Anna Paquin is the only person who gives a decent result in the film, but I hate Anna Paquin so you can imagine your personal hell watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There is one good moment in the film, when the villain tries to explain to Anna Paquin's character a twisted plot and she doesn't understand it and asks a lot of stupid questions and she blurs "You IDIOT, you have no idea!" lol. Well, I understand that this movie is garbage. 0 stars.
