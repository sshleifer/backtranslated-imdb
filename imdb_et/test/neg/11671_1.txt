Like the two previous "Mad Max" films, "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome" is no exception to violence and strange plot. Mad Max is in a post-war society where he has to destroy the captain and have children tomorrow tomorrow. This is a generally twisted movie with Peter Pan's references and Tina Turner, methane pigs and odd characters. I looked at it all, and it didn't offer me anything. I didn't feel inspired after watching the movie; the only decent thing about this film was the extremely odd characters that were chosen in different ways in the film. It's too weird for me and it was too boring.
