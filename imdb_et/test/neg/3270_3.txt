Every time I watch this movie, the blood goes out of my eyes. Yes, you read it correctly: I looked at this evil, unpleasant thing more than once. <br /> <br /> Caddyshack 2 went wrong for so many reasons: Harold Ramis chose the script and gave up diverting tasks, Rodney Dangerfield (wisely) walked away from the project because they didn't allow him to debug the script, Bill Murray, who has excellent case law and no part of it, and a doll that is pushed as a player who earned much Better. <br /> <br /> I can't think of Dyan Cannon in this sense and I wonder why he always laughs and smiles. The only conclusion I can make is that he is really the face of pure evil. Stay with me for a moment. He had to look at how the film came together and uncovered the inadvertent embarrassment that it would create countless soon surprising movie voters who would have made this film for them. He can also be very drunk. That's what I have to do now to wash away the unpleasant taste of its complete and complete failure from my mind. If I'm happy, wash it forever. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie many times. I blame them for many childhoods and I was a very dull and dimly boy who probably didn't have aesthetic sensitivity. Maybe the dolls are just funny when you're a child. No, Mupet's show is more fun now ... I think I was just dumb. Caddyshack 2 is this rare film that is so extremely disappointing on so many levels that you can convince yourself after the final credit that it would not have been as bad as it all. It was. It is. It only slows down slower. <br /> <br /> The reasons for my loving return to this movie are becoming less. Randy Quaid is limited to Jackie Mason's lawyer. His opening plan is not bad and brought out my only smiles. We see him a few more times, but it becomes as tired as the rest of the film and falls at an unfortunate speed when it is accidentally entertaining the spiritual wilderness. Randy Quaid feels good, and this film owes him for a long time, because if there was a reason to watch this movie other than tactics of torture, he was. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a movie trick. It has enough potentially pleasing qualities that people look at it, terrified what they have done, but later, because the elections were so thin, they only remember what really amused them. Years later, they watched inadvertently and the cycle repeated. <br /> <br /> Jackie Mason takes this movie a lot but fairly, I'm not sure she deserves it. He's really trying there, but it's impossible not to notice that he is spending the whole movie with the recognition of Rodney Dangerfield. This is the one for whom the movie was written, but I'm not sure he could even have saved it. Ultimately, it won't go terribly out of the horrible direction, poor editing (do we read consistency errors?) And redesigning the same story where no hungry humor or heart makes the first movie enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Dragged and screamed up to three out of ten, not two Randy Quaid Bulldogs. It's not even bad enough to laugh. I'm definitely worse, but I trust your memory - it's a dog. If you have never seen it, you have made great choices of life and I welcome your good decision.
