First of all, season 1 is unbearably bad. The prison is ridiculously unrealistic, the characters are so two-dimensional that they are almost transparent and the direction is terrible. It goes like a bad video of a school high school, characters passing through the camera and very timed and practiced lines that randomly talk to the prison. Soon the play will improve, but not much. The return of the commercial break is always accompanied by the ridiculous monologue Augustus Hill associated with the wheelchair, played impressively by Harold Perrineau. The only time that his character is consistently bad is bad at monologues of performance art, most of which take place in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and generally have nothing to do with what's going on at exhibitions. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Oz's bad ideas could fill in several volumes of encyclopaedia. First look at the whole situation. Prisoners are able to hang drunk in the normal field of vision, do drugs and not only have CD players (CDs? They can also exclude steak knives), but all incoming letters have been thoroughly reviewed by PRISONERS. Christ, this place is like the men's club guards. Defenders who don't do much. At the end of the second season, the granddaughter of the older brother is diagnosed with leukemia, and all prisoners raise thick bucks for $ 20 and $ 50 to help her send to Disneyworld to fulfill her dying wish. They must be the richest prisoners in the world. Every single prisoner in Oz suddenly became a caring, loving boyfriend, with the exception of Kenny Wangler, but one of the only persuasive persuasion. Even Adibis wanted to be nice. But it is okay, because the show has no queue or sense, so even this is not much disturbing. <br /> <br /> Later, there is a boxing box where one inmate wears a "I love brothers" shirt. Prison !! Can you imagine ?? I have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago. I sent her an old picture with some friends in high school and one of my friends in the picture was a "I Love Cops" bumper sticker and one of the "forests" (boys who have been in prison) for years) saw the picture but just grabbed it and hung it on the crusts. My cousin was happy. <br /> <br /> Kenny Wangler also keeps watch over the guards and even higher officers to not call him Tricks. One of them was even trying to bribe him to go to English. You can lose track of who is responsible, prisoners or guards. For example, more than one investigator enters the prison and is killed in an attempt to stop drug trafficking. Personally, I would just stop the prisoners checking the incoming mail, not the life of the investigators. <br /> <br /> Let's see what else? Shillinger's son OD is lonely and no one thinks he would ask the guard how he got the medication. He just ... got them, I guess. And make sure we pay attention, otherwise you will lose the reason why prisoners have enough money to get cellular transplant gums for bad gums. I did not know that in luxury prisons, guests were offered such luxurious treatments. How would it be when Robson asks about Dr. Faraj's schedule to ask what rubber he gave, Faraj is so frightened that he is going to jail and leaving his place. Do doctors and dentists have no right to demand that they do not see certain prisoners? After Poet and O'Reilly preached all over the prison, Robson asks dr. Farajit and sent him to his office, entered without knocking, and the guard left without a word. They could also give him a gun. <br /> <br /> I shouldn't make stupid ideas in this show, but it's like a flood, I can't stop it. Who thought of Chinese refugees who do not speak Chinese and who lose sight if they are not needed? Who thought they were glowing religious wars and all the worshipers? But who is the transplant of Robson's gums? What's up with Busmalis and Agamemnon? Agamemnon, because he is not clearly in jail and Busmanis with all his grandchild. Macbeth, because it was nothing more than a ridiculous tool like it was. But what are the worst ideas? Things that do not go anywhere that is constant. The Irish man comes to jail and builds a bomb. He threatens to blow the entire prison, the bomb turns out to be crazy and the episode ends with the bomb unit leading him after the entire prison has been evacuated. Nothing about him or the whole situation ever heard. It's like it never happened. In one episode, dogs are given training to the prisoners. What the hell ?? If it wasn't bad enough, during one training session, the guard will burn his weapon on the walls of the prison as a workout. No one seems to mind. <br /> <br /> I also like the fact that when somehow breaks, the culprits are pulled aside, they say nothing and the guards or guard or sister Pete or who always says, "I hope you don't believe I let it go! " And then they walk and let go. Audience doesn't remember. Maybe I am corrupted by Prison Break, but Oz is just a funny prison drama that may be better to play. Short. At least a low budget movie. There is not enough time here to store a multi-season TV show. Again, I watched it on the DVD for six years. Sometimes I don't understand myself ...
