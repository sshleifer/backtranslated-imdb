It is inconceivable to me how someone could have enjoyed the movie or laughed. I would say that this is the worst film I've seen for years, and I see them a lot. Maybe I have forgotten the younger high? It is also very difficult to believe that this is the same Jeff Daniels who was doing George Washington's excellent performance at The Crossing. He seems to have ever wanted Dumber, he's gone to the tank. Do you believe he even wrote and directed this spam?
