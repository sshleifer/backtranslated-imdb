It was a waste of $ 9. the film was terrible. all "scary" parts were meaningless and unfortunately repeated. It seems that all the tense parts are completely predictable and do not seem to have any attention. Also, the plot line did not outperform the film at all and it was just a big setup. 3. When the film seemed to make a big plot of land, it turned out to be a pointless scene. these leaders must follow the example of Hitchcock: every scene has a point. 90% of the scenes from this movie could have been left out without changing the plot. Final Opinion: Don't waste your time, energy or money!
