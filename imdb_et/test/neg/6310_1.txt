I haven't seen this movie for years, but the terrible "taste" of Quaid's performance is still on his tongue. Some have commented on how Quaid has a "path" for Jerry Lee Lewis, but in fact he seems to have only the most extreme stage of Jerry. No one acts in this way all the time, and the performance is hopelessly a clown, reducing the Lewis Buffer to a caricature.

As the cartoons go, it is somewhat amusing, but otherwise it is one of the most frightening, destructive performances I have had the honor to watch. Terrible ...
