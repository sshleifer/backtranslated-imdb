It is pure CRAP and probably the worst biblical theme film ... It's totally inaccurate, I think they will put Sodom and Gomora before the big flood. They have described Lot as Noa's friend, although he lived after Noah. To make things worse, Lot got a pirate and attacked Noah's ship during the flood !!! And what about a merchant who arrives with a boat that moves over water with a bicycle mechanism ??? And change alcohol to food and water, and then Noah is depicted as alcoholic! Catching and blasphemy one after another, and it goes on and on ... The filmmaker and all the participants made sure that this front row of garbage was left behind this garbage ... <br /> <br /> Please leave this mess because you will save yourself three hours of your life.
