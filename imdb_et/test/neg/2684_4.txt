Scott's 80's collection of icons can't save this tea catastrophe. But then I think it was just a TV movie and not a big movie. William A. Schwartz (writer) is getting closer to the "Stewardess School," except for the film's more boring. This movie is not really stupid, just boring and totally useless. The only reason to see it is to see Tina Yothers' actual role after family ties. After this movie and the equally foolish "Class Cruise", I think Mr. Scott was waving and went back to sit-coms management, which was his best move. 4 out of 10
