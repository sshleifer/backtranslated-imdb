It's amazing that something like that could be found for the public. I knew it was Uwe Boll, and I found it in a bargain store with $ 2 (still quite steep, weighing), but the sick curiosity looked at it and: <br /> <br /> 1). I'm pretty sure this is the hanging of seven, lamb and American psychos, all rolled into one, with the dialogue written with preteens. <br /> <br /> 2). Casper Van Dien plays a key character and is so strange and horrible that almost anyone knows he must be a crazy killer. <br /> <br /> 3). Jennifer Rubin plays a "good policeman" who calls a serial number for his apartment for a home-baked dinner and what does he get for his problems? I'll let you guess. <br /> <br /> 4). Michael Pare plays an "intense" policeman who drives the VW Bug, a new style, that is, with a siren. The VW error ... it fears the criminal hearts when they see they come. <br /> <br /> 5). Van Dien breaks his groom, but he still has a "not busy" party with "no wedding cake". Imagine that everyone's surprise appears (he was of course invited) and they all shot. <br /> <br /> 6). In fact, it should have been # 1. This killer is known as "Monkey Maker". This is undoubtedly the name of a stupas killer who could have come out a million in a year. Probably has something to do with "see no evil, hear evil, don't speak evil", saying with monkeys. Monkeys may have had something to do with the script. <br /> <br /> 7). Oh yes, and there's a club that Van Dien will visit in the beginning of the movie. There's bad disco music, I mean, really bad, and a chained fenced cage, whose gang members beat the pool bats out of each other. It looked like. And, of course, it's just the tip of the iceberg, really cool things (?!) Going on in the basement, where some questionable "actor" talks to a woman about signing a confession before she's shot. , sniffing a movie? Not sure how it fits with the rest of the movie, and Boll probably wasn't, so if he didn't worry, I wouldn't worry. <br /> <br /> An incredible piece of non-entertainment that makes you feel like you are looking at something in a parallel universe. A parallel universe similar to ours, but where things are just enough, where they don't seem right. You have entered "The Boll Zone". Exit as soon as possible and do not look back. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
