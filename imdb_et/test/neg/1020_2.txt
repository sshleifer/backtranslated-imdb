He's the only reason to see this movie. It gives a very good result - much better than it deserves. She is very beautiful and very talented - she deserves better. It is also frustrating to see Malcolm McDowell in it. He is another talented actor who deserves a better, but like Esai, he gives very good results. So, if you are fans of one of them, you might want to look. Otherwise, stay away. One more complaint - wouldn't we have had more Esai scarf scenes?
