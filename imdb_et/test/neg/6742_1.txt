This movie is so bad that it is not described. If I get a one and a half hour dancing monkey camcorder, it would be much more fun. The plot is so boring and unimaginable that it's not worth mentioning. The best part of the movie was when the credit roled and I got banged to find out that the names of the drivers were James Bond III. Just trust me and leave it far from this trash!
