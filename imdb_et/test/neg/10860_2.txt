Quentin Tarantino was from time to time a relatively successful filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he does not only make horrible movies, but puts his names on them. <br /> <br /> Supposedly cool retro flashback biker movies in the 60s and 70s, it plumbs new depths. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I enjoy being in a blouse more than the next man, but even I felt kind of looking at it. To use the word, I never thought it would be his speech (you see, I can't even write it). The plot (in a more vague sense of the term) is as incomprehensible as the Vinnie Jones accent, the fact that its terrible action is not our special because it is a useless testament, as one might think. <br /> <br /> It's just terrible. Shocking. It made me almost cry. Fear.
