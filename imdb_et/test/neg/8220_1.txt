For those who may send me unpleasant emails, let it go. In Hollywood, there is a trend where those who create extremely original films are immediately impenetrable to criticism. The country of the garden tends to be one of those films. <br /> <br /> Of course, Zach Braff, a rather overrated sitcom star, surprises people behind some talents, but that does not guarantee the praise that such a film has received. The story is often too thin and low to provide a true understanding. People have finished this movie, but these people are the types that try to cross an independent cinema. Indie films are subject to the same way of hit and loss that usually hits the studio films, but people seemed to have forgotten that there are many more bad indie films than good. The garden is not terrible, but it is not great. <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie is too fast, resulting in a fairly quick reorganization into a great life for him. After ten years, people tend to act like they never left. Where is the discomfort? Of course, the situation is always resolved by a quick drug tasting scene (which I say is quite accurate). The film seems to be a lot of emotional inequality, giving us the idea that emotions will emerge later in a deeper and more thoughtful way. However, it cannot deliver on these front lines, leaving us to think about why some of its decisions and moments were resolved quickly (like Peter Saarsgard's robbery trends). It wasn't completely exhausting, but maybe we should end up glorifying the film as something it doesn't.
