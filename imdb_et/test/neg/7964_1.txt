I don't like Cary Grant, but I've found that her performances irritate enough movies to find out; it, arsenic and old lace, and bringing the baby. I don't like him by the Northwest, but I really see this film as an unbearable stupid thing. In addition, I find that Granti's class is endless. I have no idea what his class is doing for his viewers. It does nothing to me. <br /> <br /> The Patrcia Hitchcock feature that comes with this DVD disc says Grant was the favorite man of his fathers; I think he was wrong. Jimmy Stewart was a better leader in Hitchcock's film structure. <br /> <br /> With this destruction, it really ends in half of the movie and does not carry the discussion and cannot support the high ratings. Even if the film is untouched, there is not much to it. Fontaine is a completely atypical mammal. He must stay dull, inactive, and not want anyone, but Johnny, for the whole film, whether it ends, to work on his ploys. That's not a lot of work to do. Cary Grant starts each line with "Monkeyface" until I wanted to strangle her. He says it about 60 times. This is a positive grate. Hitch's technique here is shockingly low. The infinite sequence of rooms / kits has a fake coating projected on the back wall as a spider web. And a light bulb made of glass milk can cheer the fans, but it doesn't save that badly made movie. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovich should retire when he makes another Hitchcock / Cary Grant imitation DVD. I think it's his whole career. As soon as I saw him, I thought, oh, nonsense, here comes the imitation that only he impresses. Instead, there were two! oh joy!
