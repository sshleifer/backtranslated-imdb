After the ninja revenge of the Ninja genre in the 1980s, the salivating fans of "Ninja Revenge" were "treated" to this bizarre offer that interferes with Ninja Shenanigan with spiritual possession .... the end result is not different in nature from this somewhat terrible experience when one spy sneaks into a human box swims in the public pool. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the anticipated "packed" introduction placed on all golf courses. Course (!) Here's a witness to the evil green clad ninja who kills a group of golfers obviously for a noticeable reason (although I have to admit that the low elitist attitude adopted by many of the players in this sport makes me a little ... maybe why he's them In fact, later in the movie it is said that one of the golfers was a top scientist, but this story has never been developed or ever referred to! <br /> <br /> In any case, back to the police, the police continue to surround the golf course and basically let the hell out of the assassin. ..and they have to keep him because he just doesn't get left! Yes, literally hundreds of rounds are pumped into him and STILL rises forever from the law enforcement numbers. <br /> <br /> In the end (after knowing eternity) our wrong thing explodes smoke bomb and disappears .. ... or it seems like it actually hides under the ground and our decisive gormless officers who leave st fungus to look for your body, climbs hiding and staggers out. <br /> <br /> Next, we'll see the beautiful Lucinda Dickey, a truly beautiful actress and a perfectly fit physical condition by playing a phone repairer here. From his high point of view he gets to die (AT LAST !!!!!) ninja. But on closer inspection, the man who is supposedly jumping on his last legs suddenly jumps and grabs it on the ground. After some struggle our fortunate hero happily breaks free, but does not read the ninja with hypnotic abilities and he will inevitably give up. At this point, the dying ninja is actually your soul's heroine! His aim is to use his physical form to kill the victims who killed him (the few he initially could not destroy). <br /> <br /> From that moment, throughout the film, when our heroine celebrates one of the above-mentioned officers, he gets some fearsome flashing lights, smoke effects, and a sword that the ninja is sliding to him most amazingly! <br /> <br /> A more complicated, especially irritating police officer (who sports enough back and shoulders hair to put the average yoke in shame!) stays trying to win his affection (the most bloody annoying way !!!) to work out that at the end of the movie, a rather "shock" (less) turns to be one of the officers he must kill! <br /> <br /> But wait for more hope! <br /> <br /> Next one and only Sho Kosugi! <br /> <br /> Yes, ninja herself and looking here as cool as ever! The Golf Club News is clearly moving fast and learning about the events he learned there, he rides all over Japan to sort out the situation (suspecting the worst!) In a short bottom-up (just a few seconds!), Sho's interest in this particular ninja has proven to be personal after being shown that the villain has killed Sho's father / teacher (?) and blinded one of Sho's eyes (so Shot insisted on wearing a truly decorative sword guard!) <br /> <br /> After stealing the dead nobleman's body from the body and then tracking our heroine who gives the involuntary residence of the evil soul is expert in the oriental temple (seemingly in the middle) where our man Sho manages to unite two divergent aspects again. <br /> <br /> Now he's dead, stupid ninja, and Sho will fight it with traditional ninja-style swords, winning ........ Yes, you might think. <br /> <br /> Really this movie ha s just two things, always a very good Koshu (who always sees a fantastic role as always) and lovely Miss Dickey. What a shame that the material they got here is such a dirty bunch of orders. <br /> <br /> Be fair, I've seen a lot worse time in my time, although I certainly can't recommend it except those who desperately want to fill their Sho Koshu / Ninja movie collections.
