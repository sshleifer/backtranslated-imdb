I've read a lot of comments about IMDb (well, all five of those that were written at the time of writing) and I'm surprised how much Brideless's groom shouted, which is undoubtedly one of the smallest comedies that Stooges does. I prefer parents where it was Larry, Curly, and Moe, although Shemp gets credit for most of the funny scenes sung by the six-legged song, the second Stooges, which is only moderately fun, but much better than Brideless Groom. Indeed, the movie has one lightly amusing scene that hasn't hit an a-lady scene that is hardly fun and has a 15 minute movie. Not very promising for a 17-minute comedy. <br /> <br /> Shemp is a voice trainer whose uncle has disappeared and left him with a legacy of $ 500,000 when he marries for 48 hours, which is a short enough notice than it is, but by the time Shemp becomes aware of it he has only 7 hours left. This is the premise that had been made and rebuilt before, but I didn't think it was a massive clich√© at the time of making this movie, as it is now. There are a number of gags in the movie, none of which are even close to the level of comedy for which the three Stooges are so widely known. Does Stooges seem to have been worried about the same worries that hit the Shirley Temple movies? there is too little dependence on the content and too much addiction just because they are there. <br /> <br /> The standard features of Stooges are here, Moe is the average, the meaning of which is definitely not used in this movie is somewhat dusky and slapstick sound effects (although there are more exceptions than usual) are quite entertaining, but are connected to the standard sockets of this movie. The line "Hold your hands, you love the birds" is immortal. The rest of the movie is not. <br /> <br /> Other people who look at this site's movie are telling us that this is one of the best Stooges short parties you won't find in one of the weakest moments of how it's best since the early 1930s. It's not just true. I can definitely understand how great is the automatic respect for the milestones of milestones and early comedy that the three Stooges definitely have, but that respect is damaged if the poorer films are praised more than they should. Brideess's groom deserves some respect because it is a Stooges film, but for exactly the same reason it should have been better. The three Stooges were just better.
