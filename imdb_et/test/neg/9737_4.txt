For me, this film was disappointing. Somehow I assumed that it would explain General Rommel's popularity and war strategy to success in World War II. But it has nothing to do with it, its last year or two, and in some ways tries to cast it down. So I just have to assume that Rommel was primarily an immoral and apolitical technocrat in a conquering and killing business without any special charm or reputation in behavior. Such real people just don't make good film material. I know almost for James Mason, really one of my favorite actors who had to embody a real wooden character. In fact, a good director and many great talents were wasted for this film? except for Luther Adler, who gives Adolf Hitler a truly memorable and stunningly natural image. <br /> <br /> Like me, there may be a cultural problem that is part of the German-speaking world. Famous British actors, famous for the Germans, are not just trustworthy. For example, Rommel here is perceived not only in German, but as a typical Southerner from Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, immediately thinking of a particular dialect, a certain type of spirit, the way of seeing the world (for example, with the Prussian junker). I also think that it has become confusing for the attempted murder on July 20th that many of those who were conspirators were not democrats and wanted the German troops to join the Western Allies against the progressive Bolsheviks (thus extending the war forever)) <br /> <br /> The best film imagination of intellectual, intelligent military intelligence is, in my opinion, still Patton (1970). By the way, General Patton can be seen for a short time in the documentary used in this film, which is a small angle when checking the vehicles in motion. The open wrapper and pearl revolver are clearly visible!
