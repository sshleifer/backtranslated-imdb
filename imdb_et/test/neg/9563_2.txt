Needless to say, a lot of allowances need to be made to adjust the true story for the big screen. But when you shoot a fairy tale that has nothing to do with what really happened, why do you call it Bugsyks and make the audience believe that it was a real story? The Godfather's trilogy processes many real signs and events. From time to time in America, it does, but they do not claim that they are telling real stories. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Bennyl has this vision of Eldorado gamblers; in real life, Lansky had to take him to Nevada. Benny considered the idea of ​​Monte Carlo's counterpart to be idiotic and would have preferred to continue his life as a playboy L.As. But of course he is the hero of the film, so of course the idea was to be him. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Benny wants to use Count diFrasso near Mussolini to kill him because he was Hitler's partner and Hitler killed the Jews in gas chambers. Obviously we should like Benny, so the scriptwriters invented this mess. In real life, nobody knew about gas chambers, least Benny, who was not completely interested in politics. In fact, he used a county connection and visited Mussolini, but not to kill him, but sold him explosives. He even met Goebbels and Goering during his stay in Italy. <br /> <br /> The entire Greenberg sub-block was pointless. Greenberg did not turn the stool of the stool, he did not seek refuge with Benny, Benny did not kill him (it was up to Albert Tannenbaum) ... at least they got the right name. <br /> <br /> I think it should have been very romantic for Virginia to return to Benny, offering her stolen money. The film even goes so far as to tell us through the text panels that it returned the money peacefully to Lanskyle after the Byden murder. Let me just say that revisionism just doesn't get that unreasonable. <br /> <br /> This list is not exhaustive - there is a problem with Benny's family who doesn't live in LA, how Benny is dealing with Dragna and Adonis, depicting Costello (unpleasant type of business), Lansky (loving teddy bear), Benny himself (an aging windbreaker who would not have been 12 years old if he were constantly "bugsy" in film-like situations), and more who have neither good looks nor Benny Siegel's charisma) and many others. In addition to some difficult facts, there is nothing wrong with this flick. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS END HERE * <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one mafia movie that can be more ridiculously bad than Harlem, NY. But the glory to be honored: This is a game in itself.
