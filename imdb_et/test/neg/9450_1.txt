Dreamland started moderately interesting, but never, except the city of Tedi. Low rentals that do not have a nameplate and a ridiculous effect are not recommended for any reason. The best thing to say is that it looked like they really filmed it in the Nevada desert. That's right, I can't think of one thing that is related to this stinker. There should be some revelation in the finals, but it falls like the rest. Oh, I thought this cheese was another good thing, this time is just over an hour, although it still carries a welcome long time ago. When a girl starts walking around in the wilderness at night, it seems that it will last forever and just get deeper. Testing for horror is not the least effective. The story is felt in the low light zone style but bad. Check out the "retrospective" edition to get a good science fiction B-movie.
