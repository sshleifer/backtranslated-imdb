I don't know how people look at it - the only people who watch it are those who don't have feelings and emotions and who like to watch people die, burn houses, car accidents, children die and members are killed every week. This is the most absurd thing on television, and I still don't know how it pulls ratings. It's so depressing. I can imagine that the writers sit and say, "So who we kill next week," or "whose house we have to burn in one month?" <br /> <br /> The most frustrating, absurd, and the most stupid thing on television right now, and I don't understand people's motives to see this depressing heap of hair.
