Detective Burt Williams has been under the trail of the notorious Poe killer for almost three years. The FTB girl Kris Williams and her partner Sean Michaels are making mistakes.Burt is reluctant to drop off and retire. In the next seven months, "Poe Killer" will continue its murderous rampage until Kris discovers that the killer is using Internet chat rooms to attract his prey. He logs in as Annabel Lee and quickly grabs the Poe killer. It's time for Burt to find the sadist and release his daughter before it's too late. The senior and extremely horrible horror flick without a break and a bit nasty gore.The acting hilariously terrible, the characters are painfully stupid and the killer is not threatening. Then I have seen worse indie horror flicks .3 out of 10.
