For teenagers who have never read Austen, this adjustment may be good. But only for them. This is Mansfield Park's separated "Cliff Notes" version, and if you haven't seen the second version or read the parts of the books, it would be scratching your head. <br /> <br /> Why is it so hard to make a good customization of this book? In the 1990s, it was such freedom that it hardly seemed to be the same book - the way of thinking was completely modern and proud. <br /> <br /> Here is Billie Piper, who looks like a pretty country. She has a charming personality that develops nicely - but she's furiously dead with blonde hair, black eyebrows and - through a lot of the picture - dark brown roots. So many unspoiled cousins. It is incredibly annoying and the rest of the cast is greasy hair, a rumpled clothing genre that shows true disrespect for the period's accuracy. <br /> <br /> One thing is good here - Haley Atwell is the best Mary Crawford in all versions. She has noticed a perfect, flirtatious, without being a modern or humble, slippery and completely moral or ethical compass. Here, Henry is actually good enough to be an easy temptation for our hero. <br /> <br /> Jemma Redgrave takes one of the most interesting roles in the story and is actually bored of being up to the last scene - too reasonable. It's just a production that really missed, a real low for Austen fans. <br /> <br /> The only version to be maintained is that with an odd part (perfect for the role) Sylvestra La Touzel (despite the very gay Henry Crawford - he is just ridiculous.)
