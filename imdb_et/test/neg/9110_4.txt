Airborne, cut above the usual direct video player, has enough fuel to keep it in 90 minutes, though you can't help but think about how low the former 80's comedy Golden Boy Steve Guttenburg has been in such cheap production !). The plot is simple, bad has stolen a deadly virus and Guttenburg and the rest of his good ladies are sent under it, not bad, but not in the same league (probably) because the films are also compared to coverings like AIR FORCE ONE and CON AIR. The cast is good because Sean Bean repeated his British-bad boy character, which we had a glimpse of ticket offices like GOLDENEYE and PATRIOT GAMES.
