One wonders how FLYNN could have failed so badly when Guy Pearce was in the lead in 1997. Often, choosing such a person is not so accurate. FLYNN was in the box office and it didn't reach Australian cinema screens ... even after LA CONFIDENTIAL ...! The first few minutes of dazzling naked scenes (presumably by Guy Pearce) will give FLYNN a rather powerful and exciting start. Unfortunately, FLYNN starts to evaporate in about 35 minutes, and with Hammy Steven Berkoff's entrance to New Guinea (watching and acting as he wanted Klaus Kinski's role in FITZCARRALDO), the film begins to resemble a movie with a big cinema biography. Believe it or not, in about 70 minutes, it's boring and you're happy about it. But such a promise! Pearce is Flynn! But the film caused a rebellion in the ticket office and, unlike The Bounty, dropped its mark.
