The film begins with a little girl (Rita) who sees her father's killing. Apparently he was a criminal who broke his companions. Later and this part has little sense, the girl has grown up in adulthood and STILL her father's past haunts her! Shortly afterwards, Rita will meet some unsuccessful and meet her. For a while, he's a little drunk and drives like a fool. Police officers are chasing and accelerating - in the meantime, killing a pedestrian. Here is really a stupid part. He persuades him to admit the crime because he asserts that his lawyers can take him off the scooter. Why, oh, why would he agree? Yet he is in prison for the next few years! And shortly after his conviction, this boy disappears - he shows he is the whole heel. What a chump !!! Later, after his release, his friend (Jack La Rue) informs him of a true friend. Then he explains that the boy's family is charged and he should shake them a lot for the money he shook him. To be honest, it makes sense - because they certainly owe him - especially since they knew he was going to jail and he intended to use him and then set aside. <br /> <br /> Now, the idea of ​​bleeding from rich tables is a good primer. However, this is not possible first, because it is hard to believe that someone could be so stupid that the rap would shake! An interesting twist decides that a stupid woman decides the life of a crime - a wig and a rich boy who takes him to the wilderness and robs him of a gun! Wow ... how he's changed! Apparently, he loves the idea of ​​stealing "from the backgrounds" - the rich hypocrites. However, and it did not make sense, he soon stopped doing it and shook his old boy's father - why he had to do some robberies in the meantime. And what was somewhat difficult to believe was that instead of the old jerk money, he was interested in having a man controlled by the mayor behind his influence. Odd ... very, very strange. Meanwhile, another plot is being developed with young Alan Ladd. He is a secret agent who has invaded the mobile. She was chosen because she just happens to be a dead ring for a real cramp - what is a clic! But what makes no sense is that this real devil is not in jail and is at the time of committing crimes, while the fake has infiltrated the mobile of another city. enough to issue a mobile game - including Ritat. This is a case of a very bad timing, as well as in the meantime when she has decided to become a decent and justified woman because she has met a really nice man she wants to marry! Oh, what are the odds? In general, this is a funny and rather stupid film that suffers from "kitchen sink syndrome" - in other words, there are too many primers and strange twists to make the film the least credible. In addition, because the film is just over an hour long, it all seems to be very forced and livened up. This is a relatively bad B-movie from Crap Studio PRC for Alan Ladd's performance just before he got a big fame in Paramount next year. <br /> <br /> By the way, this DVD was released by an Alpha Video --- company that sometimes releases somewhat hidden titles (mostly a public domain), but NEVER cleans out printouts or adds closed captions. In other words, DVD production values ​​are strictly triple ... at best.
