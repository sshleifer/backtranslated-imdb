When this film was made in 1980, I was a teenager in football, playing as part of an audience. It was done in Mosesheart, Illinois. The big letters "MOOSEHEART" in capital letters were covered with a banner. The director tells us that at certain points he would be happy to be touched. St. The Juvenile Correction Center of Charles is a true place less than 30 miles from Mosesheart, although I think it has been closed recently. During one scene, they show a black woman and a white man looking at the player. Under them you see my sister Noel's head (she was at that time 11). In the VHS version, I can only see the top of my head, but when I saw it on TV in 1981, I saw all of her head and sister Jacqui. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was ready for the TV movie. Since here's a movie description, I don't have to repeat it. It is worth checking at least once.
