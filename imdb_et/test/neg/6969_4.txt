The director and writer is famous / infamous Edward D. Wood Jr, using a pseudonym (Daniel Davis) who plays the leading role of Glen / Glenda. This is an almost radical documentary about transvestism; Wood himself is a transvestite with a fetish of angora sweaters. It seems the film material is far away and inconsistent Bela Lugos is about to stretch this odd and uncomfortable movie for 67 minutes. The police inspector (Lyle Talbot) is looking for an enlightened psychiatrist, Dr. From Alton (Timothy Farrell) to better understand the emotional and disposition of transvestites. </p>, Captain DeZita and Wood's sister Evelyn. Note: Farrell is also a narrator. Later, Fuller helped write Elvis Presley in BLUE HAWAII, KISSIN'S COUSINS & KID GALAHAD.
