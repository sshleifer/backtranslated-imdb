Although predictable and viable, not a bad film. It's amusing what's all about Van Damme. All kinds of twin devices are reused (as in many Van Damme films), but it is not cumbersome, except for a long-time fan. Natasha is proud and worthy. Activities are decent, Van Damme has something remarkable but exciting. I can recommend Van Damme fans and even those who are not, but don't remember a movie with a good-looking couple. Russian Mob is a nice concept and topical. It is clear that not his best film, but in no way his worst.
