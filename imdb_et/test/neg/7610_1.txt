I rarely give one or ten stars to every movie, but it was so terrible that I had to make an exception. <br /> <br /> I am a SciFi fan and I have seen some comedians really like SciF. There was simply nothing to please. <br /> <br /> I understand that it started with a very small budget film student. But even considering that the kits and the effect are bad. Cinematic art is mediocre, but can be the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> Operation is bad. A sad condition when a woman's voice command for a computer is the best actor. The dialogue is bad. The script is very weak and the plot is inconsistent and almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> Humor is not only subtle and sublime; it is nowhere to be found. For example, a 20-minute 80-minute film takes a flat 2-stroke combination with an alien mascot and an elevator. <br /> <br /> It was supposed to be a parody since the bad 50's Sci-Fi to 2001. What we are finally getting is just a slightly updated version of the old 50 SciF C-movies. At least these movies were funny because they were serious.
