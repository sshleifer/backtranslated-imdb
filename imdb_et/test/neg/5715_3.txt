It is nice to see that Julie Andrews is trying to play a straight dramatic role here - something she hadn't done for a while - but her Judith's character (wise they didn't try to exclude her as "Judy") is an old refined traditional and turbulent hair The hairstyle and Andrews establish the "adults" as all the other actors interpret cold. This is a surprisingly gruesome drama placed on Barbados by Omar Sharif (not the most lively leader - even in 1974!), Hoping to make Andrews a spy and slowly leading him into the proverbial bedroom. An unforgettable trip has some camp value: James Bond's similar credit at the beginning is a cheese. Julie: She's quiet and contemplative, but it doesn't do much for the audience or the film. Blake Edwards wants fun, like funeral. * from ****
