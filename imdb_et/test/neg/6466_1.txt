Ladies and gentlemen, can we present the worst Disney remakes. Although this movie is called "This Darn Cat", it should have been "This Darn Teen" or "FBI Agent". Cat didn't get pretty good scenes, Ricci's character was more annoying than funny, Doug E. Doug didn't get good features, even the role of Dean Jones companions couldn't save that movie! The only really good characters were only two auto-mechanics in the city, but their scenes were only short. All in all, if you look at this movie, go for something smart, like Barney's video.
