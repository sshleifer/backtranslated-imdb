Heldeke. it was probably the worst film I've seen for years. I mean, what else can you do about the old "woman inside" story? it was full of clich√©s, such as crying, who came to his queue, "boy" who came to him, etc. im not calling these spoilers because someone might think what will happen! the only thing he had had was Laura Fraser, who gave the average result. and as a "dream" boy, it was the most noticeable act ever. even the bad guys were instantly forgotten. <br /> <br /> A terrible movie.
