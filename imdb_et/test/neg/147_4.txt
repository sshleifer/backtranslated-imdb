I usually enjoy watching Laurel and Hardy, but this is obviously one of the movies they did when they were on a successful comedy team. one joke; how weird kilts and scotsmen are. And that is all. Okay, there are other jokes, but I didn't find them very funny; they are outdated and (I think) the first release of the film was not very entertaining. uncomfortable story (what I thought was filmed without the right script) and the scenery is nice to look at. I think it is worth it for Laurel and Hardy fans, but other people should stay away from it.
