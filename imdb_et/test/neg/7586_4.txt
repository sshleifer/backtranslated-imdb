I usually don't waste my time to criticize such a useless movie. However, I have been out of work this week, so I have plenty of time to conquer meaningless trivialities. To begin with, let me say that I often have a non-commercial, non-ordinary non-American cinema. (Please feel free to click on the filmography that supports my user profile.) This means that there are many bad movies that appear outside the US. Trust me, I have tortured them hundreds. "Lost in Beijing" is one particularly bad movie. <br /> <br /> The open half hour is an impressive exhibition of moral degeneration. This film offers some classic morals that are at the same level as Kim Ki-duki's "Bad Guy" (2001). <br /> <br /> 1. Women are actually raped; 2. Rape should be respected, praised and respected; 3. You can freely waste your wives because if you "do" it will eventually like it and will reach orgasm; 4. If you are a woman's rape, make sure you rob your rapist for a lot of money, but if she doesn't pay, just repeat your wife's slut as compensation; 5. If you are a woman's rape, be sure to screw up and hurt her the next day when you are playing a rape, as she has attacked her as "Do you like it?" 6. If you are a husband's rapist, just accept it; 7. If you have personally raped, communicate with your rapist and let him down at any time. <br /> <br /> How can anyone in their right mind care for these stars? They are nothing more than degenerate, who not only do not live carelessly but really enjoy their meaninglessness and support each other. However, don't misunderstand me. I am very capable of enjoying movies that represent a lifestyle and morality that goes against my own. "Ichi the Killer" (2001) and "Moonlight Whispers" (1999) are very interesting images of sado-masochism. "Strange Circus" (2005) is an extremely perverse game of child sexual abuse. "Marriage is a crazy thing" (2002) is a frightening accusation of traditional marriage. Even in religious films like "Running On Karma" (2003) and "Samsara" (2001), I have sometimes been offered entertainment. The difference is that these films actually have some interesting psychological content and character development, while "Lost in Beijing" is practically non-existent. <br /> <br /> It is known that there are people with unusual minds on this planet, but without the formation of any character or psychology behind you, you will end up with an exponential behavior. Why exactly Bing Bing finally comes in contact and takes care of his rape? Why has the rapist woman accepted her behavior unconditionally? The filmmakers never wanted to tell us. Even the obvious juxtaposition of the rich and the poor was deliberately prepared, and ultimately it was just a situation. It all seems too gentle and forgotten after the mess opening for half an hour. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers seem to be confused by moral ambiguity with complicated characterization. The reason you can't choose which person to root is that they haven't been developed properly. Do not think that this film has sophisticated signs because they are not clearly defined. On the contrary, the reason why they are not clearly defined is that we do not know anything about them or what they think. This is not a positive attribute of this movie. On the positive side, camera work and operation are pretty good, but everything else gets faded and faded as the movie progresses. It can be placed beside the trash like "Turning Gate" (2002), "What time is there" (2001), "Irreversible" (2002), and "Bad Guy" above.
