The sick family (teenage boy, his mother and stepfather) decide to move to the mountains to get away from it and get started. But their idyll is broken by three brothers and their dominant father, who does not gracefully take newcomers to their patch. Although the objects are thrown through their window and threatened on the street, the youngsters have decided to make things worse when they communicate with the terrible trio sister. As the law does not want to do anything about it and the violence is growing fast, the boy decides to take things. <br /> <br /> Fascinating and fun, this is one of the most enjoyable movies ever made. First of all, you may have a somewhat enjoyable hammy and ridiculous dialogue given to the characters, especially the overpopulated bad guys. But then you will get totally unnecessary scenes, such as a mother raped when her son is forced to look, or a sore throat, which her siblings will beat to dare to sleep with our young hero. In fact, the view of all the women in the film, which seems to be pathetic beings who scream and fail to defend themselves, is quite despicable. But, of course, there is a mandatory naked scene, which this time includes a young lady who dives into the pool bra under a very thin T-shirt. Who cares about the continuity of the plot if you have some ready-made young stars ready for your toes. Right?! <br /> <br /> The center of excellence focuses on a teenager who hasn't been able to drive without jumping, suddenly rebelling to the Rambo clone and blowing his attackers left, right and center to save his stepfather, who is being held hostage by the gang. It's incredible, but hey, so it's all in this movie ... so at least you can't blame it for not being consistent. So, instead of trying to find the logic in a place where there is no word, look at the IMDb pages for Janet Laine Green, Dehl Berti, Stephen Hunter, Jonathan Crombie .. etc. Their career hit a dead end. Why? Sit through it and get it all clear. Keep in mind that children, if you want to move on in this business, hire a decent representative and always read the scripts they offer you. Please .. 3/10
