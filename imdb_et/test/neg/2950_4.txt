1 review 2/18/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Leon Leonard): A fair adventure movie based on the novel by Moby Dick's fame, Herman Melville. This film tells the captain of the ship who had stolen eyes (which were extremely rare black pearls) from the sculpture of the indigenous tribe, God, and they hid somewhere that only he knew before leaving Tivi Island. She became very ill and had a secret journey to go back to the island to get her own pearls, while others (like her daughter) thought she was going back to treatment by a local medical man. Others did not know the reason for the trip. The riding driver knew the real reason for the journey - to return to his God. The stupid part is that the pearls were hidden close to the shelter and during this time the indigenous peoples ran their tribe without the eyes of their God (causing them all kinds of problems). We are (for some reason) treated with a short underwater natural show with an electric eel fighting a local octopus (I think only Herman Melville knows what it was). When they get to the island, the captain dies, but goes to his daughter's location for pearls, but he also gets the curse of the disease. One of the bad guys finds out where God is, and persuades his daughter to go there and steal the pearls, but at this point the good guys will know what's going on and the fight. I'm not going to tell you the results of a fight or an end, I'll leave it up to find out if you want. As I said earlier, this movie was OK, but some very stupid things I have already mentioned reduced its impact. I don't know if this new "Caribbean Pirates" got one plot --- hmm ?? black pearls, curse (wondering?) Well, that doesn't matter, these elements didn't make a good movie in this case or another. They seem to learn that they are a lesson, but with the money for the newer film, I'm sure they won't. Oh well.
