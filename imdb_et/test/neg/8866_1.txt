I've never understood this type of junk. You'll get some serious / semi-critical movies, each of which knows and takes its severity through immature jokes and such. We've seen it many times, and it's never been funny. It's just a simple way to laugh at something you don't understand. It seems to be one of the dullest and less pleasing genres of the genre, although I honestly don't see anything that is much worse than Spy Hard or Hot Shots. This film, as clearly understood from the title, focuses on the childish fun of Pulp Fiction. This is the main reason why I decided to look at it because I found that this film is too caring and overestimated by Tarantino's ill. I was hoping for one or two good jokes, making fun of the too violent and pointless type of film that Pulp Fiction had in every aspect, in my humble opinion. I was very disappointed. The plot is pretty much breaking up the Tarantino movie, a few scenes that speak of other, often better films, while in childish and humorous fashion. Stimulation is bad and you often sit there, being able to guess the outcome of each scene, predicting every joke, often thinking right, out of eternity. Operation is bad. The characters are clich√©s and stereotypes, and they are deliberately thin on paper to joke the symbols they are based on ... the problem is, it doesn't work. It just makes the movie much more difficult. Humor is a minor and flat. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that they managed to find participants who looked like people they had to see. The film is a terrible waste of real actors. Maybe a little entertaining for fans of similar typical junk movies. I recommend it only to people who really struggled with fans of Pulp Fiction or Zucker's parody films. All Others: Avoid. 1/10
