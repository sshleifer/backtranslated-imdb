My initial comment on this particular title was deleted by the IMDb user or the staff, just because I just don't like this point on the film that I have to write sincerely, which I felt after I saw this bad excuse for the film. where is my freedom of speech? <br /> <br /> Of course, the film's students did it, "it's both flat and amateur that he felt. Of course they even have to start? The script was inconsistent and so did. What is a low budget and b-class actors what do you expect? There are some CGI locations, so bad, it looks like it's done with an old computer. Some may say it is a kind of "alien" clone, only this time Dracula (vintage costume) that sucks you cast, one by one. Sets are not convincing, cheap and small (boiler rooms), although the story takes place on a large spacecraft. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to know which stars (Erika Eleniak, Casper Van Dien, Coolio and Udo Kier) were thinking about the movie after it was released ... Coolio must be the hardest rapper who has ever seen an actor! <br /> <br /> It was a complete waste of my time and money, I don't know why I even bothered to rent this flick. Honestly, I just hate this movie. With Uwe Boll's House of The Dead, Dracula 3000 shares suspicious honor to be the worst film ever. (Well, I've seen these two worse) <br /> <br /> Avoid! Every other film does better.
