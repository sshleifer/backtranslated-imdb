In Halloween, three friends in the suburb look for an old cemetery for fun and remove from the grave where Farmer Arthur Kelly was buried years ago. The evil creature is fired, kills the trio and looks for the descendants of the Kelly family for revenge. <br /> <br /> Cheesy "Jack-O" is a terrible story and terrible action. I was curious about credits from John Carradine and I can't imagine how relative allows me to use archive material in a bad movie that shows full respect for the name of this great actor. It is impressive how bad the action is to bring the movie to comedy instead of the proposed horror genre. This is a type of film that is good to see with a group of friends, drinking beer, making comments and laughing. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jack-O ?? Demo Do Halloween" ("Jack-O Halloween Demon")
