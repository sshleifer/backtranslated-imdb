I grew up looking at sitcoms like Seinfeld, Roseanne, Simpsons, etc. Over the years, many thin sitcoms have come and a very small percentage is really smart and funny. War at home is the best example of most modern American comedy. <br /> <br /> I will give you an exhibition of three out of ten, because that's what he's going to be, comedy, but it doesn't seem to be going out of his way to be a good comedy. A good comedy should have wiped your feet with your big jokes, you shouldn't see them and in TWAH I see almost every joke coming. Characters are probably the simplest and most terrible stereotypes I've seen on the screen, and acting is not very good as a father who represents a stereotypical beer drinking a sportingly loving American idiot. <br /> <br /> Poor acting, incredible characters and jokes that don't hold you will not let this show point where it is invisible. If you don't have a cable and want to see a comedy worth watching, try Boston Legal. It's more worth your time.
