No wonder it was free, slow, bad, and filming with Mail on Sunday (camera burning, movie start, not even artistic) = straight video, but not in case you don't get back some (movie production costs), freeing it free with the republic through the UK Sunday Leaf, at least in the way that you get the target audience, and restore some costs. <br /> <br /> I haven't given this movie out of 10 thanks to efforts to pull some old actors out of their shell, it was nice to see some old faces (Vanessa Redgrave, it's not Blow? Up), but Vinnie Jones was leading and I think he was better in Gone after 60 seconds than he was talking. <br /> <br /> This movie falls every day according to estimates, I think it will find this real sign from 10 out of 10 in the near future
