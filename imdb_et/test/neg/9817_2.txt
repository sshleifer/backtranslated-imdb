Preposterous twaddle, performed in an amazingly engaging and intuitive way - or maybe several, because of incredible continuity, tone, realism, credibility, bravery, and much more, combined with Walter Pidgeon's cattle experiments to get the cinema curious to understand some of Fritz Lang's other amazing failures. (I thought the German ambassador actually played Lang, but apparently not - they might have been twins.) If you can't predict the end of several time zones, you're not really alive. <br /> <br /> I was eagerly awaiting this DVD and was completely surprised and disappointed with such a terrible mess (even with George Sanders and John Carradine - maybe I have to wash my mind, watching Viaggia in Italy and repeatedly). <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to use a DVD once? (There may be a film about making this scary movie, and so many talented people could be wasted so much.)
