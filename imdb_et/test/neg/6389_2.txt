The collapse of this derivative generation stole from every Soviet movie and failed. I had the experience of everything that was wrong with organized deficiencies and the special shortcomings of the Russian Orthodox Church (remember that this comment comes from a man of faith). Even prominent cinematography continued to uninspired me. I spent my most beautiful moments knowingly that it was badly imitating. I do not recommend seeing this film if you do not have a deep passion for the Russian Orthodox Church, the traditions of its monasteries, the wonders facing communism, and the seventies. It's a useless movie from a narrow perspective (and that) that didn't do me anything.
