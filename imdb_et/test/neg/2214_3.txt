It's almost one of the most strange things I've ever seen. Maybe not the worst movie ever, but if you haven't seen that much, it can make your top ten listings. If you think the original "King Kong" was achieved in 1933, you have to ask yourself why there would be so little to cause this attack. Then, taking one step further and realizing that next year, Star Wars' quantitative leap to a new level of sci-fi entertainment, this offer will laugh and cry at the same time. <br /> <br /> Now, let me ask you what the professor (Peter Cushing) would embrace to bring the main piece of the underground research device to the core of the earth? OK, so it was useful for parrot / tyrant (parrotosaurus)? Somehow I don't think this is what Edgar Rice Burrough has remembered when he wrote his Pellucidar stories. He probably didn't think Caroline Munroid's mind as Princess Diana, probably the only redeeming factor for all that outflow. <br /> <br /> At least there was one little pseudo-scientific explanation that I got kick out of; I'm always looking for such movies. This should be how the bottom of the earth was indeed the bottom of the Earth's crust, explaining that the ethereal pinkish glow. But try it the way it was, the story just couldn't find me to find something interesting about Hooyah, Sly One or Jubal the Ugly One, much less of those funny half men, half of the pterodactyl creatures. Paraphrasing a good professor - "You can't remember me, I pay attention!"
