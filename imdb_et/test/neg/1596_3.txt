Someone told me that Pink Flamingos was "crazy" in one sense. Now I doubt if this man ever saw it, because it is not like I would say it in one word. Nasty, absurd, more nasty ... would do it. Every time you think it's no longer dirty, it does. One of my special "favorites" was when the Divine had his birthday party and when the police came to break it, they were calm and eaten. I admit that this is one of those films where it is so grotesque that you just can't look at it, but it's not a creative work of art. This is a pure shock value. <br /> <br /> On the back, this Jackass boys have looked like some pussies.
