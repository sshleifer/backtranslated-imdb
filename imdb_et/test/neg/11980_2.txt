I am a big fan of Farcry game, HUGE fan. He still has a place in the top-10 games list all the time! The story was new, fresh ... A truly ingenious foundation for creating a movie ... or so I thought ... <br /> <br /> Farcry's film is no less than another leader trying to get a successful game on a franchise ( see Doom: movie and much more ...). <br /> <br /> The video game begins when a player (Jack Carver) wakes up at a sea cave after being shot by an unknown soldier RPG. Then Jack finds a communication device where (Harlan Doyle) controls him between islands, shipwrecks, jungles, facilities and VOLCANOES to find his (lady friend)? <br /> <br /> The film plays very, very differently: 1: 30 "long" backstory is a 30 minute film before reaching the "boat blow" scene. 2: Jack then walks to the beach, kills some gons, then drives off ... Nothing like a game ... 3: There is no communicator with Doyle at the other end ... 4: "Modified soldiers" look like albinos with singles .. And there were no mutated "monkey-like" creatures that jumped out of the bush. Part of the Farcry game I enjoyed ... 5: There is no sunny beach, not an aircraft carrier, no big cliffs, LITTLE refers to any game content (characters / objects / vehicles), in fact, not trying to follow the story at all. 6: The game's climatic Volcano scene is replaced by an old industrial building. 7: There is an end scene where everyone (except Krieger) lives happily after ... WHAT! <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this movie at all costs! If you are a gambler, you hate this movie all your soul. This is a film that is clearly meant for men, so girls stay away ... So if your man, 12-29 years old, has never played Farcry and is not annoyed, the directors are trying to put books / games into the movie ... then it's for you ...
