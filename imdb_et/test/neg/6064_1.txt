The original body and soul (1947) is a masterpiece. John Garfield, Ann Revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canadian Lee ... and filmed by one of the biggest operators who once gave the grace of the screen .. James Wong Howe. This remake is terrible. Despite Rod Steiger, Joe Mantegna, and Jennifer Beals, there's nothing worthwhile and it's a shame that this product has the same title as the brilliant original. Both films have the same main owner name Charlie Davis. I don't think there would be any redemption features in this remake. I'm surprised that Rod Steiger attended. It may be the only bad movie he ever did. Maybe he needed a salary.
