Living in Edinburgh and having a great historical thirst, I was left with "excuses". Wrong breed breed dog! The owner of Bobbys, Old Jock, was an old man who came to Edinburgh and died as a snack in accommodation rather than in a movie. For all Edinburgh visitors looking to see the sights of the movie, you won't find the grave of Princes St Gardens! There were a few moments when the tissues would have been large. The actors were fantastic when they squeezed a rather weak script. I do not feel that a poor child, Bobby, actually has enough time on the screen, which is probably "lost" at one point. All this said, the movie was good and every 8 a.
