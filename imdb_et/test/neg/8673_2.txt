... if we all know, no one does it like the BBC. <br /> <br /> Being an avid fan of such a Sunday night, I was quite looking forward to it. When I was disappointed! In the first thirty second, I didn't think it would look promising, and after two minutes I had a hard time watching. <br /> <br /> But I and my friends only stayed on finding bad deeds and a complete misunderstanding. half of the characters. The plot was hurried to the extreme, and costumes and costumes were created in the style of "bbc robin hood" for the 21st century. This modern style may have been placed under sharp camera angles and visual cinematography, but unfortunately we didn't get it. The direction seemed decisively sloppy for both functional and impact. <br /> <br /> After 30 minutes, we couldn't look at it and went out and rented "Prestige" (which is very good btw) Maybe it's unfair that I appreciate it as I watched it so little , but rarely am I forced to warn people to see anything! But I and my friends thought the house and the sunshades were pretty good, but it's as good as it gets.
