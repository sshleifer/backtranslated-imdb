I have to look at it without a commercial interruption and let me tell you that even for TV, it was quite predictable. The actors did the work they had, and the majority was pretty good - Barry Bostwick, Jane Seymour, Frances Fisher, etc. But the script was not only predictable (except for the last scene), but the dialogue was reluctant and sounded like it was canceled from the novel of the tertiary romance. Jane Seymour's psychotic monologues were ridiculous. I am sorry, but I find it hard to believe that someone who is horrible will not cause any doubt. As bad as Theresa Russell was in the "Black Widow" - and she was sure she was bouncing - she had at least a sense of playing the pseudo signs somewhat straight. Seymour is a much better actor but has not won the material here. <br /> <br /> Finally, the musical result is incredibly cheesy. It's almost satire of all of your genre, like Kenny G's defrost. With such a weak and derived script, the film should have changed something.
