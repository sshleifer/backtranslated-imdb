This is a film that puts you in doubt about a particular director of your previous admiration before you stop and remind yourself that there are very few people whose work does not contain some clicks. <br /> <br /> Casting Lelouch in movies is extremely important as he puts the viewer in such symbols. Participants must bring the magic of the actual screen up to intensity. Otherwise, it's just hollow. <br /> <br /> None of the actors in this movie, in my opinion, had any such magic on the screen. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons and Patricia Cover were far short. Irons are a talented actress, but she was wrong for this part. The loving scammer didn't fit his strengths. His magic brand also hit me with a false statement. The Iron Personality is too inclined to fit the Lelouch Love Story. <br /> <br /> Although I hesitate to give up the opportunity to hear an English accent, I also think that the American actor would have played a better role in this field. So many of the songs that Kaas sings are so closely identified with the American writer of a particular writer that it seemed uncomfortable that Jeremy Irons was interested in love - although logically this is not really important. It still stuck the film's stream. At least for me. <br /> <br /> Of course, it should have been the right American. I think George Clooney would be great in this regard. And he would have brought the ores of the screen into spades. Brad Pitt could have done a very good job of offering a special combination of charm and sharpness. <br /> <br /> I was also very disappointed with Patricia Cover. As I read about him, I have learned that he has a very successful career as a singer and many fans, so what I know, but I found him very boring in the presence of his screen. He was actually a much better actor for his speakers when he was a singer in the scenes where he had to interpret and sell the song. Something he sang did not lead me. She was pleasant but sharp. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, someone like Kate Hudson, who is not a professional singer and has only a French vocal trainer, would be one million times better. Not to mention all the stunning talents out there that could have been used. This provided Patricia Cover to take the screen space if there were so many charismatic French actors who could have been cast. <br /> <br /> Music was so important in this movie that it didn't work without music. And because Kaas gave it so badly in this respect, the film didn't really have any chance. <br /> <br /> Lelouch closed the fate of this movie while casting Patricia Cover. JMO.
