It is impossible to avoid comparing Zhang Yimou's "hero" with Ang Lee. They were both high-budget Chinese kung-fu films with amazing Chinese cinematography and super-stars. But apart from the obvious, there is really nothing else to compare. The "hero" on almost all levels, which are really important, cannot prove that big stars, beautiful landscapes and action effects do not replace the director's artistic and visionary. "Hero" Prime Minister has done nothing more than that his failure is great. Much of what was expected of Hero attracted film-makers who opened for the first time in mainland China and Hong Kong theaters, making it a fast box-office success. However, while the script was satisfied with government censors, the Chinese audience went to a new height of nervous criticism and sarcastic spirit to express their contempt. On-line critics, both professional and amateur, declared the film "ideologically disturbing", "from the point of deep servitude", "written" by either amateur historian or someone with rear motifs. "One article was simply titled" Hero, you are sick! "<br /> <br /> The deeper lack of film is on his plot, which is not only morally understandable but based on an unforgivable historical error, but the worst of all for the film - is It is known that all attacking phases take freedom from the facts of history, but the "hero" oversteps the artistic license as an unforgivable ignorance when he tries to glorify the emperor who was just as brutal as Stalin or Hitler. Instead, it makes a shamefully bad attempt to be "deep" and simply succeeds in being pretentious and preaching. While historians agree that China's first emperor was mercilessly violent, Mao Zedong was known to admire this ruler - it is no surprise given Mao's own tyrannical rule, and the Beijing Communist government also sees allegory that the first emperor and his own Iron A fist between the methods is easily pulled, so they were particularly pleased with Zhang Yimou's last job. Tony Leung, one of Hero's stars, pointed out during the interview to promote the film that the Beijing government had done the right thing in 1989 to break student demonstrations because it was necessary to maintain China's stability. In these remarks, Tony Leung was shocked by criticism in his home country of Hong Kong, but he simply noted the main message of the film. <br /> <br /> Director Zhang Yimou has said that his goal was to overcome the values ​​of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in kung-fu novels and films to reveal higher wisdom. Unfortunately, his version of "wisdom" turns out to be: OPPRESSOR'S RIGHT. In China, where thousands of years of historical reality have penetrated this message, art was the last shrine where an individual can really get rid of such tyranny. The great popularity of the Kung-fu novel can be explained by its ability to provide an escape to the world of substitution: one where kung-fu warriors cried to a country that was looking for adventure and fighting for justice, free from fear and struggle against all contradictions super-human skills. Only in the novel did an individual win institutionalized power in China, and only in the novel the oppressed masters found their masters. Unlike this kung-fu hero tradition, Zhang Yimou has not risen to higher truth as he hoped, but down to the level of government propaganda. No wonder the government was so pleased. <br /> <br /> Some film students may ask, "Any moral decisions aside, is it at least fun?" Fortunately, the answer is surprising "No!" Since the same story is spoken again and again with only small variations, it is cumbersome to look at. Besides, the three contradictory versions of the same story are only confusing the character development, because it leaves a lot of time for the viewer to feel some sympathy for them when a "real" version appears. <br /> <br /> Film is not without beautiful pictures. But all the scenes fall on the plane because they do not combine the story or complement it. Using different colors to distinguish separate versions of the story is both simplified and creative, and cinematic art seems to be more conscious than truly beautiful. Great for a trailer, but disappointing when you're watching the whole movie. <br /> <br /> China, who showed they didn't want Tiger's unreal kung-fu, didn't expect much. 'The title role-playing Jet Li is a true kung-fu artist who held national titles before starting his career as an actor. His earlier films have shown limited ability to act, but many hoped that Zhang Yimou would be able to make full use of the body movements of Li, giving him a proper role that would not hold his ability to act. But it wasn't. "Hero" is trying to go beyond the kung-fu genre, so there are not many fighting scenes, and Jet Li performs a complicated action: internal transformation leading to profound wisdom and self-sacrifice. As the director should have waited, Li couldn't fail. In the meantime, the only fight that shows any true kung-fu skill is the first film between Li and Donnie Yen. All the following scenes are disappointing, so "Hero" doesn't even respond to that level. <br /> <br /> Although most viewers outside China are unlikely to be aware of the historical mangling of the cruel story. The first emperor seems even more unlikely to accept the version of Zhang's "Chinese Wisdom", which is anything but. Perhaps the only time that the viewer "Hero" came out of the screening was seen with a smile - instead of sudden or cracking - a special screening of Chinese government officials. <br /> <br />
