I really wanted to love this movie. I've read a book for my daughters and we all loved it. The book is wonderful. This movie is very far from the book. The book is great - this movie is a terrible customization. <br /> <br /> In the book, Sara is honorable, kind, strong, and NOT ALL wants to return. This is the point of the book! He acts as "princes" regardless of circumstances. An important part of princess behavior is not to return the discomfort. It must behave honestly, no matter how you are being treated. <br /> <br /> He carries a lot in the book and touches the lives of others. Other people change their behavior after they showed their kindness and ability to withstand without sinking and revenge. Sara does what is right, just when it's right. <br /> <br /> Outside the bakery, she gets a light girl who is poorer and hungry than she is. She has half a hot bunny. He's very hungry. He gives this bushy exciting wild girl one bun. When he sees the girl being harsh and seeing her scarring, she gives her another. He does it for as long as he's guessed 3 or 4, I guess - I don't remember how much. <br /> <br /> The bakery looks through the window. She has moved so much as she has witnessed, she takes a light girl and raises her to her daughter. Sara also affects other people. <br /> <br /> His book is dead in his book. A neighboring man is his father's partner - he's been looking for him. His father did not lose his money - the man is excited about finding Sara; she takes her and Becky to her home and raises them as her daughters. And of course Sara has inherited her. <br /> <br /> Miss Minchin is not a chimney sweeper. In fact, he remains in the same position in school. But he's humiliated because Sara has told his new cruel treatment to the guardian. And finally, Sara talks to Miss Minchin - Miss Minchin is trying to minimize her treatment with Sara and Sara's peaceful firm behavior, instructs Miss Minchin that she was cruel. Miss Minchin. He continues his unhappy existence. It does not matter - it is important that Saral has a home with her loving guardian - and her dearest friend in the world, Becky, is now for all purposes, her sister. The book is about love and respectful behavior at worst. This is about self-control and humility. This is a great book. This movie does nothing to capture the true story and messages of the book. My wife was so upset, she wanted to leave the theater in the middle, but we decided to leave it out. We didn't get a reward. <br /> <br /> I can't think of my life for the reason that the film makes this great book so bad. Perhaps the effect of the script accompanying the behavior of the Shirley temple was. I don't know - but this movie is so far away from the nature and values ​​that I don't know. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time - buy a book. It's unforgettable ... even for the father!
