When I watch a movie that surprises me completely. One that goes somewhere is a bit of entertainment. One that is pure fun from start to finish. Well people when stranger calls are not this movie. It is an incredible stupid and far-fetched remake of a much better 1979 horror campus. Our leading hero, Jill, is forced to take a baby after a minute of cell phone calls and is harassed by phone calls from a mysterious caller. The clich√© of every world is used here from a stupid cash-up-hidden place to a car that will not be killed at any time. This movie is bad ... not even bad "so bad is a good way" more "so bad is a boring way." Leave this godawful movie out and save your movie for the rest. Thank you later, trust me. Rating: D-
