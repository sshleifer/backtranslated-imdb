This rubber monsters did not try to be cool, frightening or even comedian, looks like a Porkys or a animal house wannabe film, but sequences and history aren't always clear and can't pay attention to you. Taste, the only thing that makes you laugh is terrible rubber monsters who have to pay one dollar because they never see the job or they are realistic, the movements and expressions see Muppet's Pixar as a 3D movie, if you compare it. Hope Marie Carlton is the only thing that makes this terrible movie, and when she dies in the movie, it gets worse than before. A movie that only needs to be seen quickly.
