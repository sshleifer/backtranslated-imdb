I usually try to find movies, even bad ones, who are good. Unfortunately, this film, where I fail, and the fact that this table has barely one positive overview, many IMDb reviewers show my pain. <br /> <br /> I usually don't look at the sequels, but I just had to look at it because I love so much "Rosemary Baby." What a mistake it was. It just confirms your belief that most of the descendants are bad, although fortunately there are very few as bad as it is. In fact, in my opinion, this is not even a sequel, it is satire, how bad is the sequel. The movie is highly recommended to never watch it.
