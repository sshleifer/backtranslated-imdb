I hate movies that stop it !!!! <br /> <br /> This 16 mm disaster is full of clich√©s, stereotypical signs, general, over-the-ground plot and terrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> In this "Movie" we have Aggressive Black Guy, The Black Guys Girlfriend, The Blonde Bitch, Possible Lesbian "Hacker", Pedophile Teacher ... Blah, Blah, Blah .... And then Pumpkin Man. <br /> <br /> "Do you think someone takes the legend too far?" This question is asked at the end of the movie. Taking the Scream 2 tagline too far. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ***** Normally I don't go into spoilers, but I have to climb ... <br /> <br /> Dream? The whole thing was a dream !!!!! This is the most customized way to finish the movie. "I don't know how to explain this, and we don't have any more money ... Let's do the whole thing." That's what the director / producer / actor / FX man thinks about. Yes, the director is the character of Mr E. He did almost everything about this waste film. This is the solution that ends .... And what the principal, be it so he's done all the robbery! What did this film do? Of course, the black people are killing, the fucking girl is being killed, the teacher who has had sexual harassment with the pupils in the past is killed (she is the main suspect). This film gave me a heartbreak. <br /> <br /> Nonsense, pointless, and made with older Visa and Mastercard (which tells me it's probably still paid off), this movie is stupid, boring and just stupid. ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was credit. How they presented names, etc. at the beginning and end. He had a horrible feeling. Not too bad a movie! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
