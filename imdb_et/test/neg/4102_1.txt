I generally don't look at movies that I haven't seen for a while so I have to hire them or hire them to take the movie completely and freshly. In A Thunder of Thunder, I remembered my promise to never see this movie, so I just remember. In fact, I haven't thought about how this movie was badly done until I read someone else's review and remember the experience I had in 2005 when I actually saw it in the theater. My movie friend forced me to watch it, though I wasn't interested and wow. (Later I forced her to see the "basic instinct 2" in the theater, reminding her that she saw the mess. So, I think it even made us.) I would definitely have my deep laugh (at the expense of the movie) of course) that didn't make her happy if he really wanted to see it. The time-driving / butterfly effect film had so many bad graphics, the brightest ones laughing at me whenever they showed the dinosaur (God, I loved seeing that dino and they really were scared, it was fun!) Or just, Ben Kingsley. That's nice, Kingsley can remind us how a person can be: "Gandhi" and "Schindler's list". (Even Meryl Streep can occasionally make "She-Devil" so they're forgiven.) For months, I pulled MST3k with my friends, consistently referring to this movie with any low-cost sci-fi movie or Kingsley slippery. Yes, the film would be a great movie to see drunken (or otherwise inebriated): a terrible over-the-top, "special" FX that even Nintendo64 would rotate and ridiculous plot twists. The biggest disappointment was that Razzies didn't call this movie for any prize.
