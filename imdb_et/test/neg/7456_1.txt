I ... I don't know where to start. Dragon Hunt can be the worst film in film history. Even Anus Magilicutty was better than deliberately bad. Showgirlid? No, it was a kitty value and was a technically well-made film. But Dragon Hunt takes the cake and eats it, then vomits it back and feeds it to a homeless person. It's so much travesty. <br /> <br /> Functional, if it can be called, is tough. It does not have the impression of improvised actors, so it must be scripted, but it is almost of poor quality. Several lines were delivered in a way that shows that the actors (or basically the ones on the screen) either regretted being associated with this movie or thinking of a particularly humorous joke on Saturday night, which they had seen before. camera. I can write three more paragraphs about the quality of this movie, but you both don't want to hear it. <br /> <br /> Make-up and special effects (the only good thing for most movies) were ridiculously bad. The Antagonist, whose name is so ridiculous, doesn't remember it, Mohawk is glued to his head. Yes, glued to your head. And you can say that it is glued even when you look at the place where it meets your drawn skull, you see a plastic strip, unlike fake eyelashes. Fortunately, he is the only example of make-up in the film. <br /> <br /> It is also terribly characteristic to put it lightly. Women who are strangely harshly behaved by brothers who are supposedly benevolent (and I think they have indeed been denied) are not only ugly, but ... despise ... they don't know what they are doing! In one scene, they turn on their obvious lovers, even join a dirty bad guy and then smell some coke. Obviously, they managed to get very good cocaine because they started to shake and laugh before everything went into their nostrils. Great timing for girls! In addition, they carry really terrible things, clothes that belong only in the late 80s and early 90s. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie, this movie, is a waste of movies you should say, a waste of time. Tracking it hurts you and requires not only your beliefs but also your entire brain to stop. If you want to get stoned with your friends and laugh good, then see if you can get this movie (you probably need to download it), otherwise don't even think about it. I hope I was helpful.
