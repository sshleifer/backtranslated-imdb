I was surprised that the makers of this film really said that this movie was a real story. Most scenes seemed to me fake. For example, if one girl eats her sandwich and there was a roach. While he was eating a sandwich, the camera's shoulder on the opposite side showed. It's funny how the camera just happened to a sandwich when a girl eats it. The second scene is when the gang went to open the wardrobe and the cat went out of the closet or I should say it was thrown out to give it. This film was not realistic at all. It is very doubtful that the events that took place took place this evening when the "St. Francisville experiment" took place. I believe the house can be haunted, but not at night when this movie was filmed! The end was amusing when Tim and the other girls were linked to a cellar. Paul and Madison found them and saved them! I'd rather look back at Blair's witch project, then sit back at St. Francisville experiment movie. As I said, if the filmmakers didn't say it was a real story with real events, I might like it more. You better get more entertainment from the Blair witch project (although this is not a true story) !!!
