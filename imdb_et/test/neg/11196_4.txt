The summary was promising, but watching the movie was a big disappointment. Nothing happens in this movie. The plot is linear and surprising. Ordinary characters remain common until the end of the movie, strange characters remain strange until the end of the movie. There is also no basis for the viewer to think that a bad man is someone other than the most obvious candidate. On the positive side, the actors play quite well and the film has little atmosphere, but too little to be important. see it or you are a member of a film production team! 4 is well paid.
