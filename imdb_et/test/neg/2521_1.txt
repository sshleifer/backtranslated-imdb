It is hard to criticize the movie, "Deathbed: The Bed That Eats", and involves a ghost narrator who is trapped behind a two-sided painting he was drawing, and a bed that snores and ?? if i do not get lost, masturbates. (Now it is back with your fellow human beings!) In addition, it (orange, for whatever reason), swallows the food items on its surface, including apples, wine, fried chicken and, of course, people. Again, it is enough to say that you do not expect too much when you see what I think is gastric acid? the final left of something that orange oil takes? only solving certain things. It drinks wine, but the bottle is okay and it eats the chicken bone, but the bucket is just fine. Heck, the bed even replaces unused containers. Hilariously, at one point it downs Pepto-Bismol. I had to laugh at it. I don't think they really wanted you to take it seriously. It's a small budget, and it's easy to see where they cut costs and save money. I thought that in a world where there might be a murderer "Lift" and "Blood Region", this "Death Bed" might be fun to watch. For reasons that can lead to costs, 90% of the film is tuned, someone screams or shows extremely low signs of fear / confusion as to why the bed is attacking (I can think of one and I was never one of those kids who jumped into bed) and you need to stop your unbelief incredibly. (The victim loses all the meat from his hands, barely saying "ow".) Only one scene that went too long was tense? a woman tries to drag a page only using this page. Where are the MST3k boys?
