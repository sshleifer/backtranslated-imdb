Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of Abbie Hoffman and have read this book to steal and steal this urine test. I'm an even bigger fan of Jerry Rubin. But his film was a scattering trash that made Abbie Hoffman's very PG version. The director did not take Abbie Hoffman in this film. They despicted Stew Albert as an F *** ing-cartoon who lacked intellect, a man was Berkley's proffesor for Christians. Okay, they made Anita Hoffman a terrifying job, doing terrible work for Jerry Rubin's character. I think the film is not suitable for the news I've seen about Abbie or the books she wrote. The film just doesn't fit and irritates me. Oh yes and theat is the absolute worst voice I've ever heard of Richard Nixon. This is one of the few films I've ever rented that I couldn't sit down all the way because I have a passion for Abbie Hoffman and her scattered band Yippies, and this movie was just bad. And it hurt me that now that people see the yippies of the movie, they see terrible adaptation and don't get a real reality. Instead, they get a silver braid. <br /> <br />
