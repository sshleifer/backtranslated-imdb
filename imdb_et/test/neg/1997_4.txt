I think the producers of this small budget / horror movie wanted a serious movie, but the director had a parody in their heart. So ... that's what we get. Set in an abandoned spacecraft 1000 years in the future and busy characters and props. The set is any industrial complex, perhaps an oil tanker. They are used so that the control units consist of holders of old TV equipment. One location is obviously the dining hall for the staff and sports an old TV and VCR, and a plastic demijohn with water cooler. Tiny Lister and Coolio get the best lines claiming the whole story. The dialogue is full of concepts that are already dated ("A-OK, Daddy-O"), but maybe the 30th century is very retro? If the captain declares the ship's cargo from "Transylvania Station", you know it's all. It's a bit of Alien, part of JasonX, a shameful title for all the best sci-fi and horror. At one point, Casper VanDien tells his pilot that he will do so with a straight face. It would have been better if they had allowed everyone to fly with satire, but they were trying to make this story seriously ... maybe they were supporters that day. Anyway, not a bad boredom killer if you're not too picky. FX is as good as kits are bad.
