Mexican law (Tomas Milian) steals gold from stagecoach with another Mexican and American. Americans cross Mexico twice and leave them all dead. One bird prey will survive and seek revenge in this movie, which has the original Django (all distributors call it "Django Kill" to squeeze a few more bucks for more sensitive people.) Here's a slightly lower standard western that is too surreal to be enjoyable , and as such, I can't really recommend it to everyone except the hardest Spahet with the western fan. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D + <br /> <br /> Blue Underground DVD Accessories: Part of the Western Collection of BU Spaghetti, Uncut; "Django Tell" (20-minute documentary); 3 Easter Eggs: Highlight the hidden weapon "Django", "Run, Man, Run" and "Man Called Blade" on the trailer side page; highlight the main menu hand to get interviews about the rock group formation and the hidden weapon in the language / subtitle menu will tell you how Tomas Milian was almost killed for anti-communist activities
