A harshly long and tough film. I couldn't believe how bad this film was. I just looked at it because a lot of people got to this site. Did I watch the same movie? The whole episode is one-dimensional. Nothing that happened in the past of Garps had any effect on the future of his (or someone else's) and no one affected their past. I think it was Socrates, who said about games that if a scene can be removed from the game without having any effect, it shouldn't be there. Of course, the director did not know this rule and filled his "work" after one terrible scene. Even the plane falling into the house was unexpected, it wasn't a surprise, but it was unexpected! <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that at the time of writing (December 1, 2002), although many people say it is one of their favorite films, no one has bothered to add memorable quotes. The reason is that there just isn't. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time looking at it, see the plaque thread.
