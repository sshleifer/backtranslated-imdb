Let me first say that I rarely watch movies, I only comment when I'm blown or frustrated by something I thought it was good. Killshot was a great disappointment at so many levels. The script was terrible, the actor was sub-par (primarily from heavy difficulties such as Rourke and Lane), and editing and effects were comical (blowing cars, etc.). Rosario Dawson had a terrible role, I can't believe even accepting it, it was a misuse of his talent that I can't even put into words. I should have known that when I saw this movie trailer 3 years ago, it was put on the record that their movie was a serious problem with this movie .......... B-movie all the time ... ... ... don't worry if your really boring ........
