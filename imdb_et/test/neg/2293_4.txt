Is Swedish herb film? Has the world gone crazy? <br /> <br /> Probably not, but nowadays, it is still not common in Sweden with gore-flick, Sweden's b-film business seems to have problems these days, the long golden days of "Rymdinvasion i lappland". And this movie seems to be a separate concern: it's just too much talk, it still manages to be somewhat fun, mainly for a good FX, which is great for a b-movie. However, the script and most of the actors are pretty bad, but in reality it is not so much, it should be a gore flick and nothing more than it goes wrong for some reason. There's just no blood to fill the space. <br /> <br /> Everyone who knows about Gert Fylking is good at laughing at his role. Hawk. I almost laughed at my ass. It's really so fun. <br /> <br /> Apart from the good parts I've read, there's nothing to suggest here if you don't starve for Swedish B-movies. <br /> <br /> 4/10
