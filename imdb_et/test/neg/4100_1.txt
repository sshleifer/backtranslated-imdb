It's a bad movie. What makes it even worse is time, effort, and money put into a super predictable script and action. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of monster, by the way, and some insect. Don't wait for the plot to explain. Missing. It can work if there is something interesting or signs that we might care about. No it is not. Anything that happens to any person is as predictable as other movies on the Sci Fi channel. <br /> <br /> Don't try to understand what some characters say. They talk about a giant, especially annoying lead woman whose accent is a kind of thick British, which is harder to understand than any old British movie you've seen. He's incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> A lot of money is spent on some big sets and landscapes, and this is the main crime in this movie because it's not just worth it.
