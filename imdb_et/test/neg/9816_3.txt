Linnea Quigley's pig-tail to eat milk, straps and kills her sister and sister boy after their sex. She goes to shelter, makes Amy's best friend (Karen Russell) and two blackmail her at bedtime (one plays "Lolie Wagoner" on a regular "Carol Burnett Show"). Outside these two hateful mafia princesses (!) Will stop taking their medication and invite the six boyballs to ex-boyfriends to their big homeland where they will be killed centrally very gently. Dirty Mystery Killer. <br /> <br /> Dreadful David Barton FX is so bloody, but so unrealistic that they take some sort of surreal quality. The same goes for the movie. Dialogue is so strange and stylish, the film is both intuitively paced and edited, and a different world of mind, you start to doubt your own peace of mind. This movie is actually trying to get a plot of land and three-dimensional signs, but it's all so badly processed as almost everything would happen if Ed Wood wrote the script for Ingmar Bergman! And like every good Bergman movie, this mature moral follows - Every good party needs a decent man / girl, so there are enough chicks to "walk their lizard." Look at it for yourself ... or not! <br /> <br /> Linnea (the only reason I was interested in it at first) is a lot of fun in this amusement, much more dialogue than usual and has several eye-catching scenes. Unfortunately he is completely out of the last third of the film and the film is suffering from it. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
