He wrote, directed and starred in Bruce Campbell Camp Master. It's easy to say that it's a budget shoelace; filmed independently in Bulgaria. All I can really say is that it's not always funny. Campbell plays a deceptive spouse (Antoinette Byron) with a wealthy American businessman and tries to close a business transaction before he is murdered. He hires a cube to drive him around a strange little town; does not know that his wife is "continuing" with a taxi driver. Campbell's moments are bludgeonized; Cabbie is killed in the same place. The crazy scientist (Stacy Keach) continues the experiment that puts the cabbie into the American head. With its massive seams on its forehead, Campbell breaks freely and drives the street in search of his wife; all the time he says with a strange voice in his upper size. Campbell challenges his rubberized face by making foolish expressions as he claims himself. So Bruce does what he does best and undoubtedly his many fans are happy. I have the impression that it must be written as a straight comedy. Rounding the story is Ted Raimi, Tamara Gorski and Vladmir Kolev. Watch it on the Sci-Fi channel.
