I think it's safe to say that if you look at the usual standard movie or any premium productions, don't worry about this movie when you hate it. If you're a critical film, don't worry. If you love science fiction films and you don't care about what your future glimpse is, then you will easily be entertained. It is very clear that its budget was super super low, but the money they have made is worth the back. Some of the burning fires were pretty bad and the escape images were terrible, but it is obvious that they had good support from the computer point of view, because the planet scenes and foreign images were quite inventive. Dialogue is fun and fun, but it doesn't work at all. Well, I'm not too sure what really happened to tell you the truth.
