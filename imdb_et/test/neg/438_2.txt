I had long tried to see an American werewolf in Paris, because I loved my predecessor, but this film doesn't impress as much as the American werewolf. Frankly, it is not at all impressive to me. babe from Julie Delpy's death. Before it's time to work out when constant looting and dirty dialogue is meant to be a comedy stuff, the full moon has hit and brats are pursuing terrible CGI werewolves under the Paris sewer. /> The script is reluctantly bad, the actors were made to make this movie, they are terrible performances that match the state of the movie. From start to finish, this film is never entertaining, interesting, or even easy to follow. I had trouble watching the whole movie without my dinner to be honest. In short: Tap or press forever. <br /> <br /> In Paris, I appreciate the 10th werewolf.
