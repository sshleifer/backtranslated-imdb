The recent release of Mad Dog Morgan on Troma DVD is disappointing. It seems to be a censored print for television viewing. Some of the more violent scenes have been edited and parts of the colored language have been removed. Anyone who saw the movie without being cut off is angry with this toxic DVD version. "Mad Dog Morgan" deserves to be released on DVD in the original theater. But even if it is published on a DVD, it is still one of the best examples of the nineteenth century Australian bushranger life. After the old Melbourne Gaol tour, where the sentenced death masks are outlined, it is worth recalling "Mad Dog Morgan".
