The story comes from "King Learist"; The device is in Iowa Farm. Here's the test of this thing: when you find yourself asking, "Why did it and so did it," and the answer is, "it happened in" King Lear "," you know the film has failed. Well, that's what's going on here. The figure of the father of this story does not live his life; But the movie is more wrong than this. <br /> <br /> Jocelyn Moorhouse is ambitious - much more ambitious than I think she understands. He tries to take King Leah's story and completely change this provision. This is a task in itself. The most likely result is that the transplanted story dies and no one can quite figure out why (although there are enough successful transplants, such as the "West Side Story" to try it out). But he is also trying out a revisionist statement. In the "King Lear" version, he wants to create, Reagan and Goner have compassion and Cordelia is a villain. It is also a task in itself. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to complete either task; is impossible. In fact, it is impossible for one to succeed as much as you can try. If we look at the same events from a moral point of view, events must be the same events for BE - which means that the setting cannot be changed. If the story has to be resettled alive, its moral heart must be beaten all the time - that means it cannot be changed from an ethical point of view. Moorhouse failed to fail not only in one, but in both. And so he did. ... Of course it is possible to try both tasks, fail in both tasks, but some fluke hits a work of art that is good for independent reasons. I mention this because I have not read Jane Smiley's novel, which for me is for good reasons. But the film is not. If there was nothing wrong with that, there would still be nothing about it being just as thorough, scary. The very fields of corn are even more boring than in real life - it doesn't have to be so, because on my head I can think of four films ("Ozi Wizard", "North by Northwest") "," Straight Story "," Kikujiro ") is not at all boring.
