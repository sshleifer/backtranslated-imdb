I hope this is not a portrait of future things. High definition video cameras are always cheaper (though I don't swear what was used here), so it's open for all wannabe Scorseses and Tarantinos of the season. <br /> <br /> by this smoker and calling it "movie", industry would be a great service. Photography is the standard you would expect for a family staying in a zoo. I could build a new house with everything from wood. What is remarkable about this is that nobody seems to be the worst. They are all equally awful. Like a whole bunch of Ben Afflecks. Or Steven Seagals. <br /> <br /> What I was trying to do was headline. I'm such a thing as Frankenhooker or Monsturd. Frankenhooker was also pretty bad, but at least I smiled out and the actor was just bad, not terrible. I can't comment on Monsturdo because I've received this copy yet. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I hope people who did this didn't make any money. Otherwise, they may be encouraged to try it again. Please, guys, try the camera and go back to your normal work.
