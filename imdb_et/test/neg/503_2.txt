The rule of making this film seems to have been "never a one-minute scene if you can make this 10-minute scene." It was the principle that began right from the start with the 1870 Harvard class with long images. The purpose of this scene was to introduce some of the main features of the story and give them a bit of background - which is somewhat effective in comparing the idealism of Harvard's graduation ceremony with the realism of Johnson County life in Wyoming, but it goes on and on and sets a film with recurrent clergy. something worse because I found that a significant amount of dialogue is almost inconsistent. Finally, I couldn't even look at it in one session. I went about half and I had to set it off a few days before I could pull myself back to see how it came out. <br /> <br /> My reaction to this film is a shame in many ways, because here are positive. Performances are generally high, especially from Kris Christopherson as Averill, Christopher Walken as Champion and Isabelle Huppert from Ella. The main story - which is surrounded by each other, that there is no constantly evolving mood - is potentially interesting, focusing on the efforts of immigrants to establish themselves in Johnson County and the efforts of the local livestock farmer to stop them, co-operating with the government and the military in a number of ways. There are also some absolutely breathtaking landscapes. Having said that, the whole thing would have been honestly said for half a time - and it should have been. Finally, all of these potential positives are put on - again - the sensuality that the film seems to turn around. Seriously - 2/10.
