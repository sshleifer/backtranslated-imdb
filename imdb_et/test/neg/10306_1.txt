I'm very open. I'm looking at all kinds of programs to the end ... good or bad ... just to give them the opportunity to learn from the good aspects and the bad. This exhibition was good. But my god, what were the writers, director and director thinking? The number of actors is terrible ... at least in exceptional cases, Meryl (Mimi Rogers), and Darcy (Joy Osmanski) randomly got the best of the game. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast to kill the show. This is the same story in every episode. Sam is going to do something. His boss interrupts these plans by assigning ridiculous work projects to him. Then the foolish ways Sam is trying to make are mainly stupid and lack true intelligent humor. This is every episode. It gets very tiring. <br /> <br /> In the 2nd season, they dive into the eye. Two "hot" girls in the show will be written out (still a brother? Explain that casting is please). I see why they wrote them out ... they had no important role ... but they didn't add anyone to replace them right. <br /> <br /> Strong Derek Tricoll's character is continually given in season 2. His behavior (with all other people) is similar to many of the 80's bad sitcoms ... could have been funny but ... but hurts now. <br /> <br /> The exhibition could have been so much better for some good writers and some people who had these talent. This exhibition is nothing. The quality of production is the only good aspect of the exhibition. It is great in this respect ... unfortunately, the content is painfully sad. <br /> <br /> My God. FOX, was there anything better to choose? I'm busy showing like "It's always Sunny in Philadelphia" or "30 Rock" right now. The bar should be programs such as those that actually assume that the audience is intelligent and does not lose itself continuously using its brain power to continue breathing.
