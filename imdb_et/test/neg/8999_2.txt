What a waste of time. I got about five minutes into it and I * became * very * awesome, and I started to fast forward a bit fast, and soon there was no longer any desire to move fast to turn off my thumb. I thought the actors Mark Redfield and Barry Murphy had very capable jobs, but no one else I saw did anything good. Again, look at this review with a big salt, because the film was just so intolerable that I couldn't do it. Heck, I couldn't do it with MIDDLE! <br /> <br /> I can't submit this review because it's not long enough. Maybe this last sentence puts it over.
