Bigfoot movies tend to be bad, so I don't want to watch them. However, there were good ads on the Sci-Fi channel, so I decided to watch. The climbing trip leads to the Pacific Northwest to find a fallen plane carrying the expedition's daughter (played by Lance Hendrickson) and has brought about a revolutionary DNA detector that could be used to prove the existence of sasquatch. And this initially creates some relationship. Sasquatch is invisible, but sees the heat of the climbers body (like an alien "Predator") and I was thinking when he hit. Performance is satisfactory, as is background music. Dense wooded location is well used. And when the creature is finally seen, the costume is not bad, though not great. But when the film gets crushed, it becomes increasingly annoying and absurd. Most characters are disgusting people, rude to each other and only money and advertising expeditions (except for the character of Lance Hendrickson), so it's impossible to take care of what happens to them. And their behavior is getting stupid. One man puts the creature (not deadly), drunk and sits alone in the dark. One female camper puts a negligee on a slippery slip before climbing into a sleeping bag, and then sucks down so that she does not get her hair and make-up. The survivors then conclude that sasquatch is really after the DNA detection machine and lets them live when they leave it ("the creature knows what threatens it"). Of course, the instinct is not applicable to these participants, or they would not have appeared. And the end is so stupid, you want to hit the TV screen. If it wasn't for the script, it would have been a good horror movie.
