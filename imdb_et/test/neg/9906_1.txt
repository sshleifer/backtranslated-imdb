It was really terrible. Looking at the fascinated horror, I continued asking why they did it? That is, they took out all the scenarios "Tomorrow's Day", "The Perfect Storm" and "Twister", and remixed them in the three-hour miniseries led by the long-time junk TV director Dick Lowry, a man with a disaster movie known as a clich√© and not a real intercourse. Many of the casts were unknown Canadians and filming took place in Canada, Winnepeg doubled for Chicago, so no doubt the tax breaks associated with it. While some ambitious special effects were attempted, the performance is so bad that it does not achieve proper speculation. Participants may be competent parties; the script is so bad that no one could show it except maybe Randy Quaid Tommy Tornado chaser, who went right and was quite fun. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, manufacturers have since made one of the Canadian catastrophe, known as the "World of Category 7", which was very tasteful in the US a few weeks after Hurricane Katrina CBS. How could Ed Murrow and Walter Cronkite network do this? Prime Minister? PT Barnum "Nobody Has Ever Breaked The Public Taste Underestimating" is once again proven.
