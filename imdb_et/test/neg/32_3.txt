This film seems to be well done and more efforts should be made to promote women's films. This film is also deeply disturbing as it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a deeply disturbed character. If you have seen some promotional material, you may think that this is a smooth film about the relationship that has ended, but none of it indicates how the central assumption interferes: <br /> <br /> The woman threatens to commit suicide unless if he soon agrees that he will revive the most valuable memories of their relationship here. When it was said as unfair (at least to say) that there is such a threat, Tessa (alleged main character) claims that "life is not fair." <br /> <br /> Huh ??? This symbol also uses tears to manipulate his former lover to stay and contributes to sexually oriented behavior (which he initially denies as a motive), while ensuring that it is not sex. <br /> <br /> Gender, let Tracey Gold and Brian Austin-Green play and be headed for life-long lifetimes, such as "Obsession Hostage". There is no definition of medically accepted sound and emotional stability that would include Tessa's behavior in this film. <br /> <br /> The borders of Kristen Thomson to play border psychotic, manipulative ex T, perhaps too well because there is no well-corrected man, man or woman who could look at it and have no shadow.
