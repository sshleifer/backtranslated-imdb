One of the most boring films I've ever seen. Three immature youngsters have sex and speak very few, except for the "love" of one another. They don't seem to be interested in much, but in a passive way. I felt out. Most of the exterior surfaces take place at night, so you can't even enjoy the well-lit Paris attractions! I gave up after an hour and ten minutes.
