This film was of a different quality in a box of 20 others, and I can say for sure that this title was right at the bottom of the coin. <br /> <br /> It makes no sense to go through the plot that was there, choosing what was wrong, as I have not received all day, and life is short, reminding me that I just lost about 85 minutes of my view. <br /> <br /> The action was badly bad, so it was funny, though only fair, while comedian elements like two idiotic police have to be made by all Laurel & Hardy fans. One of the few funny moments was when the manager's wife made fun of her former friends with plastic T * ts, which would have been okay if I hadn't seen them when she put the screen on. > <br /> The lowest I can give is one, and it probably deserves to be Heather Thomas because he was definitely sexy and shapely, although his actions were as bad as everyone else.
