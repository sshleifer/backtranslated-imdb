The concept of this movie was pretty good. But somehow, the execution failed in many ways. There are not many horror films I think used dolls are so realistic. Especially when these dolls begin to flash their eyes or move their hands. So much could have been done with this assumption. There were many scenes where there was room for tension and skipping. And I was really looking forward to scary things. But the film was never intimidating. One of the main reasons is that the story is too small and predictable. I really thought they did it with a purpose to surprise us with some great twists. Unfortunately, this does not happen. At least not as I hoped. Also, the majority could no longer believe it. It would have been nice if the symbols had more backgrounds. At first, when we can introduce the main people. He and other characters seem to have been called by an artist. But it is also obvious that they have no idea what they are called. Of course this is part of the mystery. But it seems unlikely. When I get an invitation without a clue what it is, it just doesn't. In addition, most characters are not really pleasant with the end result, which you never care about. Another mistake is that the director differs from the basic premise that is scary and highlights new elements that have never been explained and are not even relevant to the "mystery of the doll masters". In general, this film is a great disappointment for me. If you want to see a good horror film containing dolls, see "Dead Silence"!
