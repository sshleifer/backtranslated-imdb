It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I'm still trying to get over how bad it was. Just because it is related to the name of Godard does not make it big. Not only does it mean nothing, we can see one blurry long traffic jam, which is not stunning, incredible or something like that. While this long duration of traffic jam is occurring, you are likely to feel like preparing a pastram sandwich as you continue to look at it. Pieces of alleged story, stupid, foolish characters. What message do we expect from this? It does nothing and is not practical. The arrogance of the director in introducing the French people smoking their furry, dull chains, and sitting and chatting for hours, and then passing it when the art is truly amazing.
