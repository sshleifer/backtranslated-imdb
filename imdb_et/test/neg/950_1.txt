I saw this movie some time ago and I waited for it. My biggest problem was seeing a trailer, which I was expecting for a very stylish Marshal movie that had a lot of action and maybe a little plot to think about the way. I was very disappointed because it seems that if you have seen the trailer, there is nothing else worth watching (if you expect as described above). My girlfriend gave up halfway at that time and I was still looking in the hope that something interesting would happen ... nothing. I didn't find any signs or real interest in any sign. I'd say you just didn't bother if you didn't have a few hours of your life, so you didn't really care about losing.
