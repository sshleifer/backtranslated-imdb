This is indeed a terrible movie, if one of the standard measures is. The plot, storyline, action, influence, direction - I could go on. Suffice it to say it's bad. However, he has a certain complaint. Many completely out-of-context scenes appear, it's fun to look for Batman references. Umm - that's it. Bad really, don't worry.
