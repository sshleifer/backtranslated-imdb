<br /> <br /> I've seen this movie here in Munich, where there is a huge number of real fantasy fans. One part of the audience was sleeping in the middle of the movie and the other part was booeing. Boring dialogue, poor choreographic struggles, terribly stupid and worse special effects. Well, at least the actors didn't have to do much, except to look at the thing or (if they were women) who showed their breasts in the right light. Even GÃ¶tz Otto, who later belonged to the audience, realized that the viewers were disappointed. Warn, people, the cheapest fantasy movie ........
