I have little to add here to the commentary on the 23 in the art of the bowl needle. But when the first Brazilian (born, raised and lived in Rio de Janeiro, just a few miles from the Vigário Gerali favel that is depicted in the film), this commentary on US-funded Favela's rise in IMDbis, I get mixed feelings: on the one hand, it is good that Brazilian favelade The terrible situation is paying more attention to filmmakers and the media, both from Brazil and abroad, as local authorities seem to have abandoned for a long time. On the other hand, it is astonishingly frustrating that "Favela Rising" turns out to be such a lost opportunity for illuminating non-Brazilian audiences on this issue, as first-time executives Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary (who come from the US and understandably Neofytes on the thing) turn to the AfroReggae group leader Anderson Sá biography to this glamorous canonization of a superficial, unilateral, subconscious, and misleading documentary. Good intentions, confusing results. "Favela Rising" looks like a TV ad that is lower than a premium TV interview, and a biased advertising material. <br /> <br /> "Favela Rising" feels incredibly counterfeit to the Brazilian viewer and not only because he sees the visual treatment of eternal reality, and its misplaced place-good happy ending. The "City of God" is an obvious reference: COG actors Leandro Firmino and Jonathan Haagensen come without a "hype" for no apparent reason. "Favela Rising" is allegedly a documentary about the AfroReggae group and its director Anderson Sást, but be careful: if you see the scenes captured by the favelas, overlooking the beautiful shoreline of Rio, you may be warned that Vigário Geral (home of AfroReggae and Anderson area) is located in the Rio region , far from every beach. A strange choice of location, at least at least. <br /> <br /> "Favela Rising" is probably confusing for non-Brazilians who don't know much about the interviewees (and the film doesn't tell them) and must wait for the closing credit to find out that many of the audio tracks are NOT AfroReggae Bandi's (though you doubt when you start to listen to pink Martin, all the people!). They also do not know that important issues were simply not mentioned: why does the film draw on the idea that AfroReggae is a one-man project? Why not recognize many partners who provide him with significant financial and logistical support, such as the Rio City City Council, Brazilian private companies, international registrations, and international non-governmental organizations, without which AfroReggae may not even survive? Why not say clearly that Vigário Geral is still suffering from violent drug wars and that his people still live in fear of attacks by traffickers and police? Why not say clearly that many of the archival materials showing police violence and corruption are NOT Vigário Geralis? HOW AND WHY did the child Richard Murilo finally join AfroReggae? WHY freaking earth did not interview again at the end of the movie? <br /> <br /> For Anderson, the film leaves many loose ends for the viewer: what is Anderson's "two" mother? Is the child his son in his hand? Why does she inspire Shiva? Is he a Buddhist? Why does Candomblé appear on the beach when the films mention Anderson's "miraculous" recovery from the accident? Is he a Candomblé follower? Why not let her explain the contradiction in launching a drug-fighting group and at the same time, Bob Marley praises? If AfroReggae is also the movement of the black people's gorgeous building from favela, why are the AfroReggae band girls with a limited booty-bouncing routine? No, you don't get answers to these questions. <br /> <br /> Instead, filmmakers are interested in turning Anderson Sá into a pop star, Malcolm X, Gandhi, and Christ (see this last picture of Christ's Redeemer on the Corcovado Hill just after Anderson's "miraculously" walking after his operation ). And this is the ATTENTION made by filmmakers to Anderson and his reasons: turn him into a special CHOSEN (by the time they show their operational rhythm, you're ready to believe it's a sign of God). <br /> <br /> Because what is remarkable to Anderson - who is the most common man you will ever meet - is that he helped make his environment "not special", but copied and customized the winning projects (like Olodum, among other things, has a strong support in Bahia, its community, the strong support of friends, artists, intellectuals, politicians, businessmen, and the media. If you don't speak Portuguese, you probably don't notice that Anderson is not particularly bright or literal (unlike his sharply funny partner José Juniors) as much as he is not very talented as a singer, writer or musician, yet his "habit" could be the true "inspirational" core of the film: to show that everyone, with the help of idealism, persistence and lasting support, can actually make a significant contribution to their community do not have to be incarnate of Jesus, because in fact the movement is important - AfroReggae - not a man, look? Do we have enough personality cult? <br /> <br /> "F Avela Rising "Finally, you probably don't know much more about Rio Favelade when you did, when you went - you just see what some of them look like.
