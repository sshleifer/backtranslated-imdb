I give "Flashdance" the lowest rating of 1 out of 10 because it is nothing more than a music video with a short film that surrounds music videos so that the time can be played as a long movie. When is it considered a movie? Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens, an ambitious 18-year-old dancer, who has a misunderstanding of working as a welder at the Pittsburgh steelworks. Most older women don't get fresh out of high school for over 18 years. In the meantime, he works as an exotic dancer at night, who never takes off clothes in a fatty spoon on Mawby. Despite the good choreographic and well-polished dance classes, girls do every night in Mawby, you think they're working in the best casino in the Las Vegas Strip. <br /> <br /> Alex comes to predictable romance with his boss Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), who is about twice his age. After resisting Nick's advancement because leaving the boss is not a good idea, he won't waste time to go with him after the first date. Alex and Nick are not making any effort to hide their relationship with the workplace, which makes no sense of how it is likely to look at Alex's associates. <br /> <br /> If Beals is not doubled for many dances, the sequences in the movie will spend most of their character on their time. Alex's dream is to get only a call to the reputed Pittsburgh dance conservatory. Inexplicably, when his boss / boy helps him try, he has dreamed, he throws one of his tantrums. He is angry with Nick that he does not make any rumors because of his intervention and then leaves his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. This is just one scene that leaves you wondering what the devil's thought when they did it. <br /> <br /> Of course, Alex finally gets his listening at the Conservatory. He puts the dance on the board of a routine conservatory, which is so ridiculous that you think it was in a movie marketed by the MTV generation. Oh yes, this is a dance routine in a movie marketed by the MTV generation. <br /> <br /> I don't think I can judge whether Beals can actually do well on what I saw in Flashdance. This is because he is forced to play so badly written that I don't think it He has the ability to act justly from the litmus test. <br /> <br /> You have to give it to the "maker." This movie is proof that the poorest movie can be covered with a slick marketing campaign. In this case, the MTV has high-speed and award-winning audio and music videos. If they had devoted more of their energy to writing a script, they could have developed a plot and story that were marked by signs. Instead of what we get, there are stock characters in ridiculous scenes, where every functional brain observer doesn't take seriously. A truly forgotten movie.
