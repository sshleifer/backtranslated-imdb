The Hollywood film industry is the most widespread in the world. He only needs one stroke to reinvent the same old crash again and again. Take, for example, super heroes for each X-Man and Spiderman Daredevil, Elektra, Ghost Rider and Hulk. Japanese horror remakes are even the worst. It only took a circle that was perfect (mostly because of Mr. Gore Verbinsky) to bring a thousand horrible horror based on a woman, eg. Ring 2, eye, dark water (which was good but meaningless) and fears. <br /> <br /> The first grudge wasn't quite bad. It was the most terrifying route that could be expected. The pros had some brain-narrating narratives. Grudge 2 is exactly like the previous one; it may be good, but hey, what boy guys in black II? Was it a nice thing to change the whole scenario of xerox and just change the villain? For Grudge 2, the critic goes the same way. <br /> <br /> Tired fears, bad behavior (except Amber Tamblyn) and clich√©s all over the place. There are three stories in different places and times. It is Aubrey (Tamblyn) who is investigating what his sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) died; Allison (Arielle Kebbel), whom colleagues take to visit the house where the incident in the first film took place; and finally, an American family who knows strange things in an apartment next door. Glad to say (and I mean it) that everything is related at the end, but should not rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is just tiring and boring. <br /> <br /> Chills are all there, girl alone in closets, someone who shouldn't go home, others who dig too deep. At the same time, spirits keep killing and killing and killing, which seems even more dead than the ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic. Hey, does it look just like another bad Japanese remake called Pulse? Yeah, day after day it's easier to fear ... against Hollywood.
