This is a documentary about homeless women. It was interesting in the sense that it focused on women who are socially - job-seekers and friendships - but are in situations where they cannot afford housing. <br /> <br /> I found that some women who are covered by the interesting, but the story was few. Direction and editing could not keep my attention. Of course, there were differences in the stories of these women, but the message was essentially the same and could have been said, focusing on some of them deeper. <br /> <br /> I did a movie until the end, but it was a pretty boring journey.
