I watched this movie on the second night of the video and found myself behind this endless snoozefest. First of all, one of my biggest pets, when such films are characterized as horror films. It's THRILLER! this is correct! It has no monsters or anything supernatural. It's just a movie about a writhed serum killer (In fact, it's a very small body number, so it's a more sequential torture movie and it did a good job against torture.) The basic premise is that a man who attracts teenagers to his house through online chat rooms has succeeded in horrors could have made a great movie, but we see him only to attract a couple of teenage girls through the internet at the beginning of the movie. One of these girls turns out to be the daughter of a local detective and gets emotionally involved. The film quickly turns from a potentially intelligent sado-masochistic thriller into a boring old cat and mouse game with an incredibly boring detective and psychopathic captain Howdy / Carleton Hendricks played by the writer / producer / Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider. Snider is a ridiculous attempt at meaningful poetic individual liners for pain and similar positive effects. When he tries to order people through this film, he can't illuminate them unhappy and (inadvertently). John Pieplow's leadership (whose only previous leadership was Jurassic Women), which I promise to talk about for the title, and that was something wrong with editing, which resulted in the film being separated from some scene that was not completely tied to the plot, except when the scenario is guilty (which is quite possible.) This movie is a completely failed attempt on a thriller who is trying to go through only a horror film, which is the only achievement. If you see it in your video store, don't waste your money, but if you need something to laugh one night and Strangeland has a cable, you can also watch it. 3 out of 10
