This is one of the most ridiculous Westerners ever made by Hollywood. Gary Cooper plays a former confederate official who wants the law. He meets a moor called Weatherby, played by US Marshal Leif Erickson, who doesn't know the firearms. Weatherby is on her way to Dallas to see her brother Tonia Robles played by Ruth Roman. Tonia's father, Senor Robles, has many men, but they are unable to keep an eye on the cattle that the Marlow brothers regularly rust. Will Marlow, played by Raymond Massey, has financed Robles's real estate loan, making things completely absurd. He is even able to demand mortgage payments before they pay, just because he knows it. <br /> <br /> Because Weatherby is a Boston boy who can't fight because he just became a Marshal he could visit his groom Tonia, (Just one example of more plot nonsense. Do we expect you to go through this job only Writing a test? Wait a moment, this man could not pass the written test.) He exchanges identities with Reb Hollister, who is, of course, an expert. Reb takes the liberty to greet Weatherby's girl with a passionate kiss, while Weatherby looks like an idiot. Gary Cooper, Hollywood's first stud, is Rebis here. Before making the film, he not only takes Weatherby's work, but also steals his groom, and Ruth Roman as Tonia falls so hard and so fast that he gives a dime to Leif Erickson a little over half of the film in the film; , so, despite good cast and lush photography, the film is clever. And Cooper's character is the perfect carrier. The film also marks Barbara Payton as the girl, beautiful and talented actor of Brant Marlow, who unfortunately lost her potential by making too many headlines for wrong reasons. I strongly urge you to do this.
