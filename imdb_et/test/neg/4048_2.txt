When I first saw it, I thought it was a joke. I thought, "You get an 8MM camera, I get my little brother's monster toys, we make a movie!" Why do anyone today, like in 2001, like to do a sci-fi movie, seems to have done it in the early 80s. With actors who are from the same wood as a cigar shop in India, the script written by the director's 4-year-old son, a camera that had been stolen from a pawn, had special effects on the line of poverty, and from top to bottom, a director who thought it would make them famous. The end result was not an outstanding, completed dialogue and continuity. It must be fun to do Venus and I'm sure all the participants had their foolish movie blasting. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 that is big and hopeless. <br /> <br />
