"Carolina Moon" is a sufficient TV movie about a girl with psychic power who returns to a city where she grew up and where her best friend of childhood was murdered. It turns out that some other girls are murdered on the same day each year, and Tori, played by Claire Forlan, has to solve the mystery before he comes to death. Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black, CSI New York) is a female leader and does a pretty good job, supported by the rather tasty Oliver Hudsom and the luminous Jacqueline Bisset. The Nora Roberts novel-tailored script is striking and the <br /> <br /> chart can be predicted with caution. However, this is compensated again, as I said, by the very tasty Oliver Hudson.
