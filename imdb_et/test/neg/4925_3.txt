This exhibition demonstrates the depth to which the UK TV pre-stream drama has sunk. In these dull scripts, mediocre actions, bad plots, terrible dialogues, you have to watch an old ER episode DVD to see the great hospital drama. <br /> <br /> None of the participants in this show seem to be an exhibition for you if you want a low quality but easily absorbable soap opera TV. Personally, I like something that has more meat. Unfortunately, like any other UK license fee payer, I fund this throttle.
