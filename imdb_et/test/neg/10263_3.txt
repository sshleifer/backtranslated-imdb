Films that use a blue-black and vibrant skin tone to create a noir-ish for the film, unfortunately do not work. In fact, it is quite irritating because it conceals demon characters and reduces them to one-dimensional beings. <br /> <br /> At least the original was hysterical energy and gore kits were quite stunning. Black gore is hardly scary or the main female demon at all scary when it tries to mock and rebel the best camp in Lugos' style. <br /> <br /> The narrative is extremely divorced and if you could imagine Russ Meyer's "naked lunch" you can understand that you're trying to be William Burroughs-esque. Otherwise, let this film go wide. Bava and Argento fans - again - are bitterly disappointed.
