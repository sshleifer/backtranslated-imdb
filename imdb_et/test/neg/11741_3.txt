What is embarrassing ... It does not make the original correct, when everything in this movie has worked terribly, Hitchcock has to spin in his grave. The frequency at which Marion is killed in the shower is both inefficient and unigeneral. The only good thing is that they used the same music and are so obvious who kills him in the shower. I appreciate this movie 3/10
