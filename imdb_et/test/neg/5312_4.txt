I'm a fan of Get Shorty. This is a sequel to a movie that does not need to be continued. <br /> <br /> Chili is back, but Rene Russo is gone. Unfortunately, the Chili game was played in the first movie and instead of finding an interesting personal arc, they just stood around him repeating the lines of the first movie. It's pretty dull. Travolta looks old. It's like people who move around him because his bones become crazy. Her pink lip gloss and blue eye contact are very strange. Another bad role is Edie (played by Uma Thurman). He's a music producer, a role that requires him to be just a female Reuben Kincaid. ("Hey, these kids have a great new sound.") In every scene, he has the wrong pitch motivationally or emotionally, or both. It is painful to look. Despite being quite complicated, Be Cool improves after a very bad start. <br /> <br /> I certainly smiled (Vince Vaughan runs on, Cedric entertainer, Ludicrous, Rock, t - a shirt that says "widow" on it), but it does not offer great memories after its end. This is the love of helium light in the first frame of the festival. In the first film, Gene Hackman is not an idiotic one. It's almost a good thing to do in the world for a couple of kids who deserve a chance (Beyonce & Rock). Ho-hum. The first one was not preaching. <br /> <br /> Working on the first movie (repeatedly) in gags and lines is annoying, as is a piece of concession for Rock wrestling fans (he raises his eyebrow twice), as does Droll inside joke: Steven Tyler said, "I don't not a singer who plays in the movie "with ar. <br /> <br /> A remarkable lineup is part of the problem. The first movie was not burdened by "stars". <br /> <br /> To rent a box, we even call it.
