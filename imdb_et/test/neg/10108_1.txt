<br /> <br /> Spoilers <br /> <br /> I am as kind as possible about this movie (some people, including directors !, get very disturbed when reviewers speak their thoughts) so ... <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful car accident and opening credits look good and ... that's it; everything else bites big. Everything that works is terrible, the script is embarrassing, special effects look like what schoolchildren did on cheap computers. All in all, this film has serious bowling shoe tendencies. <br /> <br /> As a horror film, it is not very scary and if it were to achieve a "thinker" horror movie, then at some level I managed to keep it in the end of the movie is terribly far away. It can really be an ironic look at bad horror movies and I miss a point, but I doubt it somehow. <br /> <br /> This is a full-featured movie shop and I couldn't recommend it to anyone, and it's painful to say it because I'm looking forward to the resurrection of the British horror. <br /> <br /> If you disagree with this review, it's just my opinion and I'm sure someone in there will love it (for example, the mother's director).
