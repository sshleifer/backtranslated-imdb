This movie was so terrible that it can't even be described. I was surprised that I even sat over this trash. I couldn't believe such a movie would have even thought. It was a row of killers who tipped like a chicken. He's not just grabbed a couple of times, he's stealing the whole movie. He even pulls his hand like a chicken that is even a stupider than anything I've ever seen. I couldn't believe it came out in 1990. I thought it appeared in the early 80s or something. Then the daughter is not particularly wise because she defended the geek or the human chicken. The end is just getting worse and it's the worse end I've ever seen. This movie is just a chicken s ** t. I smiled more than scared and I strongly recommend going out and getting a bucket of baked chicken instead of seeing this movie.
