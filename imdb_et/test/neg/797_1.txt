Warn that next time you see Richard Kelly involved in any production, escape. Fast. <br /> <br /> Kelly proved to the world after the latest film "Southland Tales" that she is a pretentious director. It was pleasant and complicated. "The Box" hasn't changed much. <br /> <br /> I can take a picture of his pitch for Warner Bros, and I can bet that the studio's masters drove it right: a full-length movie based on one of Richard's "Twilight Zone" Matheson old short stories. <br /> <br /> Great mistake! Don't read further if you don't want this movie to be completely broken for you: <br /> <br /> Norma (Cameron Diaz) presses the button. It turns out that the Arlington flight attendant (Frank Langella) is an alien who uses his body as a ship to carry out "experiments" where the fate of mankind is. His face was intimidated because he was hit by Alien Lightening, which killed him, but brought him back to make all the red buttons. Of course, because Norma pushes the button, knowing well that someone can die, she must suffer from the consequences if someone else doesn't think about her. Finally, he and his wife (James Marsden) decide to kill Norma instead of the son growing up for the deaf and the blind. <br /> <br /> Kelly is dancing around the "message" of her movie, trying to find out the morale of the story. Of course, anyone with a brain says at first: "What if I was a person who dies?". Richard Kelly won't even let him in his characteristic HUMAN conversation. In fact, they avoid it all together. They both seem to be educated, working in a prestigious school and also in NASA, so why would they both be better than they could HOW IS OUT? <br /> <br /> If he had the main character in fact this conversation, the whole movie might be over there! Instead, we have to look at the wedding to continue forever, NASA and NSA be pleased with Arlington Stewart, who take over these government programs, teleportation to show Marsden's life beyond our world, so it's "easier" to kill his wife and drone controlled by Steward, which can be anywhere, anywhere, anytime. <br /> <br /> The most painful part of this movie is pace. Nothing will happen. This is confusing mish-mash of ideas that are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This movie is unlikely to be marketed. Ads make it "Saw" to see it, and even use the music from these films to sell it. In fact, what you get is slow, boring, ridiculous (yes, half of the theater smiled for actors and visual effects) and a filthy film that is not imaginative, interesting or united. At one point Cameron Diaz and his son were abducted, and then suddenly he returned home to the NSA's big black car with his wife. Where did he go? Why did they take it? Do we really care? No longer do you. <br /> <br /> After all, it doesn't matter what happens to any character. You're all gonna kill them so the movie ends. Go for something else that plays. Don't waste your time or money.
