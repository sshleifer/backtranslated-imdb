The plot was not good. <br /> <br /> There were no special effects. <br /> <br /> The actor wasn't very good at all. <br /> <br /> Like others, I felt that the plot had many holes that could fly well, a space shuttle. <br /> <br /> I thought the end was quite unbelievable. <br /> <br /> By the way, boys, room for torch. <br /> <br /> Impact burners have their own oxygen supply (hence the name "Oxy-Acetylene Torch"). Two hoses burn a burner: one on an acetylene bottle and one on a bottle of oxygen. <br /> <br /> So "blow burner" works well in space.
