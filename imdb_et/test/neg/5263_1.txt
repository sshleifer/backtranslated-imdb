Kate is a frustrated young woman who has trouble meeting and dating invitations. Throughout the movie, you can meet several of her loser friends. And throughout the film, you have Kate's cynical negative view of love and relationships. This negative perspective is continued throughout and presented as the ultimate truth. I had a real problem with this. Why would someone want to teach about love, life, and someone who's probably so confused? It would work if it were a joke, but it is not. For movie jokes (which are not funny or original) to work at all, you need to believe what Kate says: all relationships will inevitably go bad or not, that the highest level of relationship can develop if you can hit your partner ... You get the idea. <br /> <br /> Recent memories have no movie that is close to stomach irritation as much as Love and Sex. Why did filmmakers waste their time in their trash? Every joke in Love and Sex is something I've experienced in another movie or in my life. The story, production or style is nothing original or creative. It is cynical, stupid and pointless. Mind numbing!
