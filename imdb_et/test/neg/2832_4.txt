Like Brian Yuzna's big fan and most of the movies he's participated in, I thought I enjoyed the offspring. I didn't do it, although it has its own moments. However, if you expect something from a society or a reorganizer, you may be in shock. In a sense, it is similar to society, being a story of a seemingly ordinary world with a terrible supernatural source ... but that's where it ends. <br /> <br /> I do not cover Yuzna when I say this error is not really with him, because a bad direction is a bad direction, but the direction is sound. What trips up the film are both script and acting. Stuart Gordon (ReAnimator, Dagon) has written an intelligent script, but what really does not work with Yuzna's referral style, leaving him paused to actors who give long-term dialogue when he actually wants to throw this camera around and get his own down. This thing makes the movie uncomfortable, but it is worse. <br /> <br /> If the film had been made with big actors, the film would probably have heard it by itself. Unfortunately, this is very far from the case. The actors are wood, shocking with such a low budget B-function. The inexplicably successful and well-known Arnold Vosloo destroys every fucking line exactly, giving one of the worst performances ever seen. The man manages to change the line of any thoughtful dialogue the next time you were in the pub. "Hey Bob! Dear God, I am going! WHAT IS ... Come on! NOOO!" Actually, I can try it myself over the weekend Brad Dourif, rather than enrich the movie like it should be , Dourif seems to be the last ditch of the movie to stop Vosloo from grabbing, but frankly Dourif looks deeply uncomfortable (perhaps waiting for the next bad attack next to Voslo, and even the eccentric gear won't let the film revive. <br /> <br /> If the actor was better, this film would have been fine. Hell, it could have been quite enjoyable, but the lack of character makes the film breathless and makes the fear-free and tasteless, rather than the organic part of the film. The fact that the characters were so flawed made them unrecognizable and unattractive, leaving the mouth with an unpleasant taste. <br /> <br /> like Sci-fi and you have no problems with bad behavior, pedestrian pace and a truly tasty, nasty rape scene, the offspring is probably your way. But since I do, I never see it again. Once was enough. On the plus side, this is the only Sci-Fi movie Yuzna ever bothers to do, so she probably wasn't happy with it.
