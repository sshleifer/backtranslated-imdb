"Witchery" may just be the most inconsistent and regrettably scripted horror film in the 80s, but fortunately it has some compensatory features like fantastic gore effect, exhilarating musical result and some terrible election choices. Quite frankly, the scenario makes no sense, but who cares if Linda Blair (with an explosive hairstyle) represents another girl under the power of evil and David Hasselhof represents a hunky photographer (who doesn't seem to have created), a film with a constantly bloody voodoo, sewn closed lips, upright crucifixion, witch burns and excessive but really horrible tune. Eight casual people gather at an abandoned holiday resort on the Massachusetts coast. A young couple is a place to study the history of darkness; a dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair, although no one seems to know who her father is and what her location is) finds that reopening the hotel and Nami's female architect simply labeled random sex. Are they forced to stay at the ramshackle hotel for the night and then maybe the previous homeowner? an aging actor or something who always dresses in black? it will take them out in a variety of binding ways. Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence, which shows that the woman who is accused of witchcraft jumps out of the window. Anyway, the plot is definitely of little importance to the Italian horror franchise, which began as an unofficial "The Evil Dead". Sometimes the atmosphere is unpleasant and make-up effects are undoubtedly the best elements of the whole movie. There is something very sick and unstoppable when you look at a vulnerable woman hanging up the chimney and waiting for baking.
