probably the worst creature ever, boa vs python was a million times better than this & it wasn't big, bad functioning, bad effects and guess what the DVD is one of those with 3 hours of previews before the main menu. probably the least frightening film, no blood or violence, people are stupid and using guns, if they don't affect these animals, the only chilling part was radioactive leeches, which was pretty cool, the name of the island is just hanging off Jurassic park boring tiring and not worth even looking at, but I think the characters are stupid enough to be a good comedy movie, but certainly not a thriller
