This film is an embodiment of incarnation. But I've already seen this movie several times and plan to watch it again, because despite its imperfection it is a lot of fun. And it has one of my favorite movie actors, Casper van Dien, who is here to honor his full movie. Here is Casper van Dien completely Casper van Dien and you have to love her. If he hadn't had this movie, it would have been completely uncontrollable, or at least far dreckier if it was already. <br /> <br /> The use of cough (cough) here does not make any sense at all. No one else in the world noticed that a big little asteroid who is approaching the earth after that little group? Even with thousands and thousands of professional and amateur astronomers, isn't such a thing constantly searched from heaven? An asteroid that would be great would have become quite obvious to anyone who has even a spectacular eye sight. And the asteroid piece bounced into the atmosphere and no one even noticed it? Rock, which captures a great atmosphere, would have caused tremendous blows, which in turn would have caused enormous damage to the planet's surface. Surely no one would have noticed such a thing. Bwahahaha! The "science" used in this film is so ridiculous that it works somehow to entertain this movie as it is. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed is that, despite the uber-heat, all the characters were not dripping with sweat and their clothes were completely soaked. The most noticeable characters were that someone who was using a water bottle in the camera was sometimes lightly spun to give a "sweat light". Authenticity was * not * a goal that this movie was constantly and constantly trying to achieve. What a strange and fun way to give this film a fascination with entertainment. <br /> <br /> Is this movie really worth it? Definitely! Assuming, of course, that you have absolutely * no expectation of something that even far approaches reality. And that's your desire to gather and relax all the time.
