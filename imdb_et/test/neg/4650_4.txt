These are fans of Z-Class movies. Here you will find in writing and bad enough to compete with something that Ed Wood has ever produced. Veteran bad movie actress Cameron Mitchell is a former champion man "Paragon Studios" who, after a nasty acid-in-the-face incident social gathering, gets bitter Mad Scientist (tm) with a rubber arm on his face, who takes revenge on robbing Paragon actors and making they are live shapes in their secret lab (tm) located in a local wax museum. Or are they the zombies who make their offer? He's not sure. Fortunately, many of your favorite movie clips here. Look at the villain lab! Are these mysterious liquid vapors? Painted water test tubes for no apparent purpose? Yes! And what ho, do we see the spare arm and the legs that are placed randomly on the wooden shelf? You betcha! Admire the intriguing detectives who work together on Plan Nine! Now enjoy a carelessly taming car and listen to more dizziness than bimbo yelling if you could. Lift the eyebrow at the eyebrow end of the eyebrow, making a completely useless end that seems to be related to the rest of the film. Cheesy trash bin and a lot of fun for a bad movie expert.
