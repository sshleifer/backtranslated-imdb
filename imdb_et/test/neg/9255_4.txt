Well, well, finally, this undervalued flick view. But you can't find a good copy of it, a horrible copy with green drops, editing isn't synchronized, sometimes sound so terrible, and sometimes you even hear the camera. In general it is too dark, waist, which should be said, but it is not. It's a bit slow, the first half of the movie speaks and loves each other. It's still strange that girls in 60's movies never wear bras. When they enter the bedroom, it is perfect. Anyway, the UK has been banned since 84 years and still in the video nasties list. The reason is simple, it is non-existent. It's really an unpleasant break and it's horrible in some way thanks to being filmed by handycam. So every picture that the picture moves, things they stabilize these days. Ghastly Ones could have been better if the quality of the film was better, but better than the other timed movies, like the schoolgirls chain.
