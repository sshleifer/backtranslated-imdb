But even cartoons need a credible plot line. I think some of this audience enjoyed this lukewarm farce in 1934. It won't go away well. It provides Nat Pendelton and Zas Pitts with experienced and expert players for leading roles. Pendelton, who is at the forefront of the Thin Man series, strives for the best, but has been left without effort. The background is a stage playing gangsters, which is not an original material. The sustainable arm of the film is always great Edward Everett Horton, who has been killed. But don't waste your time watching Everett in this movie. I would encourage someone to look at him in his quest for a vacation with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. The same era of 1936, but a much better script and storyline. Better gags and needless to say, also star power.
