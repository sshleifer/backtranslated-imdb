This movie and the first AvP movie all over the aliens as well as the Predator franchise. <br /> <br /> They are terrible movies that have been badly behaved, badly written and terribly targeted. They just seem like someone desperately tries to earn money from the good name of the original aliens and predator films, but instead of offering well-thought out and high-quality production, they came out of failure. <br /> <br /> The original Alien / Aliens / Predator / Predator 2 films were big, they redefined the fear / thriller genre by inventing those crazy (and still unbelievable) creatures that took the role of "serum killer" instead of human. <br /> <br /> These films only milk the franchise and do nothing more than darken. <br /> <br /> Aliens vs Predator Comic Books were great and had a great story. They were true to the alien / Predator mythology, did not go all the original stories, etc. Why didn't they make the comic book a big movie? Because Hollywood is an idiot, why.
