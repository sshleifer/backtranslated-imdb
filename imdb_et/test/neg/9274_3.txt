The film has a good story, some are good, but not all. Some parts, I just felt that bad guys wouldn't have issued their experiences of martial arts yet. Some are activities that are long, as always mostly for the boss, but for the least important, some hits were killed or dosed, but some of them were quite unrealistic or could have done a better job. <br /> <br /> The least important actors or stunts were the right choices for the film, and my girlfriend started to amaze them that she started watching more than she was spending her time. <br /> <br /> The film is good, that's all I can say.
