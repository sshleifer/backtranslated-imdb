Such pain! Pain in such a shape that he had a promise in his central sense, but it never recognized it and continues his face with a lot of sand. I wouldn't say that the horror strike in South Africa / Canada / UK is terrible, but it's just too sharp, predictable, and very little memorable. This is the guarantee you forget, not too long after that. I tried to watch it last night, but I had to finish this morning because I couldn't keep my eyes open. Even then I couldn't remember where I stepped up, which left me again. The only thing that hit the chord was Andreas Poulson's sharp cinematography of big, harsh and terrible desert places. A nice glossy chic creates a striking visual mindset that does not save the film from this blank, empty feeling. Everything else is below the right and almost removes the grate. Similar to the beast's revelatory revelation. Ah. Computer-specific special effects of a dangerous monster are tolerated and some rubbing the flesh and the bones blink. But there is too little, because there is no hidden fact that the clich√© script wants to think about the general nature of the conflict in order to create tension and uncertainty. It would be good if the twisted script would be more than just a basic, low fluff, because it never created a strong and lasting relationship, but would do it interestingly. The tokens are superficial and symbolic support falls into the free basket. It's your stereotypical bunch. The performances by Scott Bairstow and Warrick Grier are colorless and beautiful Rachel Shelley is trying, but she seems quite tired.
