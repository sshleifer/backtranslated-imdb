I didn't know what to expect from "Future-Kill", but I hope it would be a little better than what I got. I knew the rating was bad and the reviews were unfavorable, but the Subversive DVD cover looks cool and I can't stand it. For a very long time (for too long, in fact), this film gave the impression that it was an informal sequel to Porky, who has a flat, vulgar and offensive brotherhood. Five mega-dorks, one of them reminiscent of Jim Carrey's exact young clone, desperately wants to become a frat house member, but their ultimate initiative may just be a bit far removed and dangerous. They fall into the city center with provocative signs painted on their face, simultaneously with the outbreak of violent power. It won't take too long before they face a Splatter, a seemingly half-man and half-machine soldier who drives a gang that I've never understood who or what they were. Were they government experiments? Kyborgs? Terminator imitations from a distant future? Does anyone care? Future-Kill is an odd amateur with a scenario that jumps from one path to another without any logical connection or narrative. The plot borrows vital elements from the great film culture classics like "The Warriors", "Escape from New York" and "The Terminator", but the end result is one gigantic Sci-Fi monstrosity. Costumes and special effects are quite merciful and have cheap and free nudity. Action is terrible, but I'm ready to blame outdated dialogues instead of cast members. One to avoid at all costs, despite the really cool DVD cover art. Resist it!
