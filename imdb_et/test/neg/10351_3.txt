It's not too bad, but ultimately there is no Australian series of quality. <br /> <br /> Jokes are little and far, actors are attractive (they shouldn't be), filmmakers think too much about cinematography (it should look like a home video) and it's like Kathi and Kim's serious version ... this is stupid. <br /> <br /> Too normal to be Kath and Kim. Kath and Kim should be two curvy, middle-aged women who think they are hot and wearing ridiculous clothes. Not "Look at me Kimmy!" jokes. Kim's fat friend is not at all fat and he's not even a little stupid. He's a stereotypical black / latino chick. <br /> <br /> It's not just as stupid or funny as the Australian series. It's not comparable. Nothing is the same. I admit that this show is funny from time to time, but it is not a Aussie series. I was expecting the American to take the bogan family. They failed. It should be really stupid and fun, but actors don't act stupid! For me, it's just a typical American TV show. This is to let if you want it to be something of an Aussie show. <br /> <br /> 2 Stars, because it's an OKAY show, just something that should be.
