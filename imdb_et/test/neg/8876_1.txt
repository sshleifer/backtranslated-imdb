This movie is another waste of time. The plot is a ridiculous, forced US drama. The characters were all very weak, especially the ill-interpreted interpretation of Goya and Bardem, who, in his classical interpretation, was only decent when he acted as a French ally. <br /> <br /> Just another way to lose money is to spend money. good movie. I think it wasn't a low budget movie. This is certainly not recommended. Perhaps the director should think a little bit about whether or not the film makes sense before wasting that money. Maybe they won't worry because they have a profit before they start the cinema. <br /> <br /> Cinema no longer has hope ...
