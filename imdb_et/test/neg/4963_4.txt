Think of this movie as a fan service, a fan of the genre damp to the dreams. Let's start with the original prologue that is pretty much related to the rest of the movie. Flash for the next nine months and the real flesh of the plot begins: the virgin Mandy Lane is coveted by every jock and nerd at school, and is invited to spend the weekend by the three boys on the ranch, who think they will be happy, and the two bimbos obsessed with their weight and bob size. So you have a bunch of young students in the house somewhere in the dark at night, who want to do something but have sex, do drugs and drink. The only other company is the hunky ranch-hand who may or may not suffer the Gulf War syndrome. Possible future suspect maybe? <br /> <br /> As you are now firmly convinced, all house-guests will be killed in various bloody ways and become a black man. Not the first to die. There are also some conventions that still hold on, like a little clinged baby traveling in the car field. Or lights that mysteriously emerge in the evening when our "heroes" are vaguely separating the problem. Even to the end of the so-called shocking twist, the film is like an old 80-year-old horror that was updated for noughties, and this score succeeds. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it also comes with many of the problems in this era of film, namely the thin signs of the paper and the predictability of the entire company. People can cut, hit, bludgeoned, etc., but due to their innate hatred of the audience and stupidity in these situations, it's hard to take care of when the bodies stack. Somebody is killed, one of their friends goes out to search for them alone, BANG they are brown bread. Rinse, then repeat. Maybe one day we will get a scenario with credible, intelligent and pleasant characters who make rational decisions, but still reach the genius. So far, we have to endure teenagers who have been hijacked with a pond living environment IQ. Well. 4/10
