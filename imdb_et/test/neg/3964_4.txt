The beloved story of the hero "Benji" ("Higgins"), who has many different things for many different people. On a busy day, "Benji" grabs breakfast in a house of two small children, talks with the law, guides the old lady's cat and reminds the day-to-day of the aging coffee owner. Organizer for some, entertainment for others, he is a companion for everyone. <br /> <br /> The problem arises when his young friends are kidnapped and led to an abandoned mansion he calls home. Here we know that only "Benji" can save the day. <br /> <br /> The plot is a routine for writer / producer / director Joe Camp, and he tends to move slowly. However, it is difficult for audiences to resist a loving little pooch and children of all ages will love her. Cast was never anything other than "Benji" background. <br /> <br /> Not what you would call inspired but fun family tickets. "Benji", the candidate for the Academy Award, "For Love". <br /> <br /> Saturday, July 13, 1996 - Video
