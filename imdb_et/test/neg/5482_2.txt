It's just 2 stars because they put a lot of work into seeing this game out. I played a lot of good and bad games and I think this game has a more boring story I've ever been forced to listen to. The best thing they could have done is let you skip conversations (but no, you need to talk to them in 10 minutes) and just keep doing the same thing over and over again. Climb to the building to save the citizen, go kill some guy. It's all the same! Ubisoft should really hire someone's imagination. <br /> <br /> I am a big Prince of Persia series fan (first 3). The story was good and you wanted to know what was going on all the time. I don't even hate the Persian prince 4. But I think someone who was responsible for developing Assassin's Creed story should be forbidden to write another thing for his life. <br /> <br /> Bored story and the same missions over and over again! If only one of these two things were good, the game would be worth it.
