Imagine looking at a slide show where the projector will stay on each slide long enough to memorize it three times. Now imagine that slideshow images consist entirely of everyday scenes? a small park; and an empty tennis court; piano. Imagine now that people in a slideshow have a frustratingly slow, semi-white conversation about events that are only occasionally associated with the slides they show you. Great? you have just imagined the whole movie "Indian Song." <br /> <br /> Film is an agonizing slow assembly of images that make little, except just shout. Look at me! I am PROFOUND !! with such blatant self-esteem that the pictures themselves and the film as a whole are not just abundant, but HARD. Visuals can easily be replaced by a series of static images as described above, because it is so rare that there are actually people on the screen, and even if they are, people move from furniture just a little more often. They do not speak or communicate in any way in essence? they stand there looking at each other and waking from time to time. The most energetic moment in the first hour of the movie is when three people walk into the car park. In fact, the visuals are easily omitted because the story is completely spoken through narration. The story is about a woman who hates India because it's hot and hates people who don't hate India because it's hot (this point is covered several times). It is also a man who feels he has the right to sleep with the aforementioned woman because he sleeps with anyone who asks him, but he can't sleep with him just because he never asks and he is very upset about it. So she looks at her as one tear runs down her cheek. Later, he looks at his bicycle because one tear runs thoroughly on his cheek. In fact, you don't see that one tear runs thoroughly on your cheek as he sees his bike, but you know it's anyway, just because it's such a movie. <br /> <br /> At best, narration becomes a background that is a perfect compliment to the coma-creating visuals. Just being conscious through this film would require ultimate decision. To look at it and, in fact, a serious and substantive idea of ​​what it was supposed to be, would create the same kind of migraine that tries to read technical documents in the dark. This film is probably the greatest monument of pseudo-artistic imagination ever known to man.
