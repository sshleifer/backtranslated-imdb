"Shuttle" is / was more than a boring film with an interesting start, but after half an hour it ended in the worst possible way I could ever imagine. This movie has lost its story if you can name that story? ... in half an hour. All of the following scenes are totally disproportionate. The driver is some kind of superman because he lives with every weapon in attack - etc. But what a coincidence that there was a box in this garage. I felt really sick and misleading at the end of the movie. It could have been as big as the story would be much better. In my opinion, even a child would have a better story. And why girl with water and food. I'm finishing halfway through counting the holes in the plot. And when the film came almost perfectly to the ultimate final twist of the sick, I was completely abandoned (better to say "throwing"). The worst thing about Shuttle is that it may not be even worse. writer / director Anderson learns from this lesson and gives us a decent thrill next time. Think about the better he moves to another genre. I keep my fingers baptized, but now I read a comment about my future movies first before watching, wasting time.
