I had to write about this movie based on those that say gory, non stop action, great movie .. <br /> <br /> These people probably saw another movie. Killpoint sucks honestly honestly! I was waiting and waiting for this film to become better and it was not effective. Some said that this movie was brutal and others said I couldn't find any of the adjectives that actually appear in that place, I mean hell there are so many scenes where people shoot, and that there's no blood at all, it's not even funny ! ! I think the best way to sum it up is that he should have assessed PG according to the standards of 1984 and now in 2010 it is undoubtedly PG !! Bad, BAD is not a fun cheese in "B" movie!
