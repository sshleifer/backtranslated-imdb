I had great expectations of this film (not that it was now an apocalypse or 8 1/2 but high enough) and when I saw that cable they were all broken. Starting with Actors (Poor, Almost Mediocre, Amazing Loss of Good Players and Talent) and the Story Himself: From the time a 5-man team goes to the patrol in the expected "hot" zone ?? This is one big mistake that costs the movie dearly. Very good actors here are very bad, like Sean Penn, who recently repeated an irritating way to talk about "I am Sam," and Michael J. Fox, who is wasting a good chance of winning Charlie Sheen's "Platoon", just acting "average". But the most irritating character was Diaz (played by John Leguizamo, another stupid fine talent waste), it was an exciting, frightened and insecure person, even more irritating to Jar Jar Binks (yes, you heard it). Sequencing sequences are average, the only one that really looks out is the opening sequence where Michael J. Fox created his legs in the VC tunnel. de Palma's work here is weak and if it is not used for films like "Scarface" and "The Untouchables", then I could read it as "bluff" director: too much advertising, bad filming. <br /> <br /> 3/10
