Being a big fan of horror movies and always finding something good, but it didn't interest or care. This story revolves around the father and daughter and girlfriend because his wife died a few years ago. These people are experiencing a terrible situation in a city where they stop and visit, and all the elderly citizens of this city are reaching out to these people and are almost killing. This film reminded me of "Children of Corn" because it really involves children who are to be presented to Satan and are his acts of terror. There are many songs, mambo jumble and a toy tank that completely destroys the entire family member on their wagon and the dolls that kill the man and the wife.
