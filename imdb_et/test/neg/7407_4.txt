* This comment may technically contain "spoilers", but it does not contain surprises * <br /> <br /> My relative and I rented it the other day, hoping to laugh at a typical amateur gate apology for horror Movie. Unfortunately, we couldn't laugh too much, and we certainly didn't get too much fear. <br /> <br /> Plot Overview: An airplane that includes the head of a company and some strange technology runs together in the area where our furry friend lives, so the head of the company brings the team of personalities rather than qualified hunters to restore it. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 movie stuff gets pretty boring. In most cases, it consists of frames of large legs that hide trees where members of the party sometimes hear it and do not let it go. We also see a lot of party pictures from the point of view of Big Foot and apparently sees a thermal vision. <br /> <br /> To set up a plot, we need to look at group sessions that sit around the campfire on opportunities to justify the existence and activities of sasquatches. "maybe he can take a look ... when he sees them coming". Of course, we'll see later that he can. "There are many undiscovered lands that sasquatch can live in. Maybe it's one of those that was reviewed." And of course it is. "Maybe Sasquatch is angry because the plane hit one of his family members." And that is certainly the case. With these scenes, a couple of "Oh my God, this is sasquatch oo, wait for it!" Scenes and unfortunately they are more frightening. <br /> <br /> Then people will finally die. Well, at least 2 people. In addition, the bodies of previous victims are discovered. Death scenes are pretty flat. In most cases, it simply leaves it to our imagination, showing Sasquatch grabbing them, then cutting to another scene, but first treating the camera with some terrible screams. <br /> <br /> Then we finally get to see the protagonist's final display of a monster. I have to admit that I found it quite exciting when it lasted. But, unfortunately, it is quite short, and after we are treated to the end, it makes a half-effort to seem secret. Then, some closing documents with a rather boring conclusion. <br /> <br /> I can't say I recommend this movie. It's not quite bad enough to give the Mystery Science Theater 3000 and it's certainly not scary and boring to enjoy as a horror film. Just don't worry.
