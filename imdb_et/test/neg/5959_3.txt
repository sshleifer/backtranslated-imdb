OK, so I've recently collected a lot of vipco and hardgore titles on a DVD and I have to say it's one of the most disappointing. The last movie compared to other Hardgore catalog titles was directly on DVD. I've always been interested in the el chokeberry myth because I saw this documentary as a teenager. But this movie is a terrible let's kick off the sticky dv story and acting is terrible, it took me three going to watch this movie all the time. Although cheap 80's and 90's horror movies are good for their cheap budgets and comedy, this movie is not so. <br /> <br /> First, look at some other hard drive series titles, such as boneyard being older, but much better.
