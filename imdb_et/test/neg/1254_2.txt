Having just finished reading a book for one week, I thought, "That would be a great movie, especially now that people know a little about poker and poker players". I was totally shocked to find it when browsing the video store at night. I had no idea that someone actually made it into a movie. I grabbed it immediately and watched many expectations. What a big drop! <br /> <br /> All the intriguing things that Stu was about in Hungary were relaxed quickly, and instead of being biologically, I could have been someone. Ungar can be a burned jerk, but he was also a great thinker who could read people instinctively. It made her so exciting. Why not focus on it? <br /> <br /> And talk about solving true truth. This man was all about drugs, women, gambling, hunger, sleep disorder. He played at sports events in the mornings until the morning, he disappeared in a couple of times when he hung up in the cracks, his body remained permanently, and still, when he ever needed money, he could always play playing cards. Now that's the story! <br /> <br /> Too much time spent in her childhood and personal relationships (although her relationship with "Vincent" and her daughter was barely touched) and hardly anything about her drug use (which was superfluous)), her crazy playing and her incredible card games. <br /> <br /> Probably too late, but I hope someone makes the movie right. I had no problem with Imperiol. He's great. The script left something interesting to him to say.
