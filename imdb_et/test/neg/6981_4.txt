This movie wastes 2 hours of my time and just made me shout: "LAME". Nicholas Stoller writes "Yes Man", but maybe he should "stay" in writing. <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed because I heard this great review. I was waiting for something that knocked. They say it's "knocked" by the maker? why can't i see similarity? but it seemed like a low, superfluous topic to me. I'm so disappointed. In fact, it's not bad if you think it's your average-chick-movie, but this "band boy" is just my nerves. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just didn't pay enough attention to this movie, but yes, they have funny lines and a scene, but I didn't feel originality. And the end makes the movie a little better. At least the end is not one boring clich√© one.
