So much for the court and the JURY that lives up to their nonsense title. What's good? Lighting is terribly foggy! Another horror movie you ask? Well, it is perfectly explained. David Keith is actually hiding clowns, cooks, and other shenanigans while being a killer who escaped from death. But in general, despite some new turns, it's pretty stupid. Unapix has recently released some ridiculous productions and that means just so much. We, the jury, find this film due to its indecent exposure of many who sit, believing it to be a complete waste of our time!
