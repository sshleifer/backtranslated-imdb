"Fraud" is what you see when you look at this flick and you believe you saw something valuable. This flick, which speaks of a semi-psycho passenger trio who is not somewhere in the desert of CA, is amateurish and just stupid. The film suffers from a terrible story, a weak scenario, and some terrible directions to mention some shortcomings. If there is anything at all on the flick, this is an even play of the B-film diva Rubin. Don't waste your time with this turkey. (D)
