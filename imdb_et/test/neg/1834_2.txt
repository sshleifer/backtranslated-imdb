There is an endless horror movie offer. It seems that people are never tired of trying to scare and feel excited. Alas, very rarely have these tests succeeded. This unfortunate film has no redemption value. The story is very predictable, most participants are very insecure or just plainly failed, with very low quality special effects. It took a lot of effort to turn off the DVDs and go to sleep. With a limited number of foreign films released in the US, why in the world would anyone like to import this song. First of all, there is probably "Anatomy 2" for those who have nothing better to do. I'd rather look at the paint dry.
