I stopped watching this movie. It was just terrible! Bored, minted sub-blocks. Absence of Norman Bates, Buffalo Bill or Steve Railsback's Ed Gein image. The movie does not have to be historically accurate, but Ed Ge's true story is so much more interesting than this tertiary melodrama, which was completely justified! Ed Gein, depicted by Kane Hodder, is a sadistic filmmaker. Attempts to show her mother's trauma are only weak recycled styles. And this movie wanted to be stylish but even twisted. Fortunately, this movie is a better film. 2001 Ed Gein spoke the story effectively and offered some real chills when we looked at a sick man who doesn't control himself. Steve Railsback, who played Ed Gein at that time, was already famous when he captured another famous serum killer: Charles Manson. His Ed was in sin. His film is what to see. Avoid this confusion.
