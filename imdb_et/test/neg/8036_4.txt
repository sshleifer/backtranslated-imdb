This Fred's delayed effort plays a modern day (70's), a Gothic thriller but out of excitement. Certainly this is not a terrible bad movie, this story got the feeling that many of Fred's later films have got from someone who has given up on the first day. It starts with a good enough, almost giallo like tone, then becomes gothic territories decent (though terribly clich√©). Then suddenly it seems that Freda has lost interest in the film and all we have is a long-lasting shot of Camille Keaton and burning candles. Then for about an hour, we get a violent climax with decent poor special effects. This is followed by a slow pace outro, which has a very obvious twist (if it is even twisted?). And throw in some very semi-explanatory scenes along the way and you have a tragic ceremony. So in some parts it has its own characteristics. But then suddenly stumbles and collapses in front of you. Damage. <br /> <br /> btw away from SHAROMA DVD, meaningless in the dark pan & scan edition that kills a good visual experience.
