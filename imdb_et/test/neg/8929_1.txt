It's been 3 months and you know what that means ... New Seagal movie. Indeed, Seagal has been a terrible film after a terrible movie. Every time every movie gets worse and worse, it's really amazing! I don't really know what to say about TYD, first it is crap, the story doesn't make any sense, secondly, it uses stuntmen in all its struggles and finally, but no less, there is a lot of material from other movies! It amazes how this man continues to find work, arrives late and leaves early and because his films are full of holes in the plot and stuntmen. Why do we continue to buy our films, why do we continue to hope that maybe maybe he will make an excellent movie?
