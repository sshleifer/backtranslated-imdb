As a person who knows the filmed ship and some other ships, I don't see the film as just a film. Because the film has some great, wonderful shots of the ship, most of them are made on an existing ship - of course, after a catastrophe scene and under a deck of space. But the story and dialogues can only call it big jamaica. Nothing like this would happen on a real sailboat. No wonder the film had a bad effect on an existing ship - if I didn't know better, I was not tempted to make a firm sail. I would definitely recommend that Europeans be turned off when the ship was flying. After that, the excess emotional part that I could not bear begins. The pictures are really very big, no wonder on Ridley Scot's movie, but if you can't listen to the text, it gets a lot better.
