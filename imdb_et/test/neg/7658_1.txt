In fact, there was nothing funny about this monster! This film was a complete abomination. The absurdities of this movie made me almost vomit! I think the people responsible for this movie used their audience. They took a fairly decent series of films (I said good, NOT !!) and I totally threw it out, trying to put money in my pockets. Making an airplane! was a way for Hollywood to make up for this dirty slip. The worst part is that no one in 1979 understood the movie's asinine events (as the door of Concorde opened at some divine altitude or taking a Patron from Mach 2 to avoid NUCLEAR WARHEAD!)! were they thinking?) were totally unrealistic or they just didn't care! I think it's the last of these two. The writers and the director of this "movie", if you want to name it, tried to dry up the airport dynasty for this mess!
