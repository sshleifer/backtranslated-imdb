I am a collector of Weaver starring films, so I bought it just because he was in it. In my opinion, it is really strange that his early career is full of so many terrible films. He started with an incredible promise in Alien, but then had bombs. These bombs include this movie, a century offer, one woman or two, and Half Moon Street. He also appeared dangerously in a year of life, which was not a bomb, but his performance was less than remarkable. During Alien and it's 1986 successor, Aliens, the only movie that he did something worth was Ghostbusters. Before releasing aliens, I'm sure everyone thought this woman was his way out. Luckily he wasn't. <br /> <br /> Back to Eyewitness, although the movie is boring. It does not cause any tension. William Hurt seems to be cardboard and the atmosphere has just dried up. Sigourney is decent, but nothing deserves to be remembered. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie when it's needed, but don't go with the right movie expectations. Watch better movies with these two stars like Accidental Tourist and Working Girl.
