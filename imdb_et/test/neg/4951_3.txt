After watching the short movie "Still Life" staged by Jon Knautz, I was really excited about the debut of his feature film "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer". "Still Life" had perfectly captured the nature and feel of the Twilight Zone episode, and I was eager to see what Knautz could do to take a horror comedy. The combic nature of the name and promotional materials offered something like "Evil Dead" or "Darkness Army of"; 80s fun fun with a lot of monsters. Although it was under Knautz's hand, he was in no way successful in the fun or entertaining values ​​that these films had made. what made those horror comedies that it was trying to provoke so great. Two-thirds of the running time is devoted mainly to the film's hero, Jack Brooks, plumber and college student, as he goes to class and tries to deal with his uncontrolled wrath. For the majority of the film, the prominent monster, hardly even a blood shot or even the slightest event, is related to horror. Even if "Evil Dead" or "Dead Alive" had issued later amounts, they would still be fun. "Jack Brooks" is not. This is the usual boring, which is the worst thing you get when you get such a movie. Jack Brooks himself is not that interesting, at least not enough to justify the screen time he has given. All you need to know about it will appear in the movies for the first time in ten minutes and from the time he does not beat the monster (and he rarely does), he is not worth watching. The film is not going anywhere, following it in psychiatric sessions and interfering with classmates. <br /> <br /> After all, the thing goes up. Jack Brooks fights some monsters, some heads are crushed, some people are killed and then it's over. Just like that. Everything is about 15 minutes. It's good for fifteen minutes. Monsters are all quite resourceful (and made entirely in the camera) and there are some great gore gags (the best being zombies head crushed), but after sitting through seventy-five minutes of pure tedium, fifteen minutes just isn't going to really have it all. I could talk about behavior that is quite well done (especially the horror Robert Englund in a non-traditional role) and how creature prostheses are a nice setback for the days when films did not use CGI, but this is not really a question. "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer" is absolutely boring and although Jon Knautz has a clear talent to create a good movie (again, the last fifteen minutes of killer and "Still Life" was amazing? Check it out), "Jack Brooks" leaves the brand completely behind . It has its own success (functioning, makeup), but it does not change the fact that it is not fun at all. The review I got from it was a director and a presence. One of the information I raised was that the queue was in development and that this time it would focus more on fighting monsters than creating a "hero". My advice: skip it and wait for the sequel.
