This is one of the movies you watch because it's bad. The kind of movie you look at to see that it is bright craftsmanship. Allegedly as a horror, I can't imagine how someone might be afraid that no one can get Claymation's fault, especially what is intrinsically translucent, where you can see the actor behind his feet. <br /> <br /> Even without a budget, a bit of attention to detail, and even the fact that this film would be credible, would have breastfed it fun because they should have replaced all the actors and the whole story. If I had nothing to play, I would have stopped it after 10 minutes and put some quality indicators like Spunge Bob Square Pants (HAR HAR). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend that Brett Piper gets Quintin Terrantino and really pumps out some stools. <br /> <br /> :)
