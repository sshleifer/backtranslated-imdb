There really is only one reason to watch this barely enough and completely predictable filmmaker, Kate Armstrong (Catherine Zeta Jones), whose life changes when she suppresses her orphan sister Zoe (Abigail Breslin) after killing her sister in a car wreck. And that's why Aaron Eckhart (Nick) looks at his floppy-haired and pleasant lady attitude to look good enough to break between the two organic Pannini slices and eat the olive oil and balsamic vinegar dip and a couple of finely cut sun-dried tomatoes. He reminds me of Sean Bean. The idea that he could take his shirt off was the only thing that woke me up to the end. He removed his farmer several times, but never went to disappointment. <br /> <br /> I can't be too critical because I watched it for watching at home, so it wasn't costing me at least two movie tickets, and I was extremely grateful for the small mercies. But really, it's Rom Com's most formal. Zeta Jones gives a very flat, monotonous performance, she seemed passionately completely inadequate (probably due to the amount of time she spent in the restaurant in the cold store? Thirty leads out there could not be fun) and her face barely changed the whole movie expression. Abigail Breslin was a pretty good niece, she's such a tempting little girl that it's impossible to criticize her, and still loved her in Little Miss Sunshine. Patricia Clarkson is always of good value and I can't really blame her for acting as a restaurant owner because she seemed very persistent, considering what a good actor she is and how little she was doing here. But the whole thing is just a clich√©, much of the dialogue is banal and the result is so obvious. It is a color cinema equivalent with numbers, and Zeta Jones and Eckhart produce little heat on the screen. <br /> <br /> Nick likes Italian food (no doubt showing her burning inner passion) and baking Puccini's sound. His appearance in Kate's kitchen at 22 pm Bleecker (restaurant name) is likely to predict his feathers, but his unpleasant ability to tie his brother's daughter to lace production and build a Bedouin tent in the living room brings Kate around and despite some stumbling so he gets him a glorious possession. No, not his honor. But his recipe for saffron sauce. <br /> <br /> I am very unfair here, isn't it? I mean, Rom Com is Rom Com and we all know what we promise when we register. But should it always be so desperate?
