After a pleasantly original original and a funny fool of you, it is an incredibly boring, slow and consistent sequel to another drop. Once again, Bat (hammy Luis Aceves Castaneda) tried to misuse valuable jewelry from the Aztec mummy Popoca. The skin builds a terrifying foolish human-made robot to achieve this horrible goal. Directly, Rafael Portillo led with a telling and annoying script by Alfredo Salazar and Guillermo Calderon, who is a dirty continuity (for example, Bat was clearly killed at the end of the previous film, but is wonderful and well here!), Scary Slow Script, Excess Number of Two First Clips curvy narrative, exhausting lack of action and momentum that is largely miserable, passing through movements (not), which understandably act as a selfless and unpopular cast and badly staged mummy and robot (the film eventually breaks down into a foolish life, saying with great bash, but unfortunately it doesn't last long even two bad minutes and so it turns out too late to relieve the general boredom), it is a nervously dry, sliding and comforting snorefest rate as a complete outflow.
