I will quit the obvious revision of factual inaccuracies. They're too much to name. A much shorter list would be correct. 1. Dude named Noah. 2. Knit on the animals. <br /> <br /> If you want the Noah's Ark to be much more accurate and the destruction of Sodom, rent a "Bible" (1966). It represents the story of creation through Abraham, trying to sacrifice his son Isaac. This is a much better film, and it may happen that the evil, called Noa Arkiks (1999), brought you to look for such a movie. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060164/ <br /> <br /> I couldn't watch the whole movie. When I read other comments, I see that even atheists found it to be extremely inaccurate. It was unbearable for me as a Christian. Perhaps the worst film ever made. There is no real point to this movie except perhaps to show your sub-par computer animation. <br /> <br /> Was it a complete waste? Maybe not. God can use evil for good work. Romans 8:28 says: [28] And we know that all things that love God work together for those who are called for his purpose. <br /> <br Genesis 50 says: 20 But ye, in your opinion, have thought to me against evil; but God meant it for good, to restore, as it is today, to live many people. <br /> <br /> In another example, Joseph's brothers wanted to kill him, but God made his evil very good. He could do the same for this movie. <br /> <br /> People were so amazed at the lack of a Bible base that they probably burst into the dusty old Bible and read the story itself. To find out about Lot and Sodom, they should go all the way to Genesis 19 before God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah. By that time they read almost half of Genesis so they could stop. The next book is Exodus, whose film "Ten Commandments" was based (and much more accurately). Once they have seen this movie, Exodus becomes easy to read. So now they have read at least two books of the Bible, just because they looked at the pathetic film about Noah's Bay. I'm sure it happened to someone out there. <br /> <br /> God works mysteriously.
