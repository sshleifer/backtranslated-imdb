"The time of stealing" dates back to 2001, when it was mysteriously titled "Rennie's Landing". This explains how Director Marc Fusco was able to afford the television / movie actress now created, which is obviously an extremely low budget. About ten minutes of the movie, you understand why this thing hasn't got a theatrical performance after it made a film festival round several years ago. <br /> <br /> This recent distribution with Franchise Pictures apparently reflects the perception that the growing popularity of certain cast members can be milked to restore some modest production costs. Although young actors are not a great addition to restarting, they have done worse things when they desperately seek out all kinds of action. <br /> <br /> Peter Facinelli, Ethan Embry, Scott Foley, and Charlotte Ayanna are playing college friends who make an early "Big Chill" reunion and compare war stories about failure of reality to the measurement of their dreams. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, nothing else happens. Yes, Alec (Facinelli) dreams of a wine shop and bank robbery, which is then "cheap and lamely" staged for totally inappropriate music. This is the least suspensive work of banks from W.C. The fields were "The Bank Dick" guard. <br /> <br /> If someone can refer to the "Stealing Time" for a moment, if something "actually" happens, I would like to know about it, as far as I can say, nothing in the film will happen. . Perhaps Fusco is trying to say something deeper through control over his life before it is too late. Like "St. Elmo's Fire", the film is full of every deep idea ever expressed by young adults who have left the ivory tower to experience the first real world for the first time. <br /> <br /> I felt Fusco going to some Howard Hawks Young Professionals' "Angels are Wings Only". Again, I'm sure I read too much movie. After all, things actually happen to Howard Hawks movies. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
