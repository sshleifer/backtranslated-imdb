I don't recommend it at all. It was like being stuck in the middle row of the theater, so I couldn't leave and watch the porn film (except they didn't take off the clothes - it was body language and definitely the language). I have to say I was embarrassed. Filming was a very low budget, there was no good dialogue. Yuck. The actors looked out, except for the two best characters who killed (?) And they were David Carradine and Dennis Hopper. It hit Kill Bill and this old movie with two men who dive on their chopper. You know what I mean. blablabla. Filming was grainy and of very low quality. This theater had no one who liked this movie, and people around me were younger and tattooed.
