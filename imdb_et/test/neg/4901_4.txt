Inspired by the true story, the 1970s are full of feelings, but they're getting rid of it. This is a black college swimmer story who gets to Philli in the center of the bad neighborhood and somehow puts the swimming team together. The film halves blindly for the first half hour until Terrence Howard, like our hero, gets the kids to the pool. It rises at this point, becoming somewhat interesting, although it still strikes. In this and its explicit story, why Howard and Bernie Mac took part in it, but the script is bad and most of the direction seems deliberate to make it feel like 197something instead of feeling the story. /> <br /> Not a catastrophe some reviews made, but it suffers from all recent sporting events - Coach Carter, Invincible, Glory Road, etc. - which at least knew you should at least work with a story to make a movie, not just let audiences suffer because it is true.
