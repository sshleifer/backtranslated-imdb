This movie is enjoyable if you like the line of poverty, public movies in the first half of the 20th century, or fan of making amateur films. The movie combines public domain thrillers with newly shot scenes where "actors" (the only exception when Redfield makes the Lugos hang almost dead, all "performers" are just awful!) Are trying to communicate with stock footage. "New" video footage is covered with digitally added film degrees, as well as some of the already inadequate old film material (?? !!). As close as I can see, the plot has something to do with strangers who have come together to read the island? In a terribly long order and injured sailor ship, a dashed trip is described as "Fog Island", no matter what it is! "Return" consistently links old materials to a completely different era and completely different film quality. Independent Scenes "The Lost World" (1925), the Most Dangerous Games (1932), White Zombie (1932), Bela Lugos Meet Brooklyn Gorilla (1952) and Some Other Poverty Productions. This is done with an incredibly bad voice, which seems to be too much room for sound to be recorded on a cheap home video camera. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers think they pay tribute to today's great actors, signaling the names of famous actors (Carradine, Zucco, Ouspenskaya, etc.). This tactic was made cleverly, and deliberately "Final Destination", it's just nasty! Charming and painfully funny jokes about Spiderman, Dracula and Superman. Old dirt "Dewey, Cheetam and Howe" was also used here - it was old and tired when The Three Stooges used it in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> The movie's stock and sound are not suited to the scene, and dozens of different sources are used for Lugos. The finest effect is that he seems to be older, younger, older, thinner, harder, younger and older again in a minute. Strangely enough, the film did not use this comedy as a sub-site and destroys a good opportunity for comedy. <br /> <br /> True, it was fun to watch in bed at night. Maybe what they wanted to happen!
