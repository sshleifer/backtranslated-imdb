The film opens with the beautiful scenery of the Northwestern countryside. Fenceposts that pull out of the gleaming ground, the trains of the freight train at the hay, clouds of clouds, small structures along the road, motel or meals somewhere in the middle. Above all, it's a silly but mysterious Twin Peace Piano Agreement and it's all dark and atmospheric in the American Gothic way. Through this, director Jon Jost continues to interact in uncomfortable frames, message blocks, opening up tedious sound signals on the credit, color frames that announce "BLUE", numbers that are counted in the "12-step conclusion" of the opening credit. In the first few minutes, it is obvious that although Jost is more than able to capture the landscape and atmosphere, he does not care about it. He has no affection for the openings of the Pacific Northwest, which Terrence Malick does in Badlands or Twin Peace David Lynch's time and tendency to weave mystery and intrigues around this location. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is more of Jon Josti's disappointment with experimental tricks that serve his purpose. The use of a split screen is interesting, I especially like the way we get two parts of Ricky Lee's first picture, one of which talks about childhood memories that are only important to him, the other wears and kicks his head against the wall, and the second is over the film. Ricky Lee, a macho-devastating hipster with tones that are hopelessly involved and stupid. On the other hand, staging motion animation and selection do not work for most of the voice command of the movie. It works from time to time because Jost writes as well as he does static shots of a small town in America Nowheresville, but Beth Ann's monologues for the most even nose monotone is the voice that sounds like a Stephen Hawking computer voice program baptized with a horse's glowing. so ear grabbing it to pay attention to catching attention. <br /> <br /> Each pair connects us with our past experiences, their little triumphs and follies, and their suspicions and past relationships. They say very little to each other and say they say with an empty face. But they tend to like rabbits. It seems to be their only channel of communication that remained open, perhaps the only one they can trust in safety. Of course, his main characters in Frameup are clearly chosen as na√Øve and rogue, those who were accused by the American dream became sour, but he did not place himself above them. He is not deliberate or insidious in his imagination. They may be mistaken, but they are loved by the moments of mankind, whether they are uncomfortable. We are called to feel and show affection, not a point and a laugh. This is the most successful Frameup becomes; the film's characters come alive even when their unexpressed faces do not exist, even when Jost is on the road with its harsh framing and resistance camera games. <br /> <br /> Then we go back to the angry beaches for the destructive effect of money playing over a dollar bill, we get a weird psychedelic sequence where Josti's camera slips under the large deciduous trees, which in turn transforms the beetroot red as Beth Ann repeatedly remembers. " Red Tree Trees, we can even suddenly turn around to the plot and genre, like a couple of Beth Ann and Ricky Lee, little town losers somewhere to go and nothing that keeps them back in their deadlock, arrives in California and decide to attack 7/11. The film does not rise to emotional crescendo after the 7/11 work that can be expected on the "couple-on-the-run" path, it slowly stops and you look out the window to see that it is not in some place. The parts of the race have been hypnotic and some almost touching and funny, but everything else has been tedious.
