I've tried to look at it twice, although I haven't been able to do either episode. For me, it's basically just funny. I can tell where I think to laugh, but I can't. I've never seen the original so I don't compare. I also love comedies, including off-the-wall comedies, like married ... with children and family, but this exhibition just doesn't do it for me. Jokes are flat and flat and the actor is usually annoying. Ads made it interesting, but it's not. They're trying too hard to be different, and tie in with humor. This style usually doesn't work too well. I don't think this show will end with the season. Of course, I could be wrong.
