Bridget Fonda is a beautiful Hart Bochner sexually satisfied woman. One afternoon he arrives home, calls him "honey" and quietly fixes his drink to find that he looks. Minutes go when he is compatible with his frowning silence. Suddenly he broke his rage, accusing him of infidelity without any reason, calling him C, hitting his head against the closet, hitting him and winding off the second floor. balcony, breaking his arm and a pair of ribs. <br /> <br /> She wakes up in the hospital, where it turns out she is deaf, although we find she reads her lips perfectly. This avoids any inconvenience or language-learning words associated with the ASL interpreter. <br /> <br /> Better. Let me just give you the basic plot elements. This beautiful and dedicated woman with disabilities beats her husband, her parent's mother, misunderstood what her sister is betraying, whether her bank account is emptied with unknown hands that are almost raped by a fat man who puts her bar in, believed to have murdered her now lost husband, followed by two police officers (Kiefer Sutherland and Steven Weber), one of whom is only interested in justice, while another seems to dislike all women and their presence is embarrassing. At the end, it is found that he stands alone in an abandoned bus stop where his hand is full of money, tearful but daring. <br /> <br /> Now, in the popcorn. There is only one multiple choice question. "This story was written by (a) a man or (b) a woman." Don't listen to sexist. It could be so easy to imagine a scenario of a decorated military hero and a trained soldier whose enemies have been caught by his organization, beaten and tortured, escaping exact revenge, and breezing with the woman he loves, whom he thought he had disappeared for a long time. <br /> <br /> The direction is functional and normal. When Fonda has regained consciousness in the bed in the hospital, from his point of view we see the faces of the surgeons and nurses he is looking at - that is, on the camera - the echo of every scene, which is in numerous second level films that the gurney is quickly down the corridor and people wearing white coats and decorating with starch. stethoscopes move around the camera. <br /> <br /> Hart Bochner has played an interesting way with a number of evil people - some characters are dumb ("Die Hard") and some are more common ("And the sea say"). His viral hands are a kind of bad tone for him. It would be too easy to make her a hero. A nice, deliberately blessed result by Steven Weber as a stupid cop - perhaps the best of the film. <br /> <br /> Bridget Fonda is also interesting. Its range is limited, but here it is in full screen. His almost interesting object is his almost stereotypical beauty. She's like a high school prom queen. Very feminine. Of course, he can't help if he slips or moves his hand so hard. Nor can he do anything about his nose. Most of its length is perfectly normal and attractive, but at the end there is an offset that follows the natural burn of the nostrils. The tip of this nose is full of intrigue. <br /> <br /> As for the movie - Pfui.
