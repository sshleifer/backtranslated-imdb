WARNING! This inspection may include a spoiler. The back of the box is misleading. He says it's all a mess for the kids who talk about the ghost stories they do, but that means they're all killing the forest. It doesn't happen. The stories they say are a little interesting, especially what is dog and everything that stops, but most of them are quite boring, forest monsters, some mute girls and the main, the whole movie.
