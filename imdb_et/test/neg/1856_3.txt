Following Dylan Moran's sign of the charming black books that owned the church shops, I saw that his comic begging can be used on theatrical or larger cinematographic paths. The first big screen that plays starring (he was in the ball, as Rufus was Notting Hill's thief) was promising, but as tightened on Steve Coogan's vehicle, The Password Officer, there are too many wrinkles that should have been suppressed by Production. <br /> <br /> The plot is so complicated that I don't worry about repeating finer details (everyone in the script has to do it for us) and laughs come from jokes. Michael Caine is a pompo who has worked with Richard III's production that has been renewed for the Nazi occupation (one of the few real laughs, the satirical jab of Iir McKellen), where everyone makes forever Hitler's welcome each time they enter the stage. Dylan's conviction that acting should be a conceptual act for himself, two plots of money to steal some of the rather harmless gangsters through their ability to act. Confusion arises (both on the screen and in the audience), between Dylan and one of the gangsters' daughter blah blah blaan, is a romantic sub-block and Dylan can dress in odd clothes and make funny accents. Michael Caine offers some options and Dylan's comic timing is on the money, so why is nothing good? It has a certain charm that you would expect from film 4, but it also has an uneven little girl who acts as a compass in a confused and irrelevant plot - no-no writing on the screen 101. The exposition overshadows everything else. You just want to see Moran and Caine act as one of the comic strips as they were in the beginning, but when they're together, pairing has lost their charisma. <br /> <br /> The Cast is an amusing, albeit painstaking effort. Should it come to order during the rain on Tuesday afternoon, then you have. Otherwise, it would be better to watch old Black Books videos or rent Withnail & I.
