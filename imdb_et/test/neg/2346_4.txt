If you get past the slow start and the bad thing, it's worth it. The story was pretty decent. The father was malicious because he was unemployed and hardly saw his child except in the summer because his ex-wife was under his custody. The father was very angry and cheated most of the time. The story of the monster was not too scary. The film's interruption is so incredibly strong in monster continuity. One of the scenes that filmmakers do is once the boy is in the basement and the monster goes to attack him. When a monster goes under the attack of a child, a steel trap attached to the chain of his arm is grabbed. The monster is away from the child's face. Every second during the movie, the monster is strong enough to break through or break through. At the same time, the steel trap and chain keep the child! More than likely, the members did it with a shock factor because no one wants to see one of the main characters die. Mobile users just wanted us to think that this could be the chance that a child can die. Instead of breaking the continuity, the spectators would have had to replace the child with someone they could destroy!
