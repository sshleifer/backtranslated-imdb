What is a shocker. For beginners, I couldn't keep shouting and noisy panic all the time. It didn't make me scared, frightened or sympathetic; it was just annoying. Strong camera movements were also annoying. The plot was as much as every other cheap horror. There were some pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work for the rest of the plot. And then it's the end. I'm still not sure what to do about it. I think it was supposed to be a clever twist, then enlighten the situation, but it was just stupid. <br /> <br /> There were a few of these few winner / candidate symbols in the case, so I thought it couldn't be too bad. I was wrong. If you see it, you should just leave it on the shelf.
