I like Bam Margera, so I was curious. <br /> <br /> But looking at home production with friends and family with a decent camera and a good man just isn't good for making movies. <br /> <br /> Writing, directing, acting, and editing are at best poor. But I sat down to that side. And why? <br /> <br /> This movie provides perfect examples of what not to do, a film student's dream of avoiding every step of the process. Push it into film school places across the Union! <br /> <br /> So if Bam! Now I know Jackass is real because you don't want to win an Oscar, dude :)
