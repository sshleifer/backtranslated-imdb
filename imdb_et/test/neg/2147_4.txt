I do not know which one was published earlier in 1970. Cordoba Cannon is "Western Europe" It was made in Spain. This means that it is quite worse than Sergio Leone. Baltic Spaghetti and John Ford's True American Masterpieces, Sam Peckinpah, Howard Hugues, John Sturges and Anthony Mann. This order is not to be interpreted as all John Ford Westerns are the best of Sam Peckipahn. I think IMDb's 100 Sort them all pretty well. <br /> <br /> What's worse is Casting. George Peppard is suitable for the role of Sergeant, Raff Valone "Maffia Capo" and Giovanna Rally "Puttana" in "Piazza Vennezia" in the sixties in Rome.
