I rented the matrix revisited with my friend. We both loved the Matrix and we both love filmmaking so we wanted to see what's going on behind the Matrix scenes. It turns out that Matrix Revisited will hardly tell you about the art of filmmaking or even how Matrix is ​​made. Basically, The Matrix has a big movie that has already been seen by Matrix Revisited! <br /> <br /> If you really want to know about the process and the worries and the stress and details of what went into Matrix production, it doesn't look beyond the Matrix original DVD bonus features. There are things that they show in documentaries that I didn't even think of, had to do or do. Matrix was such a complicated and complicated film that it deserves more credit than a "documentary", which is about as informative and interesting as MTV's special.
