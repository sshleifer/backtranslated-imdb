This is an example of why most feature films are the same. General and boring, here's nothing worthwhile. Ice-T and the Ice Cube are barely a waste of talented talents who have proven each time that they are capable of acting and doing well. Don't worry about it, go to New Jack City, Ricochet or see New York Undercover for Ice-T or Boyz n Hood, higher education or Friday for Ice Cube and see the real deal. Ice-T's terrible clich√© dialogue only changes this movie to the teeth and I still mean what the hell did Bill Paxton do in this movie? And why does he always play the same character? From foreigners to every movie I've seen with Bill Paxton, playing with the same irritating character, and at least for his aliens, his character died, making it somewhat joyful ... <br /> <br /> It is generally a second-degree action trash can. There are countless better movies to see, and if you really want to see it, look at the Night judgment, which is practically a carbon copy, but with better performance and a better script. The only thing that did was worth looking at the camera with a good hand - cinema was almost refreshing, close to the terrible film, but not quite. 4/10.
