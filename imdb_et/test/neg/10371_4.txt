*** SHORT SPOILERS *** This full moon franchise modifies a little bit and applies some new elements. First a new dollhead is created. Second, the dolls turn well at this stage. Finally, it also introduces some sci-fi / fantasy elements. They also learn from some demons of another dimension, which has Toulon's responsibility to steal the secret to revive. So Sutekh (demon) sends totems, a bunch of little creatures that look less like ears. Then the task of the doll troupe is to take care of the interdimensional threat that is trying to kill new friends there. How were the dolls put back in the trunk? How can nobody remember the last one to kill at a hotel? Who bought this hotel? Why would a contractor have a mass destruction building? All of this and many other questions do not answer ... ever. <br /> <br /> The real surprise of this movie is the actor. It's actually pretty good. The actors take it with enthusiasm, especially with the non-full moon names. Mount Teresa was particularly impressive as the shy, nervous, psychic Lauren. Chandra West (Susie) was also a pleasant surprise. Gordon Hill was an acceptable protagonist. But Cameron was too tedious for the stomach. Thanks to the norse god he dies halfway before. <br /> <br /> Dolls are usually animated. Also some fixes. There are emotions (especially Jester's) much more humane because of the sound given to them. Blade hisses, Pinhead primers and Six-Shooter crust are all better and sound better. Stop-motion animation is at best only average, especially totems. They just don't seem to be moving as liquid as the previous part of the series. Sutek's costume is also absolutely terrible. How should we fear a creature that is so humorous that it is so enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The story seems a bit jewel for the series. I think Charlie Band wants to focus on the younger demographic. The violence of this film also seems to be the same. Gore fans are disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think the above problem is the main problem that this movie cannot hold with many people. He has no gorewhores of violence. The language is a little cleaner. But it is too violent and harsh for rodents. That's why the movie gets low ratings. I have to say that common reviews are mostly fair.
