So this ugly guy with long, nasty hair and his girlfriend will arrive at this house and claim and argue for his old girl. There was probably something frightening, but I didn't see anything scary at all. Sometimes the demon is mentioned at sea, but it doesn't go at all. I wish it would happen because then it would be a tension away from the frustrated jealous of the triangle of love. The movie's title looks like it would be a scary and exciting movie, but it's so far away that I couldn't believe it. I waited and waited for it to end and I was as happy as he did. It didn't live by the title that it should be like. The cover had a cool picture, but I shouldn't appreciate the capping film cover.
