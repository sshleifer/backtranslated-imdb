All in all, in short, this film was disappointing and could have been shortened by twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> The actor was sub-par, the only decent players in the bunch are Trisha, Killer and Molly. The music was a bit flat, but suitable and special effects were too exaggerated. Writing a story / scenario was bad, unnecessary torture / romantic scenes were pulled too long and disappointing. <br /> <br /> The start of the movie was rather slow, the fake look was not much of interest. Trisha arrived at the house and there was some prerequisite for good style. <br /> <br /> Trisha started receiving threatening phone calls, which increased her intercourse. This momentary relationship, the best feature of the film, began to build, but then the friends fell off, destroying all possible tensions / horrors. <br /> <br /> Then the plot gets targeted. Chemistry sparks occur between the two pairs and then kills Frank and the other girl. This scene was dragged on and was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The killer then kills Trisha and binds him up. There's an unnecessary torture scene that lasts at least ten minutes too long. Since gore is badly done, it is not entertaining at all and it shrinks more than shocks. <br /> <br /> All in all, the first thirty minutes of this movie are promising, but a poorly written dialogue and a general lack of plot. destroys this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
