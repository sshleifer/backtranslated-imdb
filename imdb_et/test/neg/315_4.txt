OK, I can only find three reasons to consider this movie with an extremely small budget. <br /> <br /> The first was Linnea Quigley and Rachel Carter. In fact, these two gave me four good reasons to look and see what I did. <br /> <br /> The only other reason to watch is that much has been filmed right on the road. Now, I didn't know it before, but I saw the Orange County road sign and I said wow! It was shot in Florida. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the past and the young child's ancestors, but that was really it. The squirrel killings were pretty flat except for the biker. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Quigley and Carter, OK, but the return of living dead gives you more excitement.
