This film is a little entertaining if we ignore the numerous inconsistencies and the lack of credibility of the plots. Bruce Willis as "The Jackal" never seems to be under his reputation as a submissive master of the underworld. Instead, he worships in a broad daylight, parade the depression of dirty shadows. Why has this person ever been captured (or even detected) outside of me. Not once is the audience's impression of his intelligence or courage; Given the price he charges for his services ($ 70 million redundant), his methods are decisively low in budget and stupid. <br /> <br /> Those who serve him are at least as ridiculous in their behavior. They do not have any expertise but rely on semi-baked assumptions that send them all over the country with their whim. Incredibly, these far-drawn calculations (maybe he bought a boat, maybe he's in Chicago, etc.) always take them directly to Jackalis, who again escapes his clumsy grip. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere, whose Irish accent gets out and out like a remote radio station, plays an inexplicable role for prisoners who have been released from prison to work with the FBI. In fact, he makes a compatible partner, if only because his resources are amateur and intuitive as his professional salaries. At one point he is actually faced with the notorious Jackal, but unfortunately he is not able to supply the FBI, although he trusts him enough to leave him out of sight, unable to equip him with a weapon or means of communication. What kind of operation are they doing here? <br /> <br /> The film seems too dependent on terrible violence, which is totally superfluous and does not give any tension. The allegedly insidious Jackal acts rather as a killer of demented and meaningless sera, losing the victim of blood and blood to the human being's sports and writing. with melodrama. This film is poorly executed on several levels, one bright spot is always consistent with Sidney Poitier. Avoid this movie when you are in the mood to watch it. <br /> <br />
