First of all, I testify that I haven't seen Vampires: Los Muertosit, but I've seen the original Vampire movie and love it. I rented this movie after hearing about it. I didn't expect to be impressed. I wasn't. <br /> <br /> I love the idea that action is moved far to the east, which should have opened up many new opportunities for action sequences and lessons, but not enough. Fighting scenes and motorcycle items were painfully boring. <br /> <br /> I liked some parts, like how the killed crew was not shown as heroic good as they were in the first movie. <br /> <br /> I had been hoping that when I saw an old Hammer movie Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires a few years ago, someone could make another good Asian-based vampire in a few days. It wasn't like that.
