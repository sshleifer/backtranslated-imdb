I bought Jack-O several months ago at Blockbuster's video sales and at the same time I didn't expect anything outstanding about it. Looking at this, I realized that I not only had less than I could have ever done, but also much more. It seems weird, I know. And that is. But it fits perfectly if you think that the ultimate cunning is "Jack-O" <br /> <br /> The movie is followed by a young boy named Shawn Kelly. Somehow, through the ancestral ties, he is marked by the death of a man who is considered to be a dead pumpkin. This pumpkin man was killed by Shawn's grandfather-on-cousin, and now, as the villain has resurrected, Shawn's death is probably crucial for his hell-grown mission. Anyway, there will be a lot of "horror" when Jack-O starts to run with his neighbors before fighting for Shawn's finish. <br /> <br /> I am not so much here to discuss the plot to decide who can find the value of this movie. I can honestly say that Jack-O is one of the worst-made films in history. Operation is dead (unless it should be), the script is probably a Class 1 project and the production budget must not exceed $ 150. Some of the most ridiculous death scenes are carried out in this anti-thriller and they are all more humorous when you realize that director Steve Latshaw is serious about making his film. <br /> <br /> And still enjoy the movie. I can call it a terrible horror movie, yes. But I can also say that I had a good time with my friends to watch and have been watching this fateful first time. Many people (including some of my friends) find this film intolerable and unnecessarily time consuming and understandable. If you're like me and you enjoy ridiculously bad movies that take you seriously, you'll find a Jack-O style classic that is also understandable. <br /> <br /> That's why it's so hard to evaluate this movie. If I appreciated Jack-O's film quality, I wouldn't give it anything. In fact, the studio would owe me stars. But if I had rated it, I'd give it to 8 or 9. I'll give it to 4, so I was somewhere in the middle. I recommend that everyone go, rent and make their own conclusion.
