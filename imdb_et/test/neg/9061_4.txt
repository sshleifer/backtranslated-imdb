I'm a fan of an old SCTV show at the end of the 70s and early 80s, and John Candy was the main reason why. She got very funny wall characters and was just fun. Unfortunately he couldn't play these roles in the movies. From time to time I was frustrated by mediocre films, in which he almost played a "straight" role instead of a funny man. "Armed and Dangerous" rarely tries to use John's comic abilities or Harold Ram's. It's just a very predictable type of police and robber. If you are a fan of John Candy or Harold Ramis, this movie is observable, just don't wait to laugh.
