Don't waste your time. Pulling the plot, the characters are wooden and uninteresting, their motivation for action is completely unclear. Waiting for "romantic" or "comedy" and nothing happened. Worse still, the love letter is not even romantic, but sounds like it was written by someone desperate to make a deadline. Did I mention the "plot twist" we saw for 15 minutes on the film was "Hollywood smart", which means it is shocking, but given Hollywood's mentality - does nothing, and instead it is unclear offensive. <br /> <br /> It's not even worth renting $ 2. Don't bother to see it.
