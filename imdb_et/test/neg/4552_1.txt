Ok, let's start by saying that if the Dutch movie is bad, it's really bad. There is rarely a bit of high quality (Lek, Character) here in the Netherlands, but not often. Costa! there are about 4 girls who go to Spain for a holiday, a party, a drunk, a put (u know the drill). It also concerns the world of club friends or buyers. Pro's who are trying to attract a crowd to their club. <br /> <br /> I am not sure how long it took to write a script, but I suspect that somewhere between 15 minutes and 20 minutes, as you watch a number of random scenes in 90 minutes. Something, and I mean, there's nothing plausible in this movie. It is almost too ridiculous for the words that happen with the event plan. Suddenly, the film becomes a kind of karate activity. One-on-one in the fight for a "bad man in black" and a clich√© car drive times through the water car (can it be more cheesy). The words and the words of casting are also not familiar to the maker. <br /> <br /> After seeing "Traffic" 3 days before it, I was very brilliant, a work of art. This is the saddest thing about filmmaking. And don't start with a small budget. Because even with a small budget, you can write a better script. It almost seems that filmmakers were too busy to make a decent movie. </p> Don't waste your money on such rubbish.
