The only reason I watched this movie for the second time was to learn a "second banana" girl playing with Katie Holms. His name is Marisa Coughlan. Ever heard of her before. She's cute. Exciting. She is very observable with an animated face and a lovely body ... She is real, "Poisenality" ... More than Grace Kelly's transient vibe ... with a youthful overflow. I think he's in an Irish gene fund (my favorite female sex DNA), so it's a little thought that he reminds me of the most beautiful Irish American. The film is unnoticeable, Katie Holms is a classic beauty in the muscle. But Marisa Coughlan is what you are following with your eyes. In 1999, when this film was made, he was about 25 years old, who was his prime minister. It reminds me of another stupid, precious movie whose only salvation is in this pretty girl. It was "Career Opportunities" where I first saw Jennifer Conolit. Or "Grease II" when I first saw Michelle Pfeiffer.
