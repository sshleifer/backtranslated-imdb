It seemed cool about the film sleeve, but after five minutes we were not sure whether it was a western story of a homosexual documentary without women's interest. The quality of the film was bad and there were not enough gang fighting measures to keep even the drunken man's interest long enough to watch the whole movie. Can God worship the souls of both actors and filmmakers who are responsible for what I can only describe as new, and the only reason I never want to see (or trust) a film made by Australia again. I have to write more that I say again that the actors were so bad that I am positive so I can make a better movie with fifteen dollars and a box of trojans. Please do not look at this movie for your own benefit.
