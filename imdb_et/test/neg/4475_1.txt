It was one of the worst movies I remember. I'm sure I have seen the worse when it eases me. <br /> <br /> Humor is not funny, the stupid stereotype is a joke that is not funny again. I was on a plane in captivity and watched this movie. It was a complete waste of time. I liked Martin in earlier films, but not that. The same applies to the royal Latifah, he was excellent in Chicago and it was also good, but that role was terrible. <br /> <br /> I mostly credit for a script writing failure. I feel strongly that you cannot record a formal, unforgettable script with decent actors, this movie as a case. However, all involved would have been wise enough not to participate in this film. I'm just surprised that something so bad can be done in green light, released and promoted at the theater.
