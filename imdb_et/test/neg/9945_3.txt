I've heard a lot about this film's inventive camera work and direction. I thought both were confusing <br /> <br /> some really terrible. The main "heroine" of the film is irritating to anxiety and in no way has any useful contribution to any situation. Everything he does or says is stupid, and he seems to be simply in the life of the people in general. if he could fight, I can forgive him. <br /> <br /> In general, all the women in this movie are stereotypical "squads" that need a man to save them. and all the men in this movie are the twilight twilight muscles that can't save anyone. <br /> <br /> This is a bad film and I ask you to avoid it. Look at something like the "Sword of Punishment", I hear it much better than the confusing confusion of the movie.
