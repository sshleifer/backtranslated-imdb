Okay, you have: <br /> <br /> Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed, B.B.E. (England's backbone.) He was killed in the first scene - it's right, people; this show has no backbone! <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole, as Ol 'Colonel Cricket, from the first war and now decorated with the gentleman. <br /> <br /> Joanna Lumley as a hidden lady mansion, 20 years younger than a colonel and 20 years past her main, but still glamorous (British spell, not mine) to side visit the toy. This is fine, they have the full knowledge and consent of Colonel Cricket (they even come around!) However, he is sufficiently alert to the Colonel that he has said that the toy boy is at his age (what maybe!) <br /> > David McCallum, like a toy boy, is also as meaningless as a glamorous than his. Pilcher couldn't find him, so he gave him a hush-hush job in the circus. <br /> <br /> And finally: <br /> <br /> Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups, Honorable Director of Honorable Girls' School, earning her way in her office with deep, dirty advice on her life abroad just before she finishes. His best advice: "I've only been in Nancherrow (home of a local home in England). I thought it was very beautiful, but somehow not part of the real world." Well, we can't say they didn't warn us. <br /> <br /> Ah, Susan - the time was up, your character would have visited the whole show. They no longer write so. Our loss, not yours. <br /> <br /> So - as cast and set, do you have "Brideshead Revisited", "right" around? <br /> <br /> Wrong! They took these 1-dimensional support roles because they paid so well. After all, acting is one of the oldest tempo jobs (TE name second!) <br /> <br /> The first warning sign: lots and lots of backlight. They're going around it, taking pictures outdoors - "hey, it's just sunlight!" <br /> <br /> Another warning sign: The leading lady shouts a lot. If not crying, his eyes are damp. This is the Romance Novels Act: Leading Lady is "Greasy Eye". <br /> <br /> The leading lady is known as LL <br /> <br /> The third warning sign: LL has stars in her eyes when she is in love. At the same time, I give Emily Mortimer a prize precisely because I had to keep an eye on my eyes (I don't know if they used contacts?) <br /> <br /> Finally, the fourth warning sign is not "ladies" on the screen He's either "Miss" or "Lady." <br /> <br /> When everything was said and done, I couldn't tell you who it was and why. I couldn't even tell you what was said and done. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, they all live through World War II without ever having anything to do with them. <br /> <br /> OK, at the end LL finds that he has lost his parents to Japanese prison camps and the baby's interior is catatious. Meanwhile (there is always in the meantime) a young man LL had the impression (if I don't know) coming home from some harsh spot and finding a manor house on the street (there must be some street when SHE found him there.) Both war victims are carved on Nancherrow back (SOMEBODY must be "beaten" by SOMEWHERE in these romantic stories!) <br /> <br /> Great drama.
