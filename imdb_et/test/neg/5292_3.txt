I enjoyed the beautiful landscape of this movie when I first saw it when I was 9 years old. Dunderklumpen is a funny and cute way. It reminded me of HRPUFFINSTUFF in the sitting morning, its Swedish-language backgrounds make it easy for the eyes. Do not expect older children to be interested, because the lively action / animation is behind time and most older children get bored. This is definitely less than a 10-year-old movie and nice memories for those who were small children in 1974.
