I do not understand why you would give this movie something more than 4 ... Honestly enough to be back in the 80s and the "fear comedy for the good old days", but this genre has never been better since then - it's still so " LAME Low budget - low technology - bad behavior - bad story - not at all scary and not funny enough ... in fact, there is not much good I could say about it - the so-called monsters are just bad! I mean we are from time to time back when they used monsters out of plasticine and photographed scenes famous ... I really don't understand why someone is investing money to make this script movie - but I think it could have been almost OK if it had been a bigger budget movie <br /> <br /> A recommendation would be - please don't make the mistake of wasting your time if you don't want to get the advice of bad Halloween make up! I personally enjoy independent movies and something outside the box, but it just didn't do it the least for me.
