some argue that this is better mainly because of action; but it is indeed much worse for reasons that outweigh the healing. <br /> <br /> the source of all problems; story. The biggest problem is in addition to one of those people who are in a shotgun, shotgun, chest, and hours without a doctor. Nic, gangsta with a golden heart is ready to do anything for the friend she just met; and it also involves helping the evil spirit. Ce-Ce, who has come out of the past with a voodoo past, is ready to call Killjoy as long as Nic is able to "hook" him. acting, though improved, is still terrible. these people could not bring the emotions out of a paper bag. the script doesn't help them too. foolish lines, and I can't take any direction from the Director General. this script was read in high school with Shakespeare, the teacher whipping them as they went. <br /> <br /> If this movie (if you can call it that 80 minutes (luckily)) is perhaps even more fun than the first for all of them, it is definitely painful to look. 1/10.
