The film begins in spring 2001. A John Tree (Channing Tatum) soldier falls in love with a college student Savannah Cutis (Amanda Seyfried). In two weeks they fall in love with each other (!). But he must go to war and go to college. They do, but keep in touch with each other in writing. Then will be 9/11. She wants to reenlist - she wants her to stay home. What are they doing? Hysterically bad romantic drama. ARE wires are attractive - Tatum is obviously a beautiful guy with beautiful green eyes and a hot body (he is out of the water after surfing), but he can't act. Seyfried is a beautiful woman and she is trying ... but the dialogue here is terrible. When I saw it, I and my friend fought hard to not laugh out loud at the beginning of some "romantic" dialogue. It was just HORRIBLE. For the first hour or so I'm bored by a ridiculously predictable drama or terrible "romance". Then, after that first hour, the tragedy collides and I have to admit I had tears. But filmmakers are leaving their way to make sure you are crying, burial and meeting tears. How can you not cry? It would have worked if the operation were better. The face of Tatum never changes expression - not ONCE! He always saw the face. Seyfried was better than LITTLE but not much. To make it worse, Tatum and Seyfried had no sexual chemistry at all! They barely looked to love each other, let alone love each other. Carolinas had beautiful photos, but it's a dull and stupid romantic "drama". 1 all the way ... and I usually love such stupid romantic dramas!
