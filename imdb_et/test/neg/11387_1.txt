First of all, the assumption stinks ... the little boy likes to dress in the girls' clothes. It reminded me of Norman Bates at PSYCHO or Ed Wood at ED WOOD. Jokes are flat and old, you've seen about a dozen of 50's and 60's movies. The whole cast is wasted. I bet people entered Shirley MacLaine's vehicle. Please, Would anyone tell Shirley that he did his best comedy for two MULESES SISTER SARAs. Look at it ... if there are no Andy Griffith attacks.
