Just terrible. It is almost unbelievable that Dashiell Hammetti's characters and situations may be accompanied by such a passionate, passionate mishmash. But this is a filler for television - ads between you. The first warning signal sounds like a recurrence of a time period that punishes the "1928" banner type. Flivvers and touring cars, fedoras and vests, cloches and speakeasy jazz (jarringly played) - all the attention is paid to meaningless, arty detail, important issues are ignored. <br /> <br /> Like narrative clarity or credible or competent writing and acting. The plot has one Hammett operator ("Hamilton Nash", so he is "Ham" or "Nash", which we mean "Hammett" or "Dash"), exploring fake diamond theft. This is how a young woman is allegedly carrying Dain Curse (a charming and talented Nancy Addison who went back to the soap where she belonged); he belongs to a religious cult culture led by Jean Simmons and also appears to be addicted to drugs; there is also a mysterious gaseous medicine that penetrates into the rooms ... <br /> <br /> But enough. Writing is no longer a pedestrian when it reaches a poetic or high-flying, and cast parrots are the only way they know how to: grotesque overcrowding. Simmons is treated like a small royalties from the old Hollywood, but the treatment of grande-dame is not washed. For some reason, Hector Elizondo has another bill (after Coburn) for the release. Other familiar faces run through, making little use to restart them. <br /> <br /> The actors are not even well photographed. Jason Miller is a special fear, but Coburn's extreme close-ups are also bad. Coburn probably abandoned this role because he was strongly similar to Hammett with mustache. He needed more; no one has given him more ambiguous clues as to how to play the tone of his character or story, nor how the different strands of the plot come into contact with each other (they are not, at least not in this statement). So she flashes with her big Chesire cat whether she was invited or not. <br /> <br /> Dain Curse is available on video tape of various lengths. For those who are stupid enough to "see" themselves, the shortest abbreviation is the coolest.
