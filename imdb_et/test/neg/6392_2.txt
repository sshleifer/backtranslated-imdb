There are problems with Michael Cain's character. He is a normal, short-sighted, insecure man in the mid-40s. She's married, but her wife doesn't seem to love her anymore. She has a bad relationship with her only daughter. But his most direct problem is that the amazingly beautiful young woman, played by Michelle Johnson, tries to get her too jealously, kissing her, grabbing her and trying to have sex with everyone. What is a poor companion? <br /> <br /> This movie must be taken out of the comedy section and placed under scientific literature. Only the intergalactic brain chip can explain the nature of Michelle Johnson. Let's see - 3 billion men in the world - he can quite choose - he's going out with a clumsy, aging loser. It goes beyond the middle-aged male fantasy, which is so delusive, you just hope that everyone will volunteer for therapy. <br /> <br /> There's really nothing funny here. Cainest has some quick experiments that often seem to play Hawkeye Pierce more than a new character. Joseph Bologna is like tile nails. Michelle Johnson is not an actress - she has one crying that doesn't move in high school - but she's pretty and she's taking off her clothes. So buy a DVD, leave scenes 4 and 9 and forget the rest.
