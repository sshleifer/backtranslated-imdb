Unfortunately, this film had the potential for such a ready-made pain, but everything was so poorly thought out and badly done. I don't think I've ever seen any movie where every scene just falls loud as he did here. Nor do I believe that I've ever seen a "stoner" sex comedy that did not give at least one laugh, but this mold did not give anything other than an acute and poor one. The last time I was stunned when it was funny comedy was the terrible "Big Momma House". The scene after the scene turns these films into marmalade of your brain. Nice and foolish can sometimes be funny, but here's a stupid and stupid torture against the viewer. Absolute, stone-bottom.
