First, the title is "DAILY" LIE. <br /> <br /> Each "Daily Show" program will open on the screen visually from the date it is taken, followed by a pause and opening. On many days when they see a daily show, they slip the tape and the OMIT date and begin with an opening announcement, giving the wrong impression that the show is new. It is wrong. Not mentioned is it is a rebroadcast. And such noise is just a small indication of how this exhibition is slippery and deceptive. In addition, it is only 4 nights a week. It is not quite "everyday" - which means from Monday to Friday - another shortcoming, but I am grateful. source of news. It leaves them disgracefully ignorant and much worse - badly misinformed. <br /> <br /> Although it shows that politically it is a liberal left, it can sometimes be fun. However, its truth is small. Facts and information are often spelled in to fit the writers' agenda. It is often difficult to tell where the facts leave and the fiction and comedy begin. The result is pre-digested, interpreted information designed to convince and influence. This is called "PROPAGANDA". <br /> <br /> Far interviews are heavily involved in editing. <br /> <br /> It loses me if it is the basis of God and Christians - what he does too often. However, you never hear anything vaguely anti-Semitic. <br /> <br /> When Jon Stewart and the company attacked someone other than Christians, it is considered offensive to outrage. Credit names explain the source.
