I loosen, despise, and hate this movie with a passion that turns the red hot colors of hell into a cold side. it is nothing more than a campy, scary and full-fledged journey along the memory lane, so oh-so-nasty time, 70s, ten years im pleased that i wasn't part of that absolute trick is all that was offered! <br /> <br /> Animation is dated slowly, especially sticky, missing frames and characters with large bulbous heads, this film is striking. from the knowing smacking of the parents to the freakily gay horse and this is the camp's hand movement and the kenneth williams-esque voice, openly, no doubt, to the narcotic hymn, the High Cockalorum, this film, sad to say, was forced into me as a child and I have never been a complete terrorist, what it caused me .... <br /> <br /> This terribly awkward terrible should carry the R-Class certificate, so it will interfere with it. content!
