Bog Creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with little money, some knowledge of making a movie, ambitious participants in a mixed bag and a lot of determination, but without the necessary knowledge and skills to take something more than looking bad for school (bad, not nostalgic). I think this is such a high quality home theater / student film if you want to give it to your family and friends for free. Luckily I found it somewhere at a discounted price. Of course, this type of thing can be there, but it is a market that seems to be only by default, because there are so many bad B movies. Even more so now and for ages. <br /> <br /> The only person I would like to be is the filmmakers of purposeful immigrants. First of all, I would recommend that they look at the specifics attached to the disc. Watch the film team's enthusiasm, their hard work, their joy and their very high opinion of their product. Then look at the movie. Within a few frames, you will hopefully understand what went wrong. Bored, I went through the whole thing and clearly the manager and the operator, but just don't know enough what they do. They knew enough to have fun, but in the long run it was interpreted without the necessary skills: They knew they were dangerous. It's like a bad Nickelodeon movie (as it is probably the most decent). A couple of actresses did ok, and with a nice tattoo (real or fake tattoo I don't know) a nice stoner was probably the best and most natural and I hope she does it. But their natural talent was what went beyond the bad film, the bad script, and so the guiding principles. If the director had more time helping these aspiring participants to develop their characters, they successfully learn proven camera techniques and lighting principles to better target their team, and if the script was actually written in a week or not (a very pleasant documentary, maybe it might have been) Be more of a movie. Instead, this is a film that has some potential and has a few moments (thanks to the genre more than a movie itself), but reaches almost every frame that MUST NOT be done. If you want to see a decent low budget horror movie, look at Phantasm or even Laserblast. If you want a glorified home movie (no fun), get Bog Creatures.
