If there was an EPA for the film, it would be the most sincere approval of this film. If we all recycle our "stuff" to such an extent, we would never have run out. <br /> <br /> Funny how I was reminded of this movie when I first saw Starwars I: Phantom Menace. At least Lucas didn't recycle his old material. <br /> <br /> It's bad. But that's nice. Lovely on the ground (I liked it when the kid said "fucking stones"). And if you like explosions (even recycled), you get your fill. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's obviously pretty good for a "no budget" movie. Action is weak, but here and there are few testimonials. The story is predictable, but it will take you anyway. <br /> <br /> This is "everybody drives a child" type of film, which probably likes mostly younger audiences. I gave it to 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I dug a copy of this old VHS. I don't think it's a DVD.
