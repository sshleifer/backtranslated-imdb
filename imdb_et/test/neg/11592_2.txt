If you are looking for a movie that is fun to watch just because you can make fun of not so great actors, cheesy "special" effects and a typical sci-fi plot ... then it's a movie for you! Not acting was bad, in fact some participants were really decent. Special effects were not the biggest (at least); The animals saw completely computer animated. There was an irritating crackling to cover the intimidation, and one song was played over and over again throughout the film. All in all, you're a good movie if you're looking for something completely fun and fun. It is not good to watch a movie if you are looking for something serious.
