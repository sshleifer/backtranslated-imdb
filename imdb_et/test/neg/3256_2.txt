When a prestigious country club is rejected by a hard-working entrepreneur, he starts a battle between the members and finally buys it from Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) and turns it into a theme park / golf course where everyone can join. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, but sometimes it's still a little fun. Almost all comedies are cheap slapstick and bad jokes, except Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase plays the second role of Ty Webb for the second time and plays it perfectly. He's not just the funniest character in the movie, but the only funny sign of the movie. Even Dan Akroyd does not bring humor to this film, which tries to be a great success for the classic comedy, but falls into the comedy shown in the middle of comedy. The film could have been better if Ty Webb (Chase) had a bigger role, but it was reduced to a less important character and the star became Jackie Mason (Who?) They should have returned everything cast and make a sequel to the right path! This is a great example of what not to do if you are already doing a great movie. In general, Caddyshack II is a humorous but big mistake. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie.
