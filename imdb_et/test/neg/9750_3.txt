I just saw this movie. I liked the soundtrack.I saw the first trailer and was great, like all the Hollywood movies, they know how to sell. But the movie is almost terrible, the first 30 minutes is interesting, but then .... like almost all the new movies they blow off. I don't get the idea why this boy died? Whether the clich√©, every niggie movie has to have a child to be killed, and everybody needs to repair after death.LOL.I do not understand what is the connection to the film ... And it's so predictable, you know the end of the first minute. There's nothing new in this movie. I saw you earned the same idea, but ... something new ... it's something like "dear", but it's not a bit different between them. If you have no choice, check out this movie, but be sure to have the last choice you use. And choreography is worst than all before. It's NOT sure to be sure ...
