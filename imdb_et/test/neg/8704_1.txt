As a Christian I am outraged after I saw the first half of this picture. The movie's website says they were watching the movie before writing, but I believe they forgot to consult the final source THE BIBLE. I sat in two different versions of the Bible and could not find half of what happened or was said in this picture. It was like they formed what was not in the Bible, and changed what they thought the viewers of today's film would want to see instead of truth. Personally, I am too young to remember the Ten Commandments of the 1950s, but it cannot be worse. I have written to the network and hope that they will apologize publicly for this public.
