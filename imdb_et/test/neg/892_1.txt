I saw House Party 1-3 and I loved them, but it wasn't funny at all. First, can't it be a House Party movie without Kid n'Play? It sucks and it was more than the Black version of Ferris Bueller's Day as a House Party movie. Second, who is John-John? These new characters can't even compare to the other three movies. I know why they put it right on the video. It's terrible music, a weak plot, uninvited actors and fun jokes at all. My advice, check out this movie at night only if you can't sleep. series after House Party 3 because Kid'n'Play left after that. I hate being happy that my local video store does not have this movie and never wants to buy it or want to see it at Comedy Central. Chris Strokes has a talent who manages a newer R&B group, doesn't mean he has talent management and movie creation, right or what? Finally, the female characters were dressed like a cheap two dollar whore between most of the flick.IMX that was released a year after the flick was released, probably due to the failure of this movie and everything is forgotten today. Simply put, this movie just old sucks !!!!
