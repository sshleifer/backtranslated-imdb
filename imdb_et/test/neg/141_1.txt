His little part as a massager gave a clear idea of ​​putting the wrench into the French soft core series of gambit, turning around the Caucasian carnival and pouring Javanese stunter Gemser in this leading role, quite the first in the first series of sex knees, becoming more and more obsessed. when the sleazier directors took only the name-after queues. <br /> <br /> Somebody (and certainly not English-over-the-carriers in Warner?) was also expected to see "Star Is Born" type meteoric rising results, judging how the actor is credited only to the eponymous moniker screen of the heroine, although a couple of consonants sacrificed as insurance for litigation. <br /> <br /> Gemser's term in the series saw him as a "strange" photographer, who of course promised all sorts of adventurous adventures. But while he may be the most beautiful actor on the screen at this time, any such talent that could be seen there will get into the same unlikely hope ("I have to admit that since I've been to Africa, I find white skin less appealing." . ") found in French films. <br /> <br /> And in this particular entry, a lot of rainfall for the rainbow brigade. The essence of the screen carnality is the same as drilling in the symbol (pumping the piston of the engine!), as it is in the prosaic couplings - although of course they include the benefits of "exploratory" lesbianism. However, the Kishy Konoisur is guaranteed a steady stream of fantastic joy, with the epithets of ethnographic wisdom, such as "I don't do anything perfect for black, doing everything to be perfect white".
