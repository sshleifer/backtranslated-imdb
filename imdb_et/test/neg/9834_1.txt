Okay ... this movie was mostly very good for MST3K flick ... and then they decided to destroy the little good he had about 15 minutes before the end. * SPOILER ALERT * The movie is very common ... rich mother boy, named Danny, meets Bix, and two of them travel to a small town where Bix meets a beautiful girl Carrie (who is so great). . Everything they had to do was follow the simple chemistry of any romance movie ... Carrie loves Bixi ... Bix loves Carrie ... a horrible guy in town who wants Carrie ... Now I know what you mean . .. Bix fights slipping and finally decides to stay with Carrie and Danny returns home and they all live happily after ... right? ERROR! Because Carrie murdered the city to slip because Bix is ​​too gay to do that. (There are so many homosexuals between Danny and Bixi). And then the whole city will decide on Bixi lynch, even if the city slip would have been the main suspect. Then, the city slips out of Carrie's killing without much hesitation ... (must have felt bad, poor dope.) Then Danny brings him Bix home ... it's a movie "happily after." Sad? All I can say is thanks to God for Joel and Bot. Because they turned this horse's hockey into one of my favorite MST3K episodes.
