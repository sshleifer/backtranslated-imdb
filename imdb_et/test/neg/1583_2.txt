OK, what was that story again? I'm afraid I've never read a book and, frankly, it was one of the most confusing films I've been trying to watch for a long time. I get a little confused about how much feedback sister, patient, and man without thumbs. The film didn't even explain what they were looking for in the desert until they found it; or even how they all knew each other that they came together. <br /> <br /> After seeing Pride and Prejudice recently with Colin Firth, I've been trying to explore my film career by watching other films and other than "What girl wants" movies. it played, there was something good. I'm not sure he wasn't good. She's really one of the best actors I've seen in today's movie, but the content and quality of the movies I play is much desirable. <br /> <br /> "English Patient" is another great example of where a director, writer and team are too close to their subject to see that the viewer can't get the picture? literally. The whole movie seemed to be intended to show Ralph Fiennes as a dramatic actor with long emotional times. Nothing really explained, and every start date seems to require a psychoanalysis! <br /> <br /> The character of Kristin Scott Thomas seems to be describing erotic stories that stand in front of a male audience and transforming other men into a man; Colin Firth, who plays with his wife, may not necessarily be all his marbles and should be a secret agent? I think; and Ralph Fiennes walks like Mr Darcy of Rome (sorry, Colin!) who thinks he knows all this. The rest of the cast is poured on the four winds (pun intended) when the plot goes. <br /> <br /> The sister's mental stability sub-block (Juliette Binoche) and her motives and involvement with Naveen Andrews is another confusing element that leaves the viewer with an uncomfortable taste. Of course, the viewer still talks about how the first two characters of the world (Thomas and Fiennes) were having sex for the first time. What was Attraction? There was no chemistry and no accumulation. Just blow, junk, thank you! <br /> <br /> And is it not romantic that Fiennes ended up helping Germans by giving them cards in the desert? To describe this movie, I just have to say, "How do you impress your gynecologist with your mammograms and deceive your lovely, divine husband who loves you." <br /> <br /> The last incredible part of this plot is to understand how anyone would choose Ralph Fiennes Colin Firth. Firth had very little chance to show his acting talent? watching the movie, I thought it must be one of his first. The scene in which she had been waiting for her wife all night was probably the only other film worthy of the film. In this case, I don't care to look at it again. <br /> <br /> The best scene I liked was a plane failure where Firth tries to take them all off. He was too bad! It would have saved a more fruitful film for another twenty minutes. The scenes in the air desert were pretty clean.
