By the blow on the back of the DVD bag; Jonothan Ross laughed until a little bit came. I suspect it is more related to his fullness. <br /> <br /> I've never tracked a series for one reason or another, so maybe I've lost some important hints. What about this movie? I looked for the first 45 minutes or so. I laughed once, smiled once, reached the newspaper, waiting for something else to entertain. Nothing did. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this sacred surreal python life, in a gross-moral style, is perfectly flat. In recent years, there have been several comedy series on television, the least of which were "Bottom", "The Fast Show", "The Dibley Vicar" and "Father Ted". fun characters and sketches. Each of them can hit this naughty hat. <br /> <br /> When the series had something like a movie; I'm surprised they got the money. Luckily, this was one of those 2 pounds of Tesco Cliff purchases and is now in local charity. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story is; do not believe in pounds, never pay the best dollars.
