For a while, when I was in between jobs, I had the habit of watching all the late nights. For a while I had a good choice: Conan, Leno, Letterman, Ferguson, Kimmel ... <br /> <br /> Until I reached 1:30. Time between Conan and X files, SciFi. And the only show at that time was (and still curious) Carson Daly. <br /> <br /> His show first of all interested me. Young, casually dressed and with the hugging of the MTV host's hip, I thought Carson would bring younger aesthetics to the late night. I wouldn't have been wrong. <br /> <br /> He has no comic timing. His jokes are obviously unsuccessful, and his monologue is a painful thing to self-conscious. I started thinking that he just couldn't deliver the comedy (and I am right, he is not), but it was obvious over time that the writers of the exhibition had kept him for him. Writing was idiotic and too superfluous, and the sketches shouted badly. At the end of the show, the writers at the studio, Carson, had alcohol with alcoholic drinks at every show, unforgettable Carson, who smiled at the cheek, whispering out of his cheek when he slipped through his interviews. <br /> <br /> Zero interview skills. Missing. He's trying to be friendly / dirty, but he gets hungry and rude. He's talking too much. He interrupts his guests. He asks them rude or embarrassing questions - if he can find a question to ask them at all. And as someone has already said, the guests literally looked or sat down, uncomfortably. <br /> <br /> Now the display has left the studio and looks like a handy doll. Even still, Carson refuses NBC's clue. At one point, Carson didn't get a camera man, he had to shoot himself for the episode! Wake up, Carson ... this handwriting is all over the wall. <br /> <br /> I can see that the show is produced by Carson. I can only imagine that this is why it is still in the air, it pays for it.
