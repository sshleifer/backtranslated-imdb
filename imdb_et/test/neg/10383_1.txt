Let me tell you something ... this movie goes over the whole Troma laugh and gore-movie hands down, because it will MUST be a FUTURE MOVI. From terrible action ... "I knew it, I knew he had!" ... against a priest who receives sexual sexes and gets into naked young showers ... this piece of food takes a cake. I'm sorry if I try to compare it equally to another movie equally badly. It can only be in your class. Kicker is that some cardinals are said to have produced it to make sure that it meets the real situation. I didn't know that the people of Backwoods USA acted like imbeciles. I'm not sure if I am disturbed by this rental or I have stumbled over the comedy gem. It was a very innocent pleasure ... so terrible that I looked at my hands more than half my eyes (although I didn't laugh as hard as I cried). The end didn't make any sense, pulling the whole thing perfectly. If you want to look at something so terrible, here's your movie. If you want a scary movie about exorcism, go on.
