REVIEW is a very low budget horror film that was filmed on video. It has penetrating performance, poor lighting, a weak story and some of the worst monster effects I've ever seen. There is a college student on the plot who has been pushed to culture by his attractive landlord. This cult is a Scientology parody with a book similar to dianetics. It would have been a funny blow for this group if it wasn't for a foolish script and cheap production. Monster effects look awful and picture quality makes you feel like watching a home video or a public service. I think anyone who sees it agrees that movies should be filmed.
