It's hard to say whether this ham-braided B-movie adventure is junk, respectful, or just plain, but it doesn't work what you look at. Based on this novel by Michael Crichton, it is a nutty mixture of lost cities, giant horses, monsters, nervous visual effects, and dirty dialogues. The first thing it pulls is a gorilla that can communicate with sign language and it goes without saying that the film doesn't get better from that point. All of this old rope is somewhat worthy of Tim Timry, turning the feverish ham ham and sporting an odd accent that violates identification, and Ernie Hudson, who also seems to know it is all an old garbage load.
