This movie must be well-obligated to give Gator a worthy budget. There was no budget for this movie, the script would need to be rewritten and a better end. This film has bright brightnesses. Boating, Burt drives the middle machine and his conversation with his parents. You can say that Burt is south, not an actor. This movie shows Gator, Burt's best film. It is too bad that this film did not have the same funding and was done at Rush. 4/10
