My 15-year-old daughter asked me to watch this movie on cable TV. Like someone who saw the "Nerds" revenge, I found this movie extremely predictable. The nerds were simply replaced with Dorks. I drove him crazy because he was able to predict exactly what would happen in every scene. The cast was lovely, especially Amanda Bynes. The title should just have been "Dorks revenge." Maybe there is a sequel to Dorks Revenge 2.
