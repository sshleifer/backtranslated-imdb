Describing this movie is a difficult task. On the one hand, it is a gigantic vampire scent that includes dental grids, fearsome music, a hypnotic medallion and, of course, a coffin with a colorful lid. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is one of the most silky scripts produced by Edward D. Wood, Jr., by the same people who gave us "Bloody Vampire", "Vampire Invasion" and the predecessor of this movie titled "Vampire," the film is close to the lack of other logic of the films. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned, this movie is a "Vampire" order I've never seen. But no matter ... it's really easy to imagine what happened. Dr Enrique, played by Abel "The Brainiac" Salazar, has fallen victim to how deliberate, but erroneous Dr Marion returns his vampire enemy Count Karol de Lavudi (I think there's a rule where all vampires must have some sort of census. Marion complains that all important doctors have been using some sort of grave robbery throughout their history to promote their medical research, and hopes to use a vampire body to investigate phenomena such as the lack of a vampire's normal reflection (which point holds the mirror to the vampire and not the reflection vampire skeleton ???). <br /> <br /> Enrique is not happy and seems to have decided to leave the events the first movie is just fantasy and superstition. "That guy wasn't a vampire ... I admit he liked to drink a little blood, but that's all! "he claims. Also the confusing issues are fragile Marta, a part-time nurse and a part-time showgirl (!) who is Enrique's affection Martha fled the first film of the narrow de Lavud clutches, and Enrique probably spent a lot of time "healing her mind" and thought that everything she was experiencing was not real. <br /> <br /> OK, so if you were a screenwriter of this movie, there would be a way for someone to fool enough to pull out a vampire, right? But what about a greedy man who helped Marion steal a coffin? After a glimpse of de Lavud's body, he places his sight in an expensive look that the count bears, and he returns comfortably when doctors are not looking for it. But darn it ... he can't get rid of the tail, so ... you guessed it. De Lavud is loose again, this time a shady conga as his person. <br /> <br /> OK, so of course the vampire is back to Martha again and in the meantime doctors are confused about what they believe. First of all, they have decided to prove that there is no such thing as a real vampire, then at the end of the film they try to make the police point out of all the "dead but alive people". ! ". <br /> <br /> You can probably imagine the rest of the plot here, but the filmmakers throw some pleasant twists. One movie set is a spooky wax museum (is there any other type of film of this type?), equipped with a fully equipped torture chamber ... REAL with torture and filling equipment The film has a very enthusiastic sense of style, not just in the campy horses' networks, one of the most crappy sequences is the seemingly endless streets and streets of de Lavud, following their progress with vague buildings that have no doors, illuminating such Scene like German Expressionist Nightmare ("Dr. Caligar's Cabinet" seems to be But some other film is a minor, especially at the climax of the film. Special effects are fairly raw, even for the year it took place, and the climate fight with de Lavud in bat-shaped form is ridiculous enough. " but the director feels the need to ask us to believe that Martha will go and collapse the mother straight across the guillotine, positioned so that her head was in a sharp frame that is in danger of falling, because the braking wire has suddenly started right when it is very small! What a miserable coincidence! Worse still, he cuts the retracting rope to the Enrique scenes, trying to get into the dragging rubber bat, which is basically standing and throwing his arms around. This is definitely Ed Wood's moment when it used to be, especially when Marta seems to be reviving her and rising to her feet terribly as the blade slips. Whew! What a relief! As for coconut, "Vampire's Coffin" is not a mad factor in "Bloody Vampire" or "Vampire Invasion", but fans of this type of old horror movie appreciate the atmosphere of photography and the fact that the director manages to "read" something about this material (haw haw) ).
