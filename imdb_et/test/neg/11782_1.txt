My website (www.theflickguy.org) lists this choice as the worst movie ever. Here's an excerpt: <br /> <br /> "When I was tightened down on the chair and forced to watch this movie over and over, I couldn't imagine hell being worse. Jim Varney plays a crazy man with three hands who created the world destroying (probably starting with the cinema) Now let's face it, nobody expects a lot from Varney's film, but I had a torturing run of 92 minutes instead of laughing, not a bunch or gitchy, it's not even pointless, it's bad. rent it, it can destroy your DVD player. Don't even buy a VHS 29-inch clear box to use it as a blank tape. It is the worst film of all time. Period. I mean it. Really. "
