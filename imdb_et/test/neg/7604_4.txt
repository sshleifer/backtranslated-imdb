It was a real shoot for me. The original bride with white hair is a great kung fu fantasy movie, but it was pretty weak. I didn't care at all about new characters who unfortunately had the time on the screen and the story was not well developed. When the first film was tragic and it was tied, it was annoying (when I just counted the time until the malicious lovers actually met). This activity was also bad. The struggles were not choreographed very well and there wasn't much kung-fu at all. Just a few weak sword struggles between a very unpleasant lui and one Lin's wife. Lin himself mainly uses telesine to throw people into the walls and sometimes to the hair, far from this impressive example, as shown by the whip and kung-fu in the previous film. I gave this movie to 4 more, because at least it was a fast paced and I wanted to see what would eventually happen, even though I (like most of the people who watched the first) predicted it would go down the way it did and after that when I saw it, I found that it was climatic and wanted to have done the right step or just left the story alone. I really recommend the first, but in turn only the genre fans, and those who want to see Lin as a bride, need one more time.
