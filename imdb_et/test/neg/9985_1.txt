I found a movie from a local video store and was surprised to see it on a DVD. I had heard of explicit sexual scenes, terrible violence and notorious events. I sat down and watched and started laughing! Sets and the direction of art were cheap and fake; nudity was sardonic and incredibly unsexy; the story was badly written and it was just a paradise of incredibly beautiful and talented actors who hosted to quote the worst dialogue ever written! Caligola (Malcolm McDowell) and his calmly beautiful sister Drusilla (Theresa Ann Savoy, a vulnerable beauty) cannot be taken seriously ... it's not even shocking or repulsive! Peter O'Toole and John Geilgud were obviously hostages at the time of making this movie, fortunately dying for the first 30 minutes of the movie. Cinema was a joke and I was still amused when they used the quote from the Bible! The mark is no less. If you are looking for a shock value, this film is disappointing. If you are looking for the cultural value of the camp, you are still disappointed. I know I was. I've seen shocking and it's two hours of my life you never get.
