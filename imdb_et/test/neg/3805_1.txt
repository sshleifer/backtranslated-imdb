Being in the bed with the flu and feeling too harsh to find a remote control, I actually looked at this abomination from the beginning to the end (how many people say it? And anyone who gets - what's your excuse?). My God, have you ever been, EVER has been such a big studio that has been released? The assumed "thriller" does not have one second of real tension; the script is incorrect and ridiculous; the sets look like they were low-budget TV movie scraps; and cast ... WHAT DO YOU SAY? !!! Sally Field will undoubtedly give the winner of any academic prize in the history of the worst and most embarrassing result. Her irritable nasal congestion and stupidly dirty behavior, meant to be a life-threatening situation, is really asinine. It is a miracle that he did not use all his future income to buy and destroy every piece of this turkey. Michael Caine, who is now indefinitely announcing the display art - even the master classes - comes out and shot (preferably one of Telly Savala's henchmen). Angela Cartwright, an actor I usually love (and whose name is not even in the opening credit, the poor soul), is her role ten years too old and her terrible matronly yellow prom dress must haunt her contemporary nightmare. It is Karl Malden and Shirley Knight - hopefully they collected large pay packages to prevent them from engaging. The whole movie is a series of bad scenes, but what looks especially in my eyes is an explosion that results in a "ceiling" (if it can be called an upside down ship), a collapse and a load of empty cardboard boxes falling through! Ooh, how scary! Really, really, terrible.
