I thought I'd really be looking for the "The Fog" Bollywood remake, but it's actually more of a Bollywood remake of "I know what you did last summer," with some "Scream" elements, sort of and not very good. In addition to a couple of very fun song and dance numbers, it's pretty terrible. This is obviously a decent budget, and yet it wastes recycled waste that was not as tasty to start with. A young woman is threatened by a horrible man that she cannot enter the beauty contest because she wants her sister to win (she luckily doesn't see her as scary as her brother), but she enters anyway and wins, and of course the horrible guy comes after him and kills, after which you have to play "hide your body". Of course, the body disappears and no one knows why, but someone knows, and they are waiting for the end of the ridiculous twist to be revealed. With all this tired rehash, there are some great dance numbers, especially the festive dance number for the Simran party, the girl who won the beauty contest ... it's very colorful, well done and even fun, and it's completely lost in this waste. terrible movie. I'd rather look at the old Ramsay brothers movie than this piece, although someone has found that they don't usually need to be done, which is a crime in itself. But not as big a crime as this movie. I took one to see this team, so take my advice, don't worry. 2 out of 10.
