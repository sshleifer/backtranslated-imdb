"Wes Craven presents" the film since 1995, directed by Joe Clayton and starring Lance Henriksen. The group of scientists rescues the dead man they find in the desert of their desert government by injecting it with their experimental virus, of course, one of their colleagues goes overboard and the virus makes a person close to an unstoppable monster where they are inside. Lance Henriksen plays a morally offended scientist who leaves the project before that, but returns after the aid measure to save the man (mutation before the unstoppable death mechanism). <br /> <br /> When deciding to combine two trips, he will bring his family with him (they will go after the holidays) and continue to let them enter the facility of the ultimate secret government, placing them right in the middle of chaos. If you can't say it, it will rely on the observer to work with it and leave some small (see: big and blatant) details. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, watch out for a bit of pleasure. Note: Outpost is commonly known as "Mind Ripper"
