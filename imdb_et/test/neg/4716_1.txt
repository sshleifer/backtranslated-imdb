I swear I've never seen a bad movie like Half Caste. Not only because it doesn't make sense, there is a huge egolatry and self-confidence that makes me dress. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Apocada (Apocadal in Spanish is similar to "apocado", which means "out of life and happiness") makes a man's army movie here, I thought he was Sam Raimi or the guys who led Blair witch project. This is a Blair Kittie project that has an expensive little budget. <br /> <br /> The story of a couple of American filmmakers who go to Africa to make a semi-film documentary is simply pointless. Filming, adding high-speed frames with slow-motion frames, just makes stomachs more than stupid lines (which hell is what is Bestiality?) Or flat performances. By the way, I don't think it's cast (or box?) It's American, they all see me Europeans. <br /> <br /> To finish this, just say that the filmmakers made smart moves. They put the wrong prize (like the most original film) and the nice cover (in Spain, the cover had a negative image with a half-box), so I feel unhappy because I can't reclaim my 14 euros.
