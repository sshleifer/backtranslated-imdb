Kissing Bandit was the third and final film featuring Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson in MGM. The first two were anchors that were bigger and this happened in Brooklyn. And both Sinatras and Grayson disappeared and disappeared. I think the third time is magic. <br /> <br /> Maybe romance, but definitely not a screen image. In her forties, Sinatra plays a torpedo trousers again this time with a nice little slogan. Portering in the territory of Tyrone Power, housed in Zorro Mark, Sinatra's son, who was the owner of the hotel and the night at The Kissing Bandit, plays. She has gone and left for education in California and has come back to take her father's place, but only in the hotel business. And where he is studying hotel business, Boston. <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the father's former gang members who have grown up as a little old and in a pair led by J. Carrol Naish want him to lead the gang again. But Frank hasn't just finished legal life. But he makes a good impression of Governor's daughter Kathryn Grayson. <br /> <br /> Somebody has to have Sinatra in MGM, after he has been impressed by bad reviews of Bells. Frank is a part that fits better with Red Skelton. But because it was musical, I think MGM's brain believed that Kathryn Grayson had to sing a co-star. <br /> <br /> In fact, the best number in the movie for him is love for you. Find it. Also, Ricardo Montalban, Ann Miller and Cyd Charisse are doing a dance job that is great. Frank's songs are nice, but nothing remarkable. <br /> <br /> In later years, Sinatra would have won The Kissing Bandit's reputation and good cause.
