Rolling Vampires?! Sorry, but even for the 80s it is just too harsh to be far scary ... You can apologize for the original pair of chips because it was parody for old movies and TV shows, but it has been done once so the sequel was needed be a little less camp, not even more extreme! In addition, the first film, Chris Sarandon, was a man who could even make discotheques for random knits, seductive! - that it wasn't very much so nothing happened that happened, it just seemed silly. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me only once when I was 7 years old, but then I was already a big fan of the original, which I remember was nasty. For me, Fright Night is not a sequel, but a sticky scam that does not deserve evaluation.
