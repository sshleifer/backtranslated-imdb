I walked to Blockbuster to see some good old fashion films. So I looked around until the film got my attention, because the cover had a big bold message SANDRA BULLOCK. Action movie with Sandra Bullock and it's rated R! YAY! Although I testify that I prefer him in comedy, but if it is something like "speed", then I was sold. Unfortunately, Sandra is not really in this film, her role is small: "Panicky's kidnapped girlfriend" (She is in fifth place with actors carrying Jeebus tremors). so much) Sandra is the only living person in this movie, everyone else can be a Zombie B-Horror Flick. This movie deceived me, saying Sandra was leading. . . I fell like a Biff from "Back to the Future" when Marty screams: "WHAT IS THIS. God, I wish I looked at it instead. <br /> <br /> Sandra is the only bright side of this movie, every time she's on the camera, it's like she's strokes and punishes "CLEAR!" to get these movies, but it's straight lines no matter how hard he tries. More about Sandra later. . . <br /> <br /> The film is boring. Very empty. Think of Dullt's moment in your life and imagine you live 110 minutes after that moment (this is the movie for me). This film makes Gun Fights and Bullet time somewhat boring, so bored that Elephant Tranquilizers are ashamed. And this idea of ​​the movie from Bullet Time is a close-up of AK that captures you as the protruding hats, which are the second second of your life, when it slowly dumps. And I knew I was watching a bad movie because I found myself fast back and forth "ACTIVITIES!" Content? . . . was there a plot? Music? . . . even during the 1980s the standards are bad, but at least this is one thing that awoke me. Acting? Sandra Bullock was good and. . . ummm. . . move on. Is it good because it's rated R? No, unless R stands for Ridicules snooze fest. <br /> <br /> And this is really an 80s cliché when the movie opens up in the city (swinging guitar stops or power palette) and ends with a gun fight in a gloomy factory equipped with steel sidewalks and various pipes. Both movies match. At least this film confirms what era it was not necessary because Sandra's hair cried in the 1980s !!!! And the movie can really be ham fisted when you look at an assassin killer killing fun in the bathroom and stuff your body box, which you answer sadly saying: "This is probably the most activity that bad juice ever got." Another Hammy moment is when some-Secret-Agent-Dude affirms the crowd and apparently this movie thinks people are jumping into the air and falling to the ground when they die. All of this scene was ditty of Mario's death, or maybe Contra's sound effects, but Nintendo could complain. <br /> <br /> And this is sad when the main hero of this movie hangs from other better movie shows. Before the big pistol scene, a Da hero who is standing in a boxing ring ("Rocky"?), Playing a leather fedor (not "Indiana Jones") who has behind him malicious spotlights (Terminator before you own a T-1000) is really what sad, it is that people on Youtube or Dailymotion can shoot better quality videos (not the least of a nasty webcam), this movie. I'm serious, most of the videos recorded with poor sound and blurry images are more entertaining than this movie. I can't even call this movie by that name because it's a very name that brings back horrible memories of watching this cruel and unusual punishment (a terrible violation of human rights!) The only bright spot in this dark sorrow is Sandra's career, which started with this film. But oh Sandra. . . Why did you have to be in such a horror? The pay was better. The DVD also has a small backdrop for Sandra as an extra, we saw how he is the only one in the movie to finally be holding the house. What explains why this movie uses its name under the name of unsuspecting movie fans, Crafty little critter. <br /> <br /> I don't have much experience with bad movies, but I know BAD when I see it. I can descend back to "Mazes and Monsters" with a good old campy Bruce Willis comedy. But even Bruce can't make me happy after that movie. I haven't seen any Ed Wood or Uwe Boll yet, but I think I'm now for them. Because I can't even understand the film worse. . . "GAG". . . "Hangmen". . .
