The beginning of the film is promising. When Jeanne Pollet (Anna Mouglalis) hears the event that happened on her birthday, which makes her a daughter of the famous pianist Andr√© Polonski (Jacques Dutrone), she decided to find out if this is true or not and give the fact that He also plays the piano, it is not a distant idea. Jeanne meets Andra and her husband "Mika" with Muller (Isabelle Huppert) and their son and discover the fact that there are so many secrets in this family. <br /> <br /> O.K. we have seen it before and this has been done in a more interesting way than here. The character of "Mika" Muller has left us unaware of his motives for his actions and he is not interesting enough to take care of him. The piano scenes see the fake, and the whole piano base does not add anything to the character's perception, but makes the movie longer if it should have been in the first place. <br /> <br /> In short, very disappointing, Chabrol can do better
