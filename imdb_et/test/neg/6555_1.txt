I told my friend of my time when my grandfather actually chose this terrifying strap so we could see one night in the theater. He didn't choose another one! It was so bad! Anyway, my friend told me that his father wrote about this garbage. I thought he was joking. It turns out he was serious. He had never seen it and he said he stopped his father's written career quickly. I told him he didn't waste his time. But if he really broke and looked at it, he would see a fist in a minute, why it ended his father's day as a writer. I mean, even in the 1980s, this mess is bad under the description. I mean, Joe Frazier, how terrible Tucker? And why in the world should two police take care of a ghost house? And a movie poster? The ghost where his tongue sounded? What is this? Nothing makes sense. Well, I told my friend that this mess did not stop not only his father's career, but he finished all the careers involved. Or at least none of them have ever been completely restored to a movie of such garbage. Let's just say I'm ever laughing at my friend, revealing to me that his father was the writer of this movie! That alone should tell you how bad it is!
