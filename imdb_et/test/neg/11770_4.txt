I think my biggest mistake was to look at this '95 Piranha 'back and forth with the original Joe Dante '78. I did the same with "The Omen" last week. Strangely enough, looking at the remake immediately after the '76 original, for a variety of reasons, I proved quite a few versions of the 2006 version. <br /> <br /> But this approach is behind the '95 Piranha version. This increased the fact that it is actually less of a picture. Basically, the '95 version is more or less exactly the same movie, because it speaks the same story and follows it practically by the scene image (only the character and military intervention of Barabara Steele was written out). But cinema was not so good. Operation was also worse. Especially Alexandra Paul (character of Heather Menzies) showed me again what is a terrible actor. Bradford Dillman (since 78) had his Charlton Heston way of acting, which was fun, while in the '95 version, William Katt did a good job because William Katt. So I didn't really want him. But the whole cast is pretty much worse and the only worthwhile event was marking James Karen ("Returning Living Deaths", Part 1 and Part 2). John Carl Buechler's make-up effects are not as clean as Rob Bottin's. There were some rings with musical results, but Pino Donaggio's score was much more memorable in the original. So all these shortcomings really seemed to look again at the original as part of this double counting. <br /> <br /> As Scott P. Levy's remake follows Dante's original, I think it's fun enough even though he didn't have a meaningful Dante original. But what really didn't like the Levy version is that a lot of the first movie was used during the piranha attack scenes. I don't like filmmakers doing it (and I'm not talking about using video material for return or other legitimate reasons). I mean, if you don't have a budget (or imagination) to come to the newly-released material, then, after Pete, don't make the freakin 'remake. But Roger Corman gave this (cheaper) remake, so I think I shouldn't be all surprised to recycle the materials. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch "Piranha", make sure it's been a while since you've seen the original. Maybe you enjoy this remake a little more. And yes, yes, this cool little stop-motion creature that originated from the original is nowhere to be found in this movie. But even worse, there is no female nudity (the original really had quite a few shots) and this blonde-girl who opened the scene accidentally pulled her underwear away when she removed her jeans!). Numbers because this '95 version was made for TV.
