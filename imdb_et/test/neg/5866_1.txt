The man I had started, all this episode of comics, stories, script, animation is for me from Stups, Dummes and the most annoying cartoon that Walt Disney Television has ever created and MADE, Im so glad to both Toon Disney (2006) and Disney Channel, to stop aeration in the US since May 2008. Believe me, it's a wise choice to skip this cartoon when you watch it. I'm not saying I'm not warning you. <br /> <br /> Your boring and downward boring, down-to-right, I wish and pray I've never seen this Cartoon Buzz anniversary. If I could remove the part of my brain that remembers watching it, yes, it was and it was bad.
