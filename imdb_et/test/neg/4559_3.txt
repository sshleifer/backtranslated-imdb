Ugghhh !!! This is precisely the kind of pre-code film that might mislead viewers that films of this time period are bad - and they're not - just this movie is terrible. Terrible, because although the movie is trying to be a "hip" and "adult", it is so hopelessly old-fashioned, boring and hockey that I was laughing at the movie or just falling asleep! At least, it's a unique combination. <br /> <br /> So why did I hate that? Well, the film is incredibly weak, but it has no style and the film is meant to shock, but there is no fineness and takes too many ridiculous turns to be credible. The film starts with a clich√© - a golden whore. Dorothy Mackaill is a prostitute and she seems to accidentally kill a man! Soon after his escape, he meets an old boy who asks for his marriage (he doesn't know his profession). Looking at this man's innate goodness, he decides to change his life and stop living wildlife. It's hard when it hides the fancy Caribbean island. Here alone, and waiting for the man to return, there's nothing to do and the place is infected with super-horny and totally unpleasant men. In fact, this part of the movie is so empty that the audience may have a hard time concentrating. The men on the island are so burnt because of the presence of Mackaill that they are permanently on the verge of rape, but must be rejected because he is no longer such a girl. To be honest, I got all these slender scenes very tired - there is just too much eye rolling and tongue seam to make it look something other than a very bad film. And looking at all these ugly hornbills, it was just annoying and stupid. <br /> <br /> Wait ... it gets much worse. The man he wanted to kill appears in this tiny island (what are the probabilities?!) And he is also trying to rape him. But he must not be exhausted and he will be fired to save his new found virtue. If the jury on the island justifies her, she runs into court and lies - saying she wants to kill the man and that it was intentional (?), Because even if he is acquitted, he knows the evil prison. with him when he is sent to prison for possession of a weapon. Considering that the prison itself gave him a weapon to set him up, he felt intrusive in court and said he was guilty. Why didn't he just tell them the twisted plan of the prison? He allegedly did so to maintain his virtue, but to admit that someone is being killed, so people think you are a virgin! So, in order to avoid a short prison sentence (and again the risk of rape), he does not believe in the court that he is trying to force him (imprisonment has allowed him to be raped) when he is locked). And just before he gets to the campsite (to prevent rape), the boy appears in time to send him out and the credit rolls. <br /> <br /> The potential situation and coincidences are great - so often the movie is just stupid. Combining this with all sexual enthusiasm, it creates a film's bad and foolish confusion, which only complains of pre-code film against the toughest fans. Everyone else, be careful, it's very sticky from start to finish and stupid!
