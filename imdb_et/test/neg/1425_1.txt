Not from the "8 heads duffel" and "as high" previews <br /> <br /> did I laugh so little that filmmakers thought they would be hysterical <br /> <br />. br /> <br /> Jerry Lewis is the world's richest person. He has been rejected by the army as 4-F <br /> <br /> and decides to use his money to raise his army - <br /> <br /> about half a dozen. He then embodies the Nazi commander in Italy and finally tries to kill Hitler. This is a description of a weak plot. <br /> <br /> This movie is as funny as a heart attack. This movie makes "Hogan <br /> <br /> heroes" of Shakespeare. If "men" "men" really wanted to lose their money, they would have had to show this movie <br /> <br />. I can't stress how bad this is. <br /> <br /> The Lewis direction consists of two different cameras that shoot the <br /> <br /> action from two different angles and then edit them together. Sitcom's direction works on television, but here's an obvious attempt to deceive the audience. He finishes most of his <br /> <br /> scenes by still shooting as if he gave the viewer a double <br /> <br /> pre-sewn setting. I spent most of the <br /> <br /> movie in the abdominal area, accompanied by a severe flatulence. <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Lewis, director and producer, sets the film in 1943, but makes an attempt to use the period costumes or kits for <br /> <br />. Everyone wears the last style and the last interior ... in 1970. <br /> <br /> Casting goes missing because Lewis goes to his patented tangent, <br /> <br /> which lasts as long as a major operation and is as painful as watching. When Lewis becomes a Nazi commander, he spends the last half on a film that screams at the top of his lungs, so that he's terrible so he smells good. Try to bring <br /> <br /> at the beginning. <br /> <br /> The ultimate embarrassing blow is Lewis and his crowns trying to <br /> <br /> place Japan. They wear eye teeth, eyes and speak funny accent. It can be one of the most serious racist events since the internals certificates. I was the <br /> <br /> jaw that Lewis did all this thing, but it put me over the edge. Check out Kaye Ballard's very tasteless scene where he tries to try suicide again and again. <br /> <br /> "Star Trek" George Take has two small scenes, then wisely <br /> <br /> fall out of the picture. It's less ridiculous than Mel Brooks' last <br /> <br /> three movies. There is nothing more sad than watching. <br /> <br /> The previously seized comedian screwed the project so terribly that you feel ashamed of them. Jim Carrey learned that "The <br /> <br /> Majestic", but Jerry Lewis still appears on television with the same / same <br /> <br /> while pulling the same failed schtick. I'm sorry for him. <br /> <br /> "What's the way ahead?" it is cheap, uncomfortable, offensive and stupid. <br /> <br /> I feel all the participants and everyone who has to suffer. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend it. <br /> <br /> Although it's rated (G), it includes some physical violence, some weapons <br /> <br /> and some adult situations. If your child has an interest in <br /> <br /> see it, get professional help. <br /> <br />
