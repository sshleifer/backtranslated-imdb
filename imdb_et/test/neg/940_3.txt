I didn't feel that movie that it was quite tiring and normal. The plot's line was interesting, a boy who created his college and wore hundreds of children, but laughs were little and far away. The jokes were not really funny and I didn't throw the gut in any scene. The characters were not intriguing and I didn't know any of them, even a brown fat boy who tried to get into a frat group. It was a good first watch, but it didn't hit me and didn't recommend it. Compared to other films of the same genre, American Pie is simply cruel, because there is a film that was ridiculous. This ACCEPTED couldn't smile!
