I wish I could use a time machine to jump back to the moment I watched this movie and see other plans. I saw a free screening of A Sound of Thunder so I can't complain about that price, but I wish I could pay my 103 minutes back. The operation was mediocre and the special effects were regrettable. People should not make films about dinosaurs unless they can afford prehistoric beings to look as good or better than Jurassic Park. Spielberg broke us. Edward Burns as Travis Ryer was the only rescue arm in the film. I noticed that women under the age of 18 rated the film as the highest, and the only explanation is that they have always burned Burns. The whole length of 103 minutes. This film should have lasted about 80 minutes. It just pulled on and on. Don't waste your time or money on this far flicked flick.
