I read the reviews of this movie and they were generally pretty good, so I thought I should see it. I am a big francophile and art lover, but I believe that this is another case where critics do something "artistic" or "intellectual" into something that is not. I'm blunt: it contains scenes of sexual perversion that I never wanted to see. Obviously, the piano teacher has some important psychological problems, but I didn't want to see them so graphically. The film is essentially nasty. I mean, when I saw the Requiem for a dream, the last scene I pushed back with Jennifer Connelly, but it was nowhere near the disgust and exclusion I felt during this movie.
