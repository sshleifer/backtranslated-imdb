This "space fragment" was kind of stupid. I think it was supposed to be a shocking unexpected end, but IMHO was just a huge drop. Joseph Campanella and other parties involved in the land are doing an excellent job; their performances do not happen to such a stupid end. The end result of this end would have been the result of any inspection by the manufacturers. Another comment here is not correct, the language of the cheek vignettes came only in the second season, this thing had to be taken seriously! Manufacturers and writers could have been a bit more creative when the end ended the rest of the episode justice.
