I think I went to watch the same movie as everyone else. This movie was terrible. I am a fan of all 3 gentelmen groups and I have always respected the authors' originality, even though the 3rd format changed. entering the real world saw this movie more than the last hero. There were about 5 moments in the movie, which was easy to hit, but the rest of the time I wanted it to end. It would have been better than a 10-minute short DVD. It was more of an explanation of what they were going to do, and it seemed that some writers disagreed with the fate of the characters and they joked about it. for the first 30 minutes he is killed. <br /> <br /> If your gentleman's true fan, who can stay fresh, hates this movie. If you look at it only if there was nothing better on the TV, I love it. <br /> <br /> someone back to me!
