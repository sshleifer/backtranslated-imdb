I'm fans, especially Scream 1-3, but it's just one kill after another. To my astonishment: Part II is much better and you get the first part of the story together! So do not waste time on it and move to the right part II, you will not regret that it causes the 2nd part to really PLOT and is quite spontaneous. Part One: 1 out of 10 second parts: 4 out of 10
