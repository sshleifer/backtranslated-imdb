It was by far the worst film I've ever seen. And this is compared to Alexander, Fortress 2 and the new world. In the first ten minutes, I changed my wide screen zoom because the actors seemed to be out of the screen. I didn't think it was possible to make such a bad movie that day and age, I was wrong. When writing this message, I have been thinking of a good reason to buy this movie. The joke is Xas. I blame the lady for choosing it, thanks to the babe. <br /> <br /> Watch out ....... A real shocker all around !!!!!!
