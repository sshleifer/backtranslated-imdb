Evan Almighty continues the mainstream Bruce Almighty franchise, this time with a journalist who turned in the middle of Buffalo, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell). A completely harmless (and not even really suspicious) person, God (Morgan Freeman) decides to reach Baxter some effort to illustrate ... the importance of mutual goodness so that Baxter can "change the world" (aka, pay it further). Think of Evan Almighty as a healthy derivative of "Distinguished Gentlemen". Baxter is not a con, but his colleague, Congressman Long (John Goodman) wants his undeniable support for a bill that is harmful to the environment. And with good meaning, Baxter, knowing the importance of networks and visibility, is ready to support him. In addition, the new job involves greater responsibility, and Baxter is in some ways frightened that he did not spend enough time with his family. So God decides to give Evan Baxter some instructions, forcing him to become today's Noah. His commandments: You build a ship. Except, if Baxter 's "beard" beard can be slightly humorous, it does not seem that the whole thing that changes to the top of the film is much clearer. (SPOILERS: if the "flood" does not kill any population, then what was the calling of places ... or at least those that probably were not in the Virginia area? Or more importantly, all Baxter had to realize that Long's projects had deteriorated their quality , why did he have to build a ship?). <br /> <br /> So, while such a comedy does not have to be a hysterical laugh, it was certainly a lot less enjoyable because it was covered with too many Homiiles (and not all with Morgan Freeman) and what seemed to be meant for epic events for film.
