Okay, let's see ... a beautiful young stranger is a new city and walks on the local boardwalk. She meets a beautiful girl, meets the dreadful leader of a young hip vampire club in the local hip, dares to follow them in this cave, gets into a conflict with a beautiful girl, an epic fight ... I think even some carnival music is the same. (Do you have to pay royalties for taking movie samples?) Even the end of this stinkbomb is lost to the boys. Make-up is down for par, even for a low-budget thriller, are the characters one-dimensional and exactly how much "Oh, I had this terrible experience" for teen scenes one film needs? Humor is flat and stupid, and everything else is unfortunately predictable. Yawn. <br /> <br /> The only crappy thing about this turkey is the follow-up promise (threat), which is the hope that each country's distributor will steer the bet.
