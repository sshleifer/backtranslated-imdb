If I think your "palabra", will you let me pass? - asks William Geld, Tim Robbins, who will continue to act if they tell him a fantastic joke and he is trying not to laugh. <br /> <br /> He is trying to get out of the restricted area. The woman who stopped her continues blabbering: - Your "palabra" is Carrefour. <br /> <br /> - How did you know? - The woman asks, surprised. He answers in the name of wisdom: - I heard you did not speak. : / <br /> <br /> Yes, it defines the movie. That's exactly. It doesn't matter if Carrefour is a "road connection" in French, or if the future is cold bureaucratic and confuses languages. Or if Samantha Morton has nothing, anything Spanish (Maria Gonzalez is her name in the movie) with her Irish, Scotish, no matter what it is. <br /> <br /> It's boring and boring. If you believe there are several symbolism, then you will buy the most bizarre, inferior love relationship that is set in the future, which may be within seven seconds. I can guess this movie palabra: it's "painful".
