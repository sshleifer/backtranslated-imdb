Don't make a mistake, high school Bigshot is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> High School Bigshot is about a geek who makes a plan to get rich and become a girl. But she goes wrong and, of course, the end of the movie with another person ends up dead, including the girl. <br /> <br /> The story of morality is all women. is wealth. For our men, we should just agree that we either "have" or "we don't have it"! <br /> <br /> I can easily see how this movie can be rated 1, but it is higher than the worst movies. The actors are not totally terrible and the production values ​​are not very terrible. All this is a bad movie and it is not possible to watch it for many reasons. If you of course need to torture yourself, check out the MST version. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe 1.5 / 10)
