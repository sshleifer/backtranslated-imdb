I knew it would be a bad movie when I rented it, but I was hoping for a good bad movie. Well, it was fun to make a fun endless sand break by eating camel manure (well, actually eggplant) and a strange grimace that I thought was about five participants. The DVD needs a director comment so I can find out what he was thinking ... or if he was at all. I can't believe they actually went to England, Austria and wherever they were filmed ... could have done everything. It would have been better if they could get her naked. Is the film's best line? "He's waiting for his innovations." "Yes, still waiting". Now that WUN FUNNY! If someone had more than 3 pages of dialogue (out of the narrator ... SHUT UP ALREADY), I will look at it again.
