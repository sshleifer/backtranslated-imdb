Don't do me wrong: I enjoy art-house movies, low-budget pictures, character research and foreign films. Unfortunately, I couldn't enjoy it - the speed of the glacier, the complete absence of a plot, and the signs that you can't hate enough, but you can't enjoy it enough. <br /> <br /> Me, Distant was like looking at the reality show flooring - all scenes that were considered too uninteresting and that didn't usually make the final paragraph were the only scenes. A camera in my apartment with two friends around a couple of hours around is not an interesting movie. the first word is about credit) can be done for work (remember 2001), but for me there is something else that is needed to bring me. <br /> <br /> If you are an observer who can sit through the movie and be happy with the film's analysis, it may work for you. However, if you are someone who decides to relax, extend your mind or watch entertainment, you should probably look elsewhere.
