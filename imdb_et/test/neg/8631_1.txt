It's a scary movie ever made in Hollywood. This is a deterrent story of how to take European masterpieces and suck on it until it is dry like a basket of insect on the window sill. Frightening because it shows how the Hollywood world really works: the unknown money that starts somewhere. This makes me wonder how many great movies my memory corridors could have, if the Hollywood process hadn't brought them to a finished mediocrity. Call for the children murdered! See Spoorloo or read the Golden Egg as you dare, because they will come back forever in your empty moments of life: when you walk down the street and see a "missing" poster; for conventional parking lots; when you hear the Tour De France radio; and especially if you think "what's wrong?" wearing a sock that has a hole in it on a perfectly normal day. <br /> <br /> If I just give it to zero.
