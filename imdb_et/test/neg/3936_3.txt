I saw this movie flying from Boston to Boston and reminded me of flat food: general, tasteless, and hidden. French cinema seems to have lost its foundation today and is a good example of how a dirty script can destroy great actors. Some may find that the "playfulness" of the script is in line with the dictates of the postmodernism of the euro, but the whole project seems to be post-mortem rather than the death of the golden years of Euro-cinema and the truly fabulous talents --- one here is unclear to Bunuel but without charm or meaning .
