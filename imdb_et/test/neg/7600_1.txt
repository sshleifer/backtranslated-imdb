Beethovan lives up is a very bad film. In my world history class, our teacher had a look at this film and Amadeus so we can compare these two composers. We first looked at Amadeus and it was a very good movie, but when he looked at that movie right after that, I couldn't see it. Actress was terrible, costumes were ugly (little boys were especially ugly and girls) and cinematography was a z-class. My friend compared it to a home video without displaying the date in the lower right corner. I understand that this was T.V. from Canada. the film and probably cost $ 10, but please, they could have done better. I've seen some good T.V. movie, but it wasn't one of them. The biggest thing I do not understand is why my world history class just couldn't love an immortal loved one or see anything. How can Beethovan be compared to composers when they are given the life of Amadeus, Mozart and Beethoven? This cannot be done if it is a Beethoven film selection. I give Amadeus A (out of 10 out of 10) when someone cares, but Beethovan lives on the upper floor F (1 out of 10).
