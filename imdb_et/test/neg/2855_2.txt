This movie is just stupid. Do not bother looking at it; believe me, you're better. <br /> <br /> A long and short plot: The defense attorney represents the man who murdered his son and other children. Protecting her, she touches Pinnochio's wooden doll. She takes the doll home. Pinnochio is in possession and killing people. <br /> <br /> This movie moves very slowly only to such a weak end. The plot is very bad and Dennis Michael Tenney's musical score is pathetic. The story written by Kevin S. Tenney is simply pointless and creates NO horror and fear. It's far from working on demons and witches, which are decent trips, but nothing is written at home. His leadership is OK, but with such a bad story no one could have made this movie. <br /> <br /> To sum up: 2 out of ten, perhaps bland, the most boring movie I've seen all year round.
