I appeared extra and had a position as a journalist covering "The Dain Curse". My participation was during the film segments that were filmed in Jim Thorpe, Pa. (Jim Thorpe was also one of the places in the 1969 film "The Molly Maguires"). I reported to Emmaus Free Press the "action" where I was a 1978-80 editor (the paper stopped publishing in the 1990s). I recall how much attention has been paid to the details of periodic costumes, cars, etc. Jim Thorpe's modern asphalted streets were covered with gravel to mimic the southern city of the 1920s. At that time, I interviewed the producer and spoke to the director within a short time of change; I couldn't interview James Coburn, which was always a big disappointment. I can see a bit of a street picture with a hat and a twin jacket. The manufacturer asked me to "jump" and it was a real thrill. I still have a collection of black and white photos that I did in newspaper production. One day they may be interested in a movie / television historian. - Lou Varricchio
