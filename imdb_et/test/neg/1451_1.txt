I was watching this movie for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and it was a pretty boring, unforgettable movie I ever saw. First of all, Matthew Modine is a terrible actor and has destroyed most of the film, and the plot is just too silly. The only reason this film was filmed was because of Alec Baldwin, and his character was lost quite quickly. If you're not a fan of Michelle Phiffer, you should avoid this movie like a plague. Many people can't praise this movie, but I just can't understand what people find so terrible. If it were to be black humor, which makes this movie so terrible, then I think that these days, comedy can be passed on.
