Ear-sharing film, an almost old-fashioned screwball game designed to show the star of Madonna's comedic attributes. He really goes to the far-reaching limb, playing here a more alive password, trying to prove he was looted against murder (the body was found in his car's trunk after he was red light ... big laughs). After the energetic animated credit queue - which is much more fun than the rest of the picture - we have nothing to look at, but Madonna's black mascara and red lips are broken by platinum hair and pale complexion. What else? Griffin Dunne seems to be defeated by playing Maddy's goalkeeper, while the losers supporting poor choices are fighting to laugh with the evil dialogue. This is an unfortunate return to the talent of director James Foley, who unacceptably allows his star to ride in the enthusiasm of nutty films of the 1930s (but even Katharine Hepburn's "Bringing Up Baby" had a human side). Empty. * from ****
