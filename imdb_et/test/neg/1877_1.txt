I live in a city in Mexico, so I have to wear trailers for every trash that comes from all of those stupid Mexican filmmakers. Do you want to admire the Mexican guy for great movies? Look at something by Guillermo del Toro (especially The Devil's Backbone) or perhaps Alfonso Cuar√≥n (although I really don't like his films, but I respect them). <br /> <br /> Mexican filmmakers often produce the most sharp eternal trash cans (Por la Libre, El Segundo Aire, American visa), but it is one of the lowest points in Mexican films ever. If you respect your brain, please avoid this ****. It would be wiser to watch some wedding video or watch Britney's reality show. This movie has more IQ than everyone.
