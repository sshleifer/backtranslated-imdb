Traceable, but pretty terrible. How shocking it was the last Gregory La Cava last guiding credit! Even in his better-known roles, I don't care about Gene Kelly. It seems to me that it is secret, hostile and confident. Here, along with a small actor like Marie Wilson, she showed these pot qualities. <br /> <br /> Marie Wilson, who plays the heir to a military man, is extremely difficult and uncomfortable. The actors seem to have worked hard to get a picture of the hard, unpleasant core, and they do it well. <br /> <br /> An unknown-all-butler is probably meant to be funny, but it seems to be an extended riff of prissy bits for which Franklin Pangborn was famous (and where, despite stereotypes, he was generally funny - unlike the guy.) ) Phyllis Thaxter is quite less attractive from a rather underdeveloped second plot.
