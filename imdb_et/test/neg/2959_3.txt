Based on a true story of two young Americans who sold nationwide secrets to the Soviet Union during the Cold War, "Falcon and Snowman" want to be as tense as philosophical and winds fall on both departments. It's less Carré than the one who cares. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton celebrates a former seminar with Christopher Boyce, against Watergate and the middle class around him, which is probably the wrong man to hire. Spy satellites for CIA. Sean Penn plays his drug ball Daulton Lee, who makes himself a Boyce courier by delivering secret files to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico. The amazing sin-jazz score, the lack of sympathy or emotional attachment to everyone, and the many scenes in which men get angry in every room, are usually dead, which could be a decent thrill of moral dilemma. Penn movie despite another bill; his character talks to the Russians with turkey, while Hutton plays with his pet. Hutton looks like they woke him up in five minutes before they called "action". With a penny, it's a crapshoot, whether you're getting a great performance or a top spot. Here's a bit of both, but more of the last, especially on the other side when Lee turns coke into heroin. She swells. She slips. She runs with Russian embassy parties. She gets phonebooks. He spits himself in the mirror, the big boy he was supposed to keep on the paparazzi. "I don't know who my friends are!" he cries. It's tiring to just look at her. <br /> <br /> Penn seems to have modeled Lee somewhat of Dustin Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo on "Midnight Cowboy". John Schlesinger directed both the movie and Midnight Cowboy, but he seems to have had another Hoffman movie, The Graduate, that throws up after Boyce and Lee's pool scene, trying to decide how to live their life in their gold-plated cage. Too bad someone did not recommend plastic. <br /> <br /> From open frames, American movie newsletter to Boyce and his tape, Falcon makes it clear that this is a message, although the message itself is far from clear, probably because characters are never focused. Should Boyce be an idealist? Or is he just a mercenary? Hutton and Schlesinger do not seem to know what makes us harder. Meanwhile, the mortgages interrupt pairs of scenes with their families and friends, with the opportunity to create some tension, as Boyce steals the secret "Black Vault" documents in which he works or Lee plays with Russians. This is a story that Schlesinger is interesting, but it is the least interesting aspect for us. <br /> <br /> Good thing: it's interesting to see a movie that works in the early 1970s, referring to Maria. Muldaur and Tang. Dorian Harewood, a memorable "Full Metal Jacket", is in turn pleasing to Boyce's paranoid colleague Gene, who shows Boyce how to make a margarine shredder, but has serious "Nami issues under his solo appearance. Macon McCalman also has in a completely different way than a no-nonsense boss who gives Boyce his great security. David Suchet, an officer working with the Russian embassy, ​​who deals with Lee, offers an exciting threat and friendliness. <br /> <br /> But "Falcon and Snowman "stands or falls on the question of two headlines, and neither the participants nor Schlesinger can find many answers. Worse still, more than two hours of their alternation in a forest and catatonic company do not really want answers. You want these credits to roll.
