Alexandra Ripley wrote a horrible sequel to Margaret Mitchell's 1930s masterpiece. Margaret Mitchell's heirs sold out their rights and, for the big bucks, Alexandra Ripley promised to write the spam even worse than Barbara Cortland's novels. I was a big fan of Margaret Mitchells's book, and Alexandra Ripley's fake order was simply written for money. <br /> <br /> Although I always admired Joanne Kilmer's and Timothy Dalton's ability to act, it's really a terrible movie. The script is terrible and full of clich√©s. Ann Margarets came when Belle Watling is so terrible that she wanted to hit. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth seeing in the movie is Sean Bean, who gives a bravura presentation in sexy, wild - Lord Fenton. The performance of Sean Bean is "Man Hate Hate" and represents a dangerous sex symbol. <br /> <br /> But Sean Bean is still in the first half of the movie, so you have to torture in spite of the incredibly long 6-hour movie that has a nasty script. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money on this movie if you are not a Sean Bean fan and just watch it for your great performance.
