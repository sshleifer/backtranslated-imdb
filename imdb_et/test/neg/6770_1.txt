I got this screening at the True / False Documentary Festival in Columbia, Missouri, and was quite disappointed. I had been waiting for a cool documentary about protest and activism surrounding the RNC, but what I got was largely a faulty, ill-acted, fictitious, conspiracy, poorly knit story. I heard it in a new documentary, "combining both real and false", but I was expecting a fictional style designed to create a better personification and unity of real interviews, but it was more of a formidable plot of conspiracy theory on TV. <br /> <br /> The general action is terrible, except for Rossario, which is not surprising given that the director had been told in the screening that most of the leading figures did not have training, his excuse is he wanted them to be real . Here's a hint, real people can't act, but actors can usually act in real life. <br /> <br /> It wouldn't be so outrageous if it wasn't obvious how sharp it was for this very radical conspiracy theory throughout the movie, it's especially hysterical when we get a scene where the director came and starts ridiculously foolish theories and secret days about. The film also does a good job of ridiculously stereotyping each role, trying to romanticize these street activists and capture a great "good" or "bad" for each character. <br /> <br /> Skip it, maybe find a nice real documentary /
