Not me. If it had come, I could beat the dog breed and that's why this movie doesn't work for me. If it were against an alien or Jason. Or ... Hell, I know ... WHAT ALL HORRORI MOVIE ANTAGON is, then there is no competition and I would have given my ass by denying divine intervention. The fear film works because it puts people in a being, a human, a creature, a unit, anything that is more powerful or more inventive or more intelligent than humans, and then people think "well when it happened to me" and they fear - and that's why it's a horrible horrible idea. I can't imagine being bullied by a dog, so I'm not afraid.
