Shame on the shame of the shame UA / DW you are doing! <br /> <br /> I was terrible. <br /> <br /> Don't take the children to watch this movie. Humor is totally unsuitable for children - and they are boring and frustrated. Certainly * we have all read Theo's wonderful children's book and we definitely have expectations ... but it's a clean trash. Dr. Seuss would be ashamed and would never have given his "thumbs" in such an embarrassing attempt to take advantage of the classic. <br /> <br /> What a hell. <br /> <br /> Spend the money on the book. If you have a copy, buy this book and donate it to toy toys. This movie is not worth the "free" ticket viewing. <br /> <br /> Stick with the book. The version of television cards works well if you want a visual image - save your money ... seriously. Save your money - this is the cable's day of patron saint. <br /> <br /> Shame shame on what they are doing!
