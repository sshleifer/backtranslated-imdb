Let me just give you some tips if you are going to watch this movie to see ten different ways to kill a lot of unlikely characters, then you love this movie because everyone dies out of terrible death out there isn't much else. <br /> <br /> Where should I start: - The characters don't turn to the audience, because none of them are back stories because I didn't feel any connection to them really didn't like any of them, and I was so ill at the end of the movie entrenched dull slip to kill them all (what he did otherwise) <br /> <br /> - acted; I mean, I didn't get it, take an example of an Asian guide, first he spoke of perfect English, after he had drowned his little excursion boat, he somehow got a blue pressure, later he went to the usual English. br /> <br /> - one of the worst end of the horror: (if you call it) after the monster / human mutant kills almost everyone, he kills by the last two idiots or thought! the monster / human thing is finally killed when beauty and geek stick up through their heart / nick (it was hard to say) and probably he died right in front of them (at hand) but later comes back and kills them (wtf) i mean why he just didn't kill them when he was next to them. Arghhhh! I mean, it was just too slow, it was like the writer didn't know where he wanted to go (or he was 80 minutes in a few minutes, so he added some more slow motion to the film so people could get a 80min value 75 Instead of a minute. <br /> <br /> What I didn't get was why they just didn't kill the damn thing when it was unconscious, instead of just walking away like idiots and leaving so it could come back and kill them, the only reason I gave him 4 was because of gore, which was actually the only thing I watched to the end of the movie, so and to see them all, I'm serious)
