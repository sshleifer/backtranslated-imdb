Jeff Fahey has such warning eyes and a funny, insidious smile that every character he plays seems to be weak; that is why it does not really work as its good guys, the audience is just waiting to break its character and start to blow people. Drew Barrymore, who is freshly acclaimed for his "Poison Ivy" role, must make this film just for director Phedon Papamichael (he was "Ivy" operator); playing a character called Daisy Drew (!), he has just come across, which leaves us unaware, but Jeff Fahey and Sean Young (who have not been to the camera at the moment after "Blade Runner"). This meaningless script by Michael Angel relates to a police sketch artist who pulls his wife's face from the testimony of a murder witness, and while this is not a bad idea for the plot, it would be much better for hourly TV series. This cable film is a short inspiration (starting from casting) and shorter surprises. * from ****
