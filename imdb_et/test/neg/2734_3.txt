The script seems to have been wholesale (ahem ahem, cough cough) borrowed from a second movie that includes the use of a self-propelled manned drill. Scene scene, two movies were almost identical. Just a sufficient number of serial numbers that are turned off to prevent this copyright infringement. <br /> <br /> But besides this, I have to say that I found it somewhat fun because I enjoy the deep-ground-in-the-in - movie genre. This is a bit of a stupid side when science goes, but if someone wants to turn their eyes into reality and pretend that nobody notices that there is a scientific gaffe here, this film is almost tolerable. Much better than "Supernova", which was another tremble, that Luke Perry played a leading role in being so stupid, stupid, stupid that nothing could save it. Note to filmmakers: employ someone who knows something about film. This would be a very small part of the film budget, but it would have an overall effect, as it helps to prevent the public from being blamed for doing fool science. <br /> <br /> Production values: almost satisfactory. I've seen much worse than my time. <br /> <br /> A New Idea for Disaster Movies: Instead of always having a happy ending, where the world is rescued, how some things are. a little more realistic, where sometimes even the best efforts are still unsuccessful. Especially when the problem that needs to be solved is prima facie stupidity. Lollus catastrophic films glowing, the heart-warming end rightly justify stupidity, saying, "No matter how terrible the problem is due to the braindead's foolishness, it can be fixed." This is certainly not the case. A self-inflicted disaster would make a miserable end better than a warning story "Don't be so fucking stupid." Should you watch this movie? If you are bored and you have seen everything in the sci-fi section of your local rental store, be sure to not. But don't avoid "Supernova" because I can assure you that you're not bored. It was certainly not one of Luke Perry's best films. That's better. It's not much, but it's better. One dead hoof to be a deep underground genre movie. One dead comb to blur the scenario of another movie in the same genre.
