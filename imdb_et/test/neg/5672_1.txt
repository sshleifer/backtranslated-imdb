Yes, we all know about Dan Schneider's strange little enchantments with young children, and iCarly is no exception. See young girls snatch their toes and stick their tongues on the camera and wear nervous clothes and bikini. Yes, it makes you wonder if these exhibitions were made for teenagers or some older degeneration. In both cases, this show is not as good as Dan Schneiders, as other shows are much better than Amanda Show & Drake and Josh. and when the father is left in the army and their mother has been strangely absent from their lives. Carly has an average spirited friend named Sam and they make a very well-produced, award-winning web show with iCarly with her little school friend Freddie. Episodes deal with their lives at the web event and its surroundings, and their hi jinxis school. who relies heavily and quickly on talking to get his point over and make a strange face. His brother, Spencer, is a somewhat meaningful, dim and eccentric artist, played by Jerry Trainor, who is trying a little harder to be like Jim Carrey and whose comedy style seems to be targeting this young male audience who would like Joey Gladstone's sense of humor. Then Sam Puckett, the unlikely, little, recumbent early morning who needs Jeanette McCurdy's attitude, who clearly carries hair extensions when you see that they disappear and appear again in the scene to the scene. And finally, on the web, Freddie Benson, who shows a nervous operator and technical advisor who has severely crushed Carly, is unlikely to reach him with whom Nathan Kress plays. <br /> <br /> Other secondary characters come and go like Freddies' mother, Carly's grandfather, tedious teachers, and many of their annoying little school friends who shed around. Most comedy is spirited, such as blasting a Lewbert doorman with a gagina, teaching a balloon to a teacher, and a table for selling young girls' cookies. All adults come out as perfect idiots, if the children are all aware and some major characters have no morals. Children, cheating, stealing and violence are all such a children's show created and written by Dan Schneider, yes, it's a children's show! What more young viewers might ask? Well, with Dan Schneider, we can expect young girls to dress in tight clothing and bikini and do some strange things like lingering and eating bananas. <br /> <br /> These are just what the young crowds are feeling and I think no other garbage will shovel Nick into his young crowd. There are always fans that can be seen on the TV, at least it's a little better than most of the jokes have seen the terrible examples of Naked Brothers.
