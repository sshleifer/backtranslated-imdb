I was looking for a documentary of the same journalistic quality as Frontline or "War of War" (Errol Morris). Instead, I was appalled by this low and naive report on a very complicated and disturbing person and his regime: Alberto Fujimori. This movie should be called "Fujimori's Return". The director assumes that he has made a "perfect" film because he is selling both professional and anti-Fujimor factions, if in fact it is a very biased and unprofessional job. The film has a few important facts wrong: <br /> <br /> 1) He uses so-called landslide elections in 1995, when Fujimori was re-elected with 65% of the vote, such as Fujimori's tremendously popular support. But we all know that these are the very organized fruits of electoral fraud. <br /> <br /> 2) The movie says that Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) killed 60,000 people. In fact, the Commission's final report on the truth states that 69,280 deaths were caused by political violence in Peru, of which 33% were caused by SL. This leaves the remaining 67% in the hands of the police, the military and other groups. The fact that he uses the same misleading information Fujimori has used for 10 years is another example of how terrible this film is. <br/> <br /> For every person who has an education in Peruvian politics and history, Fujimori is clearly the perfect manipulator, misleading character and frantic egomania. His regime was very democratic. He's still dangerous to the potatoes. Despite these circumstances, the director promises to tell Fujimor a story. Not just how he wants the camera to be placed, but the narrative and direction of the film is part of his political agenda. He always has the last word. There are no journalistic "cojones", just soft questions and uncontested remarks. Where is Oriana Fallaci when we need her? The director who was interviewed after screening did not hide the fact that Fujimori, his charm and intelligence were impressed by him. Yeah, he's definitely fascinated by it and you can say that when you watch this movie. It is obvious that it is very difficult for him to read many facts that indicate his responsibility for corruption, murder and fraud. He asserted that Fujimori was indeed a "patriot" when, a few moments earlier, one of Peru's leading journalists was very blatant, telling us that Fujimori was above all a "traitor". He said that no bank account "from one dollar" was found on his behalf despite all charges. It was like hearing again the ruthless piece of gang who ruled the country for ten years defending his master. It was a sad moment for the press. <br /> <br /> This film makes injustice in history. This is an insult that the Fujimor regime has lost or unjustly imprisoned hundreds of dead people. No wonder he later admitted that all the Peruvian intellectuals he was friends with made the film for his betrayal. Unfair? The words "opportunistic", "naive" and "denials" come to my mind.
