In the central and best horror strike that deals with the fool, not with the grooves that discover the evil video game (GASP), those who die in the game (DOUBLE GASP) are killed. This movie is a permanent secret of Mystery Gang's "Scooby Doo". I was waiting for them to pull off a mask of one villain. I can handle it for 40 minutes even as a sci-fi movie, but go to all theaters, come to people. The effects were very mediocre, this whole scenario is something regrettable, but Director Uwe Boll, because it would be his cast. As always, video game systems are a great thing that is a glorious power button. I recommend using this average view. * 1/2
