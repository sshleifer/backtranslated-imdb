The problem with this and all Vietnam war films is that they are too inclined. Antiwar films ignore the fact that the vast majority of US soldiers were heroes, while the tough movies ignore the fact that many soldiers did indeed make such atrocities as this film. This movie sucks. It is time for a film that is neither stubborn nor antiwar, neither liberal nor conservative, but completely unnecessary.
