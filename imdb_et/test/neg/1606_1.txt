The fear for this movie was that it didn't end there. It created a regular weekly series that was even worse than the pilot / film. Most movies from different professions have some reality for them and, of course, it's interesting. It had nothing. If the intention was to make a "camp", then it succeeded. A few years ago, he wired the cable and failed again. The only redeeming part of this film was the chairman of Richard Jaeckels who did it. Campier as the 60s Batman series.
