I was waiting for Bruce Willis, especially since I remember the original was young when I was young. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great example of how movie companies get a very good story and fool it down until it's just another formula that traveled to the American law enforcement / military VS (Russians .... it is not a pity that the Cold War is over with the Russians) VS TERRORIST, similarly to 50 other films. <br /> <br /> In addition, he treats his audience as idiots. Weapon selection is very ridiculous, do we really expect that the world's most frightened and experienced hit man / terrorist will choose to be sure? <br /> <br /> The whole point of the original story was the tense doubling of intellects between the ordinary detective who is given responsibility and the professional who deals with the merciless but elegant plan to achieve his goal and then get it. None of them survived. All we have is a tired old American CIA / FBI / Army vs. an evil terrorist plot, we've all seen 1000 times before. <br /> <br /> But of course the movie company MBA has realized that here's a new intellectual corner that would lose income with a short attention span, so the answer is ...... Bruce Willis, big explosions and a crippled plot. They assume that the American audience will not be able to relate to the danger of people living abroad (where France is after the card), so it's American! <br /> <br /> Another example of a movie in the board.
