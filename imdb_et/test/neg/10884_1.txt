I've seen many movies. In fact, I love B horror movies, they are one of my favorite genres. But this "garbage" (I refuse to admit that it was given a film of honor) was the worst crap I've ever been tortured. I actually signed up for IMDb just because I needed the chance to say at least how terrible this "garbage" was. I've been watching films (at least worthy of honor) made in high school students' basements that were better written and directed. I have nothing but harm to the poor participants of this "garbage" because they just tried to earn wage control. They have this blemish now and forever on those records like the virgin who was raped and given to Herpes! If the writer / director John Shiban has remained dignified at all, then after he has counted countless people to do so, he should never allow himself to be near the camera and try to apply his so-called gifts to his best ... Like the floor of Peep's exhibition ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
