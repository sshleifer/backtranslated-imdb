Full disclosure: was born in 1967. Initially I was walking with me - if you were a teenager who grew up in the Reagan era, the memory was worth laughing or three. Pop Rocks, Atari and Rock 's Sock' em robots? Beloved, not * despite being funny, but * because * they were silly and stupid and fun. But when VH1 decided to make the series "I love last Tuesday", I knew it was enough. Goes Hal Sparks has nothing better to read than a telephoto when idiotic Slinkys are? (Wait, let me check ... hmmm, no. No, it looks like he's not.) Snarky, snubber uber-hip-positioning is in place, but enough!
