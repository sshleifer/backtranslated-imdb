I talked to see this girlfriend .. John was a good boy, sweet, sensitive and looks good without a shirt !! I thought it was a love story of both, but it was mainly about his reactions to his letters. Savannah was a pleasant character at the beginning of the film, but when she threw her off, I lost her. He said he pulled him away, away from him and it was hard - he was one million miles away, he killed people and the only contact he got was through his letters !!! He had no difficulty, he had a family and money and had a sense of duty! I was so disappointed when he forgave him - he was too expensive. I would have waited 3 years and greeted him at home.
