The "normal dignified criminal offense" is sad because it is obviously trying to succeed and obviously it is obviously not possible to touch this obviously clear goal. Emergency failure in droll Irish comedy Spacey as a thief who enjoys cops and his race becomes a kind of national hero, this flick is easy to entertain when he tries to be funny, a little bit more boring when he tries to be interesting and forget about sentimental or poignant or love, although it also takes shots with these qualities. "Normal Decent Criminal Punishment" is a cumbersome scenario, a naive direction, the execution of militants, a thin story, bad casting, mediocre action, and finally disappears in itself and falls into desperate mediocrity. Forward it. (D)
