What can you say about a movie that makes a "Erotic Witch project" like an "English patient". Again, the plot and characters are secondary, but the plot is an almost exact copy of TEWP. women become sexual. The naked gap leaves porn equipment and blows the doll like "TEWP." They disappear, the doofus disappears and the girls find their hotel back. There they reenact the end of the "Blair Witch Project," because the cameras have fallen and the guide is seen playing hopscotch, a game integral to the thin plot. <br /> <br /> At least three sorority sisters here have unnaturally large breasts and stretch marks, with pretty obvious surgical scars. One "natural" gal here lowers the director. In the highly inaccurate and protracted credit segment, playback scenes are played, where he did not receive the line cut, over and over again. naked odor. This one scene seems to come later, because nobody could wear it when shooting. In the background, like women cavort and stroke, you can see someone's picket fence. It may be the backyard of Director Jim Wynorsk. <br /> <br /> It's just a bad thing. Lesbian Love Scenes are a Kelvin degree cooler than the "Erotic Witch Project". Most of the lovin are made up of four women who clench their eight collective boobs. There is no such luck in this bad career development - if imitation is a form of sensual sincerity, the "Blair witchcraft" makers should be really crazy. physical violence, severe anxiety, female nudity, sexual content and sexual references. <br /> <br />
