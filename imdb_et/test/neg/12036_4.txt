MARY, MARY, BLOODY MARY is an OK killer. It is equally attractive, the action is rarely boring. There are many killings. And the production values ​​are not bad. In the end, it's like a regular TV episode since the 1970s, thrown in with some nudity. The film is the end product of the 'author', trying to make it a purely commercial film. There is very little depth here and the film spends too much time with chase and action scenes. MMBM lacks almost any intimidation or break or fear, except for the scene on the old man's beach. The director has very little understanding of the type of horror. <br /> <br /> It's traceable, though it doesn't leave a lasting impression.
