Are you serious? Did you read the book or watch this movie? Well, if you did, let me warn you, it's fake. Mark Furhman has tried to work after losing his job with LAPD. You remember her, aren't you? He was a man who lied on the billboard and gave OJ Simpson protection from what they were looking for. He has since written three books. I've read them all. No, I'm not a fan, they were given to me. At the same time, I tell you the same similarity in all three, they seriously distort the importance of Mark Furhman. He exaggerated his monsters in all three. In "Murder in Spokane", he claims he had something to do with killing a killer if he had nothing to do with it. In all of his books, he is happy to end local law enforcement efforts. Like her efforts, an EU trial was conducted. In this film, Furhman is looking at women and women who deserve her afterwards. Many other shots are at the center of his attention, because in fact I am sure that the only thing people thought at this time was "hey, isn't it racist who caused the exit to OJ?" It was an interesting real life story, but not a good movie about it.
