I had great expectations of this movie, but unfortunately I feel down. I bought this $ 5 per VHS used, and the version I bought was a duplicate in English. Duplication is terrible, so be careful. "Lola" wasn't as good as "Run Lola Run" in this movie, and the bad guy just got the glove out of nowhere. And "Lola" will stick to what's going on at the university. It seems to me unreal. I also wondered if the original version had American songs on the track ... they seemed very far away. Too bad this movie, I really thought it was going to rock.
