It was a pathetic film. The alien was decent, but the film itself gave a new bad meaning. The plot is something that has been done over and over again! But that makes it worst! The action was c ** p, the scenes were often too dark to get going. No one was worried about the main character. The film was too slow and the scenes of the murders that were there were foolishly crafted and ultimately no more interesting than the rest of the film. There are some movies that "suck", but you can still enjoy it because there is total resentment, but it is not even that! Who made this movie thought they could do something good and they failed. Nothing offers this movie except headaches. Avoid it!
