I watched Gomedat in my cinema in my town. My friend took me away and I was very curious what it looks like. Well, I have to say that this movie wasn't horrible, maybe we can say it is "Fancastic Experimentation" ... OK here I am going ... But there was a lot of shooting, acting, dramatic, theater and storytelling problems I understand that the director is very young and Gomeda is his first full-length film.OK The management of this film was not quite bad, I see. Unfortunately, because of the limitations placed on the movie due to the extremely low budget, it is often as miserable as the storyline. And there are no powerful Gothic scenes. Because the horror movie it really fails, is not afraid at all and it is rather confusing and boring. Some people say that "Gomeda" is an art film, but I didn't see such a ridiculous, terrible and broken art film. So how can we say that this is an art film!
