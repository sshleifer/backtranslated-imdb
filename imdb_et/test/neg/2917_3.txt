This flat Harold Lloyd soundtrack is ridiculous in it and makes it wonder if this Lloyd is even the one that made all those pleasant and fun resins. if we can hear him, and the slow, restrained pace replaces the silly of his silence. Lloyd plays a young son of a missionary who is growing in China, and then finds that he has been implanted in a modern New York City with no idea how he lives outside his Chinese village. He finds himself unlikely to be a winner in the mayor's election and swiftly withdraws all government organizations, because he refuses to see it differently in the face of arrogant corruption. When he has tried to humiliate him, he decides to play as dirty as everyone else, and he fights every beaten off in NYC as a tactic of intimidation. This darkly satirical end seems to be everything else beside the film, but it is the only part of life that lives far away. Everything else is a boring cage. <br /> <br /> I don't like to admit that Harold Lloyd's movie fails because I like him so much, but I don't have that choice. <br /> <br /> Rating: D
