The film gives a graphical overview of the suffering of sexual forced labor, but nothing else. The leftmost left of this movie can be seen miles away and leaves the viewer as embarrassing as you know it. So, women are being abducted and sent to the territory of the former Yugoslavia to work as sex slaves because, because of (deep breath), the American military institution is corrupt and looks down, while their private security companies sell people abroad. You don't need half the brain to see the importance of the Iraq war and the Black Water Company. <br /> <br /> What is the load on the left stool? I seem to be deceiving my whole life, thinking that this problem and many others were directly in the grip of communism in this region for 45 years. But no, it was an American war against Iraq, which is also responsible for earthquakes, tropical storms and constipation last week. <br /> <br /> The film ignores the fact that 95% of the sex trade is women who want to sell their bodies for money and enter the West. You can also see scenes that are so stupid that you want to pull your hair. We have somebody who rides women on the streets of London in daylight, beat her up, then somehow drags her unconscious body half an miles back to the apartment where she rapes her. No one can see it or call the police, and the running woman does not care about yelling at the chase. Better yet, we'll see 4-5 women in central London - a very wide daylight, one of them being a broken face and people buying in the background like nothing happens. You can't build this stupidity. <br /> <br /> I thought such a trash was exclusive to Hollywood, but it probably was wrong.
