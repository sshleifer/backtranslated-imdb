"Tokyo Eyes" talks about a 17-year-old Japanese girl who falls like a man hunted by her big dick, a policeman. This flat flick is about 50% of the filler and 50% of talking, talking and more talking. You see less than three letters when they talk, play and play video games on the bus, talk and get a hairstyle, talk and walk and talk, talk about cell phones, talk and talk, etc. when you read subtitles, waiting for something. The story of a thin wedge is not enough to support a film that has a low end result, low casting and no action, not romance, sex, or nudity, not a heavy drama ... just an incessant yadayadayada'ing.
