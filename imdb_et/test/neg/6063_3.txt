After his father's suicide, Charlie 'Kid' Davis (Ray 'Boom Boom' Mancini) accepts the invitation and advice of his friend Tiny (Michael Chiklis) and goes to Las Vegas in an attempt to become a boxer. On the road they meet Gina (Jennifer Beals), climbing, lifting her and becoming Charlie's girlfriend. Johnny Ticotin (Rod Steiger) is convinced by Tiny that he is a Charlie sofa, and the powerful agent Alex Dumas (Joe Mantegna), who has followed him after the fight, will be his leader, promoting Charlie's career. This movie is so boring that it really doesn't take much time to write it. I don't like boxing, but sometimes I watch a movie worth it. But it's terrible! Predictable, full of clich√©s with a terrible head actress, a waste of time. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Corpo e Alma" ("body and soul")
