Another TV show becomes a movie. Steve {The Office} Carell plays such a bad movie that it's so bad that it's the worst movie you've ever seen. The seventh course story - if you can name it with megalomania that tries to take over the world. It's so weird, it's totally pathetic. The only thing Anne Hathaway does as agent 99 looks good - she can't do anything else. Bill Murray has a good idea to limit his screen time by about 90 seconds, and some examples of TV series appear in very small roles. The film should be part of the thriller and partial action film. No it is not. Though I was not really a fan of the TV series, it was at least in the light of years. All this pulls it through dirt and descends from any good memories. Thanks to God, Don Adams is not here to see it. Hold Hollywood! Keep such movies so that they are, and keep them once a week. No wonder the film industry is under the pipes. This movie is so rotten, it doesn't even laugh good. If this film was a newspaper, it could be used to connect the bottom of the cage. There is no reason to see this movie. Root canal is more enjoyable! Rating - zero minus five stars. If you're not a masochist, then STAY AWAY. Better yet, do what the title says - Get Smart and save your nine bucks. You can buy about 2 gallons of gas. Put it in your car and be grateful that you didn't waste it to see this bomb!
