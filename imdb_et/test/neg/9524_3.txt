AKA <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 3 x 1.78: 1 in the range 2.39: 1 frame (triplet) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> 1978 A working class teenager (Matthew Leitch) takes the wrong identity and gatecrashes high society, where he learns the harsh lessons of discrepancies between rich and poor. <br /> <br /> Autobiographical feature directed by Duncan Roy (JACKSON: MY LIFE ... YOUR NUMBER), a pre-Thatcher aristocratic exposition seen in the "ordinary" eyes of a small tenant whose worldview has changed with his adventures in the Upper Class. Unfortunately, Roy's scenario says very little that we did not already know about the abundant excesses of forces, and the narrative only briefly ignored Leitch's relationship with a beautiful, but destructive, boy (Peter Youngblood Hills) who turns out to be no less hypocritical than the people he's trying to emulate. Also Diana Quick (a terrible snob who believes that the working class is "embarrassing!"), Bill Nighy as the black sheep of the rich family Lindsay Coulson ("EastEnders"), Blake Ritson (for different men) and Georgina Hale from the usual terrible fires your breasts and a variety, without any care in the world! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, much of the film's impact on Roy's demand to use the Triptych effect (three separate 1.78: 1 images in 2.39: 1 frame, each with a different perspective on individual scenes) is diluted, which reduces the image and distorts the viewers from the screen events. A long, pointless film that is too personal to make a wide complaint and is hampered by the entire cinema process that doesn't match the story. There is also one version of the image (theatrically coded 1.85: 1), the title on the screen is AKA: LIES ARE LIKE WISHES.
