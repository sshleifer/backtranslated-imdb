Terrible acts, terrible dialogue, bad humor, dirty parcels and a terrible movie. It must be the worst film I've ever seen in my life, and I'm the king of bad movies. For the sake of influences, they were simply forged by people and things, not spending time on wounds and doing something worthwhile for special effects. Most people who make small-budget horror do at least like pieces of tissue or something that produces a gas-free wound. Dialogue was by no means even decent and action was not a direction or an effort. They just threw some of the participants and said they had. I swear I have seen my movie in class I better movies at school. How did it get a DVD?
