I can't believe how bad this "movie" is. For starters, the film deals with the legend of Big Foot and a group of people who have a close encounter with the creature. The premise is interesting and Lance Henriksen's lie (ALIENS) gave The Untold a promising outlook. Unfortunately, it's as interesting as it gets. It looks like a direct DVD ... or I think. It's basically less of a production process, which is probably the worst editing (continuous "fading to black" between each scene.) I've seen in my life and acting that will definitely shine on you. Why Lance Henriksen chose it completely useless. And the film takes clues from all the other genre films, the "Blair Witchcraft" (video scene) and the "Predator" to "Alive". It is based on supposedly real events, but the only truth found here is how BAD this film is. I am not usually a tough critic and believe me, I tried to trash it, but finally NO. Take advantage of your DVD and be guided. <br /> <br /> I try to say a little: this movie is a PURE garbage and it made me want my gun and shoot my neighbors ... or ask for a refund from BLOCKBUSTER !!! <br /> <br /> And Lance, shame on you! 1 * 10 *
