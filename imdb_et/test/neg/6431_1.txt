11:11 a.k.a.a.k.a.g.a. hell gate (2004) is another bad horror film that tries too hard to be something that is not. The young girl has an imaginary gamer. One day, when he goes out with his friends in areas playing with his friends, a few refugees will visit their parents and cast them away for no apparent reason. Young girl runs away and hides bad men. Years later the girl grows into a problem woman. Graduates (looking like repressed homosexuals) are burning their masculinity in front of him when he rejected one of them. Girls hate her and life is generally unhappy with her. The secret of his past returns to him to visit. Who or what is it? Why does everyone hate him? What's his Guardian problem with him? To find out, you need to look at the Hell Gate. <br /> <br /> The new title doesn't make any sense. I don't know why people are given money to make such bad films. This movie isn't even good enough to joke. This is a headache that creates confusion that interferes with someone who is trying to think of some sense. Not worth your time. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
