High fat slut "Uncle Buck" played by John (eats-a-lot) Candy, visits family members of the family for a week to have two cute children (Gaby Hoffman and MacCauley Culkin) and a beautiful but snobby teenager (Jean Louisa Kelly). Shenanigans begin when Buck makes breakfast and then tries to sleep in a bed that is too small to break his body. <br /> <br /> Mostly boring, but peppered with two or three funny scenes, including Buck, who is trying to angry with his girlfriend (Amy Madigan) over the word and his meeting with a very nasty clown. Candy looks like she weighs 600 pounds.
