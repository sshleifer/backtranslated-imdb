Disclaimer: While participating in a cinema abroad, I have loved a wide variety of films that include a variety of genres that include fear, action, drama, comedy and romance. So I have enjoyed a thoughtful, serious drama tone as well as a meaningless, popcorn fun action film. There are many different Chinese, Japanese and Korean films under my mouse, I am sure I can recognize movies to evaluate and complete films. Unfortunately, Ashes of Time does not recognize anything. It's one of the worst Chinese movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> To begin with, this over-rated epic infamous "slideshow" action sequence is nothing but a very cheap and pathetic form of choreography. Just a series of close-ups of faces, swords, feet and / or hands and then the body are to be shown. Bravissimo! You now have an action for Ashes. The problem lies not only in its poor quality, but also in the fact that the scenes are so chaotic and divergent that the viewer has no idea what the hell is going on. <br /> <br /> The dramatic element of this movie is non-existent as it relies on characters that tell the viewer that they love someone or hate someone, instead of actually developing and displaying such elements on the screen, which makes all characters general and colorless, leaving the viewer completely indifferent to his actions. In fact, the story itself is an absolute disaster that takes too many signs too quickly, too much plot equipment. The complexity of the images in the films can be used very favorably (ie A Tale of Two Sisters), but the ashes of time become an exploitative garbage if it does nothing more than simply create a simple plot without a good reason. <br /> <br /> In fact, this whole movie acts like a line of incense to cover its drawbacks. Dreadful choreography is covered with "slideshow" tricks and chaotic camera movement. The development of a non-existent character is covered by characters who publicly say how they feel. And the meaningless storyline is covered by mixing the viewer with convolution. <br /> <br /> As it wasn't bad enough, this movie was very boring, it seems more than 150 minutes instead of the actual 95. <Br /> <br /> Rating = Rarely given 0/5 stars.
