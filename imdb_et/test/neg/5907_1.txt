This movie is not completely funny and I imagine getting offensive to the Jews. (And I'm not a Jew) Why? First, the whole film depicts the protagonist Zucker as a running shady business and deals while his son is gay, his daughter is a lesbian and his niece is a slut. Then there is the family relationship that happens in the family, first the daughter of her, Joshua and Jana, and then her son with her niece. Two inconsistent relationships in the family. I am surprised that they did not add a family of mentally disabled people to the family ... Now this would be the perfect sub-person of the Nazis! (gay, lesbian, Jewish ...) <br /> <br /> Absolutely nasty movie. I'm surprised that this film doesn't respond to any Jewish community.
