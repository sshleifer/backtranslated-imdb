This catastrophe is a remake of the 1973 movie, based on the Sakyo Komatsu novel. Japan is located right next to the Pacific Fire Circle (active volcanoes) and along the edges of the architectonics, the displacement of which causes earthquakes and tsunamis (the Japanese term itself for the wave of tides). Of course, this is a natural prerequisite for the disaster that Hollywood has a day in which films like Armageddon, Deep Impact, and recently The Day After Tomorrow, which is about to become a global warming catalyst for natural disasters, but I have to say this: Japanese drowning makes all the films mentioned earlier classic. This catastrophe is a disaster and it is great. If I need to watch my watch every 10-15 minutes, this is a sign that the film is not involved and feels that it was not over time. <br /> <br /> Special effects are beautiful. From satellite imagery of outdoor space to a lively vacation of every conceivable natural disaster that can hit the land of the rising sun, the effects are the star of the exhibition. At the same time, impressive computer-generated graphics are not, in themselves, a delicious film because it is just too good for ordinary cages. <br /> <br /> If you had seen a trailer with tempting effects and chaos and chaos on specific scenes, yes, in fact, these scenes are just that. There are no details and everything is viewed far away, in God-like mode. Things happen like on the screen, trying to try and get deeper into the issues. It is similar to Godzilla, who is knocking over buildings, and it would not be through one act of people and human casualties. Morbid, because it may seem, show us the victims! The nation, like Japan, does not suffer from the disaster after an extremely low number of deaths, not when the filmmakers unleash the chaos on such epic scale. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to shoot romance in the eye, he looked like a painful thumb. There are many signs in the film, but they all lack real traits or humanity, and they look like wandering zombies, without expression, without emotions, and certainly very rigid and convincing. Heroes remain in general management positions, giving statements, instructions, and forms, and responding to incidents such as the computer game, all solved at the touch of a button. These are the characters you are not talking about. <br /> <br /> If I can just use the day after tomorrow as a comparison, although there are terrible effects, at least an attempt to provide a microscopic whole disaster perspective. And there are many activities inside the infusion, big like catastrophes and small, focusing on the triumph of the human spirit, which makes it relatively convincing. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Japan's drowning in this film should preferably be one to sink and refuel, and hopefully the local box office will go through a short and quick death to do better things.
