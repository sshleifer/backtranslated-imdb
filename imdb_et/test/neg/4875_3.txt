This movie is not worth seeing, at least not in the cinema. The story is hard to track and understand (it starts in 10 minutes, which happens 3 years earlier). It's hard to know if this movie is trying to be a comedy or just so bad / weird it sometimes seems like that. American police cars American sirens and lights are just one example. The behavior of Persbrandt and Bergqvist is good as usual, but I think Jenny Lampa is very bad at Jasmin. Zara Zetterqvist works pretty well, she hasn't been seen as an actor in Swedish films for a long time. If you still want to see it, wait until it appears on the DVD or appears on the TV.
