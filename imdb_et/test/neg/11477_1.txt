It's the worst comedy I've ever seen. However, it is difficult to explain because (if you haven't seen it) I bet you have never seen comedy that wasn't good or bad; it's just there (it's the original part, not good or bad, right there)! Allow me to say that I have seen every comedian who plays a major role and like everything. This makes it such a secret. Support managers actually work (although the dialogue is bad). The only sign that is pretty good is the John Goodman game. She does a pretty good job with the little dialogue she has, and she actually has one funny line (I don't break the only funny line of the movie if you decide to watch it. It includes pancake.) The major leaders are the big secrets. I do not call them because the characters have not been developed. This script is so minor that they don't even bother to give fictitious names. They all use only their own. They don't even try to act. It's like they all read each other loudly the scripts the local younger sent them. In fact, I wrote a piece of paper for my English class when I was thirteen, not funny. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, just don't worry about renting it. That's not funny. It doesn't even have such a bad dialogue that you want. I just sat down and watched the whole thing. It was so boring that I couldn't even get upset about how bad it was. I can't imagine how it will even reach 4 ratings here.
