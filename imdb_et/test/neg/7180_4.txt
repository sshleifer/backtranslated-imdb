This movie doesn't work. There are no two ways. I saw it for the first time in '98 when it appeared and I didn't like it. I just bought it a few days ago because I thought "what the hell I'll give him a try". I'm not sorry for the money I put out for Hamilton, but the fact remained the same. This movie is useless, boring and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Stormare is usually a pleasure, but it is when he makes movies in the US. Back to home, he doesn't do the trick. Of course, the movie is well done (if you forget here about the strange equipped footage) but eventually really raises Hamilton's one-star garbage, Hamill is in turn a bad man Hawkins. He's got a lot of fun with his character, and he's also responsible for just two good moments in the movie .. "Swedish intelligence, is it? Now in the sense of contradiction" and when he allows a word or two words with his wife over Hamilton at the end of the phone slip. And it's really pretty much. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
