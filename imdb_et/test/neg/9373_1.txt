The trademarks of this movie, such as Suit Supply, take this story off, as it should be set in the eighties. This is not a very exciting movie. Also, the single track of the Intwine single is very bad, it has a cream that is repeated several times, "as I'm a cruel man, I take it all, I'm a cruel man I am here to stay." asswipesid get something better? I think they wrote it in a matter of minutes .. <br /> <br /> It's really annoying, as is the product placement in this film product that introduces a criminal and publicity criminality who shouldn't be a celebrity as he is now ready be, but it should be forgotten as the rats should have.
