* Front Spoilers, but it shouldn't be important because I hope you don't see it anyway. Because it was one of the most wasted 1/2 hours I've experienced. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is a complete hanging of a great "Battle Royale" movie. It's as stupid as watching some flat American TV shows like "Cops" or "Candid Camera". <br /> <br /> The plot is completely predictable. One pregnant and the other is a sister, anyone who does some logical thinking understands at first what should happen between them. enjoyable. I mean, preggo takes it behind his back and doesn't follow any trace in the back. and get a copy of the song Roya instead of viewing this copy. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10, too bad, couldn't judge it. Almost Scream does 3 masterpieces.
