This movie was maliciously PC, predictable, and clich√©. I couldn't imagine a movie that would better show today's Hollywood narrative narcissistic preaching. If you haven't seen it, don't bother looking at it. If you have, show courage and tell people how terrible it really is. My husband, a minority on its own, was offended by the film's natural and infinite racist message. This film has nothing to do with the real world, and it has little, if any, discussion of any racism in that country. Instead, it is such a cheap, sensational mess that is promoted as deep and complex thinking. What kind of bubble do you have to live in to think it's impressive at all?
