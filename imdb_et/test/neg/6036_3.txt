The White Warrior is certainly one if not Steve Reeves's weaker films. The 18th or 19th century Russia (??) plays Steve plays a Cossack warrior trying to ride a crazy man with the Russian Tsar, riding a mountain side with his rebel band on a horse-looking Russian white tuna ..... much of Reev's body is a hidden chair, knee-length tunic, even with a thicker Russian-speaking hat. <br /> <br /> The action is quite minimal, but just above the center line of a good wrestling show off the body of the Great Reev. This is an obvious attempt by manufacturers to move from Reeve's sword and sandal genre to another historical time, with poor results. The script dialog is difficult to understand at different points and only the narrator's comment allows the viewer to understand what is happening from scene to scene. I would imagine how Reeves regretted making this film, but trying to try and get out of his toil and sandal and tribune armor to open him to other historical characters like Morgan Pirate and Baghdad's thief.
