First of all, I have read the director's comments down and would like to thank him for his opinion. I have always wondered what filmmakers in MST3K felt about breaking their jobs (not to mention how Best Brains acquired rights). However, Rice's comments make me curious as to how much Sci-Fi could have been cut to make it different (now I think I can rent it out of NetFlix). Of course I have never seen the uncut, non-MST3K version of this movie, but even though I've seen it in MST3K, I've never thought about it as a bad movie or something irresistible (although I thought it was a pretty funny MST3K episode) ; certainly not, as Pearl describes it, "skin peeling terribly"; not after seeing the "war of the future" and "hobgoblins". <br /> <br /> When it comes to movie cutting, it's done at least once in MST3K. Example: Joe Don Baker's letter, Mitchell, where John Saxon's sub-block is cut into the MST3K version, but Joel and Bots comment on the absence of Saxon after his appearance at the beginning of the film. If I can criticize MST3K if you need to cut the film for time, fine, but be honest with the film (even if it's a movie like Mitchell). Of course, such criticism is quite meaningless what the exhibition is over, but I think this exhibition was dishonest. But anyway, if it's with Soultaker, it will get my sympathy. Still, I argue that this is an enjoyable MST3K episode, although the film itself, even the "hacked" version of MST3K, is not terrible. Finally, I noticed that in a strange coincidence or in the Synchronicity case, I was watching The Hudsucker Proxy on the day when Soultaker urged and did not know it, the man who played Vivian Schell's father was a little part of this film; one of his three other credited roles. I thought it was that weird.
