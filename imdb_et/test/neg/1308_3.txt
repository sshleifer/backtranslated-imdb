I usually don't write comments, but for the movie I had. I am shocked by the talent who is going to waste ... the script was terrible ... editing terrible ... and the plot very thin. You spend the first half of the movie thinking about who is talking about who and what on earth. The other side of the film slows down slightly, but it has no depth and no sense. The only sustainable grace is a nice but still limited cgi and location in London. I gave it 3 letters and the fact that the actors were still trying to do a good job was given. If you want to lose a few hours of your life with the entertainment of mediocre popcorn disasters, it's all a movie for you. But I would recommend doing something different in your time than viewing the actual archive content online! :) http://www.weatherpaparazzi.com/flooding.asp
