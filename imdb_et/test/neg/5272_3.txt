Kevin Spacey is my all-time favorite actor, he is undoubtedly on the list of other actors as well. He also pulled a good Irish accent from a normal decent criminal order. What about Kevin Spacey as a mafia leader? Or even a burglar? I'm not so sure he could go that far. I just didn't make sense to the movie, and some of the stories just didn't seem to me to be solved. <br /> <br /> I know once again that IMDb is making me ten more lines. But I'm not so sure about the movie I could say, because I'm trying to figure it out. Glad, isn't it? But I'm pretty sure more than one of the other IMDb users have been in the same situation as I do now, where you just want to say a line or two about the movie, but now you have to make ten lines? Oh, it should do it. : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
