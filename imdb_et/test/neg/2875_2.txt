I really like Salman Kahn, so I was really disappointed when I saw this movie. It didn't have a lot of land and what they had was not so appealing. But Salman looked good in the movie, looked young and refreshed, but pays the price of that DVD. The music was not bad, it was pretty nice. Usually Indian films are at least two to three hours, but it was a very short film for Indian film. The American actor who played the film is Heroes, Ali Larter. There was much to be desired in his actions. But she looked good in the Indian dresses she wore. There wasn't much to be desired in the whole movie, and I hope Salman will do much better on his next film. Thank you.
