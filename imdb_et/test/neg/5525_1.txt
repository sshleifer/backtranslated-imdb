It's so bad that it's traceable. <br /> <br /> The plot is a grizzled team of spacecraft that takes place on a drifting, apparently abandoned Russian craft. <br /> <br /> Space in a space-filled ship accidentally colliding (!) - and "Alien'-esque fun" arises as a cyber ship that threatens our crew. <br /> <br /> The spacecraft's interiors are obviously puppet products (metal walkways, boilers), piping). In this completely persuasive environment, "Kody", "Snake" and the rest of our hero's crew grimace, grunt, run and constantly and repeatedly rack your shot without firing them. <br /> <br /> The gaffes of continuity are what you define in this movie and they are not amazing: <br /> <br /> Stuff will appear and disappear. The shotguns are racked. The cigar is smoked longer. The shotguns are dressed again to make sure. Bottle content increases when you drink. <br /> <br /> The film travels through the usual clich√©s with intense zinc, grafting and Ed Wood's high quality props.
