I've always loved bad creations, rhetorical criticism, and my film professor affirmed it for me in college. It's not as bad as Star Wars Holiday Special, there's no such mistake in the south box. This fantastic four film, with I-have-no-idea-why-hes-over-twisting-fingers, Dr. Doom, is on the list of big mistakes. Doom's Dialog "Kill Him ... Let It Go!" is classic because it is amazingly fun. Editing is good and the photographer's director is not half bad ... they are from the top. However, I can't look at all of my friends as a whole, but when I get the chance I will show them, "Will Jonny and Sue come with us in space!" the scene I do. I also add a final scene where Redd Richards from his FF outfit for some reason beside his bride's dress came to a limo in the bride ... the profit margin is good when they drive away. Most people are absolutely unbelievable that there is something like that.
