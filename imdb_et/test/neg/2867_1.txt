I couldn't look at that kind of mess. This is your standard junk that some annoying women love the old English era drama, with lots of costumes and clichés that appear either directly from the oliver's twists or from some other novel. It uses the usual Victorian era clichés. Certain idiotic people really think that the emotional torture of this culture, which is so bloody repressed, is somehow exciting and romantic. It's a juicy, clean and dirty junk and bored like watching the grass. As such, it is ideal for women who desire some romantic drama in English in a Victorian environment, but for this man, this film is not just a torture and a cruel and unusual punishment to look at bunch of scenes with vague characters in this language, sad and forged English accent.
