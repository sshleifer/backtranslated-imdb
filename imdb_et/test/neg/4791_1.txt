Have you seen all the great adventures of the last decades? If you haven't worked for that, as you've already seen most scenes - and I can make sure these scenes were originally in much better movies. <br /> <br /> The story (I'm sure the storyteller will never forgive me) is childish and stupid (stupid, so playing in the cemetery would result in a bunch of angry walks). Every character is based on a cliché and ... well, they're nothing but a cliché. And yes, again, all you have to be a hero is to be an American. <br /> <br /> At least in Finland, they advertise that it would be a movie that the DVD was prepared for. Maybe I should sell my player ... <br /> <br /> 1/10
