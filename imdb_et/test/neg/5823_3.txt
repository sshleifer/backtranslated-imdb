Close, but not the cigars! - This is my opinion on this movie! TAG PURVIS wrote and instructed this script, which should have been written before shooting. Sometimes it's ridiculous because this film's star is Dan Mongomery Jr and director of photography. Both talents are future prospects. My suggestion is to wait until it hits your local cable TV and rents the classic!
