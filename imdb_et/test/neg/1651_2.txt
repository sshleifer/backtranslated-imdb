Here is another one of today's ultra-splitting comedies where dysfunctional families are said to be fun. Know if people ever asked, "What happened to Pauly Shore?" Well, Shore did not disappear, but his career took nose-diving. Such films didn't help. <br /> <br /> "Son-In-Lawis" plays Shore's incredibly unpleasant character called "Crawliks" and yet it is the most enjoyable for the family! His father is a prophetic idiot; her mother is completely incompetent, her young brother is a sex maniac and her college sister is a real snot. <br /> <br /> One hour and a half of totally unlikely people were hard to do. I definitely wouldn't look at it anymore, nor would it recommend it to anyone other than the tough Shore fans. Adam Sandler took Pauley shticki and went much further. <br /> <br /> The following is an excerpt from the IMDb title page here under "biography" and explains why I am not the only one who was disgusting this movie. <br /> <br /> "........ but his insanity was rejected crude oil, Lolland and mostly uncomfortable. His movie career fast tank. The downhill is not helped his failed Fox sitcoms" Pauly "(1997) due to the failure In 1997, both critics and the media were terribly opposed and soon became a joke and forced to lie and rush out of the storm.
