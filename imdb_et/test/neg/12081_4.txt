"Hardbodies 2" is harmless, purposeful, and plot less. I would add this to the list without "brains", but the movie's in-film trick, though not very well done, helps to narrow this tag narrowly. The landscape has changed from the beaches of California to the Greek islands, and the only returning majority of the first movie is Sorrells Pickard (a shave man) and Roberta Collins (who at one point gets a mud pit that brings back his memories) classic cat fun with Pam Grier's "The Big Doll House". All other actors are new, but probably Brad Zutaut should play the same character (Scotty) as Grant Cramer did "Hardbodies". This result does not have the energy and appeal of the first film, nor does it approach the "heat" department. Of course Brenda Bakke and Fabiana Udenio are both very beautiful, but Teal Roberts - Cindy Silver - Kristi Somers team is second to none. "Hardbodies 2" is by no means the worst, but if you only want to see one of these movies, it will be original. (* 1/2)
