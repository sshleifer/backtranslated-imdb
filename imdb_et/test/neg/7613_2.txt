I loved Muppette. Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper and The Muppets Take Manhattan were good family movies, smartly written and fun to watch. I've never thought I'd see the day they jump on Hollywood butterfly races, but here's a Scooter like a drilled rave dancer, Pepe, who makes lewd and recommended comments every five minutes - it's not your father's Muppets. This is no longer Jim Henson's Muppets. <br /> <br /> This "It's a wonderful life" movie is your moments, but not enough to record it. I started watching it with my kids. I still have hope for my next movie, but it was definitely a disappointment.
