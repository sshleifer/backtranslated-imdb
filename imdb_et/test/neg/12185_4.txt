It was Jill Ireland's last film appearance, who died in 1990 of cancer for four decades as a renowned actor and producer. Ireland made quite a few waves in the press when he lost his wife David McCallum in 1967, starting his long-standing relationship with Charles Bronson. It is very ironic that Bronson, who is probably the leading number of deaths on the screen, was one of the most persistent marriages in film history. <br /> <br /> "Query" seems to be a film it was recorded in Cannon's manufacturing process for Bronson and Ireland. Ireland has already suffered from cancer-related illnesses in 1987 and you can almost look at two of the participants who want "another, old time". "Heritage" has been carelessly done in its entirety, showing the lack of resources for Poland and Cannon until 1990. But in a couple of ways it is the last time to see the value of nostalgia and the film will make you wonder what exactly helps the relationship to survive the chaos that is Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Bronson plays a high-level secret service, Jay Killian, who is destined to protect the first lady, Lara Craigi (Ireland). The President's spouse has a good reputation because it is complicated, earned around service agents, and wants to do things. All this, however, will change if one tries to make his life and he must drive with Killian by car, train, motorcycle and not to believe, dune buggy to escape possible assassins. There are few surprises here, because Killian believes that the murderers are part of the interior work that the President himself may organize. By the way, Killian and Mrs Craig are developing an unmatched affection between Bronson and Ireland, which is actually very funny. <br /> <br /> What really happens to me is how this movie was advertised when it was released and advertised. how to still watch it on dvd. The original trailer gives you the feeling that "murder" is another Bronson shooting with a cold heart. But a lot of this movie - which was, by the way, valued at PG-13 - is a comic wine, putting it on the romantic thriller, such as Bronson and the western 'From Noon Till Three' in Ireland. Even on a DVD body, Bronson has a rocket launcher ready to blow things up. What he does, but to a lesser extent than his other 80's potboilers. <br /> <br /> All in all, the murder is late for the cannons and doesn't really know what kind of movie he wants. In addition to drifting from an actor to a romantic thriller and again, there are serious flaws in continuity, property values ​​are low and the impact is terrible; Many explosions seem to be matt work rather than on-site. Robert Ragland, who had shown good compositional skills in earlier films, joined Valentine McCallum in a score that was mostly synthesized and better suited to television. <br /> <br /> The Richard Sale script has a real dialogue where conversations between Bronson and Ireland are the only bright spot. There is no explanation as to why the first lady is suddenly called "one mother", nor is the reason why Ireland has its British accent when the character is the mother tongue of Wyoming. Jan Gan Boyd, who plays Killian's chief assistant, is a kitten personality and is a bad federal agent. Stephen Elliott (former Tony Award candidate died in May 2005), Randy Brooks, Erik Stern (Assassin Bracken) and Michael Ansara (Senator Bunsen) are acceptable in their supporting role. By the way, it was the last film director for Peter Hunt, who in 1969 broke into the scene "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" and in 1981 collaborated with Bronson and Lee Marvin. Home entertainment; it is presented in a dual widescreen and standard format with three-language subtitles and a theater trailer. <br /> <br /> ** out of four
