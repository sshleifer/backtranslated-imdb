I was very disappointed with this movie. English, who says he is a fan of the original film, seemed to have taken a great work of art and turned it into a flat-lined "ho-hum" that you've come up with for long children's production. I tried like Meg Ryan's Mary Haines, but she was just bored. She didn't know anything about her husband. There was no emotional struggle, deep hurt. In the original 1939 film, Norma Shearer's Mary Haines felt frustrated, frustrated, confused and angry. The 2008 production was more related to some fake sister themes (actually the words of my wife) and didn't make you tear or even laugh. Only the performances that were worthy are Debra Messing and Bette Midler. (I wanted more from Bette.) There were no main characters in this movie. Sylvia Fowler's character had too many sub-topics. And Crystal Allen had no fire. Rewriting the department store met Annette Benning and Miss Mendez was Luke warm. The pace was also slow. Obviously, the 1939 version had to be renewed, but that was not the case. The reason why the original version worked so well was that the characters were dealing with "people" problems. A subject that is not out of date. The magic of the original film was that the film was for both sexes, while you never saw men.
