Jane Eyre full of nudity! I was not surprised that the woman was in this terrible "woman's picture" and I mean it in the worst possible way. The problem is that it could have been as good as they would have been left out of Jane Eyre's affairs and seized by the more interesting scenes in which Spanish / Portuguese Jews took part in the early 19th century in London. If the soundtrack music is better than the movie, you know you're in trouble. If you move the video forward because you are unable to hold the movie, make sure you don't miss anything, so you have worse problems. This movie comes to a romantic TV channel, where it rightly belongs.
