I leave it to my bettors, uh, I'm encouraged here to admire and gawkit this wonderful admiring movie and just say I thought it was stupid. The great thing about this site is you always get different views and search for them by all means. Don't say what you come out of the movie. For me, those who have seen this simplicity and Shenaniga have their own money. One, dead at a perfect time, when he drew attention to two great moments belonging to Pacino. Meeting and Airport. Other than good, that is a waste of time. Completely. Pacino is doing it over and over again, he would have been better served if he had reached about five notches around his defense level. Everyone always says, but this movie could have been so much better. Of course they would have been all. But most of them should never be done. Including this.
