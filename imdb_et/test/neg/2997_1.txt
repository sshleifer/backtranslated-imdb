It's a good time to say how good I think on this site: it gives me the opportunity to give feedback on all the frustration I lived for two hours, waiting for something to happen, something to say, subtly to the symbol, the idea, whatever . No, but long, endless violins, alternating with tired piano. Tired of voices, tired actors and boring cases and situations. Boring is a boring long death and this film is a public enemy from this point of view. How many thousands of hours of life have been stolen by another thousand innocent viewers. I'm not demanding my money back, just for my time and the time of the people I called this thing ... oh God!
