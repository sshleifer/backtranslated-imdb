I can't believe I even tried to look at this slag. Like an attractive B-Horror movie fan, I was more than riveted by the film's outlook on popular budget horror filmmaker Herschell Gordon Lewis. Unfortunately, after opening my movie, I couldn't think of a worse film right after my movie. Well, maybe Gigli, but I firmly believe that Dr. Gore (The Body Shop) is worse than I think about it. A terrifying plot that moves incredibly slowly, pulls the movie forward without a real horror. But I admit a couple of scenes of pure fun when Dr. Gore is soon victimized. The camera zooms in to its oversized bulb stickers, while at the same time it's a purely dirty soundtrack that adds to the amusement. I laughed better for 10 minutes. After he set up his "wonderful wife", the film destroys for almost 20 minutes, showing him and his "girlfriend" when he teaches him to talk, then they talk around, spiders, etc. Unfortunately, there is only music played throughout this fandango without a call. This part of the movie leaves you wanting to have your wrists split or a knife. I want to tear almost this movie for thought. If you like bad movies, check it out.
