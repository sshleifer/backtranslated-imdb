Let me highlight you by living in Louisville, Kentucky all your life. I grew up about Â½ miles of Waverly. In winter, we would pull our sleds on Maryman's road and cross Dixie Highway to drive to Waverly Hill. Many times during the winter of 76-77 we climb into the tunnel to warm ourselves up. The place was still at "Geriatric Center". We would go up the tunnel up the hill to show what we thought it was "from door to morgue". I have to be honest. The only feeling we felt was that we got something we shouldn't do. I have to say that we went to this tunnel over 50 times over the winter. Nothing is stranger than teenage boys who are stupid. I love the fact that after all these years, attention will be paid. One night, when I was young, we looked out of our forehead and it seemed that the whole mountain was a fire. The hill burned on the hill was an older hospital. It burned down when the entire neighborhood sat and watched. The missing thing about Waverly is that many people lived there in TB. Let's face it? The doctors did everything they thought they could to save people. There was a lot of courage that people could work there knowing that the infectious TB was. Too much focus on victims. I have traveled to the building several times in the early 1970s. We would go to the nursing home through the church's youth group. By the way, the doors were not in jail like steel doors with chains and locks, as depicted in the film. They were wooden and open, sometimes too open. It smelled of urine and faeces and occasionally saw the dress of patients with open-cut. It was true that the country closed it in the early 1980s. Much of what may be related to the age of the building or the right boy was not paid out. This is after all Kentucky. The part of the documentary that most turned me off was cleaning the housings. If I am not mistaken, it seems like a Holocaust film. This was added to the dramatic effect. I got a sour taste for the filmmaker. I'm a skeptic when it comes to "Ghosts". I believe many people here really think of a haunting place. However, Waverly symbolized me as a fun place for a boy with a sled.
