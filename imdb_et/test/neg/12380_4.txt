Personally, I have no problem with behavior or script. I have problems with a giant bird. It was just AWFUL. Simple and simple. <br /> <br /> The first impulse is a roll that laughs when it sees it. What did they mean ?? The budget is terrible. The monster bird was a monstrous joke. Of course, in my opinion, if manufacturers were to get actors such as Ankrum, Corday, and Morrow, they would have a special effect that the beast considers to be much better for the people. Oh well. It's done. It is such an eternal joke about those that was unwanted.
