It may be, although there are two or three, which I have forgotten. This film is an interesting night city image that resembles so many fuzzy scenes from Sherlock Holmes movies and lives with its bad Kafka-esque characters. In the midst of them, the movie Mia Farrow, who sounds like she is still playing Hannah, and Woody Allen, who seems to be repeating her nebbish role in Play It Against. Should we laugh at our grip and wrists? I think I'd like the rest of the movie to be clearly comedy, but that's not. At least I don't think it is.
