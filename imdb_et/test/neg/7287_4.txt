I find that I get less and less excitement about the Disney queues in the movies. Yes, I understand that the budget for direct video movies is not the same, but these movies don't even try. Some examples are Hunchback II and Tarzan and Jane. If someone has seen Stitch-The Movie previews, you'll see my point. But I ground, this film reaffirms its point. Animation is sloppy, the story resembles Saturday cartoons and not all of the original voices exist. I was very disappointed that I did not hear the voice of Michael J. Fox. It was so obvious that the person who made Milo's voice was trying to sound like Fox, but he didn't succeed. <br /> <br /> When he says something, my kids at age 10 and 6 didn't even get through the movie.
