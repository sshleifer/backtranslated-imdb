Well, this is the usual Hollywood schmaltz that you can see the coming miles away. This is partly enjoyable, but just so predictable. I have to admit that I really don't like it, but I'm pretty tough, and many of my friends loved it. <br /> <br /> It's pretty sweet and the actors give good results. It's a nice background and the eye candy is pretty good. But the annoyingly predictable, superstitious and truly fairly boring story keeps the movie back. Personally, I can think of better ways to spend a few hours of my life. <br /> <br /> Girls' flick genre gets some bad press, but there are some really good chicks; this is not one of them.
