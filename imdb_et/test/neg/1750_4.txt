I felt that the film Skammen, led by Ingmar Bergman, was very dry. It shows what people do to survive during the war, and the shame that comes from these activities; I think, however, that it was neither complete nor attentive. He did not fully come to the plot or deep into character emotions or the causes of his actions. The only thing I found in the movie was the transformation of two main characters Jan and Eva. Many times during the movie, there were only two main characters who sat or did their daily work and not even the conversation. I understand that it showed the reality of these people, but I feel that there are other ways to show reality and whether it is fun. I think Ingmar Bergman could have filmed this movie in a riveting way.
