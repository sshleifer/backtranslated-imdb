Rita Hayworth is an occasional stunning and for me the only reason to watch this foolish movie. Despite the lipsticks of the 1940s, Rita was the woman of all-time glamor of Hollywood. Actually, I can't imagine for a couple of years who would have been better off, except perhaps Elizabeth Taylor in her main position. <br /> <br /> In any case, Gene Kelly, the co-star of the show, is not shown in her usual pleasing, at least, kind of guy we all know about "Sing's In The Rain". Kelly's "Danny McGuire" gets a lot of time here. Phil Silvers, whom I loved on TV "Sgt. Bilko", is so stupid as "Genius", which you just listen to your stupid jokes .... and they are stupid. <br /> <br /> Visuals are great with Technicolor, which seems almost terrible. Here you can also see many beautiful women, not just Hayworth. Unfortunately, this story is not so much. He recruits Hayworth, deciding on a career choice. Along the way, we get the treatment of conventional marriage and we get an insulting fool. All in all, there is an unoremable film, except Hayworth's beauty presentation.
