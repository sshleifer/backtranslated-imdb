I felt that when I was in my favorite movie rank, I felt that the rank of my most hated films was to be honest. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid there's nothing positive about it Movie. In fact, this is one of the two films I've ever been out of. In honesty, I went back and watched the movie again to give it another chance and just sat down with the desire that I had to stay away. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that the film has a really decent casting and team ... but then even Hollywood's brightest stars will bring a life-long script to the dead duck. <br /> <br /> Stay away ... Save yourself from this really crazy movie 1/10
