Bugsy Siegel was 31 when he went to the west coast. In addition to his dreams of Las Vegas, he played with the idea of ​​acting. He was good looking and about 7 years younger than George Raft, so it wasn't that crazy idea. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty was 54 years old when she made a movie and, despite her hair color, she's too old for that part. Beatty had failed; Bugsy should have been played by someone like Alec Baldwin. Bugsy was a tough guy who was helped by modern men; Beatty just isn't in a hurry. <br /> <br /> It was Beatty's vanity project that has not reached an agreement that she is no longer a leading man. <br /> <br /> Another great annoying mess is Mantegna as George Raft. Raft had a special voice and manicures, none of which Mantegna even tried to match. You never believed Mantegna came from the streets. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty and Robert Redford have both been younger for years because they use immense hair color, and now this shock is suddenly going to gray and play parts of the character.
