I was forced to watch this movie about my world classical geography class. This movie is wrong in America today, instead of finding out difficult times or situations, we rather complain about how this is the fault of someone else. This film passes the Michigan Flint drop and accuses 100% of General Motors. In doing so, Moore goes a long way to making General Motors' leaders a rose just because they work in a capitalist society. Moore filmed a number of evictions in the film and never asks whether a person has been evicted because of GM's redundancy. In addition, he never interviews tenants of filmed tenants. Moore goes around historical events to match his political agenda with this pure propaganda film.
