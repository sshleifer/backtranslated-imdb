The worst movie I've ever seen. I still don't understand what Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen are going to do. Maybe they had to pay the bills ... The best and cult part comes in a rebound that brings us to the Second World War when a Nazi officer hides his Jewish wife. It's the beginning of a typical serum killer life! It looks like it was targeting the early 80s, but then the new Beattle ... ... Amazing! This movie was directed in 2001 ... I'm pretty sure it took less than two weeks to make this movie. I heard Dennis Hopper's wife ask for a divorce after seeing this picture, and Michael Madsen's mother had a heart attack when the actor admitted to being a yellow baseball. Pathetic!
