I had two reasons to see this movie. First were Stellan Skarsgard and Marisa Tomei (who are both good actors) and I had nothing better to do. Despite the film, I was thinking about doing something better: SLEEP! This movie is a waste of time. This is a normal ex-cop. The former copper is the best there, but he was fired. He keeps his things against his former friends and saves the day. All BIG surprises (NO !!!). Go to bed, or if you have insomnia, try it. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
