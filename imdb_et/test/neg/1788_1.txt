The Lord. I started with such a great potential - a bunch of corporate girls walking practically naked and controlling. Then come to the bar, where 80s cheeses are pulling out, check. Check the clean state park next morning. A lot of girls and their professors, robber cyclists, a general shop boy and the fact that they lived in a local drunk - make a nice body number, control (and speak of body, notice that the DVD has a strong resemblance) cover a foreign incandescent lamp - Body Count! called Camping del Terrore). Dirty indian in the woods, which makes some ritual, hmmm, OK I let it slip, look. And then, brother, all downhill from there. Terrible. I had an explosion of Lochness's monster head.
