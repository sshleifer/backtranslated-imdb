Imagine the worst thing a person could ever understand. Imagine something infinitely darker - I mean, worse. Then multiply it by the amount of lactation collected by Star Wars Holiday Special. This movie is much worse than that. <br /> <br /> "Dracula 3000: Infinite Darkness", featuring outstanding and prestigious actors like Coolio and Langley Kirkwood (when the "terrible antagonist", Count ORLOCK) is equal to eating their stools only throughout their lives condensation for about one hour and 20 minutes. Quite frankly, there is no way to approach this review of the cinematic tragedy - communist propaganda, promoting drug use, futuristic anachronisms, and most likely the worst special effects after the (original) "World War". br /> <br /> The Soviet Union hammer and sickle can be seen proudly when they are bold to call a spaceship. Lenin can be seen on a number of posters on the entire "film". And, of course, religion has been lost for two centuries. So they don't know who this "God" is, although they have no doubt about using their name in vain. But, of course, in the space socialist republic (led by the interstellar president Baker), the death stick is legalized as a drug and is quite common. However, less mobility seems worse than it is now (they don't even have a wheelchair ramp). <br /> <br /> Racial tension remains quite familiar / predictable throughout the galaxy. We get a great comment on ethnic division through lines like "on Dracula brotha?", "We have to hold both" and "if you're black, you won't go back." One of these black characters is Coolio. Playing a stereotypical stoner that Coolio will ever be the most annoying and ridiculous vampire. Oh wait, the second most ridiculous vampire. This rated title goes to our friend COUNT ORLOCK, PLANET TRANSYLVANIA, CARPATHIAN SYSTEM. These two are doing quite a few that are related to Coolio's aspirations for paraplegic, a strange attempt to make high-level animal noise, haircut 1004 years old and GIGANTIC a completely worthless dialogue; and Count Orlock Twenty Dollar General Halloween-style Vampire Costume, Exploding Coffins or Confusing Modest Story. One wonders whether they just give Coolio the chance to get as high as the dragon in space without gravity, 'let him interact with other "actors" and go on from there. <br /> <br /> Count Orlock's motives are also somewhat questionable. Does he want "infinite darkness" because the movie's subtitles would you believe? Does he want to eat a team? Or does he want * Coolio * "to kill them all"? Or does he want disabled people in such an unpleasant future? This is not really important, because none of the plot of this movie makes sense. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this movie must be the end. The more that this means that the movie is over, when the sudden attack rank they get accustomed to before the credit. Instead of counting Orlock out in some sort of duel (the closest we are to kicking Orlock that strikes the speed behind our protagonist who dies shortly thereafter), our heroes beat his hand at the usual door. Then Orlock will continue to collapse, getting into pain in a daily but understandably painful injury. This is by far the most fun movie you can get. Looking at the vampire's grueling face, when it cries in pain, you are laughing at the edge of your seat. It's worth almost four bucks. Of course, you will be treated immediately after treating one of the film's worst liners, the mandatory hint of sex and perhaps the most abandoning of ABRUPT EXCUSE. They drive into the sun and their ship literally just blows before they even come close to the blow. I think they just crossed the Wachowski bros. for the worst finale ever. <br /> <br /> I can sleep only at night, because we know it's impossible. It is certain that we can say with certainty that it is a TOTAL OF WORKING CAPACITY, and that it must never be overcome with lower quality, lower budget and lower-capacity talent.
