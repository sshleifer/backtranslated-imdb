This movie is not as good as I thought it would be. There is no story, no sign and some dialogue would have been nice. Gore effects are good and occasionally quite bloody, but not up. It starts with leaving the person and if it is on the scene, the girl starts. Music is a classic score and it fits very well with film. They would have had to make a 90-minute version where they would have had time to develop the character so that we could get rid of the person on the board. And some more information about the dead would have made this movie much worse. Don't wait for a scary movie, but a nice, gory special effect reel.
