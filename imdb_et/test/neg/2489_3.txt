There is no real story, because the film seems to be a wall drama documentary rather than the right film, so that the piece itself can be a spoiler. I do some drama about 3 young Singapore children (very similar to British chavs) who play from school, ride gangs, get into battle, insult people on the street, get tattoos, hang things up, etc. etc. to be difficult and every time so often shout the challenges of rap songs in the camera. Filmed with MTV style, fast cutting, crazy camera corners, close closing and animation. Dialogue may be more pronounced in the original languages ​​of Mandarin and Hokkien than in subtitles, and I have no doubt that some modern Singapore references slip across Western leaders, as well as cultural and political contexts, unless of course you are familiar with Singapore. Such a teenage film may be the first in Singapore, but it has been done earlier and better in other Western countries, such as La Haine (1995).
