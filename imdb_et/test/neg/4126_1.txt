It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. I'm looking at virtually every night's movie (either showtime, hbo, cinemax, etc.). "Three" AKA "Survivor Island" keeps you so tense when the color dries out just to put you even more unhappy. If you want to feel you're just wasting what seems to be the eternal worst movie, look at this movie anyway. I must have been screaming at least 900 times for idiotic twists. If I had four hands, I'd give it to the 4 thumbs. <br /> <br /> In my personal opinion, I believe that the only people who want this movie are those with terrible morals.
