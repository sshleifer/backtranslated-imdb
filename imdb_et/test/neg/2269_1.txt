It's not a good movie at all. I can't believe that after fifty years this film will be a national award when Marathi's cinema is such a jewel that has been so systematically ignored. This is a very overpriced movie that is very happy. It was awarded a national prize, a popular opinion was gathered and now represents India in front of an international audience. Anyone who even has a marginal understanding of good, high quality cinema knows very well that it is not even mentioned by the Oscars. <br /> <br /> I don't understand where to start. There are just so many things that are wrong and missing in this movie that it's amazing to be even a national prize. Since this film is the best film announced this year, it is to show people the tendency to keep victims of Indian cinema and a little understanding of the people who are blindly evaluating this film. <br /> <br /> The chosen theme is great. Is it important that such films are made? but only people who can handle them. Sandeep Sawant does not measure the task? not even close. His direction is confusing, confused. There is no clear thinking process. He is trying, but unable to study the depth of symbols, especially the grandfather. He is unable to show the original horror, anxiety and then the hopelessness of leaving, and the grandfather's insurmountable courage. He wastes our time in the hospital if we had to show that the time spent together. He's trying to bring everything without priorities. He does not understand his substance correctly and actually reads it. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't help Sawanti. The worst job? Amruta Shubash. He is a terrible actor and a terrible choice for this or some reasonable work. How did he get to "Make Phulran"? Very happy and / or extremely influential and / or extremely poor casting. Having said that, he goes out to make a terrible job in the film. Would his behavior in MSW have gone to a more responsible actor? Sonali Kulkarni. Amruta Subhash didn't understand it. MSW's work is under constant emotional stress, and yet it is important that they work out a calm, strong look because it is soothing for patients. The Subhashi Asawari looks even more frightening and needs more support than the people it works for. <br /> <br /> Another worst? Arun Nalawade. I've never seen a more wooden face in Marathi's film industry (it's pretty and everywhere in today's Hindi cinema). He is a manufacturer and he chose himself; there is no other point, no fee will be charged. Any good actor would have jumped to play this role even when he had to pay for the producer, but Arun Nalawade won't let anyone else do that. Extremely ambitious and terrible, it helps to make the movie more than everyone else. There is no investigation and even basic operational skills in his activities. My choice for this role would be Vikram Gokhale. <br /> <br /> Music is forced. The film is technically incomplete. This could have been the work of the FTII project. <br /> <br /> Up; Great performance by Ashwin Chitale. It is amazing that such a young boy can give such respectful work. He shamed many of today's actors. Unintentionally, maybe he brought his innocence to his character and made it a memorable achievement. Sandeep also gave Kulkarni a really incredible result. Really put all your efforts and shows. The script is also well written. <br /> <br /> The Shoestring budget cannot be an argument for this film. Lack of money for dogs in all Marathi movies. Cricket and Hindi movies are all money and the rest are scraps. This is a regrettable situation, but there is not enough reason to praise any immature movie that comes out. "Doghi" was a brilliant film, and it was also made in the budget of the shoemaker. "Doghi" was also technically missing, but it was well researched and well done. It was rich in detail and was supported by excellent championships and made it a rich cinema. Why didn't he get the highly-earned prizes? ? only proves my purposeful judgment. <br /> <br /> The lack of research, not the availability of funds, makes Shwaase such a bad film.
