This is definitely not a comedy - I don't know what it was marketed. It has no substance as a serious film. If you are not fresh from Sunday school or need to fix your Noah, you will find yourself in tears forever. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast shots removed this little movie. Lauren Graham plays an empty housewife with no real depth. His children didn't add anything to the film. They seem to be just at the beginning of their missing father. Jonah Hill plays a terrible internet addict who doesn't come humorous. <br /> <br /> I found that the original is a decent film. It was disappointed that it wasn't anywhere.
