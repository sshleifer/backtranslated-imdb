Like most other people, I saw this movie "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Although it got some well-earned barbs, this is one of the best films shown at this show. it creates interesting moral dilemmas. Although the score is sometimes intrusive, it also offers some wonderful moments when Richard is walking along the river. When you watch the film, you can see where many developments on the plot probably seemed very good on paper. Richard's discomfort in today's society is an interesting problem to think about, and the end would probably have been a nice 70's entertainment if the previous things were not so funny. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is noticeably cheap, making mistakes even more apparent. The "Clone Farm" is obviously a college campus and beer can be used as the main plot point. Lee and Richard have zero chemistry - we should believe that this is a meeting of relatives' thoughts, but there is no brain cell between them. The "quick old couple" schtick can also be pretty old, real quick. There are also some mistakes that can be blamed on poor routing options, such as the decision to keep a climate conversation out of reach of any audio device. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is superb, but still best viewed in MST3K.
