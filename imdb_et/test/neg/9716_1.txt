This movie was Flippin Awful .... I wanted these lessons from my life. For God's sake - be far from this terrible crumbling ball at all costs. Its title is not worth it, but the ratings of this film are quite generous for such a vomiting pollen. And where do I start? Unknown A ** kids in the movie ..... Zero plot or story? ... garden variety college / frat boy-esquire scenes towel slapping? Or very bad behavior, do I get angst innuendo? $$$ # @% @! My God, it's never finished! ..... I remember thinking I was going to kiss the movie cinema, then sit back. <br /> <br /> But what are you waiting for? Most people with brain potential looking for comments are not target groups here, so GO SEE Pirites 2 or Jet Lee, if your own discussion is taking place. Look, this movie just costs you soul, money, energy and brain cells. WARNING WARNING.
