In general, I do not understand easy attempts to create humorous stories, which means that "Anita no perd el Tren" cannot get very high results for me. The story is good: a middle-aged, but still good-looking woman finds new love. However, attempts to make this movie a romantic comedy were sometimes somewhat comical. <br /> <br /> Rosa María Sardà has really shown she can be a serious actor in products like "Amic / Amat" (qv), "Todo Sobre mi Madre" (qv), "Las Amargas Lágrimas de Petra von Kant "(qv) and" El Embrujo de Shanghai "(qv). However, over the years, the mandates have tended to turn out to be trivial things for cinema and television. Something similar could be said about José Coronado: totally capable of producing serious performances. María Barranco belongs to this group safely. <br /> <br /> The last thing I missed was that I would be really happy to see that the new film making is a serious tone that will allow participants to really showcase their skillful skills. And the curious thing is that it should be done with exactly the same leading players. Destroyed talent for a rather stupid movie that would be really promising.
