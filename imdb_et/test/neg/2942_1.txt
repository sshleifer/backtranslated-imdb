"Twins Effect" is the worst movie I've ever seen! Not only support is weak, but also characters. I'm sorry to tell you Edison fans, but Kazaf is by far the weakest vampire I've ever seen in my life. I'm sorry Edison; Your role in this film was disappointing. Edison doesn't fight at all in this movie and I'm sure that if they didn't have Kazaf in the movie, the plot wouldn't be much different. The film's main plot is hardly explained and the whole film focused too much on Helen and Kazaf's growing relationship. I mean, who the fuck was Kazaf and why did they need their blood? Yes, he's a prince right? So! <br /> <br /> Certain scenes in this movie were just fools. Yes, the action was great, but the whole sketch was stupid. At the end of one scene, Duke tells Deck that Kazaf is the strongest of his brothers ... yes, it seems now that he is full. Why are you waiting until he's grown up? The second scene was with Jackie Chan, one of my personal favorites. In the scene, Jackie asked Helen who were the creatures who had been following them permanently. How can you be so naive that you don't know they are vampires? People die around them with signs near their neck; Certainly there are NEWS on it faster than you can say "Vampire". <br /> <br /> The characters were another mistake in the movie. Helen, played by Charlene Choi, is a Kazaf girlfriend. Which girl is not afraid of vampires, especially if it's your brother's job to kill them? I bet you can't find such a brave girl Helen when you were looking for your whole life. Helen is annoying, bitchy and is the queen of the complete drama of the movie. He is trying too hard to be different and eventually fails. One of the strange and disturbing signs I've seen in every movie. Why are you biting someone's neck, especially if you're not a vampire? It is very strange that his reaction to Kazaf's confession does not preclude him. Kasaf, played by Edison Chen, is another stupid character in the story. How to humiliate a young actor with himself in such a poorly designed role in the film. She does not look at the whole film and does not fight. Although I'm a fan of Edison, I wouldn't want a man who's down all the time. Gypsy and Reeve are my favorite films. Their love is pure and sweet. The gypsy is proud and doesn't try to get Helen too hard. Reeve, played by Ekin Cheng, is smart and seems to be the only person who makes sense in the film. The plot's failure was Reeve's death. The film had no substance, but it was executed by removing one of the only pleasant characters. Another sign was Duke Dekotes. The story didn't focus on her much and therefore made her wish to become Kazaf's "rock" unknown. <br /> <br /> It is very sad because at the end of the movie I forced to watch me because I was so keen to see Kazaf's fight. The end was so steep, because all the time I was so big that it happened. A coffin who is a supposed vampire prince does nothing about the film, and I'm sure if the film is taken out, the film wouldn't be very different. I suggest you not waste your time with this movie as I have. I was very disappointed. If you are looking for a big movie, why not watch the "Lord of the Rings" or "Pirates of the Caribbean?" Sensitive signs with a well written plot.
