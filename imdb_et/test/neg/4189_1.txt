It's by far the worst "horror" movie, not, do it for every movie I've ever watched. Shame on Block Buster even to carry this kind of nonsense. I never ask for a refund for a movie, but I think it's the first. <br /> <br /> The film is so bad that I had to stop after 15 minutes of viewing. <br /> <br /> I had more fun watching YouTube movies than watching this fall. <br /> <br /> The marketing trip for this movie must have some silver to bring it to the business. Blockbuster.
