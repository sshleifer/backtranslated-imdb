The original review I saw for this movie was perhaps a bit harsh, so I am good at saying: Sleepy Hollow is a totally acceptable beer-pizza or sleepover movie that you watch with a good group of people when the mood is light and nobody really focuses to the film. The visual elements are beautiful and partly fun. But horror, my friends, it's not. I made the mistake of looking at something to erase all the lights. If this is your intention, send me a personal message and give you a list of alternative suggestions. (By the way, this is a serious offer. Real horror fans deserve better.) Now my complaints with SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Why trouble even creating a movie based, if you don't even try to stay on the original idea, feeling, tone or theme faith? Listen carefully to the lines of the misspelled dialogue and hear the slowdown of Washington's Irving in his grave. I even accept Big-City Detective, but ... Ricci draws the beds around the bed? Come on now. "Sleepy Hollow Legend" is not just something vague, but it is a historical BUNK. I don't care about what the neo-pagan ax needs to grind, but in the 18th century, "witchcraft" meant selling your soul to the devil in exchange for the devil's forces; This whole fluffy witch-witch-worship-worshiping "no-hurt-no" approach to witchcraft dates back to a historic British invasion. (Participants interested in the pagan traditions of a real old school refer to James Frazer's "The Golden Bough" if you do not believe me.) It creates an insecure element that is thrown into the context of the film that the Sleepy Hollow legend is broken. So we'll end up with a completely different story. If that were Burton's idea, I'd like to have warned us before. I also wish that he would have come out with a better story than the experienced pedestrian. And he could also collapse Irving's claims. And in any case, the film is not scary. Not once. Not at all. The twisted tree came close, but it was offset by the ridiculous effect of Hessian farce-comedy. And finally, yes, I also wanted Christina Ricci to be Christmas, but God obviously didn't mean her blonde.
