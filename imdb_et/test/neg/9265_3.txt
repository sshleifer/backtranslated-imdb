I bought this movie a few years ago and tried to find out about it that I found that even a powerful IMDb is not listed. It should have been all I had to know. <br /> <br /> With friends like they are an anthology that plays like the second-level Twilight Zone / Outer Limits episodes, all of which are interconnected by a bus trip that never seems to be. link to the rest of the movie. Of the three readings, the only thing I found entertaining was the second episode in which the man (s) grew out of the bacteria in the fridge of the pups. This episode won points for some humor points and it is a strange assumption. Besides that there is an episode with a talking car (empty and directed) and an episode where the girl visits a very unique dating agency (my dog ​​thought it was finished). <br /> <br /> As has been mentioned in other comments, 18 ratings are totally unjustified. There's nothing to offend here. If you're after an anthology of fear, look at Asylum or Creepshow movies.
