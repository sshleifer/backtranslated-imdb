Poor Bela Lugosi. Just another day at work. A group of saboters trying to break the American military from within. It is quite difficult to understand at first, because although we know that these men are something, their way of working is simply not clear. I don't break it, but it ends up pretty amazing. Our hero has made some murders. Police force who doesn't know what's going on. What a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and come from the same house. There are comments like: "The true patriot would do it." It is obvious that suspicion is abundant when most of the world does not know spy or undermines when it jumps and bumps. I was also surprised that Clayton Moore (Lone Ranger) has a romantic role. I have never realized that he has ever done anything other than to sit on a horse. Of course, the discomfort of the criminals is because they think they are immune from the killer list. Anyway, Bela is a kind of good boy and a bad guy who rolled in one. The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I don't break it. Like curiosity and a periodic piece, some people may have fun watching.
