The man builds a hotel with his partner. He thinks the hotel is over-insured. Things get worse. This film has a large number of scenes. They must be put together in somebody's sleep. It jumps from place to place. It will not stay focused on anything for a very long time. The end of the Christmas Day begins with the hotel fire. It then cuts it to the night and then cuts the day. The DVD audio track is terrible. It takes a fair plot and becomes the worst movie for a long time.
