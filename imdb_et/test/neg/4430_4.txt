This adaptation of tatty am drama shines through the plot of Dickens' wonderful book, replacing the emotional blow with quick transitions and exterior drawings. It is not the fault of the participants and the production team that the budget is, of course, so low, but you have to ask this question first if there is no time or money to make it fair. Michael Horderni Scrooge is too gentle from the beginning, changing the power of his transformation, and his lack of reaction when he looks at his faces does not help. Other participants range from Acceptable (Clive Merrison, Paul Copley), Non-Commitments (Bernard Lee) to seemingly forgetting their lines (John Le Mesurier). It doesn't even have tightening points to be honest.
