This movie comes from a friend's mother who worked in a charity store. He gave it to us with other unknown cartridges. The film itself is a little garbage. There are some significant bits that would laugh when his girlfriend is drilled with his head, but in general this film is happier. Immediately when I saw the trailer on "The Island", I couldn't notice the similarities. Can Clonus be the inspiration for this movie? All in all, don't worry about watching this movie because it's boring and boring. We liked it as much as we were 16 years ago when we called this band. Another sign of this movie is a bit dirty if the videos on the back of the videos aren't really visible in the movie? weird
