HAPPY DAYS was one of my favorite shows when he appeared in 1974. But critics had quickly shown their ignorance with a complete sense of humor when he showed it because they thought it was an inexpensive attempt to make money into the success of America's GRAFFITTI. <br /> <br /> There were some similarities between American GRAFFITTI and HAPPY DAYS. <br /> <br /> Bill Haley & Comet "Rock Around the Clock" both opened. Both were in the past and both were one of the leading roles in Ron Howard. But there were some great differences. Although American GRAFFITTI was held in California in 1962 and focused on newly graduated high school students who intended to become adults, HAPPY DAYS took place in Wisconson, Milwaulkee and focused on group teenagers in high school. joy and misery of adolescents. <br /> <br /> HAPPY DAYS was originally launched with Juke's box playing Bill Haley & Comets' ROCK's original version. But when the oldies got hot, thanks to the success of the American GRAFFITTI, and the original 1954 ROCK AOCK CLOCK, came to Billboard Hot 100 and hit again in 1974. So the song "remake" (the correct term is now "new stereo recording") was replaced quickly. <br /> <br /> The current memory serves HAPPY DAYS in the second season, when the memory serves me right. <br /> <br /> Similar fans and enemies agree that this exhibitor is. The liberties were taken and the details were ignored, making the exhibition less than completely authentic. <br /> <br /> That's all right. HAPPY DAYS should be a comedy, not a history lesson. Sometimes writers were sometimes hit by controversial issues. One episode focused on the Cunninghams building, which had fallen out. Another episode was the divorced woman's movement to the neighborhood with a dream to start a new life. The budget issue was dealt with when Howard was invited to an old army friend's wedding, which just happened to be black (in an age when prejudices and discrimination were unfortunately part of the American way of life). The question of the project even emerged in a later episode! <br /> <br /> Exhibition originally in 1955. One problem that was wisely addressed was cast. Most of them were teenagers, and every year it was obvious that they grew older, so that the series gets old with pain, moving the series of Eisenhower's safe waters into the Camelot era. then in the worrying 1960s. This, together with the lost writers of ideas and later cast members like Ron Howard, left the series, wisely leaving when they were, leaving me with the desire to have done everything right by pulling the plug on the show and ending when they were ahead. That, along with an idol worshiping studio audience who just couldn't manage himself every time the Great Fonzie entered the scene, very quickly began to wear very nice. <br /> <br /> This exhibition originally represented Fabulous Fifties as our WISH to remember this era. Time heals wounds, you know. Everything is in its place, and although I prefer to hear "original hit forms" over these "new stereo recordings", these "new stereo recordings" worked very well in HAPPY DAYS. And this is where I feel sorry for buying a DVD! Unlike the first season DVD, the original music of the second season has been replaced with music. Although it is nice that the original episodes were restored digitally perfectly, the removal of the original music was destroyed, which showed it to be so fun to watch!
