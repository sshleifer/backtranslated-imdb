After watching the first movie in the BCI's new Aztec Mommy collection, it's hard to believe how excited I was in the set and how I was when the release date was rejected. I've been watching a lot of Mexican horror in recent months. Some big? Curse of a smart woman. Some entertaining despite obvious mistakes? Blood Apeside Night. And some cheeses? Choose any Santo movie. One thing that all these films have in common is that none of them can be called "boring". Well, this is not the Actek mommy. It has been a while since I last looked at something that sleeps induce. I didn't expect or expected a big movie, but at least entertain me! The Aztec mommy takes all the situations that might be of interest and sucks this life through a repetitive scene where people do nothing and then extend these scenes as they do to eternity. I think this happens when you make an 80-minute movie with just 30 minutes of material. Additional material! For example, if someone has seen a movie, for what purpose is Batil other than disguised wrestler type taking on screen and duration extension in 15 or so useless minutes? <br /> <br /> I can only hope that the other two collections of movies are more interesting than this.
