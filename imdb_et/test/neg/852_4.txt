It was a mish mash movie that started somewhere, disappeared, then suddenly found a plot in the last five minutes when the title tag was finally introduced. In this movie, there were so many ugly, sheep-cut boys, I lost who was the owner and who were the supervisors. I have a casting theory; all the bad guys were played by ugly actors (and one ugly actor) and all the good guys / victims were played by beautiful actors. Indeed, the actors, the slaves, who played the most sacrifices, were proud of being the daughter of an innocent priest, while the owner of the plantations, his minipulative mistress, and his supervisors were quite difficult for the eyes. On purpose? You call. <br /> <br /> I hung up to the end and some others can do it. If you just want to look at the bare breasts, there are a lot of them and if you have a slave / master fetish, you will love this movie. Otherwise, check it once, vomit, take a shower and do not tell anyone.
