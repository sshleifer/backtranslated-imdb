I was so excited to see it because it's the only movie I've seen in Mansfield Park. I suffered the first four episodes, but when it came to the scene between Henry and Fanny, I looked and had to turn it off. Whoever uses this Sylvestra Le Touzel woman must be both dark and sad because she is the worst actor I've ever seen in my life. The whole thing is just bad, bad, bad. I do not know. I just don't know why people who write Jane Austen's scenarios are unable to give their work the respect they deserve.
