Flashdance is one of those terrible, stupid movies you really enjoy, just because they're so messy. I just watched it on television and my friend and I was surprised how it was. It is true that Don Simpson and other manufacturers came up with the idea quite cheaply, with low glow, with lots of sweaty bodies to help sell (admitedly memorable) pop music, so Flashdance is a strange pioneer: the first MTV Film. Adrian Lyne started advertising and shows that Flashdance is almost commercial. You've already decided to watch it, but the movie has this strange panic, as if you were scared that you could change your mind at any time. It sells to you over and over again, all the time using sliding commercial style editing and shiny breasts close-ups. The story is thin (I can't honestly think of another film I've ever seen with the plot) and it never makes sense, but its a very complicated, computational film, so it seems consistent. People say it's dated, but Flashdance was always a garbage. In the early 1980s, viewers saw it was just a cheesy R&D, but it works in its stupid way. There's a dirty romance for a chick-flick crowd and fatty, twisted female bodies for those dates, all put in a pump disc. How did it fail? This makes the dialogue meaningless so that you can lose something bigger from the popcorn and if such a thing is not your cup, you can always laugh at "interpretive dances". The scene where Jennifer Beals stand-in plays on the front of a TV in front of a fan and a face full of white clown make-up, we had stitches. True guilty pleasure.
