(The spoiler may start ...) <br /> <br /> "The Eye 2" is the sequel to The Eye. It is about a pregnant woman who is able to see the spirits and spirit after she happened to her. <br /> <br /> The sound effects frightened me a little, although this is the only scary thing. Some prequel scenes are relatively similar and repetitive, so the cooling effect is definitely chilled. <br /> <br /> "Eye" is a pretty scary and indelible impression, while "The Eye 2" is a forgotten horror-cum-drama movie. Don't look at it. Looking at the "eye" is good enough.
