It starts interesting because there is someone else's house next to a carnival with oil shed, and some shop church across the street with the neon "Jesus saves", all in one small area ... Now it's pretty dazzling if it's unlikely ... and then we go straight to a movie that takes unlikely new levels. Of course, this is a remake of the 1979 thriller, starring Carol Kane as a babysitter, Jill Johnson .... now Jill is a few chicks running so high in his cell phone minutes that his evil parents are punishing him for doing his job. probably something the audience can target this movie. Jill is taken to this large and fancy house by the lake, where her father is not for the family of Mandrakis. The kids are already in bed when Jill arrives, and all the households are still there. Of course, despite the distant location, one of Jill's friends with whom he probably has problems like "boy stealing" or something. Anyway, the house alarm goes off without a reason and then starts calling from someone who wants to kill him. Of course, Jill calls the police, and since he has not taken any real threat to his life, they will kill them, but tell him to call back if there is something they can do for him. Check out the scene where Jill invited his friends to a high school campfire / pepper rally or whatever it should be, a "Burning Man" festival, ?? !! ?? There are all kinds of frightening fears, including the cool cat Chester, who is here and there, of course, one of the tired "horror" clich√©s. I admit that I stopped off at some point during this time and did I miss anything? It's really hard to say or maintain. This is one of those films that makes me think how bad the "Amityville Horror", "Wax House" or "The Fog" remakes are. Anyway, reading online reads seems to be the people who were the most horrified, were 12-year-old girls, and I can only assume that such statements as "it made me pee in my pants". Well, one can only hope that it will end the Hollywood transformation of films that were not exactly in the characters at the beginning, but don't predict it. 2 out of ten and I'm too generous.
