I liked the fact that Laura Linney was playing "in love", but she is a "Man" of the year. <br /> <br /> But wow. Robin Williams does not give much of this performance, with a few minor exceptions. Laura Linney may not have failed, but the editing raped her character or it was just the sad presentation of Head Barry Levinson. <br /> <br /> And I think it was Barry Levinson's old one. With so many weak results, such uneven results must be the guilt of management. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum have great supportive roles. Goldblum plays a joyful side and the combination of Walken's entertainment manager and movie commentator is great. <br /> <br /> But the story is a clich√©, the presentation looks like it might have been (should be) a good picture and too many activities are halfway. Tension, story, and direction are just weak, saying "Head Office" ("The Secret of My Success").
