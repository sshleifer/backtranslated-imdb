I am currently watching this movie and I have no hesitation in reviewing it. Functioning is ridiculous. Half the cast must be retired porn actors and you can imagine the quality of the action you take out of porn. <br /> <br /> Graphics are different from what I have ever seen. I think there are more jokes with more faith. They can't even afford the weapons they shoot with the pathetic apologies of monsters. Maybe I should also notice how incredible it is to see how many "bullets" their pistols can hold. <br /> <br /> When asked to say a movie summary, someone would have robbed a local no-hope group at a local county fair, hit them on the island, added unnecessarily intense music, and let the 6-year-old edit. <br /> <br /> I can't honestly tell you why this movie was released, recorded on DVD, and cost $ 6 from my local video store in one day. If I have benefited from the fact that I know that I am a lot wiser than many of the parties involved in the film. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie with high intensity. Why? I wish I knew that Captain, I wish I knew.
