I haven't looked at STARCRASH (1979) - the famous Italian language that takes STAR WARS (1977), but it can't be much worse than the wrong spam that says that Mel Brooks makes so-called ATTENTION (1987) look like a real work of art! In fact, the main reason why GALAXINA is remembered today is due to the tragic fate of her leading lady - Playboy centerfold Dorothy Stratten, who died of her frantically jealous stranger spouse - before the film's official premiere! While Statten (who later had two biology, depicted by Jamie Lee Curtis and Mariel Hemingway) plays a role, the first half of the film is reduced to being supported by the chair, apparently traveling on a 27-year trip to a planet or other; in fact, Galaxina is a universal android who also serves unpleasant teams for their snacks, gets them all hot under the collar and even goes through the Blue Star (cue choral music) examination when they land! Having said this, Statten certainly looks luminous in her white clothing, and even if her role does not require almost any kind of talent she may have, it is not quite humiliating. <br /> <br /> However, it is ironic that the film that bears his name overshadows the members of his co-workers and fellow citizens, especially the annoying captain Cornelius Butt (which gives you an idea of ​​the comedy level shown here), the long-eared sports-colored boy, smoking, old Chinaman quoting the proverb and the best (relatively talkable) unpleasant mouth, rock eating, hairy stranger they're capturing. A piece of scraper is a metal clad non-unit that still has the best laugh in the film when it shouts the choral music after mentioning each of your characters, "What is ** t?" "There is little point in listing the sci-fi classics that this stinker has corrupted in his ridiculous attempts because they are not only flat, but obvious; it is incredibly enough to chest a chest, but ultimately a benign alien, Angelo Rossitto, plays a benign alien!" br /> <br /> Because of what is worth, the scenes on the planet are visiting the landscape of the western planet) is a yellowish, sunny tone and its inhabitants are "human gourmets" (delicacies in their menu are Leather and tonic, Scotsman on rocks, Reie Pies, Baked Alaska, etc.), not to mention a motorcycle gang who serves his specific deity (Harley Davidson) and when our heroes are fleeing on its back, they will not dare shoot them because they are afraid of beating their "Lord". ..
