TV commercials from this movie showed that trucks hit the truck on the head, then they began to break into bits and reform the truck on the other side. I thought the special effects were good, but the overall style of the movie was pointless. It's a "Charmed" TV series with three girls instead of three girls. <br /> <br /> A big surprise for the three teenagers who become adults is that the clan has a fourth member who is unknown and who has the power to consolidate them. In addition to driving on lorries, these children can drive up the sides of the houses, climb out the window, push each other into the chimneys and make their neck veins out. But if they use their power too often, they become prematurely old and weak. One boy's father is proof of this because he is sitting in an attic that looks like a mummy, but he's only 45 years old. <br /> <br /> The three good warfare layers are all dirty rich in his own right, completely corrupted, unpleasant and annoying. In every public school, these children are beaten every day. Their glares and face ticks did not cut the mustard with the hooded boys. Unfortunately, all those good guys were sent to these Charming Boys at the Hogwart Reform School, where they couldn't get to the Harry Potter class. <br /> <br /> What was the film then? Three teenagers and their girlfriends. Another teenager who bothered with his power and money and is a lost relative. For some scenes where the Charmed boys show their power and have sex with their girlfriend; The film goes around the revenge of the teenagers of unknown soldiers. Predictable things happen. Poor ambush strikes different friends of other military locks and eventually starts attacking them. The final confrontation is taking place and it concerns it. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not bad, but something special. If you want to see fireballs, spiders and blue veins, this is a good movie to watch.
