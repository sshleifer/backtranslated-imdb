Troy Helen follows the outbreak of Helen and the Trojan War. It is more of a love story between Helen and Paris who is unhappy and falls in love with Helen, not knowing she is a queen. The film depicts a couple as love and does not want anything more than being together. (Other movies and books have different characters, but they are just hopelessly in it.) The film is moving in some places quite slowly, but battles and landscape details are pretty good. There are also good results. I thought the slave girl was doing a very good job, and she was one of the most pleasant signs. <br /> <br /> Generally, it is a good customization if you can look at a slow moving track beyond places and look beyond some fun romance and dialogue. I don't think Iliad's perfect version has been created yet, but it's fun and has some good bits.
