I've read a number of comments that ask: "Why was this movie made?" I myself found that the question, which seems to me to be sensitive, seems like the hour and twenty-minute function seemed to be in the middle, but gave the feeling that it finally rose when it really didn't do anything like that. So, "Why was this movie made"? I think this is a big question for those who look at Heftig og begeistret to ask themselves. This reviewer is proud of the director Knut Erik Jensen, who gave us hope, fraternity and inspiration for this male choir, but I don't think Jensen made a gripping story. Let me ask you this question: "Does the public need more than just a straightforward story of interest in a documentary?" My answer is yes, and this is where Jensen failed. Heftig og begeistret was a good documentary, but it wasn't much. Jensen did terrible work on the subject story and devotion. It was nice to hear the songs, but over time these songs seemed boring, overwhelming, and a bit irrelevant. From the opening scene, where our men sing their hearts in dazzling snow, I knew I was hooked, but when the film evolved, I lost interest. Why? Jensen didn't take us, audience members, to the next level. He kept the playground level and ultimately damaged the overall tone of the movie. Was it a movie about music or choir men? The world may never know. <br /> <br /> Again, I would like to say that Jensen did a phenomenal job to find an interesting story about this group of men who have definitely seen the difficult times and how they dealt with music, but it would be like all male choirs who would be ever created the most boring men. Jensen gave us great music, but the characters, the themes, didn't know anything at the end of the movie. We had a 97-year-old man who still had a driver's license, we had a big man bathing in classic American songs, we had old men who had ever heard of their youth, we had a little tension between the young. cream and veteran singers, and we even had a former drug addict who had been clean for only eleven years. Did Jensen develop these interesting stories at all? No, he left them on the table. It was obvious that these singers were ready to talk about it (see a political man who didn't have his political days), but Jensen seemed to be away from their affectionate moments and headed back to interesting places where he could sing the choir. I was defined at the beginning of the movie, I wanted to introduce them and listen to the stories of their individual men. They were all exciting, but Jensen seemed to ignore them completely. <br /> <br /> By ignoring the main themes of this documentary, Jensen was finally unsuccessful. Without giving up, I felt Jensen was coloring the lines. Instead of being bold outside the lines, he did not decide to create compassion, emotion, nervousness, or sadness. Jensen took our items from A to B to C, asking us to participate in some way. I see how national sentiment made this film a great success in Norway, but looking at everyone else (ie ME) was absolutely necessary. I wanted to feel for these boys. I wanted to know if they were going to drive well when they were traveling, or just to find that they loved their city. There was no story, mostly partly without theme development. If you look at contemporary documentaries (weird, this film was made in 2001), you want it to play like a Hollywood movie. You want Heftig og begeistret to get something like this, for realism and drama. <br /> <br /> In general, I have to ask the question again: "Why is this movie made?" My last response to Alex is that Jensen wanted to show how troubling times and a changing economy can still produce happiness even in the coldest places on Earth. I think Jensen wanted to show a human commitment and how something as simple as singing can be combined. That's what Jensen said perfectly in the movie, but he didn't create a good documentary. When you do this kind of movie, I feel you need to look at the group, explore the choir's participants and hear each of your stories to bring to the end what grabs your heart. The only thing this movie captured was my attention because it was trying to rush at the speed of the room. Again, I don't want to have a negative sound on this movie because the music was great and the singing of the men gave me a sense of honesty, but I needed more. As documentaries become part of the film community, it looks a little more than what Heftig og begeistret gave us. I want to see reality and people, not just one song and dance routine! <br /> <br /> Rating: ** *****
