Although this film (and I use this term loosely) was made in 1997, we first looked at it this evening. My husband commented that Tommy Lee Jones's film, which we never heard, made him a little frightening. I looked forever, sure if Jones was in the movie, it must be at least two hours worth of time. After all, he has been one of our actors for years. Although Heche is not my favorite actor, I confirmed another well-known face. The list of accomplished actors / actors continued to grow, so I wore more of this movie, sure that if I pulled out enough clich√©s and trite social statements, I'd win the other. Unfortunately, there was no plot. It seems to have been burning constantly by the exhausting stage. <br /> <br /> The characters were thin. The plot had so many holes that it literally disturbed most of the special effects and acted in the film. Was the fee for a short consultation with a science teacher for the budget of this film too big? Acid rain is not ... poisonous gases (like sulfur or hydrogen chloride) ... no deadly ashes ... no heat from the skin just a few meters from the lava. Wow ... it's a world-friendly stage ever! <br /> <br /> Events were no better than characters. Every incident was so established and far-fetched ... it's like writers said, "Okay, we have to get rid of the little girls now ..." and the poof, he's on the stage bomb that burns enough for him to have a safe ( not a lava, but his helpless stupor) ... but just a moment later in the car, he is obviously not painful and soon after, runs through the building effortlessly! no!) has exploded. After all this has been done, at the end of your reward, there is a little boy (about all the people who are looking for the same) ... which must be one of the worst movie features I've ever heard. Even if it wasn't such a painful script, it was a ridiculous timing for everyone involved. Kid and the police aside, as if the mother was still in the area and just had to draw attention because she wasn't talking ... what ... she hopes she slips into the shadows and away a little once and for all? I do not belive. Obviously, the child's mother would be lost or dead - or yelling at her head to find her toddler. <br /> <br /> A black gangsta with a hoodlum hoodlum that has a secret soft spot compared to its shoulder wedge, a narrow enemy who is a clever secret soft spot scene that made my eyes bleed. Even if such pats existed, they would not behave as the film depicts these circumstances. Something about the imminent death and massive destruction tends to catch people, you know? <br /> <br /> There are too many conserved movie moments to mention ... really, it's just an embarrassing movie. These poor writers ... where are they now?
