I gave it 2 stars out of the possible 10. <br /> <br /> I went to not understand what it was - and discovered that it was probably some sort of African musical because people would break the song every few minutes. br /> <br /> No song rhymes, most of them don't say anything reasonable and they all have the same non-existent setup - if you could call it "setup". <br /> <br /> Carmen is a tall, remarkably built young woman with longer braids. [The actor looks like he'd probably done some modeling.] <br /> <br /> The film opens in a women's jail, although it doesn't like any prison I've ever seen or heard - prisoners wear what they want - And it looks like a party. <br /> <br /> Carmen makes a nice dance and a prison female nurse, Angelique, [a wonderfully beautiful woman] is definitely interested in eroticism. She and Carmen are dancing together. Later Karmen visits the caretaker's room and loves - unfortunately, the scene is not detailed and it is very short, although there is some nudity. <br /> <br /> Carmen then escapes from prison and the next one will see her dancing in front of another group, where a man named Lamine, perhaps a colonel, was never clear about who she was, looking at her. She's with a younger woman who doesn't like Carmen's seductive dance and there is a dance party between two women. <br /> <br /> After that, the story [as it is] becomes even more confusing. <br /> <br /> What is Lamine in prison, out of prison and who knows where. <br /> <br /> Carmen may be involved with smugglers or thieves. <br /> <br /> More dancing and the Angelique scene, which probably suffers from heartache. <br /> <br /> The film rebuilds its way to finishing and I punished the relief that was over. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
