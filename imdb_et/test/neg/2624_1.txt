A lazy filmmaker made a lazy film. The characters are grotesque. Despite the tragic situation of this war, the film has no emotions at all. The insignia is artificial and ineffective (and an old Bosnian woman who gives her child a picture of Arbor, "concretizes" her willingness, her mother wakes up, the body of the worms, to show the fear of genocide ... a lot is sometimes worst than inadequate.) <Br /> <br /> This movie is just an advertisement, an empty mix for a woman who is not a hero. He worked for the United Nations. Remember that the UN was not able to protect the civilian population of Srebrenica. Who are the real heroes of this war? Canadian judge who led the post-death trial of atrocities, mainly because his organization was unable to prevent them? Where's the criticism of this movie?
