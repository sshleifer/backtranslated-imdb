Ocean 12 starts tedious and worsens from there. Like the presentation of celebrity awards, every major actor / actor is introduced in short 60-second scenarios that seem to cease only with a short, blinking "praise now" sign. The first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly divergent, poorly edited, and sometimes completely related to the story and confusing. The story tells you ... is one, glove, ... but hardly visible to all "look at me" frames and cameos. Only Matt Damon actually seemed to be a "act" during the movie ... the rest of the participation seemed to be there only to participate in a rat-pack-wanna-be session. As for hockey, action, drama .... it was put on film in the last 8-10 minutes and was pathetic and anti-cyclical. Terrible! Terrible! Terrible!
