In general, I prefer horror films that hit me so much that I am afraid of the next day or not, not those where people are stupid and kill the indestructible monster. This is one of those movies. Legend chupacabra is a dog-shaped lizard-green-gray monster, like a canopy with hairs and claws, a series of sharp nails that come out from behind and absorb the blood of the herd. Like many fears, good and bad, this film is free of legend. Not only does it attack people, it eats its gut and it has a bulletproof, almost indestructible constitution. So tell me how a hypodermic needle can penetrate your skin when the balls fail? And why, when the Navy thinks the armor-piercing bullets can hurt it, do they divide so that chupacabra can take them one by one? John Rhys-Davies gives a play that goes over a bad movie, and Chelan Simmons and Dylan Neal deserve their performances. Otherwise, the rest of the actor was bad bad, as was the rest of the movie. My rating is based on Rhys-Daviesel, Simmons and Neal.
