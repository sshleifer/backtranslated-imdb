Shame. Here is an interesting idea, but it is completely lost in the confusion of Commodore 64-style computer effects and poor storytelling. As it is, the soul touches the tombstone. It should be a fairly simple hunter / cool story, but the director and / or the writer seem to have forgotten what the film should be like when they shot for about three days. Things are not helped by the fact that the main baddie looks like he is wearing a cheap Darth Maul mask that they tried to hide with flowing CG colors. Not much to suggest here, even the title seems to pull this shadow.
