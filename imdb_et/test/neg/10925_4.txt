I really mean, really, really high and this movie is fun entertainment. I don't mean high, I mean high, where reading a phonebook would make you sew. otherwise save time out of your life and do something more constructive, such as striking your head on the table and offending your intelligence. A complete waste of talents in some cases (Bernie Mac, John C. McGinley, Tom Kenny and Captain Shatner) and exactly what they deserve (numerous rapists who demand movies). Not without that laugh (again, chemical help is crucial) and certainly not without violating politically sensitive (which I always support), but ultimately it is not worthy of its life.
