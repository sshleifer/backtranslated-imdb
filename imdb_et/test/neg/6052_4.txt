The problem with this movie is that it tries to make a 6+ hour movie for 2 hours. The result is clear. It seems too forced, unclear and too simple. <br /> <br /> The only plus is the start. This explains well why and how Hercules was born. The rest of the movie was ... just a mumbo jumbo that has been put together. It can be a great movie, like LOTR, if it is not forced for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Operation is not very convincing either. OK is not all bad. But most of them are. The special effects are foolish and look like it was done ten years earlier (although the first monster is pretty good), I give 4 out of the above reasons.
