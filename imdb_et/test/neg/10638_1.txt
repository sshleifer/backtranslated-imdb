this film is so bad and Hellraiser part 1 to 3 are so big. Nothing is good for Bloodline ... a lot of gore, but without meaning and most of the time without originality. the film has a past, the present (1996) and the future of the puzzle box. The creator of the box and his successor are fighting with some demons, but nothing seriously links the 3 stories. Pinhead is in the movie ... but it's not Pinhead, he's just a boring bad guy who kidnaps kids and kills the birds, and the worse ... he's talking too much. The thing I really didn't understand is why the dog in hell ????? He can't be cobobids because he had nothing to do with him. Why can a dog be killed with death if another hell creature can accept slogans without problems ????? Bloodline is in many ways contradictory to the film series. For example, Pinhead and Angelique are an old friend of this movie, but it's impossible that Pinhead met Angelique because Pinhead is just the first world war and Angelique is an old demon and he lives in Paris sometimes like 200 years.
