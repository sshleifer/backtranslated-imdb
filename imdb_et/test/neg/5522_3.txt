"Happy Days" have been produced and sent since the mid-1970s to the early 1980s and seem to be more ridiculous with age. At the time of sending, most of the spectators who grew up in the 1950s were family-middle-aged, and Mel's Diner scenes apparently brought them artificial nostalgia. Fonz was, of course, the coolest cooler (though actress Henry Wrinkler has never learned to ride a motorcycle to date). Richie Cunningham was an American American blond-haired child who would probably be elected president of the student body. Potsie was Richie's best friend - the star of the show must be the best friend I think. And Ralph Malph was a bumblebee of Fonzi, if not the whole group. I loved it when Fonz beat the poor Ralph Malph. And there was Mel, a middle-aged who ran to Mel's Diner. And of course, who could forget the appearance of Mork? Was it really 1950? It is ironic that films produced in the 1950s, such as "Rebel Without a Cause" and "The Wild One" are better off with age and represent a period more honestly than the exhibition produced 20 years after its submission. > <br /> Unfortunately, "Happy Days" is not in the same league as "Rebel Without Cause" or "American Graffiti". "Happy Days" may have received some aspects of the 1950s with their burger, juke boxes, cool cars, and sticky square shirts, but it is more nostalgic idealism that is rather a laugh than an honest representation. "American Graffitti" had something to say about young Americans in the 1950s, while "Happy Days" seemed more like what the middle-aged people of the 1970s wanted to like in the 1950s. The result was a kind of irrigated production that has nothing to do with the 1950s. "Happy Days" is at best a comedy fantasy based on the artificial culture of the 1950s. As noted by another reviewer, the American child Richie Cunningham would probably have been guilty of being friendly, such as Fonzie. And Mel would probably have banned Fonzie from entering his canteen. <br /> <br /> Fast History: "Happy Days" was originally a pilot named "Love on Happy Days" that was broadcast. Comedy pilots related to gender and romance issues, which did not make it a pilot network, sometimes appeared in the rarely sent "Love American Style", often presented in place of baseball games that had failed or other unexpected programming cancellations and / or changes. In short, the "American Style of Love" was a visual exhibition that included all those one-episode comedy pilots who never did it for a pilot run. "Love on Happy Days" appeared at the beginning of the 1970s as a "Love American Style" exhibition, but at the same time TV managers could not predict how the exhibitions of the 1950s would be popular, especially at a time when comedy shows a focus on middle-aged people such as "Mary Tyler Moore Show "(and the following spin-offs like" Rhoda ")," Bob Newhart Show "and" All in Family ". (How things have changed, as most TV channels are young and the industry prevents most middle-aged people from showing off like a plague!) Next, one of the young letters "Love Happy Days", the child's actor "The Andy Griffith Show ", named Ron Howard, was given the opportunity to film in a film about young people who took place in 1959, called" American Graffiti ", led by a relatively unknown George Lucas, whose previous" THX 1138 "was a bit bombarded by a boxer. , the studios could not see again how the film of the 1950s became popular because it was not popular in the past, although they did not realize that a large part of the film environment was young in the 1950s. As everyone knows, the film was a big hit and studio leaders admitted somewhere "Graffitti" during the theater trip, television leaders realized that their vault had a comedy pilot that was much like "Americ" An Graffitti ". They brought it back to the original pain and Henry Wrinkler as" The Fonz ", renamed" Happy Days ", and the rest is TV History because it became one of the most popular examples of the 1970s. "Happy Days" now seems ridiculous. The characters are flat and cardboard, never more than superficial. The questions they deal with are insignificant. And their reactions seem frantic and even stupid. Today, Fonz's character seems to be the Fonz's caricature. Was the idea to be a kind of parody of Marlon Brando's character "The Wild One"? Looking at the exhibition with fresh eyes, I feel that the manufacturers really had a great opportunity to introduce the depth and realism of the 1950s, which can be fun and fun. Instead, the manufacturers chose cheap laughs for quick bucks. This is definitely an exhibition that has not tested time. "American Graffitti" has many "Happy Days" looks, but he had an edge. It was honest with the characters and their problems. "Happy Days" took the look of "American Graffiti" but couldn't accept his heart.
