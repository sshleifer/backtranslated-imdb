Thomas Edison can make many great inventions, but WTF is it !! I'm sorry, but this movie is just terrible. The plot is that this elephant walks to a certain point and gets electricity. Okay The picture quality looks like someone who used it on toilet paper. I thought the early Charlie Chaplin films were terrible. Okay, Thomas Edison can be an inventor, but why did he make the film he could have filmed for a baby while being Fed & it would have been better. People may say I'm tough at times, but would you enjoy something I've said that Edison can make a light bulb, but why did he make that special movie. Well I may seem like a full A ## hole But watch it on Youtube Then you see this abomination. I still can't believe this movie. All in all, the worst short film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10
