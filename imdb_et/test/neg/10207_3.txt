I remember when they came out, they did a lot. They showed clips every week on WWF TV and everyone was excited. He made his debut at No. 2 at the Indiana Jones and the last Crusade at the opening weekend. Then he made him nervous. Critics HATED this movie. I don't remember one good overview. Everyone agreed that it was bad and sometimes grotesque. I didn't know they meant at that time, but now I've done it because the film makes references to gay bars, women get hard and almost raped and nasty looking for a bar with flooded urinals. When I was younger, I don't care about it. It was Hulkamania, brother !!! <br /> <br /> Now I think it's pretty bad, but it's still fun to see if it's related to Bodyslam (which has a better story). First of all, Hulk Hogan's operational skills are simply not great. he is one-dimensional like the character he plays in a wrestling round. And actually, Rip and Hulk are not far apart. Kurt Fuller is a good actor but he is not a good guy playing good. He is a better comedy and nervous drama characters. He's not just believable as Brell. There are not many characters in this film and those who suffer are characters from Randy, Rippi's brother and Charlie (in their wrestling who didn't hear the trainer who went around with the wrestler lol). Tiny Lister plays Zeus as he should play, so there's no problem there. Joan Severence is satisfying and she has a lingerie scene for all your son's actions. Finally, you see what this point is? <br /> <br /> For this (as with other wrestling films or movies that are the main characters), turn your brain off. You'll enjoy it more than you do.
