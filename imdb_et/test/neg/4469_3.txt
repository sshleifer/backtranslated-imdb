(very serious spoilers) <br /> <br /> This movie was a big disappointment. There are so many problems that I don't know where to start. so I'm talking about what's good about the movie. <br /> <br /> The cast was great. steve martin offers really funny results from the Middle Ages, the upper classes, the dark white man. Queen Latifah plays great, beautiful, urban, black gal. and eugene liver, well he plays himself. add betty white and jean smart and you have a big cast - everyone played their parts really well. and if you look at these men for 1.75 hours, you're worth $ 8, then you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> But the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes. First of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone. all white people are upright. all black people are ghetto ebony speakers. blacks are hips, cool, together and poor. whites are nerds, rigid and rich. (except for the eugene liver, he has clearly taken the queen latifa and "speaks lingo" - so latifa shouts him "freak", so - if you are a white man and you like black women and you know the street slang you have to be freak). the film has striking racial weaknesses with black cast members, and vice versa are white images under the mores and breasts. <br /> <br /> Dismiss the race card to watch the movie's main mistake: they destroy the latifa character. he reaches the martini home with the wrong pretext, but martin admires him anyway. he should be wrongly accused of robbery, martin takes over. 3/4 doing a movie that explains that the latifa character escaped from prison. so our compassion for him goes out of the window. <br /> <br /> There is no real plot. film plods along the scene scene where latifa appears in some places where he should not (like a country club or a martini house) and a martin who tries to hide him. this is the current gag. then the last minutes of the film will decide that they will eventually deal with the latifa claim that he was wrongly accused of bank robbery. martin goes under cover as a homeboy to get a latifa ex-boyfriend (be it face, unusable) confession, and everyone is happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Finally (but with this flick much more wrong) this movie seems to be clips from other movies. the assumption is clearly borrowed from some other martini movie "janitor". where goldie hawn lives with martini and shakes his stodgy middle class life. martin and latifa meet online - the area "youve got mail". The whole "exotic babysitter rich man's life" stretches far beyond "music sound" and "mary poppins". <br /> <br /> I can't see this movie again for free.
