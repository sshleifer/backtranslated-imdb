Visitors have a hard, hard movie to enjoy. It is so slow and leading when I was drifting from time to time during the movie. It was around 11:00 on a hot, sunny day, I could add, not at midnight on a cold winter night, so you understand how this movie is slow. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that it's not long. After 100 minutes it is just ten minutes longer than the average, and it's only fifteen minutes longer than boss Darkwolf, which I was very happy to see the day before. It simply draws a lot of fun to lose. <br /> <br /> If this does not lead to the development of the S-L-O-O atmosphere, visitors will be good enough to almost apologize for the slow things happening. While the setbacks are as cheap and annoying as the way Radha Mitchell's woman's rounding boats, ghosts / aliens / whatever is actually quite creepy and effective, especially when her suicide mother rises and starts to wither at night. Complete signs that won't let make-up across the store. One man's boat is a horrible place and sometimes the film uses the full power of the film and the abandoned sea to scare your soul. <br /> <br /> However, I find it difficult to recommend Visitors. Not only did I feel like I was just watching a 4-hour movie, not a 100-minute movie, but also the feeling of being somehow deceived, like providing many explanations about wolves (Mind Games? Real Spirits? Space Foreigners?) don't choose any for a particular. Anything that looks at Radha Mitchell talking to her cat and Dominic Purcell is obviously not an unexplained terrible event, for nothing? Say what you like about Shyamalan, but at least he'll tell you what happened, though crazy / stupid what you think. If you don't watch these movies, your fresh perspective will improve things a bit, but I found it slow, boring and highly derived. If you want to frighten yourself, there are many better places, if you want a smart thriller, it's a lot brighter.
