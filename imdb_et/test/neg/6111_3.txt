For a while I couldn't see this movie, although it has been quite successful and has been the subject of many discussions in Israel. I'm sorry I didn't stop seeing it endlessly. <br /> <br /> Kadoshi's theme is very real and painful for someone who knows the Jewish religious world - the place of women in the Orthodox family in society. The main situation in the film rooms is possible, the problem is that the way it appears on the screen and the "solution" that the conflicts described in the movie are wrong. Gitai does not seem to have too much sympathy for the men of the religious world, but his approach to choosing characters who are either fanatical or unable to express their human feelings makes the whole story easy. He also does not provide much better service to his women, although he has at least more compassion here and also has two beautiful and talented actors in Yael Abecassis and Meital Bard. In general, Gitai's vision is too one-sided, his cinema means it's too simple, the technical details of the Jewish religious life that may be of interest to people who don't know them, but are not at all relevant. the whole story. Starting from interesting spaces, we are here a boring film that seems to be longer than the very static mode of action, obsessive use of music that plays in the same register not only from a musical, but also from an emotional perspective and a very unclear, if not even confusing ending. What is the difference between this film and "Ha Ushpizin" has inspired and described the same social landscape and managed to convey human feelings on the screen. There are too few cinemas and too few human emotions in Kadoshi.
