Harmony Korine. I'm not sure what he's trying to do with this movie. If that were to make my good day's feeling a night of disturbing memories, if I thought he had succeeded. <br /> <br /> I know that in this movie, there were big questions about who we really are, what we are here, really God. All the big questions, but I really don't think it's funny if you have any questions about such a tragedy. I want to see real life, but come on. It's never funny if a woman is raped, someone kills herself (and the family and friends find the body) and people die for unexplained and unnecessary reasons. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was this location filmed. There are lots of beautiful places. <br /> <br /> I am not a student of the film and I don't know all this as much as I admit, but I know that if I left the theater disgusting, it wasn't a movie I would recommend to anyone.
