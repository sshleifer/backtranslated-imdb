"People rushed through a country house discover that the home was facing years of unsolved murders. During dinner, the lights disappeared and when they come back, they discover that one of those destroying their lives is trying to find out the secrets behind death before others may occur, "according to a summary of DVD sleeves. <br /> <br /> This is a murder in the "Old Dark House" story where "Play in the game" is the most interesting feature. However, the direction is quite common, which highlights the low cost of production. Like most such movies, there are (or should be) interesting signs. Only the old-time Broadway producer Richard Carle (like Herman Wood) and his fey secretary Johnny Arthur (like Homer Erskine) retain interest. <br /> <br /> **** Ghost Walking (12/1/34) Frank R. Strayer ~ Richard Carle, Johnny Arthur, John Miljan
