In an effort to build a large shopping center or complex or something like this, a wealthy landowner ignores the ancient American artifacts buried in the land, and frees the bone-eater ... a creature who goes around and kills people who are looking for their fallen friends or something. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this movie was supposed to be a Sci-Fi Channel original. If that were not the case, the director would never have to drive again. The film's effect is at best ridiculous and the Bone Eater monster is nothing more than CGI animated, which is added to the frames later. The actors don't even see what scares them when they see it (probably because they don't really do it, and they're just terrible actors). This is a great comedy, even if it should be a pure horror.
