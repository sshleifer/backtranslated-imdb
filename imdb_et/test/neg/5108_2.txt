This thing bites me! I'm sorry I ever sat down and watched it! Friedkin was crazy when he made a film that tried to get the audience's sympathy to this madness. If it were for me, I would have hated the audience for this low life instead of getting all the blurry eyes on her! He killed people! Quite grizzly I can add! And Friedkin wants you to saddle him because he's not right! I say Friedkin can forget it! I hate this man, who is partly based on this film, and hope they made wisdom and give their cardboard juice! Don't waste your time in a nut shell! It's sick and perverted!
