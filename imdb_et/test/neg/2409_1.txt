If you were trying to make a bad movie, you couldn't do the worst. I can't imagine someone paying good money to see such a trash in the theater. The thing that really arises for you is that we look at the whole thing just because of this astonishment to see how bad it can get. The redeeming side of this movie saw the words "The End"
