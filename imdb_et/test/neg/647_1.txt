My wife and I saw it in the theater when it first came out. <br /> <br /> There were only 3 pairs and we all walked out at the same time. <br /> <br /> This is the only movie I've ever been out of. <br /> <br /> It was just a painful sit. <br /> <br /> The theater actually stopped us on departure and asked if we wanted a refund. <br /> <br /> It never happened before or after Pleae didn't rent it. You really regret that I am really voting with a summary of votes Maybe the personal taste is related to it
