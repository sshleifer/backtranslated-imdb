At first I thought it was bad because I had great expectations for this movie, but after some thought it was so bad. I was almost involved in promoting bad characters in bad movies. hk new generation actors and actors, not to mention bad script writers, bring the industry down. he is still trying to figure out how big it is. usually you can't lose a movie with donnie yen and ekin (forget about jackie, she's gone to the top). but then I should figure out if the twins were on the cover. It's cheesy, campy, very corny, I'm trying to laugh at some jokes, but not only has the effect very minimal, but the jokes are very recycled and not funny. im sorry i bought the movie. the only reason why some people think it is so good is that they are temporarily washed, that the twins are cute and everyone loves them and that everything they do is good and funny. and if you like twins, you are up to date ... <br /> <br /> sigh ... i miss a good hk-movie day when jet li and stephen chow movies were dominated by box ... <br /> < br /> Movies from mainland China are much better than that and are filmed for lower budgets.
