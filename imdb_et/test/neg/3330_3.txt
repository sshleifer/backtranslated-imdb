A group of seven gold advisers leads the mine, which was recently opened after the earthquake. Of course, they do not pay attention to the local legend that something is there and kills people. This low budget ($ 25,000) horror flick has a light cult and I'm not sure why (if it's not because it's so hidden). I admit that the last half hour is quite fun, but an hour is pure torture. A lot of walking and talking and our titular bowling will not appear in 45 minutes. I would forgive them if they were strict amateurs, but this group ended up with the USC, so I hope they know that exploiting the film should be exploitative. Anyway, as I said, the last half hour is cool, because the three survivors are fighting for a stop-motion monster and there is a score similar to the cool John Carpenter. I wanted to see more of a monster, but it's literally 45 seconds on the screen. <br /> <br /> Even though the film is not the best, the Code Red DVD has paid great attention to this. You have interviews and audio commentary by director Melanie Anne Phillips, producer / actor Mark Sawicki and co-author Huntley. The stories of how the film is made are quite exciting and inspiring (like a cave that is built in the backyard). Even more interesting are the shorts of Sawick and Huntley USC students, which are actually better than the production of features. Huntley was a pretty talented artist, and it is a shame that he did nothing else. Sawicki has been working in Hollywood as a visual effects and camera boy. The VHS movie is sort of legendary when it was blind and I'm sure it's a lot better. However, you still get scenes where the only picture is five helmet lights that collide in the dark. It's safe to say the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still a "horror movie".
