I was hoping that this exhibition was somewhat realistic. It just strikes me as an example of another mainstream after I watched it. Didn't I know these signs at all, is it an American glamorous idea of ​​how terrorism works? The protagonist does not act as a fundamentalist at all and how he goes to the terrorist is not my understanding. Neither of the other terrorists was able to appear genuine. One of the members, a blonde-American white boy, would never be alive by Muslim terrorists. The second member, the French ex-skinhead, is not suited to the Islamic terrorist movement. In addition, terrorists have sexual relations with a white American housewife, which I find very strange. This is another stupid misleading American TV show. It's almost as realistic as Prison Break.
