there is only a way to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> So bad it's fun. <br /> <br /> The actor is so bad that I smiled at my ass. The man in the film that tries to use the weapon is so ridiculous that you think he's trying to copy the toy figure, I know it sounds ridiculous, but if you see it yourself, you can't agree. <Br>> <br /> The monster looks like a cgi guy who is trying to restore the blue monster you get in the old Sinbad movies. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is only good for one thing, which is a great laughter as bad movies can get. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a bad script with bad effects and special effects go wrong <br /> <br /> This is a movie for you
