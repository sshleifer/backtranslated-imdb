... if the film's biggest fault is easily noticed. What was the motive? The details of the killings were used but never explained. I think the team got too much atmosphere, which is great, but the story is definitely missing. There is no next topic. I think that if it was done properly, the film would last a little longer, but it would have been worth it at least for me. <br /> <br /> Casting is very good, I loved Wilson as a vulnerable Vicky. <br /> <br /> Not much more to say, really. But I really want them to be less focused. <br /> <br />
