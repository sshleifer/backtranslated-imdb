There were so many classic films where the leading people were lying out and still looking good. I never bought this stuff. "Scooter comedies" were filled with such things and so many Fred Astaire films. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays here a famous "state" magazine writer who has lied to the public for years. and feels he must lie to keep his person (and his work). He even lies about getting married, another topic that was always trivialized in classic films. <br /> <br /> She is a New York woman who pretends to be a great cook and someone who knows how to handle babies, etc. Obviously he does not know anything and the lies are so fast that you will lose a trace. I think all this should be funny, because the lessons are finally learned and true love reigns, etc. etc. Please go through the barf bag. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie is not funny. Stanwyck was a much better film genre in the genre. As for Dennis Morgan, go back to the bag.
