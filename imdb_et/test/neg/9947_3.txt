Seymour Cassel gives a great result, tour de force. His actions in the supposedly washed dune beach duke Slusarsk are always in the heart. At the heart of the film is the hunger that just came to the beach, hoping to honor the dreams of its dead brother. What she gets is lame surf hijinks. The boys are cheating, the boys are fighting and the boys are drunk to watch the surf movies with the whole LA city on Friday night. Duke takes fun and tries to teach him how playing volleyball is like touching a woman. The next time my wife talks back, I did that I hit the ball. <br /> <br /> Back to Seymour Cassel. At the end of the film, a good drama will be created, because there was no point in the first half of the film. Duke plays a great volleyball game, the best he has been playing for over a decade. The way the scene is taken is beautiful. You can feel the heart that this man needs to play and love to be on the beach. These five minutes fall into one of my favorites. 3/10 Bad to Fair, the rest of the movie was flat.
