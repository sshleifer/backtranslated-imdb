Jim Wynorski captures KOMODO VS in a very literal sense. COBRA. There's no guess here. The giant CGI Komodo dragon - it looks like a dog minus fur - takes the cobra of a humane CGI king, with a bunch of tree huggers and others in between. Fruit huggers get charter boat captain Michael Pare (who else?) To bring them off-bounds to the federal island. The crazy scientist's experiment in growing very growing vegetables has become an experiment in the cultivation of very large critteries, thanks to our nutty army. Now all that is left on the island is the very big critters and the little, formidable daughter of the mad scientist. The group runs to her old planting lab, monsters arrive and hunt. If you look enough at the Wynorsk / Sci-Fi channel flaps, you can recognize some of the kits and locations from many other movies. Action is non-existent, as is the plot. At least you can enjoy watching a badly animated compot / dog designed for its intended victims before they scare them. Cobra just strikes and swallows. No imagination at all.
