Macbeth is one of the most frequently talked about stories in the cinema and has been translated many times into many theatrical and celluloid settings. Originally written by William Shakespeare in the early 1600s, Macbeth talks about the story of betrayal and one man's struggle for power. Director Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper) tries to update Macbeth by putting it on the modern Melbourne underworld. A movie in which characters replace swords with weapons (area Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Julia) and royal vassals for gangsters, Macbeth is a sharp, violent, but critically defective film. <br /> <br /> Macbeth (Sam Worthington) works with King Duncan (Gary Sweet). After the King had lifted Glani Thane (as predicted for Macbeth by the three witches), Macbeth starts putting his eyes on the throne. One night, King Macbeth's house and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) tell him about killing the king to conquer power. Macbeth kills his master and then takes his crown. But the success is that when Macbeth soon becomes aware of when he has to go out to protect his murderous secret, it will soon come. <br /> <br /> OK, first first. The main guilt of the movie is Sam Worthington. His depiction of Macbeth is one word ... boring. Honestly, Macbeth didn't care about watching the movie. I had more sympathy for Lady Macbeth of Victoria Hill because she had the trouble to act at least. Worthington sits on the wood next to the film. I felt that he had the best impression that Johnny Deep's George Jung's character from Blow ... but without charisma. I've never seen Worthington in the movie, so I'm not sure if it was his director's fault, but in both cases, the glue that should have been brought together into one coherent unit is weak. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is good, but if it fits with Geoffrey Wright's Australian gangster motif, it seems a bit inappropriate. The sparse tempo actions, mixed with the long Shaksperius moons, create momentum in the film. I understand that this is Macbeth and that the director wanted to use the original dialogue intact. But the hard and fast action steps that follow the three-minute soliloquy tend to be annoying, if not a little pretentious. <br /> <br /> Camera work is very stylized and usually works well. One of the things I was upset was how the camera slides slowly and continuously. I don't mind such pictures being just over. It goes further if it is cool and stylish and instead becomes irritating. In addition, art direction and cinematography are quite well done. <br /> <br /> Macbeth has all the good qualities; stylish direction, Shakespeare dialogue, strong soundtrack, supernatural naked witches (strange sisters) and good brutal, bloody violence. All these strong points are forgotten when looking at Sam Worthington's unpublished image of Macbeth. Macbeth's role was important in linking everything together and in this context, Geoffrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed unhappily, making Macbeth an unforgettable invasion of Shakespeare.
