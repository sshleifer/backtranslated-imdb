Many people stand in front of the house n some women cry ... Men who stand in close groups and talk in dark tones ... a few men come and they discuss how the girl looks sexy today. we will soon know that someone in the house has died ... the husband of a deceased person is worried about preparing so many people's food, a friend sitting next to him gives an idea to make things easy by preparing simple rat sabji ... The son of a dead person talks to someone with a cellphone, the daughter is busy with her makeup ... her mother advises her to wear a salwar kameeji, but her daughter is more interested in seeing good people, when so many people visit her house and therefore prefer a pair of jeans and a T-shirt salwar kameez ... another son asks her to stop all kriyad and also tells him that he should not be expected to come from the office early ... Then the camera slowly focuses on the dead person ... the face is covered with white fabric slightly due to wind, exposing the face ... His Anupam Kher ... suddenly rings and comes out of bed up ... Is he his dream or lightning? U can't get the answer to the end of the movie ... Well, it's Wat Comedy Director Dibakar Banerjee !!!!! Later on, to find out about this scene, there is nothing to do with the actual film, and thus everything that is obvious is a dream previously described. Is this a movie comedy? Well this should fall into this category ... But it really isn't !!! is not something that can be tied to comedy in the movie !!! More than the director gives a message that no one gets justice from the police! so everyone has to cheat !! or forget about justice !!!! The music of Bapi-Tutul and Dhruv Dhalla is OK ... There is nothing much to say about other sectors ... The bad script destroys everything ... not even Anupam Kher's performance will not make it at least stagnant ...
