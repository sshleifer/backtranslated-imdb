So many good films arrive in 1995 (especially "Mortal Kombat" and "Seven"), unfortunately there were some bombs, and this movie really belongs to a boring, predictable plot and grief. end. It seems that Antonio Banderas has not been able to find "Desperado", the only remarkable film he has made. Anyone with an eighth brain could say who the DeMornay stalker was from the beginning. His comeback from his mother's death did nothing but confused the paper with a thin story. I'm sorry Dennis Miller was wasted with this movie; this part resembles his ethereally similar role as "Net". <br /> <br /> I had a hard end shaking my head because I did pretty much during the whole movie. In addition, any film that depicts animal cruelty in any shape or form, regardless of how it appears to be counterfeit, will automatically go away. If you want to make a short story if you want to enjoy a good thriller, avoid it at all costs. Never talk to strangers ... especially those who recommend this movie. 2/10
