The movie's title makes it sound like porn, but it's not even a sex comedy. Instead, there is about an official in the barefoot county of the hot summer who is sent from a southern country to a small town to find and arrest the monthly bribes. Moon comes from an old woman's farm with three beautiful daughters. Almost everyone can guess what happens next, but strangely enough, the film is very good. It hardly even qualifies for PG rating. Moreover, the low budget is obviously obvious for every hit and the actress is sooooo amateur. This film was obviously meant for the crowd, but it is unlikely even in 1974.
