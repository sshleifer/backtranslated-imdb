One of the biggest lessons I ever had when watching a movie happened like this: <br /> <br /> I worked at Roger Corman's offices like so many other wanabees before and after, I was online and I was trying to figure out how it all worked and how to make yourself indispensable (hah!). One afternoon, Julie Corman, Roger Corman's wife and producer, asked me to ask me to record. I'm not sure why he wanted to see it. I had the impression that it was a student film or a show-reel, something like a calling card. Regardless of the reasons he was supposed to see it, the only free-to-air video slot was where I was working, and I was the closest person to the machine. I started the tape. <br /> <br /> Deactivation: The table facing the camera sat on the screen. Behind him was a screen to the left, a door that opened into the room. There was a coat against the far wall. The second sign was entered through the door and started talking. The first sign, the desk boy turned around to answer, (it's all one, static camera, no pans or dolly shots. Only one locked camera). The second sign turned to the coat's coat and presented his next line. Julie Corman said, "I've seen enough." and he left the room. <br /> <br /> What he had seen in the ten seconds he looked at was that the director was an idiot. Opening with two characters who immediately turned to the cameras supplying the camera on the back? No excuse. Next! So long you have. Ten seconds. Put it up in the open game and you're dead. <br /> <br /> This moment I was reminded when I looked at the opening of this chick. After a somewhat longer jungle ride we see several monkeys who probably throw them into cages. The man wearing the gun laughs. The Jet liner lands and we see this taxi across the terminal. God it is boring! Cut inside the airport. Two men meet. Aha! Something's going on! They shake hands. Cut two men at different angles - <br /> <br /> - and the director crosses the line. <br /> <br /> The first two shots of the movie that have any spatial relationship with each other and the guy is drawn. "Crossing the intersection" is one of the basic rules of film grammar that keeps characters from jumping from side to side and confusing. Audiences don't like confusion. Mystified? Disturbed? Reasonable and Interesting? Yes, yes. Viewers love all of them. Confused? You lose them. They're walking out. "Crossing the intersection" is one of the things that they should be forced to do in a film school. This is the main thing. This is not an inviolable rule (there are no untouchable rules). Directors stop it all the time - but not in the first real cut of the movie. <br /> <br /> I thought I had seen enough. And off.
