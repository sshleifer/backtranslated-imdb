I suggest, if you have already seen the original American Graffiti, don't see this movie. If you haven't seen the original, it's still not recommended, but it's a lot less painful to look at. The characters in the first movie are big and eventually you were related to them. This movie shows how bad their lives have changed. It's a clean up to watch! <br /> <br /> On New Year's Eve, 1964, 65, 66 and '67, we have four films of the first movie characters. In 64, we have John Milner (Paul Le Mat) who is now a professional racer. She meets Eva with a foreign girl, and although her plot doesn't really go anywhere, it's the best of four. In 1965, we have the Rooms (Charles Martin Smith) who are stuck in Vietnam and more than anything he wants. He is trying to find ways to hurt himself or get out of stupid things. In 66, we have Debbie (Candy Clark), a girl who picked up the Room in the first movie. Now she's a hippie smoking a pot, and I'm really not sure what her plot was. He went to the concert ... nothing happened. Finally, in 1967, Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) and Laurie Bolander (Cindy Williams) own marriage problems that end with anti-war rally and police action. None of these in the northwest is very good. In some parts, the script is a very bad dialog. Those poor characters I enjoyed so much in the first movie came where they are here ... why? Why did this sequel follow? I think if he followed, he had to have a Vietnam war and hippies and police action, but the real thing is that this movie shouldn't have been done. <br /> <br /> The direction was stylish but it's just a big headache. Each story has a different style. Milner is just plain (depending on how you look at it) on the widescreen and it is filmed how the rest of the movie should be. The toaster plot was hit 16mm and what it means is a bad-looking picture that is the size of a small box in the middle of the screen. The Debbie plot has been shot with multiple screens. At one point, there could have been one screen, but with a good majority, it is two to twenty screens at a time. Don't worry about following the screen because there's nothing going on there. Steve and Laurie have a strange filming style. Its style does not really mean anything and is stupid and pointless. Instead of a widescreen, this is the widescreen that looks like a full-screen full-screen version. Although I don't like others, at least I understand what they are going to do, it just doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Music is the grace of saving this movie, not that it could save it! Bob Dylan, Simon and Grafunkel, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gay, and dozens of others have beautiful songs here. They do not record this feature, but make it a little better. It's still bad! In general, this is a futile sequel. Any fan of the original should avoid this empty sequence! <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 out ****. 110 minutes. PG for language, drug use and violence
