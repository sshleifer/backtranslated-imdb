When I first saw this movie, I didn't know its title. I realized that it had Chevy Chase with the same name as Caddyshack, so I had the idea that it was Caddyshack 2. At the end of the movie, when I found it, it was Caddyshack 2, I was disappointed. They could have done better. Dan Akroyd I thought it was bad. The whole story was bad. Invite this movie to another title, but don't call it Caddyshack 2. You give this great movie a bad name. Jackie Mason's daughter, when I first saw her, looked like her wife. How old is this girl? Geez. How would this film be a little credible. I thought Chevy Chase was good.
