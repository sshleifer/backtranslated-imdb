It is hard to imagine two players with such classes and experiences, such as Michael Caine and Michael Gambon, who participate in such a shamefully inert film. The responsibility for this poorly understood production must remain with the writer Neil Jordan and director Conor McPherson. I doubt I've seen such a bad movie for such good credit after a long time. Comedian Dylan Moran, who gave his mark to the irritated and incompetent bookstore owner of the BlackBooks TV channel, is changing the same routine here, except for the lack of excessive and comical control to leave one bright. It's easy to see how the story could work because the situation is interesting and comical. The classic actor (Caine) attempts to rob an attack (Gambon and co) with the help of an awkward colleague (Moran) with predictable results. It could and should have been good. Unfortunately, this was not the case.
