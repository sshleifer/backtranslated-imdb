The deadly historical group takes the author's "furry" adventure through the uncharted cave of Kazakhstan. During these transformation and aftermaths and film companies trying to combine cinematic components to win, Cavern has in the last few years only a relatively different twist of the previous eight cave images, and this twist seems to have been taken in the X file. I like to give every film a suspicion, but here was too little annoyance for me. Camera work can give you a headache as they seem to be constantly confused with the way up. It's not really important to me whether filming was realistic. There is too much PANNICK needed from the alleged caves, in the last half you say one of the two things? oh just close and focus on rescuing yourself, or i hope everyone will die eventually. For these dignified participants, this film must be very tiring. Moderate amount of gore and something special in dialogue or characters. While you're pretty sure you know what's going on, the last five minutes will explain all the details. But I would have a better opinion of the film if they had left the cutting room at the last minute. It was not just necessary. I recommend that you capture and record the sequel immediately after suspicion has been adhered to. I have long thought that the film industry should distribute the modified restaurant industry. You pay for the movies before you go to the movie, but the profit of each movie comes from the advice you give when you leave the cinema. I can't blame what I don't like about this film for their low budget.
