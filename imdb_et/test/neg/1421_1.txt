This is one of the most pathetic, predictable, and badly performing movies I've ever seen. Clint Eastwood has never been worse, never seen anyone being less convincing on the screen. I laughed at him all the way. Then this romance is sure between her and her proud Rene Russo, which was even more pathetic than Mr.Connery and Ms. Zeta-Jones in Entrapment. <br /> <br /> One IMDb user asked: What's not to like about this movie? I ask, what do you like about it? And the answer is: John Malkovich. He is an absolute genius and probably the best film villain (He even recorded Con Air you know). But that's it. <br /> <br /> This movie is called the fire line, but "bodyguard 2: rip-off" seems to be a more appropriate title. Just observe when you're a deadly John Malkovich fan. Otherwise, avoid any cost. * 1/2 (five)
