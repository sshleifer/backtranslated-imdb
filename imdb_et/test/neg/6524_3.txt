Loving Andersen's fairy tales as a child and recently some intriguing documentary films about this strange but brilliant author, I was eager to see this TV movie. Unfortunately, the experience was nothing but disappointment that leaves me angry and confused. First of all, the story / script is full of inaccuracies and even fantasy, and it creates an almost new story, disgracefully abusing Andersen's fairy tales, presumably to sell the mess like me. Secondly, the real-boy actor (really ... ever seen the real Andersen picture?) Kieran Brew can portray Hans Christian's spiritually slowed down as a brilliant, though very disturbed, character he actually had. Though Brew is annoying and irritating like Andersen, Bris has no required charisma to create any sense of compassion. Thirdly. The Love Story between Andersen and the fictional Jetta (who should really be Henriette, Edvard Collin's wife) ... Why? This man has lived such an interesting life, it should be a good basis for a great movie! <br /> <br /> I can continue this as a very long list, but I feel it is most desirable to recommend all of you to spend your time and money on something else.
