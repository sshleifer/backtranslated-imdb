Spoilers in front of JEEEEEESUSSSSSSSSSS ... I have the saying: "Insecticides kill insects and Moronicides kill the moorland ..." The ghost of the movie "kills the moles." Many of the people killed in this movie are actually asking to kill, getting into abandoned houses, ghosts, etc. <br /> <br /> This movie sucks really badly. It is shown that the three stories are parallel and suddenly we learn that they are separated for at least a couple of days. It's a cheap shot ... <br /> <br /> The "thrill" is so cheap, they're ridiculous. Even "Nightmare on Elm Street" didn't fall as low as to show that someone was attacking their sweater ... it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Save your money, stay home and you don't have to fear filmmakers.
