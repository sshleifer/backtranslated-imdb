This directly and cheaply dragging flick is based on a real story. I have no doubt. This does not mean that it is particularly interesting (if you are not one of the main characters who actually lived this experience). A young woman, called Angela, buys a big and big old homeland, which is really very cheap. Well, as we all know to watch Horror's movies when you buy a big house, it usually means that it haunts in some way, shape or form. In fact, another house goes to Angela over a smart boy who lived in the house so far, taking the time to "introduce" Angela to a ghost! Nice guy? Angela contacts a psychological and paranormal expert and tells her that her house is haunted and invites them to come and look at the ghosts for her. They come to the party and definitely there are ghosts sitting on the couch hanging in the garage and trying to attract people to the bathroom. Some friends stay overnight at night, see ghosts and promise never to return to the house. (Check out the girl who died "I'm so scared. I'm so scared." Fully emotional. If she was so scared, why she didn't rise, turn the button and leave? They look like ordinary people.) They steal celery from the kitchen, chairs around the la POLTERGEIST, and one bisexual ghost of a woman seduces Angela, who doesn't remember it! but not so I would know! Hahaha) The actors are not your typical porn stars, they should beat the beach and the gym more. is my house! Go out! They do not leave. I could not think of all the times I have heard of psychic Sylvia Brown on TV, saying that if you have a ghost in your home, rationalize and say, "Look, you're dead. on the other hand, go out! "According to Sylvia Brown, they leave as long as you are not hostile and disgusting. This film costs about $ 50. It really has a cheap feeling and bad behavior.
