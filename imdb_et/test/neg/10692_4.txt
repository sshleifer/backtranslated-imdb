I was so waiting for the documentary self-injury of the master behind Boondock Saints, one of the most difficult and pointless films I've ever seen. But "Overnight" - masters (ex?) Makers - must also learn how to make a movie. Several unpleasant remarks, getting into trouble with the phone and enjoying alcohol make Mr Duff really out like a putz. But that doesn't leave any idea why the man first got the contract, what his creative process or vision is - what are the Boondock saints? How difficult is it to meet Patrick Swayz? What are the strange institutional mechanisms in which our nasty heroes are caught? Since the film does not attempt to consistently answer these questions, it does not reach the Hollywood dippity. Who cares then?
