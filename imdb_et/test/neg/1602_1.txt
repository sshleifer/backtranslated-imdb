I thought the sleeping chamber was interesting and exciting to see, until the last episode, if nothing happens, its F ****** BS, you, the Americans, Muslims as terrorists and Americans as a hero, on the contrary, I hate it when every American the TV show is predictable, I was hoping that the bombs would go out in this stadium, but I knew it wouldn't be, it would take pleasure to see it when you know that good guys are going to save the day, the Americans are again the biggest terrorists who are the leader of all who are guilty of September 11, and I'm P ***** that you throw these examples at us, which is all f ******! I'm a good show of terrorism, called "The Whitehorse" and the bush itself, it's the same as 24, how 24 was good, the sleeping chamber is nice and should never make season 2, its F * **** joke! You are also American manufacturers.
