In 2002, when Matthew Lawrence made The Hot Chick, I also saw Drumline that day. Drumline wins by default! If Comebc was released in March (as planned) while TMNT was released, TMNT would have won by default! <br /> <br /> Matthew Lawrence gave a subtle job that was upside down. He did not have to use dirty words that are plus. But when he started playing with his personal parts, as well as with another football player, and touched the girl, these were the drawbacks. <br /> <br /> But the biggest minus that pointed out to me is that every football player participated in the music video except Matthew Lawrence (enter The Price Is Right, lose the horns)! Another blown musical opportunity for him, just because he is shy about making music. <br /> <br /> In the past, Matt has disappointed me several times (Super Human Samurai Syber Squad), where he came so close that he had a musical moment, but ended up unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> Of course, Joey had a singing career with two albums with his belt and Andrew started his own music career. But it is very rare to find Matt's musical moment. The two who stand out would be in Brotherly Love, where he played the guitar and sang "Pigeon On Your Car" (Art Atrack), which he wrote, by the way, and this romantic boy meets the world at a moment when he sang "See Dame" (Over time). <br /> <br /> Matt, you've been playing too long. Why not make a musical return. You have a good voice and I miss your musical side.
