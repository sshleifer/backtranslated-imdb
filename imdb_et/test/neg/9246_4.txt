Too broken to be enjoyable, too loose to be interesting and too clumsy to be acceptable. MR LONELY is an interesting idea that is really destroyed by bad filmmaking. Like Ken Russell's film at his worst-case or on the day of amateurs, Mr. LONELY may seem like a good piece of paper (that is, he can't see the script) and free vacation somewhere, but Finally, we have a widescreen movie that seems to have been done by film students whose parents they told them that everything they did was a brilliant creation. Or did I get the filmmaker right? MR LONELY is a waste of resources trying to be (gawd!) Exotic and deliberately out. It's finally annoying and pointless .. and meaningless. What is the point of going to Scotland? What a stupid idea in this movie about Hollywood misleading. Maybe Korine wanted to restore GODSPELL ... but the result is GOD. Oh, and there's a sub-block, like FITZCARRALDO, including Werner Herzog, nuns and plane. Add slo-mo drifting and violin music to all the clergy and melancholy, add James Fox, who seems to have the hope that he can be seen as bold (like PERFORMANCE), and the result is an amphetamine fantasy alphabet soup on the widescreen. It may be fun for the movie, but the result of the screen is confusing. Imagine American PIE BAND CAMP food poisoning.
