Years ago, the "MA2412" feature film in Austria tried to be a "regional blockbuster". One thing is for sure: I hope nobody ever sees it outside. Maybe if you are familiar with the original sitcom, it might be interesting to see what the director Sicheritz did in his series. I think he continued his opportunity and wasted time and money. <br /> <br /> So far, many directors and writers have managed to make the series concept compatible with a 90-minute film (see Alf, Inspector Gadget ...). See how hard it is, looking at "MA 2412". The result of this experiment, in my opinion, is delicious like an endless TV episode (and not good). It does not give the plot, humor strives too hard, and management seems very purposeful - as the visual style seems. <br /> <br /> So, summing up, I probably wouldn't recommend this ...
