This film had all the components of a good adventure film, but it showed almost every level of incompetence. <br /> <br /> Roger Moore's presence on the cast list is usually a sign that the film will not get any more than mediocre, because Moor always has a leading role and cannot act. But Ian Holm and Lee Marvin were on this film, and it was based on Wilbur's blacksmith, so I thought I'd give him the chance to see a DVD in a box that was for sale ... <br /> <br /> It was a mistake. The open scene started in the middle of the roll, and the sound suddenly appeared as if the first part of the soundtrack had been trimmed. The scene showed a German team at sea. This bad editing was a sign of things to come, but the dreadnought-related scene was interesting enough to look at me. The special effects were good and the team wore the right uniforms and spoke German, which indicates that the director paid at least attention to historical details. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> So I looked, and then Moore appeared and my doubts were confirmed. Bad behavior, clichés, cinematic clichés, and cheap humor ... but worst of all, it is a catastrophic attempt to mix the light feel of the film with a serious drama and tragedy. It just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> The film ends as suddenly and badly as it started? in the middle of the rollers.
