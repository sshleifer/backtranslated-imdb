Victor Jory never became a big star. He is better known for his later role groups than his former leaders. But he was a very beautiful and wonderful actor. <br /> <br /> The romantic scenes in love with Loretta Young in his romantic adventure are passionate. Their kisses are very real.

But if somebody wants to go through movies of their time with similar intriguing titles, chances are there are some suprtb movies.
