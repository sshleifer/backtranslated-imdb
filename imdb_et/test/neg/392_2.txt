Now, I loved "Lethal Weapon" and "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang," but I can't believe Shane Black wrote this pile ... or that David Morse and John C. McGinley are in it. I watched it for a film festival. Awful. Everyone laughed. It's a preaching and hard hand ... let alone a fool. It is also surprising how little L.A. Cambodia looks like. The whole point of the time through post-traumatic stress disorder is certain. Imagine "Born on the Fourth of July" mixed with "The Butterfly Effect 2" (I followed the example to really show how bad this movie is), but directed by Michael Bay, Head of Unit 2. This is bad. Two letters are based solely on the value of the output.
