I just saw the movie today in preview and it's just a movie for kids. It doesn't fix or add to the original Disney movie in any way. The whole style is passionate in Scottish pasty style, which is not supported by weak writing writing (where the motives are torn) and the behavior is uneven and often undone (regardless of what is considered a painful pain). I have no problem with a dog dog - although there is some quality of "Skippy Bush Kangaroo" (see below) for his shots. <br /> <br /> * For those who don't know, "Skippy" was in the Australian Children's TV series from the 1960s, where the kangaroo would be an important part of all the stories. It has been said that as a poor "old" Skippy "to act" they left their muzzle a flexible band, which he tried to come down with his paws - something that seems to be in communication with people !!! Bobby has the same range and you just don't buy your heroic rescue series at all. <br /> <br /> Children from 8 to 12 years old should be advised. Under it, they may be scared. Above that, if they or you love it, good luck to you, but it is the making of strictly cut out films. This is a missed opportunity because Bobby's story is a true sin and brightness, and this movie doesn't give it.
