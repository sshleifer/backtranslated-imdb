Did writers pay people to come up here and write positive comments? I mean, really, it's a little hackney and Spike isn't that funny. She looks more like a serious guy trying to be too funny. There are so many mediocre concerts in this show; Like once, there was a starting line in the "talk show, applied directly to the forehead" over and over again. And the other one that was with Spike and another guy, and it wasn't even funny. They did nothing more than sit and laugh, over and over again. Ha Ha! And the other one that spoke to Spike spoke to a Korean man who ate a duck and told him he had a pet basket. Ha ha! I mean, Spike just gets funny guests at his show, that's why people like this show
