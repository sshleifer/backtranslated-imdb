I'm a fan of the original 1950s, and for about 20 minutes in this transformation I began to think it was as good as the original, but it wasn't. The motive for murder was incredibly stupid. Two movie lovers turn out to be brother and sister to excuse me when I am. The main character stops in the middle of the movie to have sex, which doesn't make sense in a situation where he is. If the filmmakers wanted to have sex, he would have had to put it before the main character (Dexter played Dennis Quaid found he was dying and accused of a crime. There's a reason why sex music is. Early in life, Dexter is not alive so he I'm not interested in sleeping with Meg Ryan. I still think it would make sense for the sex event to have been cut off earlier or earlier, and two siblings would not have been lovers. <br /> <br /> One of the most stupid parts of the film is the arms fight, a couple of people are killed and one person runs over 15 meters of overcrowded carnival and still in NOBODY CARNIVAL NOTICE. If you get tar, you will sink and fall into f seconds. Not only is it hard to believe that things will sink quickly but more important builds a camp in tar mines, I'd say more than the stupid end of the movie, but I don't want to put a spoiler in my post.
