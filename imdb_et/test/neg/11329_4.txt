I've seen this movie once when I was about 14 years old, but I was glad they made the movie from the 45th division. Being in Oklahoma and especially now that both of my sons are 45 years old, I would like to see it appear on the DVD. I may feel a bit biased, but sometimes in the 45th section, he does not appreciate what he deserves today. The history channel always talks about other infantry departments when talking about World War II and Korea, but you rarely hear it from 45th place. One of the scenes that really stood out for me was when I was working with Indian coders and seeing German soldiers puzzled when they didn't understand that language. I'm glad that all Native American Code Talkers get the recognition they deserve.
