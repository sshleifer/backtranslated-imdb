For reasons that I cannot think of, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) starts injecting wolves into his twilight masters Petro (Glenn Strange). Result ?? Petro is turned into a terrible (both ugly and bad wig and witty teeth) killer beast. Dr. Cameron uses Petroid to get revenge on those scientists who scared and smiled at their ideas (and why not, Dr. Cameron's nuttier as a fruit cake). <br /> <br /> Overall, Mad Monster is one of the most boring and poorly made poverty line thriller. There is really only one positive thing I can come up with in The Mad Monster. George Zucco can be fun to watch because he plays both mad and someone. His dr Cameron is plain loony. He has no punishment for killing; he has a conversation with people who are not there; and, like most crazy scientists, he also interferes with the "domain of God" (in fact, I'm not sure anyone accuses him of it, but it fits). But there is nothing to suggest except for Zucco. Everything else, from monster effects to supporting music, is the usual old bad. The line of poverty is much better than the 1940s as Mad Monster.
