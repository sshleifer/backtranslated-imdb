How could a movie with illegal Mexican immigrants kidnapped and beaten at the crossing be boring? Well, "Border Incident" is. <br /> <br /> It is no wonder that the career of songwriter George Murphy ended long after this terrible movie. Politics was definitely the way out for the future Senator, who is dying of a terrible death in this slow-moving film. The film's stereotypes are a typical Mexican migrant worker who is puzzled and terribly dull. <br /> <br /> The film only gets intense when Murphy's and Ricardo Montalban's identities are discovered as a federal agent for the US and Mexico. <br /> <br /> The best disappointment we see is similar problems in our own society today.
