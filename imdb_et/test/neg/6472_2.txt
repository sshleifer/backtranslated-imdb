This transformation is titled "This Darn Cat," but D.C. There is a cat side effect as the main. Patti Randall was not at all comfortable with this remake. He reminded me of one of those Gothic Jerks that you read about who has been angry since birth, so that they will end up in the rest of the school one day. Federal policeman Kelso was okay, but not as good as the original. I think Disney was trying to make Christina Ricci and Doug Doug (or whatever she's in her name) stars, but they don't hold the candle in the original to Hayley Mills and Dean Jones. I'm a lover of animals and a lover of cats and I don't blame D.C. because the remake is so much worse than the original film. After all, they cut out almost the whole movie. All in all, it's a very bad remake.
