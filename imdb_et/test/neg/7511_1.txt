I saw this movie in Germany at the Cinema Club in 1970. Most of the participants were from a local private school where I taught. I had seen some Godard films before I lived in France, and although they weren't my favorites, I can at least understand them. French language skills have helped. <br /> <br /> The endless end of the "Le Week End" soon became a kaleidoscope of images, very well, perhaps too well captured, which soon didn't make me any sense. For me, movies, like books, must have a clear meaning. It wasn't for me. I don't think I'm in "movies." Pictures still worship me from the movie. Until today, I refuse to eat rabbit meat that the French love. Those who have seen the film can understand why. Yes, the matter of materiality went through, but cannibalism, car wrecks, and all other scenes of destruction and horror made me worse. I'm not sure if I went out before the end, but I certainly felt it. I promised myself that I would never see another Godard movie, and I never knew it or ever. <br /> <br /> My rating: nothing. It was the most nasty movie I've ever seen. Others may be more inert, stupid or stupid. I've forgotten those scenes that haunt me forever.
