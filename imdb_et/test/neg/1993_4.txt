It's okay ... a few years later, Chayefsky's classic "Network" is his true cinematic BIG civil war ... but now it's not a dark comedy he wants to be. It is usually terrible, although it has some good scenes: the first murder victim was found, the ER secretary responsible for the surprise discovery of patients, the Drummond misleading testimony and the last scene where Scott's character restores his professional integrity and self-respect. It also has some ridiculous scenes: a tiny monologue of Scott's character during the early visit of a hospital psychiatrist, the raping of Rigg by a Scottish character, the terrible looting of Dysart in short scenes, and O.R. The doctor beats the operating table for the wrong patient, because "I already have one infringement procedure". <br /> <br /> Chayefsky is also trying ALL of the hurdles in one hospital (ie murders, administrative errors, poor people who protest outside, etc.). It could have worked better than the industry as a whole. Reasonably: Scott is passable, Rigg seems wrong, Hughes is inspired and Dysart crowns his short presentation. The rest is TOO one-dimensional.
