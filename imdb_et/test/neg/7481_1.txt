Nothing from Carson Daly has ever said or done that show that EVER made me laugh or even smile. I don't understand how this show has survived so many years. <br /> <br /> Even a "funny" band member is like one of those kids in high school who thinks someone isn't good enough to even look at him. Daly and this guy are just arrogant frat boys. It seems they're not even trying to be a little funny. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION ATTENTION. <br /> <br /> It makes my soul cry. <br /> <br /> I just can't stress enough how this exhibition is. Don't look at it. But if you absolutely need it, I recommend that your eyes be closed and the ears clogged with cement.
