Here were nice characters played by pleasant-looking actors and actors, plus the famous band and some famous dancers ..... but the movie just didn't work. By the time it was almost over, I missed death. The dialogue was stupid, humor (mainly Milton Berle) was just stupid and the music wasn't just my alley. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big band fan, and when I hear "In the Mood" one more time I take it. <br /> <br /> This was my first look at the famous skater-actress Sonja Henie and I have no complaints about her. Almost part of the problem, at least with humor, is that it is so dated that it is no longer funny. Berle, Phil Silvers, Bob Hope, Red Skeleton, Abbot & Costello etc etc were fun for the 40s and 50s, but humor is changing and it wasn't funny today.
