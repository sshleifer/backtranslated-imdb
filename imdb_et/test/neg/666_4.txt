The first official edition of World Wrestling Entertainment's film distribution is a pretty basic horror movie called "Look No Evil", starring Kane, one of the wrestlers of those great masters known for their scary presence, heavy moves and one of the most controversial backstories in wrestling. And don't pull any strokes here; Although this movie is being promoted as the greatest horror film of all time (mostly WWE), it goes without saying that after seeing the film I can confirm it as the greatest comedy of the time. <br /> <br /> "Look Nothing" sees a number of juvenile criminals who are sent to the hotel so they can clean up. Of course, this hotel also has a monstrous murderer (played by Kane) and we all know where it goes. Without too much of the film's plot, in the early 1980s, this film has all the similarities and structures most of the clich√©s intact, but without the intimidation of these films. And this is a kind of main problem "Look No Evil". He has so many advantages that his predecessors have shown in the genre that it is predictable; veteran horror fans easily feel some gimmicks ahead of time and even those who have only seen a couple of flicks should say what happens next. It's too generic to be scary. <br /> <br /> The movie is expensive, no doubt, but it's just for that effect. The dark atmosphere introduced by the film initially gives off this terrorist attack, but when you get to the end, it seems somehow inappropriate and gets tired quickly. The scenes of death are not as harsh or terrible as they laugh, although some of them are quite inventive. <br /> <br /> The action in this movie is also pretty bad when the main characters aren't sufficiently developed to take care of them when they finally end up. Some can't even imagine fear properly; they just scream and cried in vain. So when they die, it only adds to comedy, because you don't care enough about them to just consider them as equivalent to Starfleet Redshirts monster Kane. <br /> <br /> In Kane, he simply depicted the character of his movie in the same way as he depicts his wrestling character, but uses an axis and a hook instead of hellfire and sulfur. In my opinion, there is no doubt that Kane can be a big contest in the genre of fear. It has its appearance and presence; he just needs better material (especially a script that no one wrote in wrestling) to work. <br /> <br /> Despite what may seem like a harsh review, I enjoyed this movie. It's one of those ridiculously bad movies that you can't help but sit and enjoy. My main film, again, is that it's just an exercise to kill whores and has no frightening or shocking moments. I liked it, but I liked it because it was easy for me to laugh at some of what was supposed to be a scary moment. If this happens because it was supposed to be, the film would be rated higher. But it wasn't. He laughed because it was a B-film and it didn't help that the director's previous experiences were porn movies and music videos; not so complicated things to manage anyway. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it enormously. <br /> <br /> If you don't mind a B-movie or a funny horror movie, I'd recommend "Look Not Bad". If you are a true enthusiast of the genre, I look forward to the DVD appearing before that. Everyone else should probably look at something else.
