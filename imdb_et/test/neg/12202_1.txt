I felt like shouting and falling out of the theater, but I looked at myself. Yes, the action was great, not the typical Hollywood movie, but the dialogue just didn't end (or interesting)! And despite all the attacks, you can never really feel or care for a character. Certainly the most boring film I've ever seen since Sphere, but I was expecting it to be boring. I had to sit through it, but please save yourself
