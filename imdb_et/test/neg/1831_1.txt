Anatomy is not very unique in the genre of horror, it is not even scary. It reminds me of my American cousin, horror slashers. It's just a copy of other horrors and, as a German movie, it's too American to add nothing to. <br /> <br /> In fact, anatomy is too predictable and boring, its plot is not healthy and consistent. It has stupid scenes that don't even fit in the horror genre. Entertaining sex music with pop music and panties topless with women. Why do they only need it in one movie? Instead, they should have made a cheap German adult film. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie to anyone because it's just too boring.
