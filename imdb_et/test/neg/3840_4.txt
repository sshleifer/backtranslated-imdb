Like most anyone watching this movie, I did it with the characters Michael Madsen and Dennis Hopper. These two are extremely underestimated and, unfortunately, they have a lot of nonsense with the title. In this movie, Hopper is a boy who accidentally kills a blackmailer and is offered a mysterious Madsen. <br /> <br /> The film is not as terrible as it could have been. I've seen so much worse, both independently and when working together (LAPD, a terrible movie). The direction was pretty bad and the script needed some rewriting, but both give the best results. The end is also pretty strong so you can tell that the story was potential. But if the film's glowing review is, "It could have been much worse," it doesn't say much about the film itself. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one that can be simply skipped if neither of these actors pulls you. But if you're a fan of either or both, look at it. They both give strong performances that exclude the obvious drawbacks of the film. Believe me, there are far worse possibilities.
