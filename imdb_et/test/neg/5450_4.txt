Jonathan Demme is such a characterist to see that he pulls Brian De Palma (that is, Hitchcock), it is almost predictable if he can't do much tension in this strong mystery. While working on David Shaber's Murray Teigh Bloom novel, Demme tries to hit the chord somewhere between Alan J. Pakula's paranoia dramas and Hitchcock's hanging thrillers. Roy Scheider stands for a retired secret agent who mourns the murder of his wife, who is now busy with the bad sons who kill him. Take it right away, but the script is full of thin threads and all the thrills will die quickly. The Niagra Falls is a visually impressive climax, but Demme pulls out of his performance and even less of this blow. ** from ****
