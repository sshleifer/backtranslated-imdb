In fact, the average is the only word that I think is. <br /> <br /> The operation was average (maybe just above the average), using the camera was average (actually below average. The picture was below average.) both shivering and coloring were grains and blurry. moved so slowly and didn't use it well. <br /> <br /> It could have been as much as it didn't go at the snail's pace and we saw more of the characters in the backgrounds. <br /> <br /> All we see is the setbacks here and there of Alice and how her life is so "bad" (her mother is a working-class woman who is trying to get her and her girls together). we see that she was in high school and her friend tells her to "tell her mom that she's doing some better food" and "everyone says it's your mother." Yes, it is embarrassing, but why do you go for it. <br /> <br /> I can definitely see if his mother was drunk or someone abused her, but nothing was wrong with her home except she was embarrassed. How immature! <br /> <br /> We don't even have a glimpse of what a couple's life has been like (except they have been prostitutes for a while and the woman has forgotten her name, gave her a child when she was 9 years old. ) That would be so much. It could have been if Alice, abused by her drunk mother, went to Florida with her friend, but then she becomes a prostitute. Or something like this, the real plot of the movie (that is, Alice), a girl who probably has 90% of the American population (WORK CLASS), lives in Florida, but then turns into prostitution. <br /> <br /> I don't see why it got the Sundance award (it must be to fight some very weak competition to win this prize.) <br /> <br /> It also seemed to me that Alice The Boston / New England accent was forced. It didn't seem genuine. (I should know that I was born and raised in Boston, but now I live in Georgia.) <br /> <br /> 4/10 I don't think it's worth your time.
