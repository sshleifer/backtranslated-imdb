I'm trying to understand what people liked MirrorMask. I am an attractive filmmaker and filmmaker. As I told my friends at my lunch hour, MirrorMask could be my biggest film disappointment. Just like a short Moongirl, the film was left between her characters. Many times during the film he tried humor. It makes you laugh. Instead of laughing at you, it leaves you empty. The jokes resembled some of the latest Star Wars films. They weren't funny if you weren't five. And the actor felt terrible. I've seen the actors actually acted in front of the blue screen. And I believe it. But not in this movie. Not the other. <br /> <br /> This film takes the formula and tries to apply it to beautiful artwork? And while the script is fully functional and the special effects are pretty beautiful, it is not the heart and cannot fail it. I left the movie shaking my head and I had to leave the theater. I felt mercy and misfortune and still haven't got a taste of this acid from my mouth. I love an independent movie. I encourage people to look at independent films to support them. But not this movie. This movie shouldn't have been done. At least it doesn't like it. Why was the director so clear? They were clearly set? Not just humor. But the emotions. Drama. Even the lines were poorly timed and delivered. It was like a movie walking on three feet instead of four. Its steps are inconvenient and timeless. And can it fall with the smallest move? Don't look at this movie. I don't care who you are. It's not worth your time.
