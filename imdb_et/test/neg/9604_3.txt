All right! The sci-fi / horror / action B hybrid run by Jim Wynorsk and the latest scenes will see a cyber, where several people have been killed by the head of the forest! As with any Wynorski-flick, he throws a whole host of crazy ideas and sub-blocks, which usually don't go anywhere. But "Storm Trooper" is rather a two-film-for-the-price-of-one type of transaction. On the one hand, we got a part of the drama / thriller (as such a movie opens), where Carol Alt killed his incredibly annoying and ungrateful husband (a plot that just goes somewhere). And, on the other hand, we got the "escaped cyber" robbed of the "Living Dead Night" style. When Carol and Cyborg are the ones inside the house and a lot of special operative operations / bounty hunters playing the role of zombies trying to penetrate the house. Needless to say, this flick is not the biggest there. Particularly Zach Galligan ("Gremlins" -fame) is painfully bad and Corey Feldman (in a small support roll) has been completely wasted for this movie again. Wynorski also hangs out his films because I'm 99% sure he used scenes from his previous movie "976 EVIL II" (exploding truck and motorcycle). Yes, it's not that good and so fun. It's just for Wynorsk fans. And I'm one of them if you didn't already know.
