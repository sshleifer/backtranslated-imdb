This is one of the worst films I've seen for a while. The action was just bad. Anthonie Kamerling is usually a pretty good actor, but in this movie she sounded like she read her text on paper. Especially his voice was very wood. Beau van Erven Dorens was completely up when frat boy Fraser, though it was probably more related to dirty dialogue. "Ik ook van jou" is an adaptation of the book and it seems that the filmmakers have forgotten that the film dialogue follows different rules than the literary dialogue. It all sounded like it was in the book. <br /> <br /> Some situations were very poorly visualized. Example: somewhere in the beginning of the movie there is a scene where the canoe is moving fast. It's just incredible to be true. You will probably see a rather shallow river line with lots of stones under the surface (so fast). We hear some sacred music to warn us that there is a danger. The girls' canoe goes beyond that, it's pretty low. Our hero dives several meters below the surface to save one girl. The girl screams her hands and says the words "You saved me ..." Vomit! <br /> <br /> It was actually so bad that it was funny. It's sad because it wasn't really meant. During the break I heard some of the men behind me saying, "O God, there's another part!" My feelings exactly. I am frightened by the fact that the final credits of Ik ook van jou were in English. Does this mean it will be released abroad? Just when the Netherlands got a good reputation for films like Antonia (Antonia line) and Character (Character) ...
