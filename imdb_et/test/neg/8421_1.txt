One of the worst homosexual movies I've ever seen. Because they are not the characters of this story, it is difficult to comment on the actual movie. So, since Colton Ford (aka Glen) made his life visible to everyone, I think he's a fair game to criticize. And it's not hard to do that. Here goes. 50 Something Glen is a great time porn star who wants fame and happiness as a great time singer. (I think 11 movies make him a "star") Being gay and forty, I've seen porn and I didn't know him or his lover. Personally, they all see different hair styles for me. Face, boys, he's not Jeff Stryker, Jim Bently or Casey Donovo. That's fine. The purpose of these films is about 6.5 minutes, so they all have the same requirements when you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So Glen wants to be a serious (legitimate) singer after mining the porn industry, but she can't take anyone seriously. Interesting why? Was he so stupid to think he could take off his clothes and film. According to the film, it is not just porn movies that he promises, lives in the house with "other" stars, where people can get in their bedroom, bathroom and somewhere through webcams. It's $ 500 an hour to entertain the private sector. Clothing languages ​​for clothing "hotels". By doing something called metiks, what I expect is medicine. And then you get angry when someone tries to touch you at a club concert because he is now "legitimate". Oy! <br /> <br /> The only interesting, non-cardboard character is the Academy's award-winning geo-screen writer, who doesn't give his name. And given that it is a documentary, porn is very porn. You can say that he is the most interesting joke of a porn star. <br /> <br /> Glen has one hyper-nellie leader (Kyle) who wants to "sell" him as a porn participant, hoping to get him gay club concerts. "Wear it" "Do not smile" "tell it", which means verifiable issues. I'm not saying that Kyle was right, but when a singer who starts off is questioning the manager, they won't go far. Such: who is his own lawyer is stupid to the client. All this wouldn't have been bad if it wasn't one of the little little information, then the drum, please. She's bad, she sucks, her singing talent is with Ashlee Simpson there. hard to root for anyone who - trying to make your dreams - at 50! --- Not working like ordinary people. No work. Can you say a lazy ass? And whining and "Why don't they accept me." Song and dance. And a few months after scraping the surface of the music industry, he pulls out, "Why I haven't made a record now." What? Actors are waiters. Writers work in low-level newspapers or magazines. This man is over it. It is true. He now wants his success just because he decided to want it. Jump. Plywood. Her lover leaves her back to nursing, but I say I don't want to be given medical help. Both were useless. Heads. The film is useless. If you really don't like Whine and Cheeesy people stay away. Don't waste your money on useless people's dirty lives, the bottom of the shoe has many interesting things.
