It's just a long-term ad for the film "The Death Tunnel". Although this is an interesting history of the Waverly Hills sanatorium, the entire ghost theory is in your interpretation. More "Ghost Orbs" that you can dub in front of a flash camera, and "Ectoplasmic Mist" is just someone's cigarette smoke that lights up with the camera's flash. I didn't see any "shadow people" until they sketched the blurry image of the image. Scientific explanations of the phenomena were not presented, but paranormal. Maybe these are just the events we should believe so make sure you plan to visit the Sanatorium on your next vacation in Louisville, Kentucky.
