Like many people with my age limit, I remember seeing this movie as a child in '98 and came out of the theater with almost tears. At that time, it seemed to be one of the most important, fearsome cinematographic experiences of our generation. At the same time, swallowing, action-packed, funny, heartbreaking, and truly inspiring Armegeddeon really did everything that happened, a teardrop of an instantly memorable Aerosmith theme song and end. <br /> <br /> Sweet Jebus. What did we smoke? I was watching it for the first time in a night on a movie channel and ... I can't even describe it. It's really one of the worst movies. Where to start? Leaving aside many LAUGHABLE scientific flaws ("astronauts of staff watchers"? Yes, sure, thanks to this, Billy Bob), I have to say that the worst thing was remarkable - I dare even say that it is unbalanced - where he combined nervous writing with the devil action. There are too many examples of this to even be listed here, but one is especially memorable - a scene where Bruce Willis tells Feds exactly where to go to track all of their oh-so-magic members. oil drilling team (check every New Orleans bar, "craps tables in vegan", "the only black guy at Sturgis motorcycle", all "Come together" ... reminded me of Anchorman's "NEWS TEAM! ASSEMBLE!" scene except serious) . Ben Affleck proves once again that he is Hollywood's most rewarded actor with less depth, scope and overall talent than anyone else. Not that Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, or GODFORSAKEN GARBAGE ADVERTISING was much better. (I must say, however, that I got a kick stardom to kill Owen Wilson's vision half way ... this is the only movie where his character dies?) Peter Stormare is perfect as the most stereotyped Russian Russian COSMONAUT, WHO YOU NEED. (Then it seems that Peter Stormarel has talented games for playing all types of Euro.) It was really fun how almost immediately after docking with the Russian space station (what is actually called in the movie) Ben Affleck can unanimously bring the whole wave of waves exploding in a grand Hollywood fashion. I also love the fact that in the end Paris is the only place on earth to destroy, and it doesn't seem like caring. And in addition, it will literally become simultaneous ads for Lockheed Martin and Kerr McGee. Oh, how proud I am to be an American. <br /> <br /> There are many other things I am talking about, but I'm not going to say that it's really a terrible movie that I feel ashamed that I've ever really loved it. <br /> <br /> I'll give her two letters just for a bang.
