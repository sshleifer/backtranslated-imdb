I saw this movie yesterday on TV. I had just finished reading a book in which the film was supposed to be based. In open credits, it was said: "This is a free adaptation of the Eça de Queirós novel. I should have turned off my TV at this point. <br /> <br /> Vera Sacramento's idea of ​​"free adaptation" is a story about the influence of the church on people and the hypocrisy of people who demand morality at the end of the 19th century. In fact, the only thing he received from the novel was the gender part, which was only slightly referred to in the Eça de Queirós novel. And of course, the name of some characters. <br /> <br /> The letter contains victims of the influence of Amélia and João Eduardo. Amélia seduced his father Amaro and all the time he led him. His brother João Eduardo remained in the priests because he dared to criticize them. In this film, Amelia is seduced by everyone she meets and Father Amaro is just another victim. João Eduardo is a dealer of drugs and illegal weapons. <br /> <br /> Vera Sacramento has become a novel that criticized the moral costumes of the era and simply transformed it into another film with many (bad) sexes. Worse still, his story was completely empty of ideas. Two wasted hours! Eça de Queirós has definitely not deserved it.
