No movie I've ever seen is as boring and stupid as this junkie. And I've always been a big B movie fan. After I look at this overall length, though I can honestly say it's not even close to the B-movie. <br /> <br /> No one in this movie can act if their life depends on it. The script is so stupid that I don't think I've ever heard anyone talking in such a life. The writer should go for a couple of years to learn real people to see how they act and speak, even if they are unable to make a watchable movie because it is so obvious that someone who participates in this movie is not talented at all. <br /> <br /> I could make a better movie with a digital camera and some monster toys. Also, forget all the sexy scenes, the women in the leather are so grotesque that you need to turn faster than turn on! <br /> <br /> Avoid this pointless fire if you don't want to get bored of your mind!
