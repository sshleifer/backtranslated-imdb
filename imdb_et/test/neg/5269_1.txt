"Normal Decent Criminal Punishment" is a kind of use of Martin Cahill, which is already the theme of John Boorman's 1998 The General. Cahill had fruitful cultivation in the slum region and ended a small crime against armed robbery. He justified his criminal career by pointing out his poor background at every opportunity. It is a general excuse for criminals who are comfortable despite the thousands of slum dwellers who are not turning to the abduction of post offices and the sale of weapons to face the ends. Cahill made fools from the police and the local authorities, not to mention the IRA, which served as a sort of "people's hero" and made him many enemies. But he was basically an immoral, self-serving power. <br /> <br /> My main problem with "ODC" is that the main character has been developed as a loving Irish scammer. Kevin Spacey does a good job of depicting Michael Lynch with a mixture of oily charm and silent threat, but the character is too immoral and selfish to be considered any hero, even an anti-hero. <br /> <br /> The film is well photographed and well influenced, but it shoots the script. Writer Gerard Stembridge cannot take his mind; Does he write about the Irish "Lock Stock" or grittierravi Martin Cahill's stealing career? This is a problem when the writer relies on his real reality for a real person. It is also unfortunate that "ODC" followed John Boorman's release of "The General", which was a more accurate story of Martin Cahill. Cahill was an insidious thief who knew the value of a good public, so it is not surprising that his exploitation became a film procedure. <br /> <br /> What's surprising is that the studio was ready to take Cahill's story and give her a happy Hollywood-style ending. Kevin Spacey's charismatic-twinkly-bigamist-thief thief Michael Lynch can fly anonymous with his motorcycle "ODC". In the real world, Martin Cahill was executed by the IRA to prove that no one is stupid, outdated, corrupt, and corrupt from a para-military organization. The actual Cahill would never have gone away from his fame because it strengthened his "Man of Man" self-image. When Michael Lynch gives up everything to prevent death in "ODC", it's a weak and low film.
