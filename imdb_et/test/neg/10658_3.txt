The two redeeming qualities of this film were cinematography and a story that was difficult to resist. But the script, direction and some scenes were just terrible. I asked myself why such a good lie would be such a bad film. My only conclusion was that these actors had to believe in the charity that was the basis of the film plot, but knew that the film was full of mistakes. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been so much better and reached a larger audience. It seems to me that some of the scenes in the film are painfully bad, but I still wanted to see how the obvious conclusion would be solved.
