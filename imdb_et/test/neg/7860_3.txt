Although there is much to recommend about Maetel Legend both in concept and in the final product, it is ultimately a bad film. Consider that this is the early life of Maelel, which is usually unclear; at the same time, writers use the opportunity to talk about the machine from the empire. And since Leiji Matsumoto hasn't done his second job, we have Emeralda's sister, her mother, Queen of La Metala and a little Galaxy Express 999 to complement the movie. In short, Maetel is the princess on the planet La Metalle, a planet with irregular orbits, which means that its cycle around the nearest sun reaches the cold stage and that it is artificial Sun dying. On the planet, the whole story is getting colder, increasing the sense of punishment. To protect his specimens and family, the queen decides that mechanization is the only way to ensure the survival of the La Metal people. Enter Lord Hardgear, a robot / cyber who provides tools for work. Through the film, the characters remain mechanized to question whether they are still human? Can Hardgear Be Trusted? Are souls and hearts left? So the fan of Matsumoto's work has a lot to be enjoyed, the questions to be answered, the topics continued, except that the film is meant to be used both as an introduction and as a fan of curiosity. The negatives, especially animation, while the Galaxy Express 999, in the TV series over 20 years ago, is a dirty foot animation and sometimes sketchy character designer. Express 999. Design is very detailed, but unfortunately, the animation has suffered, leaving well-drawn characters "sliding" as the background moves or the camera zooms in, a quick way to animation. However, few, yes little, well-animated scenes are used again in dream sequences, repetitions, and additional scenes. Anyone who seems to see a movie can see how many times Lord Hardgear can drink the same glass of wine. <br /> <br /> The next story, although the concept sounds good, the final product is actually a plot that is repeatedly and repeatedly repeated, how many times the characters encounter the same problems and learn the same things, is practically offensive to the audience and the characters who appear seemingly more sensitive in the former incarnations. Add everything to this terrible character that seems lifeless, superfluous, and the audience is left out of the way, so that it could have been overwritten by another movie, but at least newcomers wouldn't be confused <br /> <br /> And yet at that moment, at least the end is surprising. The difficulties of the inhabitants of La Metal had an impact and rightly disturbed; I think this human-machine theme is annoying. It's hard to know who would recommend Maetel Legend because it is not well animated, written or executed, and confusing when Leiji Matsumoto's mandatory cross reference is introduced. But I can't help but lighten up than thirty years of great entrance, now it's a good cinema. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars out of 5, 2 if you are a fan.
