I think you could say that this film has a potential blade, but nothing else, because the boy did it for filmmakers. The plot is practically incomprehensible, it is sleepy and the behavior is pathetic. And what the hell is a commercial rat? The worst thing is that the climax of this film is the antimony of all anti-climates; plus the title doesn't seem even far from accurate. The only redeeming feature of this movie is the pretty dark haired woman ... well, the blonde girl was pretty nice, but she was annoying and not as good as the brunette. Anyhoo, like many movies, is only visible in MST3K.
