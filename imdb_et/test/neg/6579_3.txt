I don't see this point. This is pointless. Animated people are horrible. Scenes continue and very little continues. The plot is a skeleton and must be padded through a lot of meaningless dramatic, screaming skateboarders, as Disney or Spielberg had planned to drive a movie-based amusement park. Most signs are annoying and unlikely. Some of them show how important they are to add to the climatic scene. They are not. They just disappear without permanent influence. Someone took it as "if you do not believe in Santa Claus, he is robbed on a train on Christmas Eve." It comes from a lot.
