I'm annoyed and terrified by the positive comments that this movie gets. It's not just hockey, manipulative, and melodramatic. It is also disgracefully offensive. Radio "Gooding Jr." is a paradise like a cute little animal like a puppy that is so cute that you want to take her home. 'This mentality is shameless; Radio is never treated as a human, but a manipulative device to bring the sympathy of its audience. Even more frightening are several moments of the film where the radio hits the head / travels / falls over, etc. In these moments of comedy, the audience's smile was simply pure "because it's funny because the radio has slowed down" It's shameless, now I don't think the word "slowed down" is the word for describing people with intellectual disabilities. but it seems to be what the film takes, "The radio has slowed down, but it's okay because he's cute and we like it." Gooding's image seems more suitable for John Water as an inspiring family drama. To add insult to damage, the film is incompetent at every level, Debra Winger is "stereotypical housewives" unaware that her memorable monologue's understanding laughs at anyone who sees the film. John Horner's score is pure juice that always covers tears of tired cinematography. Ed Harris has a decent role he could have slept through, but manages to keep the entire audience focused on the whole film. To conclude, if you consider yourself a decent human being, ignore this movie travesty, read the book, but otherwise leave this terrible film of American history interesting.
