"The Vindicator" is a strange little Canadian film B. At first glance, it seems to be just one cheap (extremely cheap!) "Terminator", but strangely, it also shares some of the original "RoboCop" features that had not yet appeared when it appeared "Vindicator" (1986). Coincidence? Who knows? Anyway, the story is: scientist Carl Lehman seems to be a pretty nice guy working at a superduper secret high-tech research lab, who reports to an amazing boss called Whyte, who will be headed by Film soon at the start of project funding. Carl has a home-loving husband and a kid on the road that makes it even more tragic when he is suddenly killed in a "lab accident". But wait! Carl is not dead! Whyte has mined Carl's brain and added it to his pet project, some kind of experimental bio-mechanical space device. When Carl wakes up in his new body, of course, he gets a little nuts, trash and flees. This is a problem because Whyte (for known reasons only) has programmed a "Rage Reaction" program that causes Carl to kill someone who for some reason touches him. In retrospect, the slight addition to Carli's psyche was probably not the best idea. Robo-Carl sometimes runs through the film somewhat, killing a few casual fingers and other assorted background marks. he returns to his home and contacts his spouse (this scene should be heartbreaking, I think, but it turns out to be comic because Carl's voice is so strongly synthesized that you can hardly understand the word he says). He tells him that he is leaving the city and will never come back because he is in danger, but he wants to stay and help him, yadda yadda yadda. Ultimately, Mr. Hunter hires a gang of commercial gangs, as shown by Pam Grier (!), To hunt and destroy his reasway creation using Carl's wife's bait and predictable (but ridiculously cheap) chaos. <br /> <br /> I'm a B-Movie guy, but "The Vindicator" was so half-confident that it turned into comedy quite quickly. I expect a good number of budgets went into the design of Stan Winston's robo-Carl suit, because it looks really cool, but the rest of the movie has a cheap TV-like look. The script could have used a lot of LOT's work, but then the filmmakers might have received RoboCop's wind production and rushed out of "Vindicator" so they could not be blamed. In both cases, depending on other IMDb comments, I am not the only one who has noticed parallels between "Vindicator" and "RoboCop" and probably "Robo" is the ultimate movie, so there is no need to waste time sitting through this piece of thought if you don't want to to see a film that is best described as the "RoboCop" original drawing, if it was done by the eighth grade.
