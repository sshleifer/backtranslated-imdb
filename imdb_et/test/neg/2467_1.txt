This is by far the stupid thing I've ever seen in celluloid. I thought we started to look at it, assuming it was a "skinemax T&A flick", but after a few breasts, it was. I mean, I have an idea to make stupid movies to show some sexual scenes because they are the only reason to make such a movie. However, this film does not have sex scenes and it makes no sense at all. There is no linear time, scenes move like the wind, winds appear, people appear for no reason, then leave and never explain, the plot has never progressed and nothing happens. I've never been as bad as a bad movie until I saw it. Has the director even been to a film school? Has he ever seen a movie? I don't know, but it looks like she's proud of this lace, because she's still working. I literally walked away from the dumber of this movie, but I still recommend looking at it as it should be shown in a film school in every country, for example, when it comes to making a movie. Move over from space to PLAN 9, you have a new candidate for the worst movie.
