I understand that it was Llyod Kaufman's attempt to record a film in the mine. The whole movie is tuned because the sound roll was junk. Voice transmissions were so bad and terrible. As much as I love Tromat, they tend to have some difficulty working with the voice. Action was terrible. One of the things I enjoyed about this movie was the quick comer of Trey Parker, who made a funny wig of aristocratic jokes. There are many great directors in this movie, such as James Gunn and Eli Roth (Lloyd Kaufman's friends). Again I think it was a Llyods attempt to save the sad movie and try not to lose $ 1,000. I will not go on and on, but this film was a mess. See other Troma titles.
