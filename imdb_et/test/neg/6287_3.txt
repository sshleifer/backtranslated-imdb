Poor old Robert Taylor. Nothing has gone beyond FEDS - it's almost shocking ninety minutes and not much more. This is one of those hair-detective crimes that lead to the narrative of all the leading character - it is usually reserved for comedies these days, but this movie is too serious! Injury; Australian films, especially in the years 2000-01, have generally been exceptionally high quality - but I think there must be some drawbacks. Why even make such a movie, which is probably not good?
