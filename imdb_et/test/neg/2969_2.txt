Some previous reviewers seem to have seen another movie than what I saw tonight ... In fact, this movie is registered in IMDb. Of course, Bobbie Phillips can "fight" and I give this movie 2, but the rest of this movie is just clean and ... Action is bad, the plot is bad, camera angles are bad and effects are bad. bad. Of course, the actors are in physical form, but they can't act! Sometimes I enjoy laughing at watching bad movies, but this movie had no charm and after that movie I saw that I was seeing it. Of course, if you want to see mediocre battles without anything else, this movie is for you. If not, stay away from this movie! PS: Sorry for spelling mistakes ... I'm just tired of this movie!
