Any horror movie that makes Robert Englund (Freddie Kruger!) Then kills him in the opening 5 minutes before opening the credit, and must be seen immediately with suspicion. <br /> <br /> Tony Todd (Candyman!) as a sex guide (his James Earl Jones voice is hysterical, I don't know or care if he's trying to be funny, but I smiled at it). Unfortunately, his role was 5 minutes long. More reasons for doubt and justification. <br /> <br /> Mercedes McNab (Buffy & Angeli AKA Harmony, I had to watch her to see what I remember, but she gets half naked!), Marcus's symbolic black boy (not yet a teen movie) fills the comedy a role that is not really required in a horror movie if it is not meant for robbery. <br /> <br /> Joel Murray (Brother of Murray and Pete Dharmast & Greg) plays Shapiro, who is shooting gonzo video with 2 cute girls. As they take the "Spooky Swap Ghost Tour", the two leading male characters meet other people and run on the rocks and have to leave the boat. So now everything is now isolated in the daddy's night. (Well, you won't come back when you hit the skull!) As the old man is attacked, despite the pulling of the weapon and taking a very clear picture, Marybeth takes more than 30 seconds to cope. who hacked the old man with a hatchet. Is he stupid? It's 29 seconds too long! In terms of plots, this is not really one (I do not classify Undead as a psycho plot, sorry) and it is very bad. Before you restart the cycle, you will be killing, some fleeing, some relieving, and some slow dialogue. <br /> <br /> After an extremely long scene exploring an unpleasant bush with a raccoon, Victor will appear again (some sort of electric tool) and will kill a dark haired porn girl, he will also manage to slice the guide toward Shovel? When Misty stayed with her to see Ben, I felt it was quite obvious that she would be the next to die (I was right, but you didn't see it). <br /> <br /> Filmmakers? Rain does not extinguish burning gasoline, OK? Idiots! Obviously, after the passing of the cemetery, Marcus was next to death, and Ben was wounded in his wounds, but was able to find a wagon with a wagon. <br /> <br /> He has pulled the water into something invisible, he is trying to save him, he has suddenly pulled the boat to his brother and shouts and the film suddenly ends. <br /> <br /> Yes, just like that. No wonder Ben was dead (it seemed he had no hand) and no idea if Marybeth should survive and what happened to Victor. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible ending and no doubt my oral attack on filmmakers got the last review deleted. So much talk, right?
