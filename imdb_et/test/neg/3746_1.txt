I went to the cinema, who suffered this movie in 30 minutes. I left two big friends attached to the grease ball to stay. <br /> <br /> As soon as the film's opening sequence rolled, I felt something was wrong and it wasn't long before I stopped hiding under my spot in embarrassment. I am not one of the films, although they have some redemption function, but it suffers from the terrible editing (in terms of subject and meaning) of bad leadership, bad deeds (character of "Bruno" and impeccable Jean Rochefort catalog - by my friends) and the image correlation that seemed to make art erroneously put the wrong music over the picture and the scene. The worst crime was its general inaccuracy and disbelief (the result of the above-mentioned atrocities). Why was it so terrible? I don't want to waste more time explaining my time. I'd say I'd go and see it myself, but I don't want to fill that project with more than needed. Oh, the screening function had one redemption function: my friend, who rides over his umbrella in the line of silhouettes, hung over when he tried to stabilize himself in a couple of weeks, 125's. unfortunately, this is a terrible effort.
