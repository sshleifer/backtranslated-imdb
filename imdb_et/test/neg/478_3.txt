I am 35. Bruce was a man of Evil Deadis and I still love to watch ED1 and ED2. It was cool to see him as a king two or three years ago in Bubba Ho Tepis, where he showed versatility and great action. However, this Screaming Brain adventure is definitely not for Bruce's early fans. I'm too old for this sh17 or I'm no longer part of Bruce's target group. I'm positive kids aged 9 to 13 love this movie. However, this extended matin√©e sci-fi comedy contains around 5 minutes of interesting moments and the rest are cheap children. Campbell speaks better with Sam Raim and get his brain screaming with the last Evil Dead reunion picture to get my interest back. At least there would be a good director behind the camera ... Sorry Bruce, it just won't cut it for me. Be good.
