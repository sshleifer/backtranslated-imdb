This is not the case with theatrical screens, as is the case with IMAX, a massive, well-known theater system that has stunned and still remains in the release of this audience. As long as the right of the material is right. <br /> <br /> The main problem with "excellent destruction: Moon 3D walking" is that it uses the big screen as its main advantage, it is boring, informative and relentlessly eager to please and amaze us with its exceptional special effects and inspirational quotes from the famous names like Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.
