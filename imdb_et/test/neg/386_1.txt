I classify it as the worst movie ever. <br /> <br /> If I had ever wanted a movie for enemies, that would be the case. The plot is ridiculous, there are only 2 characters, and the match between these characters just puts the faith. <br /> <br /> These factors combine this into a very boring film. <br /> <br /> My wife and mother walked on the film for about 15 minutes. I thought the movie that boring and slow * must * have cool interesting plot twists and a was quite disappointed if something exciting wasn't realized. <br /> <br /> I briefly considered sending filmmakers for my 2-hour lost life.
