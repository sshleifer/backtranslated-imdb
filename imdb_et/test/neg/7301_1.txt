I knew I wasn't going to see a high quality movie if that title was added to the "B-Class Night Night" friends site. Despite warnings, I was still surprised at how bad this film was. Luckily, we had a lot to share the pain with each other ... The film is trying to talk about the dark future where Hawk (the mad character of the mad character) can escape the trouble. In reality, the plot is a thinly concealed excuse for producers to promote the philosophies of their lives (see the final credit and "these people are not a real disclaimer" for a real laugh). The film is often defective and unable to develop its characters to some extent. What's even worse is editing this movie. The movie repeats scenes (often 10 to 20 seconds) up to 4 or 5 times in a row. I think it was an attempt to mimic things like Jean Claude Van-Damme's struggle, but if it is completely unsuccessful. The film would probably not be about 1/3 of its length if we were not forced to look at the main character who moved his head half an hour and a half (yes, it all happens in this repetitive scene). I'm giving this film a prize I've ever seen. I doubt it will be any time soon.
