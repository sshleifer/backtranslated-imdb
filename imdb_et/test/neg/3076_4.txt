With an interesting hodge-podge. It could have been more, but the imagination does not seem to be a script or direction. The man has been murdered by his wife and his lover. The culprits are doing a very thorough job of seeing him guilty. But a man (Richard Thomas) whose psychiatric records show him "stable" and "unimaginable" are able to escape from prison, beat him in a conspiracy to a beach home, and secretly record the conversation between where they show their guilt. Then it drops randomly to the tape recorder with all the evidence of its seawater, but manages to download it. He shows great creativity and improvisation for an unimaginable man when you ask me. <br /> <br /> The tape is now a damaged item, but it is enough to break the woman's lover and break the confession. Bad people are being punished. Good people are saved. <br /> <br /> Taking a position is impressive. The beach house is more than a wooden exterior that has emerged from the Fort Fisher battlefield on Cape Fear Peninsula. The house was demolished immediately after packing the production process. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful place. Unfortunately, it is somewhat difficult to see because someone seems to have taken every scene through tights stretched on the camera lens. It's all very cloudy. And for the natural glory of the entire location, the viewer never gets a real place in the sand, the texture of the gray crust in the evergreen evergreen. <br /> <br /> Action is fine, but there is nothing for performers to do. Dick Olsen gives the best result as often happens to a foolish but not unreasonable defender. Virginia Madsen radiates infidelity with every trick. Ted McGinley is within his immoral weakness. <br /> <br /> The musical result mixes gently and mysteriously. If you want to hear the original from which it was hanged, rent Hitchcock's "Vertigo" and listen to Bernard Hermann's fine theme. <br /> <br /> I can't think of any specific reason to catch it, except for the perfect boredom.
