Don't do me wrong, I love gentlemen TV series. It was funny, twisted and completely inspired. I was waiting for the movie, the premise was interesting and I was waiting to see what they had done with the characters and where the strange story would take them away. <br /> <br /> It was a total disappointment, the three weakest characters for the starters were the leaders and it contained only small parts for other characters (why not choose mickey & Pauline, papa Lazaro or baths and Edward for the main parts!? ). It was always half-baked and bad sloppy humor. <br /> <br /> In fact, the real ridiculous periodic drama / comedy (and I use the word comedy loosely). It disturbed the main story and felt discomfort, let alone painfully failed. The direction of the film is terrible and often feels that the lines were the characters of one key. Very hurried. <br /> <br /> Then - the three main lines of plasticine. What the hell was that all about? Just ridiculous it seemed that the gentleman's league noted it at the end. <br /> <br /> All in all, I found myself watching my watch and deceiving the whole film experience. What was once an amazing television series is a hard-hit movie. <br /> <br /> If I could give it to 10 out of 10, I would. Don't waste your money by seeing it.
