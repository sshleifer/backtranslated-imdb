Well, at least this was the last step I could find in Blockbuster, because this movie was just terrible. I mean, I understand how hard it would be to get rid of the evil house. We are talking about starting with terrible fire, intimidation, flooding, etc. But the mirror? How hard can it be to get out of the mirror?! It was the most terrible movie that could put Amityville's title on the picture! <br /> <br /> Well, a group of friends who are pretty much from the beginning is a bunch of freaks. One of them is a kind of photographer and buys a haunted mirror from the horrible guy of homeless people, teaching me a valuable lesson, not buying things from a homeless guy. Of course, this group causes terrible deaths and chaos, although I cannot imagine that no one is missing them. <br /> <br /> Please leave Amityville: a new generation, I have some complaints about my generation, so I think it was an idea. Not so crazy. : P But believe me, it's terribly acting, not well thought out and not even scary! I feel so bad for the original writers of Amityville's horror that they have to cry every time a person sees this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
