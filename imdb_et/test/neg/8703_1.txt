This movie was terrible. Biblically very inaccurate. Moses was 80 when he led people out of Egypt, for about forty years. Moses was forty years old when he fled from Egypt, forty years, and was with them forty years. Moses was 120 years old when he died and was left with a privilege over land. I understand that films use a lot of "poetic licenses" because the biblical account is not so long, but when the biblical film is made, they still have to reflect known facts and keep the general taste of the main biblical character, in this aspect of the film and in many others. Even though the 1956 version also had its own problems, it was a lot better in theater.
