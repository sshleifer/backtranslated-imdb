I don't think I can add much more to what I said about this movie. But I can offer a little memory of seeing ST-V in the theater. In the last (terrible) scene, when the camera pulls out of the camping field and it seems likely that the credit will run every other time, the audience seemed to be rising steadily. Typically, at least, running fans will be watching this movie until the final responsibility is given up. As people came out, I remember not listening to laughing and joyful catching, but a few murmurs. fans would like it. What an idiot. Fans were the ones who best interrupted it first! <br /> <br /> Favorite Worst Scene: Target shooting at the Voyager space probe through the periscope! The space must be much smaller than we thought.
