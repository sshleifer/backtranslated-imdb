I enjoy different types and high quality movies. Whether it's your typical standard Hollywood action movie or your Oscar season tear-jerk, movies that meet a certain standard are almost always enjoyable for me. <br /> <br /> Soap girl was nothing but confusion. First of all, we meet the Mayan massage parlor, which seems to attract all customers. The virgin poet named Harry comes one day and they fall in love. After that, a lot of twists are placed on the plot, which seems to not move anywhere. <br /> <br /> Although many have commented on the controversial question that a white man uses an Asian prostitute, remember that this film was made by an Asian director who wanted to bring the problem. But whether he succeeds or not, the question is not whether the film is enjoyable or not. <br /> <br /> For me, the soap girl can't meet the expected standard of movies. It was hard for me to get emotionally involved with this movie because it is loose and mediocre. Worse still, the director seems to have wanted to make a drama when the tone falls more on comedy. <br /> <br /> A movie like a soap girl who can't catch me in the magic trap always leaves me bored. Throughout the film, I couldn't think of "What is it?" The film must answer this question before doing so. If not, what you finally get is an empty push to catch the audience. <br /> <br /> Rating: D + <br /> <br />
