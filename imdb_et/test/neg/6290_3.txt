KK should sing - this movie was great. I do not understand that the boys are cruel and the romance between Miles and KK - sexual scenes were also forced. The end was terrible - unresolved - justifying the murder. And all the boy's voyeurism was strange ..... the mother always wrestled with the boy - don't you think she could get her with Freud? And why no one taught KK how to speak instead of monotone, <br /> <br /> It's good that I only paid $ 1.00 for that. <br /> <br />
