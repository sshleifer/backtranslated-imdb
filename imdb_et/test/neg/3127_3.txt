I really want to believe that the above quotation (specifically, the translation of English subtitles), which was written, not in the letter of refusal of the publisher's letter, was supposed to be in English. -yah. But if so, the manager, Leos Carax, apparently ignored to inform the participants of the true nature of the film. They are all so terribly serious about their images that I have to stop. Carax actually takes himself seriously or else there is so much frustration for everyone, especially the audience, that he cannot be disturbed by allowing anyone to joke. <br /> <br /> Some drivers are able to go slanting and strange, because they do so with a living and unique personal style (eg David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky). Others use a more subtle approach, however, narrating the surreal elements in the story fabric (such as the later, less bizarre work of Krzysztof Kieslowski and David Cronenberg). In Pola X, Carax throws away the confusion and encourages her to find her guilt. Well, here it is: the pace is uneven and uncomfortable, especially with frequent consistency; redundant characters (eg gypsy mother and child); most of the performances are burnt down; Lighting is often poor, especially in sexual intercourse; unconnected scenes retract into the movie for no apparent reason; and the list continues. <br /> <br /> It must not be completely negative, it should be noted that there were some exaggerating exceptions. I liked the musical result, even the cofoof-industrial-techno-music that is played in a scattered abandoned complex whose main characters retreat to the other side of the film (perhaps a reference to Andy Warhol's 60s factory)? . Much of the rural photography was a beautiful, obvious attempt to contrast with grimy city settings. And even in the Middle Ages, Ceneing shows Deneuve that he still has it. His performance was also the only one among the big characters who didn't go into the bathroom. Experimenting is admirable, even if the experiment does not work. But Carax is trying something new here; The film is a pasty of innumerable items borrowed from earlier films, and after several decades of watching the film and thousands of films later, I am no longer suffering from such unbelievable, poorly formulated fear. At the beginning of the 21st century, the question remains: except for Jean-Pierre Jeunet, does France have * any * directors who know how to make a watchable film anymore? Rating: 3/10.
