If you are a six-year-old boy in dinosaurs, you love this movie. If you are someone else, you move your eyes about every 15 seconds. If you want to start with a selection of things like actors, special effects, dialogue or the lack of a more coherent plot that makes even the slightest point, you have a lot of materials. If everything you want is a safe dinosaur fantasy movie for your child, he will do it well. This means that there is a lot of entertainment for children that is much smarter and some are even acceptable or enjoyable for adults. If your child is not uncompromising in the dinosaur's mood, you are probably better off looking for something else.
