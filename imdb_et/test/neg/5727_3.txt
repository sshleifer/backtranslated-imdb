I think the company that made this film wanted people to think about Conan's movies, but unfortunately, those who did it would do it. You mean, man Conan's movies were pretty cool ... it's totally boring and sucks. The story of caring? It doesn't help you like this movie more or less, because it just seems like a really cheap movie. Arnold, he doesn't seem to belong to why he was willing to play that role that is beyond me. Probably for the money. I just love the monster in the water that turns out to be a machine. Lame! This movie is simply and simply terrible.
