What to say about "Dead End Road" ... <br /> <br /> Let's just say that Edgar Allen Poe would have been so ashamed. Working, writing, impact and everything in this movie was just terrible. It doesn't even do justice! This movie was the biggest garbage I ever had to sit on. That's why I stopped it about 20 minutes before the end because I personally didn't care what happened to the cases. I've seen bad, but it was definitely the worst. I got it because I'm a fan of the store and it was just bad. Just bad. <br /> <br /> What annoys me is that negative numbers cannot be evaluated.
