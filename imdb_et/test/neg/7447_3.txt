For most people, RoboCop 3 is a movie that really is a big shame on the RoboCop. It has little fans and most people hate this shameless commercial PG-13 approach. Now, I'm not saying RoboCop 3 is good. Frankly, it sucks a lot. But if it is a properly fired and executed film, it overcomes the chaos of this chain. Yes, the truth is that RoboCop 2 is the worst and unnecessary order for almost a masterpiece. So, when RoboCop 3 turns Robo into a superhero for kids who make it particularly popular - at least it does it publicly. I don't know where RoboCop 2 starts and ends, I don't know what or who it is, I don't understand what's going on, I don't understand what jokes are deliberate and what's not, I get crazy when I i try to understand the characters, nothing says anything someone says, i can't believe someone looked at the script and thought it would work and i can't believe Irvin Kirshner saw the end result and thought he liked what he sees . Probably he wasn't, neither Miller nor Weller nor Allen. It is not difficult to understand why. <br /> <br /> RoboCopil now has 2 fans, I know it. In most cases, they belong to this absolute anti-pretense league, ignoring someone who anticipated the depth or content of the first film, as trainees of the academic Roger Ebert Sith. It's just fun, good deed, and great entertainment, the argument goes. Yes, I think if you just don't listen to what any character says, you might fool yourself that we might have a suit instead of Weller instead of Arnold. Don't do me wrong, I like a good action movie that has a pure entertainment value because it's just - the most satisfying - in the round. But RoboCop 2, sir, is not such a thing. <br /> <br /> See the first few scenes. This terrible actor makes Robo repeat that he is just a machine, and then it goes into an operative speech about how he can never be a man where after Murphy's wife (who complains about OCP robott-stalkings) and goes out of the blue this sad a little moment with him and you never heard again! I would definitely want to go to the scene of this movie because each of them has such absurdities. It's like a twelve-year-old son of a fan who has made a manuscript, characters act completely randomly and say it first, then say. OCP wants to end the crime with the new Robo, especially the drug called "doll", but then it seems they really want to get this big capitalist empire and control the whole city? policy is abandoned I think it is understandable for the mayor of a comic strip, a villain (played by Tom Noonan, who made a better version of his last action in the hero and says a lot) but this machine is still in use. The woman behind it has a schedule that is impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the 12-year-old, this film has a "Hub" infamous role, the crazy child who swears and kills the people the child's actor plays. I'm not going to be moral about it, it's a free world, and if you want a psycho boy in your movie, go to it. I don't know how much of Frank Miller's original vision was put into it, but at least credit is recognized as a "story." And when I ground, I saw it as a rather cool character. Surely this gloomy killing is that I have a kid killer, but again it is RoboCop's world and who would be surprised? The whole business where OCP is trying to get all this giant monopoly is dystopically good and good. It would also be good for RoboCop to contact his wife and child, being somehow hidden, and as far as I can see a natural and logical step when they have to make RoboCop's sequel now. <br /> <br /> But of course they are just ideas. As many people have already said, the scenario is 100% confusing. The child has one scene (a torture scene) where it suggests that he is just a stereotype that is a boy, and then we have such an unimaginable scene where he dies and gets everything with a soft and friendly head. Why does he just not take his swallow and try to take his last soul off? Isn't that what his character would be? Does he give his life a little bit in bed? Not necessarily that his last words are "sucking", why? It doesn't really make sense, and it can be said about everyone in this movie, not everything. Is the police a strike? Is a RoboCop Machine or a Man? What to do to turn Robo into a community service machine for 10 minutes? I think it's pretty funny that I don't deny it. But why build it and then throw it away? And why hell is Allen so abused? and what it is Weller has an obvious desire to express his character and yes, well, the threads are many and the mess is huge. <br /> <br /> This review is as confused as the movie. The only reason I give the extra letter is because of the first film actors, they have good intentions. I mean, it's a bit stable, some anchor in this sea of ​​bad movies.
