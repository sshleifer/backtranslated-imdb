This movie was pointless. I can't even call it sci-fi because it requires more than just a room. "Max Q" is not a space for the whole movie. The story / plot is uneven, most have nothing to write home, even though it would be strange in the middle film topped up ... In addition, it's not particularly exciting or well-spoken. At least in a quality way, it is at least evenly balanced, because nothing or anyone seems to be. All are equally blissful. I usually find "space shots", even if it is just 90 minutes of arduous entertainment that is bounded by a low budget with pity, but "Max Q" didn't give me that satisfaction. All in all, it is a waste of time.
