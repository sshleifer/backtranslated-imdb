Perhaps the best show is that he slips right after the fans of Conan O'Brien and Late Night suddenly wait for Carson's show. Carson Daly cannot hold the candle of host of Leno, Letterman, O'Brien or any other late night talk show, and the last speech seems to hit more than hit in this genre of hit and break. Only showing a redeeming quality is that it is so short. But I wouldn't call it crap. Carson Daly is sincere and does not hide that his show is not great (that honesty is really useful here), while some of the recent calls and material seem to have been stolen, they sometimes find the mark. In fact, some Carson assemblies have been quite fun and the sketches sometimes have decent comedy moments. higher than high school AV team. However, he doesn't have a quick spirit that makes Conan so much fun. I don't like his musical guests, but that's more, because I'm not a fan of this music, so I don't hold it against him. <br /> <br /> A band in the house. I don't know Joe Firstmann's band and don't compare them to CBS Orchestra, Tonite Show Band with Kevin Eubanks or Max Weinberg 7. Even Cleeto and Cleetones are better. But I think the Firstmans band companions are still showing. Especially the Alto Sax player, who sometimes appears (he has long dark hair and sunglasses and who always plays in the upper register), if at all, look at him, I'll do it. <br /> <br /> All in all, this exhibition is not even worth a full-sized kibble n 'bit. But it has an audience and wants more younger "mtv generation". If you don't have a cable and you are at 1:37, you don't really have much to choose from and surprise surprise in this time frame. So, if you are waiting for Poker After Dark to come, then 30 minutes of last call will not kill you while waiting.
