Around the circular forests there is a bunch of teenage dirty men. They are fun; little do they know that soon emo-refugee will release "Deliverance" or "Hills Have Eyes". He's armed with games and a firefighter. And he has an eye that bleeds or something. Why Park? I do not know. Maybe she doesn't like Smokey Bear or something. But he's wearing the army / navy store when it helps. <br /> <br /> Crosses send one helicopter to fight the score; it is all you will ever see, except for a number of people who are somewhere in the fire but do nothing. Some policeman or ranger or militiaman, or whatever he's on a helicopter, falls with a defective yarn. <br /> <br /> Everyone now rides their dirt bikes as they audit the motocross. They're forever pop wheelies, no Evel Knievel jumps, spin around etc. They claim incessantly. Fires are fake as a $ 3 bill; it is the same film material from ten different perspectives, and the fever does not grow or move. And you never ever see any fire extinguisher. <br /> <br /> A SyFy Channel movie with about 0% science fiction added. What to expect from it: poor performance, low cost effects and a story that goes somewhere (like bikes and fire somewhere). Ridiculous insomniac treatment.
