Cyclone is a little redeemable piece, even for such bad entertainment. One of my friends took the band overflowing from St. Vincent DePaul's Trash Bin. Okay, this may be a bit annoying, but it was supposed to be a clothes box, not an old devilish old VHS, something that our unhappy members of our society don't need to make their lives better. This can be considered a mercy. Watching a movie like Cyclone really adds up to their problems. In any case, the basic assumption of a woman with a super-powerful motorcycle that it is armed with missiles and lasers is not even properly utilized. There are two high-speed chasing vehicles that drive less than 40 KMPH and an ultra-fast motorcycle that is in danger of running out of obsolete wagons. that. At the top of the movie, there is only one scene where bicycle horses are used, and it is ridiculously ineffective or simply ridiculous when it is. It includes a laser beam that looks like they should come from an evil wizard against the eighties swords and witches that created great flame cracks that seem to have no direct effect on their targets. The rest of the movie is just annoying hard to watch the filler. Many bad actors, yes, even combs, and Landau suck in, most of whom seem to have been pulled out of a porn movie that is moving around, exchanging a very bad dialogue in a desperate attempt to barely delay a single plot. Some policemen and motorcycle repairers are some badly staged fighting sequences and some extraordinarily awkward comics. The lower Benny Hill comedy grandmother can't bring her back when she leads her chest. Basically, "money" are scenes that involve bicycle actually things, little and flat and the rest is clumsy stuffing. Skip it.
