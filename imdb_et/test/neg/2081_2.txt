Paul Mazursky is attacking this movie. Writing, directing, casting and acting (except Victorio Gassman) are all out of the mark. I remember the comments from the age of 20 back to mediocre, but I thought it could still be seen. Like Susan Sarandon, Raul Julia (who mostly crosses her scenes) and John Cassavetes, I thought I got a lot more. The music chosen for the film is confusing, the confusion between New York and Greece and the overall pace leaves much to be desired. Why Paul Mazursky felt the need to refresh this story or add that it was puzzling - this reduction in Prospero and his daughter takes very little import and adds much more to the game. The game is still not the best of Shakespeare, but it doesn't seem like a good decision yet. Unfortunately, there is nothing to suggest in this movie.
