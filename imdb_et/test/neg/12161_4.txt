I went to watch this movie because it was recommended for my husband and he wanted to go. <br /> <br /> We both tried to watch our watches before the end of the movie to see how much we had to endure. Two hours and six minutes, that's it. It is divided approximately equally between battle scenes (about a dozen, all interchangeable) and plot development. <br /> <br /> One might think that if the subject is the son of a small tribal commander, conquering half the world, drawing would have been relatively easy. There's a fair bit of raw material to make a pretty good story. However, the writers wrote it completely. We don't have a real history. Instead, we get the Hollywood version of history. <br /> <br /> What keeps the young Temudjin through his long - almost endless, actually or so, that they look to the viewers - suffering? Why, of course, a good woman's love. <br /> <br /> How does he get out of prison? Well, the old monk, who confesses his innate goodness and majesty, sets the good woman, the talisman, on the whole continent, symbolizing Temudjin's love for him, dropping dead just to him to find him when he is there, in the talisman. And of course he goes and, if (inexplicably) becomes rich and powerful, he will save him. <br /> <br /> How does he escape? Well, he goes to the shrine of the great wolf-god Tengri (or any such name), and Tengri sets him free from magic. Yes, right. <br /> <br /> Why does he want to become a Mongol ruler? Hunt-god again probably. Off goes to Temudj to ask for instructions and - surprise! surprise! - He gets it. "Laws," he says. "What the Mongols need is laws. Good, simple." Nice, it was impressive. <br /> <br /> And finally, how does he win the decisive battle against the more powerful forces of his rival? Certainly, there is a better tactic, but also an old wolf with the help of God who sends a storm to the height of the battle. All the troops light up when the thunder rolls and the flash flashes (Mongols fear thunder, you see) - but not our temudj. The brothers, who are completely forced by his bravery, recognize him as king! <br /> <br /> I don't know what forces people to produce such garbage. The funny thing is that it has all kinds of sharp realisms: lots of milk, dirt and violence. Just as the producers of this movie wanted to get trivial things right, viewers didn't notice how some childhood childhood is. <br /> <br /> There are piles of violence in a graphic close-up: slashings, bleeding, blood withdrawals, blood sprays, blood clouds - in fact, the brothers had a good time. Despite realism, it is impossible to take seriously. <br /> <br /> I have to mention the ridiculous CGI last battle scene. How can anyone think that these things seem realistic over me. They are not. Oh, and it's all the usual Hollywood style - a breathtaking panoramic view of amazing landscapes and a super close-up of Stedicam stuff for the battlefield. And the standard Dolby super sound effect that comes from piglets and droplets and a steady low-frequency glow to maintain tension. <br /> <br /> Don't be annoying. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
