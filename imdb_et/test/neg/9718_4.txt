Think of "Charmed" testosterone instead of estrogen and you get a general idea about this picture. A very flat story with mediocre consequences and anti-climax, which ends the opening of the door 2. We hope someone will have to spend their money smarter. I would recommend "Charmed - movie" because compared to this "Charmed" kicked ass and I only watched to show that please my girlfriend !! Wait and watch it on the DVD in the rain on Sunday if you have nothing better to do. Or better, but download it, so you don't waste your money. The first 15 minutes were fine. But the most fun of the movie and the only highlight of this movie is when Reid says, "Kiss my ass Harry Potter" during the rock ride. Although they are not worth the Potter's kiss, because Potter is so cool and at least his films have a story. The fire was even worse than !!!
