The TV director uses astral design to kill people in the form of a blue man. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a frightening movie that just sits in front of you and makes you wonder why you look at it. I sat down to the end of the movie, and I can't really give you anything more than a brief understanding of what the movie was like, because I found out what the other things were pointing to. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend it. I think my feelings are best summed up by the fact that I paid the dollar as a double function for the DVD and I feel it is hanging.
