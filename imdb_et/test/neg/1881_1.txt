What really amazed me about this movie was that it was so wrong. First of all, who in the late 1980s (when the film was going) lived like this family? The college professor does not make enough money to support the film's lifestyle. As a result, he and his wife at home are suffering financially, especially when he gets cancer. Secondly, Streep is my age and most women, especially in their class (educated, white, well), experienced a feminist movement. But this woman seems to ignore her anachronistic behavior. In fact, I felt she was a very controlling woman who kept her husband an emotional child, taking care of her every need. I have admired Carl Franklin's films in the past, and I like Meryl Streep, but what is manipulative and lying.
