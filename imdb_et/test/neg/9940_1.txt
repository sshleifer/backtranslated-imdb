Heftig og Begeistret (intense and enthusiastic) is a documentary similar story of a male choir in Berlevåg in northern Norway, where the weather is cold and hostile, the days are dark and cities are facing young people moving to areas inhabited in southern Norway, where the climate is warmer and where there is more climate opportunities. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful part of this movie is the people themselves. People in the choir, aged 30 to 95 years, have all the unique, colorful lives and very enjoyable beings. They are characterized by a comprehensive climate and economic recession and have adapted to the necessary lifestyle. Throughout the film, we get a little bit of information about many people in the choir and we follow them through songs, church and port events, and finally Murmansk's journey. <br /> <br /> The film's outdoor environment is very beautiful and characteristic of Norwegian nature. Scenography is also natural and taken directly from the choir and the peoples lives we meet. Living room, bathroom, kettle in oven; there is nothing artificial in this film, not people, not the environment, not their music, not their feelings. Everything is as real as possible. <br /> <br /> It all loses when it comes to giving a story. It is very beautiful and real, but why do we see it? Is it because of the songs? Is it because of nature? Or just see the story of Berlevåg Mens Choir, their life and some of these trips. If it exists, this message is that this small society is delivering life through social events such as cream. The choir has been saving people for many years. <br /> <br /> It's all nice, but as popular as it has seen in almost 200,000 Norway, there is something wrong. There is no beginning or end. No one can or will lose anything, no one will post or try to convince the audience that it is good or that life is great there. Why was this movie made? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry. It's a nice movie about good people, but compared to the average European, Scandinavian or Norwegian film - it doesn't deserve 10 out of 10. It's closer to 4 out of ten, and that's what I give it. br /> <br /> If you see it in a movie theater, you should expect the average age of the audience to be around 55-60. He announced that all theaters are constantly high. Perhaps this is the reason why he gets so much praise in the news and good classes in IMDB: it's a film about parents, parents. This is the movie "I don't regret anything in my life" and the story that says living in a small town like Berlevåg can be a nice life.
