Frankly speaking, Outline says pretty much. The Andromina planet (which must not be confused with Jemima's aunt) is represented by cheap L.A. There are no removers, so the last male visitors leave the workers. <br /> <br /> Men are mistaken for kings or arrested on smiling spies (although, despite being women on the planet, they only get two women who participate in girls' sexual scenes) that men are good. Well, not the men who made this movie, somehow! <br /> <br /> But the boy, do we see that many, wonderful amounts of softcore sex and nudity. It has a lot less than usual for such valves, so change the channel if you don't like such a movie and rub your teeth when you are of that type.
