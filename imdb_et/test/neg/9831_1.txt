I don't know if I hate this movie as much as I did when I looked at it two weeks ago, but if you wait for the events described in the box, forget it ... it would have been a good movie. The big descent described in the box is not comparable to the complete stigmatization that I am watching this movie. If you have seen the HBO taxi cab testimonials, it is the same, only fancy and not even far from interesting. If you really want to see something interesting about a cab driver, check out the Encore from time to time for a 20-minute short time ... it's really worth it. I've never asked for a movie ever until I saw it ... thing. Bored, boring, boring. It offers one unique feature that is: it leaves you with the opportunity to decide what happens to every traveler, letting your imagination fill the gaps. What would be nice if you were dealing with these people. Instead, I found myself screaming at the screen, crying like a child, praying at the end of the movie or my own death. The driver of the cab (though he played well, weighing) runs through randomly sensitive emotions, ranging from sarcastic to sympathetic and fierce and apathetic. Sometimes it is appropriate, mostly it is only in your own interest. "Damn, I learned all these emotions in the classroom and I use them!" Now that I was thinking again, I hate this movie as much as I did!
