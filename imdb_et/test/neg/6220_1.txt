After sitting on this movie, I've decided it's one of the WORST movies I've ever seen. I knew it from the moment I was shouting and moving three teenage girls when they (OMG!) Again met, and then watching the same thing that only old women do to be my mother. And it was just the first few minutes. Yeesh. So here are my comments ... <br /> <br /> 1. Middle-aged women + ridiculous dances are moving with hips and upper costume = not a good idea. <br /> <br /> 2. Pierce Brosnan couldn't get out of the paper bag. There is practically no other heap of stools in this matter. <br /> <br /> 3. The songs were so random. It was obvious to me that they were thrown into the nervous and STUPID plot. <br /> <br /> 4. My three-year-old nephew could have written a better script. <br /> <br /> I was squeezing or laughing during the movie. And I really like the musicals of the movie. Of course they have to be a little horny ... but it was ridiculous. What a waste of talent. I mean, you have big actors and actors in this movie ... I'm embarrassed for being part of their career now. I'm sorry to waste my money and time on it.
