My wife and I met the professional production of "Merry Widow" in 1982 - in English, but with translation. <br /> <br /> This "adaptation" only shows the very basic skeleton of the original plot. "Most of the characters have been deleted with the entire B-graph and all but one character has been renamed. Most of the characters in the movie are not in the operetta. The action has been moved to Paris in Washington DC and then to Pontevedro's fictional state, which the film has renamed" Marshovia "and only later in Paris. The result is that we will not reach the beginning of the original game in about 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> And the main source of voltage will be deleted. Early, years ago, Count Danilo and the heroine were very in love, but his family refused to allow them to marry because he was poor; this is his broken heart, which has made him a careless playboy. Now that he is a widow, he is the richest woman in the world, he loves him and he loves him, but he pride does not allow him to allow anyone, even himself, and he has to spend three acts that play his games to break him. A troubled aristocratic rope who does not admit that he is in love with a rich woman because he fears what a human d think they gave decades after the "Widow" of 1906 an important part of the Vienna operetta. In this film they have never met before, which hangs not only the heart of the whole thing, but almost all of the comedy. <br /> <br /> Lamas does a decent job. <br /> An interesting musical point is that we hear several times the Tr√©s Parisien fragment, which is an additional song written (in English, despite the title) on the London premiere, which was not as much as I know, usually American production until the 1980s.
