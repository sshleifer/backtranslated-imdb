I was 19 years old in 1970 when he came out and heard how funny it was when he came out and read the comments here, I finally rented it and watched it. I never laughed - a very unpleasant flick - and I usually love the Reiner. I can't figure out why it's funny. I had no smiles. And I love comedies! Well, at least now I know what everyone called. Not my idea of ​​comedy. Go for renting a Buster Keaton Navigator or Love Box - now these comedy classics! When it comes to renting, you have a backup, so your whole evening is no harm. Item 3 of 10
