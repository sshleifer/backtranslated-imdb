There are films that are leaders and movies that are followers. <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" was the leader. And here's one of his followers. <br /> <br /> The "Party Camp" is about as interchangeable as any of its braternies who laid the depths that the "meatballs" (original) so successfully mined. Of course it was Bill Murray. So what is "Party Camp"? <br /> <br /> I'm glad you asked this question. <br /> <br /> Jewel Sheperd has made them for bread and butter, and what side does the dish offer! Even if he's a rich twerp (Cribb), an innocent (dirty, dirty) girlfriend, he offers home steam for all his parts. And yes, guys, he shows (if you know what I mean and I think you're doing it). My gosh that his smile can melt through titanium. <br /> <br /> What? Oh yes, film. Something special, as I said; Every cheap joke is targeted and hit (about foot level). And the eternal teen Jayne is good to laugh or for two. But instead of feeling humor, it is nudity, flat sex jokes, more nudity, a soft core of dreams, a sex symbol just for (CLOTHED!) For Leering, even more nudity .... <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... Maybe it's a good idea if Bill Murray doesn't. <br /> <br /> Two stars. Jewel for the course. A lot of "camps" but not many "parties".
