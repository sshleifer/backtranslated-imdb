I don't think of anything, I repeat that something like this "movie" is positive! The whole 1-hour 45-minute movie could be a short 5-minute movie! Nothing is happening in most scenes, and it seems that only the camera was left to save time! Everything you see is somebody in the background who walked around or watches the TV without a specific topic or even what it is! I just feel like I've wasted 105 minutes of my weekend, my family and my friends! If the film is badly done or if the scenario is not big, this is another story, at least it will leave you with nothing but DISTANT, I have to call it "movie" because it was a movie recorded with the camera. . <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, imagine the movie has a 105-minute movie based on two three lines! What do you finally get? 5% content and 95% fillers! It is exactly that the "distant" were at least for us! The actors did a great job with nothing special about them, they hardly talked or showed special emotions! I took this movie in the comedy section of the store, based on what I read on the back of this cover. I still wonder what it was funny to see after watching the movie.
