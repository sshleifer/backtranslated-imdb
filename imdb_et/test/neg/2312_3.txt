Anyone who loves both intellectual and just stories about songs must be tempted by this film. But as Catherine Breilla wrote and directed, who seems to have played in her congressional film experience, it does not create a tedious and conversational film of interest. <br /> <br /> The main character, Jeanne (Anne Parillaud), is a Breillat screen form, cheated by the director trying to film convincing sex with two heavy actors (Gr√©goire Colin is an actor and Roxane Mesquida is an actor). One "comic" is Jeanne, who puts the actor in the use of a fixed dildo to get sex into the scene, but even this sight quickly carries the air and we fall under the film in a movie that knows more than "deleted scenes" on DVD as sure French comedy class.
