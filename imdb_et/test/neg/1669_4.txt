It was a comedy of the 1970s, bombing in psychiatry, and Beverly Hills. I do not mind this, but I challenged the more injustice of this marriage and religion: two issues that secular filmmakers (ie all in Hollywood and elsewhere) cannot be stopped. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau plays an amazing character, "Donald Becker", who walks with a cloak of insults that offend me, but when Hollywood is ever concerned about insulting Christians? <br /> <br /> Anyway, despite being crap, the movie has entertaining moments and even some charm. Dan Aykroyd is good for nutty and Donna Dixon ("Laura Rollins") is a drop. I'm sorry he didn't have a bigger role.
