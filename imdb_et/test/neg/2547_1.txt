What a terrible movie! It is perfectly the degeneracy of French society, where the most important respect for healthy values ​​and traditions is completely lost. The plot is pointless, the movie is not funny at all and the characters are completely low and uninteresting. At least, direction and cinematography are very poor and forced. Catherine Deneuve is just as bad an actor as she always was, even when she was directed by Bunuel Belle De Jouris. The rest of the generally good pain (Vincent Lindon, Line Renaud, Jean Yanne) seems completely lost in the vulgar ocean, spreads and riots. I cannot draw in parallel with the magnificent James Ivory's "Le Divorce", whose thoughtful imagination is in French and American mores, its supreme cinematographic work, and its range. After watching "Le Divorce", you may feel some empathy with the French, regardless of their fans. "Belle-Maman" only leaves you frustrated with your moral bankruptcy and helplessness.
