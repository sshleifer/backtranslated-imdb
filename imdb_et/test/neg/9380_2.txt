Persepolis' only good thing is the shadows created in German expressionism-style animation and a hint of history. This film missed me. It concerned a woman who was not satisfied with her culture, trying to do everything else and then returning to her roots. Here he finds once more great dissatisfaction and finally gives up the final, so that all other people in his country can find out the situation and what they are doing now that he would not support them. It does not reach the conclusion and leaves us feeling that this woman has no loyalty. Keep in mind that it is intercultural and does not have enough background that seems important and real. He is listening to so many voices and is likely to become a citizen of the world than anyone who has any ties with his native Iranian culture. The only thing I got against this movie was angst.
