This movie is too long. I lost the story in one hour. Saratoga Trunk talks about Ingrid Bergman, a well-known New Orleans man and his lover's child. After her mother's death in Paris, Bergman comes to New Orleans to scare her father's "legitimate" family and extortion. He will meet Gary Cooper, who also wants revenge against the railroad poisoners who cheat their father on their land in Texas. She pulls her into her charts and the movie pops up at Saratoga resort. Long and boring, but it's worth checking out if you're a Bergman or Cooper fan. Miniature Cupidon offers a unique light spot in this tendency.
