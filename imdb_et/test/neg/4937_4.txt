"Shuttle" is an indie thriller of about four young adults traveling by night from the airport to find out that the driver is a sadistic psychopath. <br /> <br /> While some frighten and this is an unusually interesting plot, some aspects are simply not. Poor dialogue and unlikely characters give good reason to care for them. But often temporary acts work and ask you the question "What would you do?" and usually what you don't want to do is what these bus idiots do. <br /> <br /> If you expect a meaningless, bloody horror movie, you are wrong. It's a movie that forces you to use your mind, but unfortunately not to the end. <br /> <br /> Four out of ten.
