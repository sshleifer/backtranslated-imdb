Wildly uneven film, where the main problem is comedy and thriller blend. For me, the unusual assumption is obviously comical and they should have gone to all kinds of comedy. For example, Rock has some funny features, but sometimes it's too unlikely for comedy. The scene where Betty's wife gets scalped is too disgusting, which should have been less violent comedy. An even better example is the Hollywood left writer who preaches to us early on the character of Freeman after the Indians' situation; I mean - awake! They should have said something funny to Freeman on this segment, but it is, of course, much more difficult than simply writing a boring PC call to him. <br /> <br /> Graduation Form: The girl not only gets a boy - she can't even be a boy; actually the message is that the girl doesn't need a boy at all! Here's a little feminist statement. The first half hour is weak, but the film gets better - ironically - when Zellweger confirms Kinnear. I say "ironically" because I am not a Kinneal fan, although he is sure here. Zellweger is very cute as usual; he is a kind of American look that should appeal to almost every boy, and I have to think about why most of these women are not "present" today instead of dogs who inexplicably became stars like Diaz, Roberts, Aniston, Lopez or Barrymore. <br /> <br /> Since the film sometimes tries to be very serious, I have no choice but to criticize Freeman's character, which is equivalent to a gangster's whore-in-the-gold language. There is nothing in the relationship between Freeman and Rock to suggest that they are a father and a son.
