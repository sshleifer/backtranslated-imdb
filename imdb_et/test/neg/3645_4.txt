I was looking forward to watching this movie and it contains very interesting prospects for the Iraqis all over the country, not just in key areas. <br /> <br /> As the film went on and as it seemed more and more one-sided, I began to think about who made the film. To get hundreds of hours in just 80 minutes, it was obvious that decisions had to be made. <br /> <br /> I would have really enjoyed a movie that showed how everyday Iraqis knew all aspects of the issues, newspaper headlines different from what people said and every movie that had the same opinion at the end thought it was obvious that the editing was done in advance planned prejudices. <br /> <br /> could have been such a big movie.
