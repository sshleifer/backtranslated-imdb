On Humphrey Bogart's first trip to Hollywood, he got his first lead in this B-picture Love Affair. The first thing you should understand is that this film has nothing to do with classic Love Affair later in the decade, when Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne or two subsequent repairs. None of these films are so good. <br /> <br /> In fact, Bogey is the second bill for Dorothy Mackaill, a corrupted heir who finds that he lives in his extravagant lifestyle with his recent father's best friend and financial advisor at Hale Hamilton. It's a shock to Mackaill. He holds the exhibition's business career for income. <br /> <br /> Bogart is a pilot pilot who is also an aviation engineer and designs the ultimate aircraft engine and looks for investors. Mackaill is ready to do this, and she likes what she sees in Bogey. <br /> <br /> Considering the cynical roles that Bogart later did in the specialty, it is a bit amazing to see him as such a very moral and self-righteous person. in Love Affair. This part does not carry him well. <br /> <br /> The love affair is your average second feature of the B program, nothing special.
