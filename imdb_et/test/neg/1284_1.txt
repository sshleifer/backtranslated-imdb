I had to watch this movie with my 5 year old child. She never laughs during the whole movie ... and she loves dogs and laughs almost everything! This movie was terrible in every aspect: a bad script (even a child's G-rated movie), poor production (nervous camera shots made me nauseous in the first ten minutes), bad action (maybe they were "targeted" to act in comic book) and even bad sound quality (there are parts where sound levels seem good, you can't hear what the next actor says). I'm ready to take a lot of time to watch a child's movie, but it was worse than catching my eye. I also didn't like to beat the god-heaven's affirmation against the head. All in all, it was the biggest waste of 90 minutes in my life ... and I've been wasting my time in my days!
