This movie was an absolute trash. Director and Stars (?) Movies should be made forever. A paper-thin chart is about a foolish director who plays a funny movie online to play for women to celebrate. <br /> <br /> There is no horror, girls look and are bored, direction is pointless, music is in the wrong place (heavy metal library scene?) and lighting is terrible. The director would have had a couple more shopping carts filled with aluminum jars and got a script, revered participants and a couple of light bulbs. As it is, this is a nasty, nasty and worthless confusion of the film.
