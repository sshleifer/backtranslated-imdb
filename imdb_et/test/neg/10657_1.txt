... without walking. This film begins with scenes in China with the discovery of a newborn. Although this is not a new concept, I did not give up. Then there is flash in front of adolescence. The husband's husband and biological child are fed up with their father who has ignored them. Although it didn't seem culturally accurate, and the film didn't move to develop these characters or accept the father's purpose of dedication, I pressed. <br /> <br /> Next we are in Malibu, where we are being bombarded with poorly constructed classroom communication and a terribly low budget (fill empty: actor / camera work / lighting). <br /> <br /> I will no longer give up the plot because I think the summary is accurate: the purpose of the movie is to show how a Malibu girl who (although she seems to have an innate compassion and interest to help others when she is asks the teacher for a trip to China), is corrupted and careless, finds himself a healer and a helper in body and mind. <br /> <br /> Lame. LAME, LAME, LAME. Now I'm a tough critic, so maybe I can take one of these LAME and you're on the mark.
