Ho Hum. Just another flick with Steven Seagal who pretends to be a spiritual being, but burning and killing like it was nothing. Of course, he finally justifies donating money to the orphanage. Put the world to waste and we ignore it if you take care of a little girl. Jesus! This time he works with Ice Cool (Anthony 'Treach' Criss). I have to be someone who puts all these brilliant inducing lines, man, and there's a lot. Dialogue is pure nonsense. <br /> <br /> They're going to bad guys for Nick Mancuso and Kevin Tighe, two people who were born to play fools. <br /> <br /> She squeezes Mari Morrow and the impressive soap star Sarah Buxton. How cute is it. <br /> <br /> I think if you have the excitement of July, it will be enough. If anything else, it will help you get a degree in Seagalology's.
