After watching this movie on TV, I watched it up in IMDB and imagine that the user rating is 7.6! It's not a good movie. Editing is especially bad; the fact that the story jumps from one point to another was an amateur and a big mess. It is not very smoothly done. I agree that it was quite decent, especially Kelly Kapowski, and that the story was intriguing enough.
