The only result of John Carpenter's vampires, this film takes place in Thailand and includes a sect of bad vampires who enjoy killing people and sinning a good vampire who doesn't. Although it is an interesting idea to set a vampire movie in Thailand, writers do not seem to have a lot of exotic locality. This movie can be as simple as in Los Angeles. What brings me to the next point is that it looks like a Blade Lite. We have rock music, martial arts battle scenes, dance club bleeding and, of course, many vampire sharp objects. What we don't have is budget and talent. Yes, the hero is a good martial arts fighter, too bad for his action was not so good, and there are many decent wires and tons of revved up combat sequences, perhaps too much. The problem is that they don't have the same effect as any Blade movie. Perhaps it is that the film "has it" seems to be. <br /> <br /> But for me the biggest problem was that the filmmakers didn't take enough time to establish a relationship between the leaders played by buff and bland Colin Egglesfield and his girlfriend. She grabs her boyfriend at the beginning of the flick after a small change. We have no interest in our welfare right now and there is no reason to believe that his boyfriend would be ready to rescue his neck. Now this is the main drawback when it is the main thrust of the plot. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, you could do it in less than 85 minutes of your time, but I can do a lot to do my time, like renting Blade movies.
