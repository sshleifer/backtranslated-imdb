The nest is really just another nature conservation resort that is not able to afford a low budget. The actor is OK, and the device is great, but somehow the whole movie seemed a bit boring to me. Gore effects are not the best I've seen, but are fun cheeses in their own way. Roaches itself is just regular cockroaches that bite people. Nest reminded me of a much better movie called Slugs. If you liked the nest, the slugs are black because it's ten times better. It is also worth noting that Lisa Langlois, who plays Elizabeth, was in another nature conservation film called Deadly Eyes (aka Rats), which is about killer rats, as you have thought. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy this type of horror movie, you might want to watch it, but you would be much better at seeing many interesting and gory.
