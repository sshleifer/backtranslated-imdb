After seeing Blues Brothers DVD and their reputation for "Wired" in Belush Biology, I was my boyfriend and I was hungry for more information about John Belush. I had heard "wired" but didn't know too much about it and found it at the back of the local rent. I understand that Dan Akroid was really over the film and I thought it was because it didn't show them in good light. But that had nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The movie begins well until they ride into John's body. When he wakes up on the dissection table and decides to do so, the full taste of this film begins. John is looking at his life and all the confusion he created with "Angel", the driver of the Puerto Rica cab, who had a bad sense of humor - subjecting him to criticism and trying to overcome him. <Br /> <br /> Two actors who represent John and Dan do not see anything far from the real participants (let alone someone else who is involved in this matter, ie Lorne Michaels), which made it harder for them to concentrate and how they were in real life ... but this is the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> I think it was supposed to be an "artistic" movie - John is constantly torturing drugs (ie, powdered soap in the bathroom as cocaine), so it was also hard to follow. Returns are inconvenient, making it difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> Probably the most delicious scene when John was (literally) forced to go through his kindness and hurts when they consider removing his heart by saying that it was abnormally high due to drug use, obesity, yes, we get a point without grotesque imagery. <br /> <br /> There are very few other players in the movie (where Carrie Fisher, for example, they were incredibly close, and Jim Belushi would have been a great person to show), it seems very cheap (it seemed that the graphics were from the beginning of the 80s or from the late 70s), it seemed to be filmed in about a week and not at all shown to John. I felt I knew him a little more about watching the Saturday night live episodes. <br /> <br /> In the last remark, Bob Woodward is narcissistic, placing himself in the movie, claiming to be a story about writing his life with John. Because someone who was supposed to be very lofty with Nixon's bust, his caliber could fit with any writer in the national community, so he loses his interest in that work on this issue. <br /> <br /> INVITE THIS MOVIE. If you want to see more about John, check out his films, watch Dan Akroyd's clips telling him, or hope someone is tasty to make another movie about John going along "Man on the Moon," which is what we expected. . I think it was a "moral" movie - you know, don't do drugs, but I think the creators of this movie didn't realize that his death made many people (like Carrie Fisher) quit for that reason.
