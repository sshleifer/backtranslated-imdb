Just Caught "Rain People" Turner Classic Movies Late One Night. The film was released in 1969. Shirley Knight stands for Natalie, a housewife of Long Island, who - without knowing the exact reasons - leaves her husband and starts the journey without knowing exactly where she is going. Natalie is also a pregnant woman, which makes things harder. Along the way, he's up to the brain-damaged former football player "Jimmy" (James Caan), who has been kicked out of his college and cycling. There are many turns between the two because Natalie tries to take care of Jimmy and she starts to realize that she is mentally limited and unable to take care of her. He goes through his own struggle, goes without saying, and can't take care of him. From time to time Natalie seems to be a woman at the break of the nervous system; he makes some strange phone calls to his wife asking him to come home. Natalie tries to appeal to Jimmy many times, just to get her to get through her life again. Young Robert Duvall plays a strange and worrying policeman who takes his friends with Natalie. You feel that this movie ends badly and it does. This movie is occasionally uneven and the script is somewhat incomplete. Francis Ford Coppola drove it and, of course, he became immensely famous for his "godfather" in the coming years. The actors are good, it goes without saying, because they all have a future for the film. Shirley Knight is the three least known, although he is also undervalued as an actor. James Caan is particularly effective here, and he seems to just live this character. This film is now more than curious, no doubt, because it is Coppola's early film, and I testify that I have never heard of it. So God blesses Turner's classic movies to bring it to a new audience.
