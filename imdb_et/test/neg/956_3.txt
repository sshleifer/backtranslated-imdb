"D.O.A." is the thriller thriller of leaders Rocky Morton and Annabel, <br /> <br /> Jankel. Operation is okay and the scenario is pretty bad. This film also has a few moments that make you laugh when there are foolish scenes of violence. For example, someone hits a window. Then we'll see the outside of the <br /> <br /> building that looks like this person jumped. I laughed at my head when it happened. This movie is trying hard, but eventually fails. Watch this movie only if you have no other choice. <br /> <br /> My Criterion: ** <br /> <br /> Rating: [R] <br /> Rating Reasons: Violence and language. * <br /> <br /> * There was no rating reason for age.
