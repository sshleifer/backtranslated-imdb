Bid hook or who killed the Australian film industry? Case No. 278. This unfortunate pretext for the drama of the period takes the choice and the idea of ​​potential? Rose Byrne, Pia Miranda, Hugo Weaving, Jazz Time Gangster Drama? and makes it sloppy and filled. McHeath (weaving) is a boxing promoter and gangster and working illiterate; for no apparent reason, he has given the song to the songs of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen before the competition. How to postmodern. How stupid. Anyway. There's a boxer, Art (Matthew Le Nevez), who gets McHeath's newest protection to his detriment aboriginal stablemate Alby (Luke Carroll). <br /> <br /> McHeath's sliding minor Iris (Byrne) keeps an eye on him. Sexual tension slips under the surface. Miranda plays Iris's friend Daisy (these flower trousers stay together) who keeps the scenes unannounced. They dance together and talk to the boy. 1920s. After that I finished reading anachronisms. There's a Japanese beer sub-block and a Broome pearl-fish background. I don't know what it was. For some reason that is not (at all) explained, Byrne puts cocaine Art into lemonade. McHeath thinks he's drunk and he's hitting him. Byrne plots and schemes to help him again. She has a big drawing and a diagram. Most of them cause problems. McHeath's two weapons, portly Ronnie (John Batchelor) and Russian Donnie (Tyler Coppin), discussed McHeath when he understands his role in one of Iris's schemes, but Ronnie seems to see McHeath's cry. Finally, the film ends with a lot of inconsistent scenes. <br /> <br /> Director Jonathan Ogilvie spends a lot of time with operator Geoffrey Simpson, creating some real pictures, but he can't quite make sense of a style that could compensate and decorate a quiet, pathetic power script; Unfortunately, the grammar of Ogilvie's film, the lack of structuring of scenes and the lack of exposition is amazingly incompetent. In the early scene, Daisy suddenly appears with the car's main characters. How he got there and who he really is, Ogilvie seems to have slipped his mind. There are many more examples of this recklessness. When he pursues poetic weakness, he only gets irritation. He performs uncomfortable performances from actors who are usually trustworthy, poorly performing, and relying on Byrne's ability to design some kind of haunted doll-like humanity when he misunderstands him. <br /> <br /> It may not be as important as the story would have more significant signs and more drawing if it hasn't been stolen by ten old dirty movies and stealthily scattered pop culture quotes. But it is not. It's boring.
