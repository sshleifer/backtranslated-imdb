First of all, this is one of the worst soft hearts directly to the "erotic thriller" I've ever seen in my life. Of course, as all erotic thrillers want to do, this is a brothel lady and it is on the brothel. This naturally changes the "context" of the simulated sex of the cushion that appears every 10 minutes. What ever. <br /> <br /> For a moment, forget that it never won prizes. The actors are terrible and their reading made me shame. The woman who plays the female policeman is so bad that it is out of description. He must be a really good friend who put a movie on this terrible adventure when you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are only slightly higher than porn. Other than this? I think if you are really drunk and you need to laugh, this would be the perfect movie. And if that is the case, I suggest sending the woman to the police quickly. What's that accent, Brooklyn? Fun!
