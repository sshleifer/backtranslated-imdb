Robert Montgomery-Myrna Loy's farce by Loyi (Irene) and his groom, played by Reginald Owen, in the labrador when their plane crashed. (This is really what should happen to this very predictable film.) Montgomery lives there when she waits for her fianc√©e. <br /> <br /> Surprise! Montgomery and Loy will soon be attracted to each other. The scene near the bear is so artificial. We knew it was a stormy bear all the time. <br /> <br /> Clara appears with complications. Loy wants to tell Montgomeryle Cale that they should attend when she refuses, she wants to leave right away. <br /> <br /> You don't have to be a rocket scientist to find out how it ends. All this snow is too cold!
