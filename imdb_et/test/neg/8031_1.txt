Maybe I'm just a simple person, but I prefer movies that care about me for these people. I don't care about this movie. It was supposed to be a comedy? Maybe humor was too small for me (up to nano levels). The thing is that it left so many things. There were signs that would have been funny, but they weren't. There were signs you should have, but you didn't. For example, a man who thought Beatles burst his songs. There was so much potential, but everything he did was talking like Beatle and complaining about how they hung him. Haha. And the previous poster spoke of "I'm a Walrus" scene as it was special. What? He played on the old piano "I'm Pink" and sang without tuning. Is there a joke inside? This is a fixed denomination. This film has the feeling that people in the movie say they like it because it sounds "intellectual" or "hip" to say that you like it, that you get the whole metaphysical art / garbage message the artist expresses. If you want to enjoy entertainment, stay away.
