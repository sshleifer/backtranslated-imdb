It was unbearable. (SPOILER # 1) The chief specialists avoid meaningless truths for their loved ones so that they do not give up this status and accept the role of Antagonists. (SPOILER # 2) Writers should believe that exposure to multiple violations by the perpetrator poses a threat and is a response to the main victim of the transgression. (SPOILER # 3) Until the last 15 minutes I had a score of 6-8 out of 10-10; Instead, it was like discovering that Lieutenant Columbo's dog is a REAL murderer. The story was simply unreliable and I don't think the world's best director could have saved it without huge editing.
