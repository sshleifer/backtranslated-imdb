This film proves the theory that I have had for some time now - in Australia, when the film deals with the right topic, it is a success, no matter how terrible it is. Boyus Aussie Park may not be worse - action is more terrible, the plot is basically bad warriors, and filmmakers have no obvious idea of ​​Australian ethnic gangs (Irish gang in the 21st century Sydney! The last time Irish Gangs were in Australia was about a hundred years ago during the migrants !) But because it is related to ethnic rivalry, one of the four topics that is successful in Australian cinema (with fighting families, minority groups) and the famous Australian biography) won several academic awards. I have always suspected that Australian critics will abolish all the garbage dealing with these problems, but some thought, or at least hoped, that they had their own limits. This movie proves otherwise. So for all filmmakers aspiring to Australia, don't worry about thinking about your movie or picking people who can actually act or even get your facts right - just write a script about some poor family trying to come across, or someone coming to Australia and deal with racial prejudice and stereotypes, or, if you want to remove these people from the book, some ethnic gangs who fight with some other ethnic force that is not a truly credible period when the film is set, and your film wins five academy awards, despite pathetic it is!
