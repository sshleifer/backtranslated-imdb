I usually enjoy underground movies and antiheroes, but it's a bad joke. I don't know how it's called a movie. All these people are relaxed and the filmmaker can't make them interesting at all. They are not funny, not tragic, but just stupid and boring. Anyone with a camera can do it better ... <br /> <br /> I give it 1 originality. All the rest is crap.
