I wouldn't call it a good movie, although it might even be bad. <br /> <br /> IF there are at least two good reasons to watch this movie, these are AGNES BRUCKNER's performances (Eden) and JONATHAN JACKSON (Eric), both of whom have strong performances. <br /> <br /> They are much better than the rest of the cast, which is pretty bad, especially MEAGAN GOODE (Cousin Skeeter). <br /> <br /> BIJOU PHILIPS was a great "Suburban kids going to the hood" -am HAVOC, but here it is far from a good edge to be annoying. <br /> <br /> NATURE is decent, though not special, but it would have been much better because it is happening in LOUSIANNA, that some children actually created a southern accent, but they didn't (!). <br /> <br /> Especially in the movie, where the "monster" is actually so deeply delimited by Lousianna's folklore, voodoo, and that is just a stupidity that no accent is added to characters. <br /> <br /> The only w ho this is rapper METHOD MAN, he plays Turner Deputy and puts a pretty accent on his few scenes, and I mean, if a rapper can do that, then "professional" participants should not do the same? Mister Tical, or Meth, is a very small player who knows that Ticallion Stallion would never be a policeman? Even if it's just on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a pretty stupid but quite enjoyable Slasher movie, but if BRUCKNER and JACKSON were as bad as the rest of the youngsters, it would have been really bad, luckily they're good as usual. <br /> <br /> 4.5 out of 10, decent, but there are hundreds of better slaher movies.
