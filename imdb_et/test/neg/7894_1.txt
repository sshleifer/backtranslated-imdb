With such terrible movies, as is not even said, it is very easy to understand why Hollywood has such serious problems with bad plots and worse repairs all the time. <br /> <br /> I think the viewer should be laughing at their backside shifts over the funny black, "pimped up" and "bling". It's so incredible "top" and so bad that it's even passed "so bad it is funny again" sign and has fallen right "completely embarrassing for everyone". <br /> <br /> I'm very, very sorry for every minute I wasted for it. I want my time back! <br /> <br /> Save yourself the trouble, don't look at it. The only reason I can give a rating even one point is that 0 wasn't an option.
