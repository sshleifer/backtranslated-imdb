Ho hum. Rich good looking baby gets in trouble, poor girl falls in love with her, jealous ex-boy causes tension .. yadda yadda. I really smiled this movie in many parts loud, because the next scene was so predictable and just stupid. As one scene moved forward, I often found myself wondering how we got there, as if I had skipped a chapter of the book. <br /> <br /> The script was quite pathetic and I had no or my wife cares much about any characters except the jilted boy. Now that the former boy had got the ax and started the girl and the rich child, then ... then we would have a movie and all the foolish dialogues and jumps in the plot could be acceptable. But because this film tries to touch the boat and completely defeat it (and reaches out to a divine intervention romance attempt to pull the tear), it just falls very flat. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Staple your toenails instead of having more fun.
