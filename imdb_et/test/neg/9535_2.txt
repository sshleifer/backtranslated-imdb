OTHER is the presumed "horror movie" of the 1970s. It must not be confused with the title of "OTHER", which marked Nicole Kidman. "One of these two guys - Niles - should be" good. "The other - the Netherlands - should be bad. <br /> <br /> The idea seems interesting enough as the abstract concept and film were adapted from the novel. I can only hope that the novel it was interesting because the movie was incredibly boring from the beginning to the end. In fact, this movie looks like it was a daily afternoon movie on this TV channel. Easy cutting one or two scenes and it would be such a Disney production of a U-rated movie. Damage than Fear of others. <br /> <br /> You don't have to check the director's CV to realize that horror is not his forte. Mr. Mulligan depends heavily on conducting the story. I have not seen any of his other films, but KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a highly regarded crime film on this site. Unfortunately, the other, the characters are given too little to do and the plodding script ensures that the movie will never really be taken off as expected. /> <br /> The direction is as blissful as you could find. Almost every scene takes place during the day! Think of it - a scene that is open in the open countryside of America in the daytime when the camera focuses on a large area. Is it scary or atmospheric? Believe me, it's not. It's like something else similar to the PRAIRIE LITTLE HOUSE episode as a horror movie. And yes, both the above-mentioned TV series and OTHER were announced in California. <br /> <br /> There is a noticeable danger or maliciousness that makes the whole exercise quite meaningless. <br /> <br /> The end was obviously very disturbing, and maybe influenced the effect of another movie during that time. I don't publish what kind of movie, but I give 2 clues - the young boy was the main character and the film is known. And I add that the concept was used in the last film with much greater impact. <br /> <br /> Actress is really pretty good and that's the only reason I've given 2 stars. The dueling actors, along with the grandmother's playful actor, are trying hard with the poor materials they have given. . Don't be fooled when his big billing is on the list. She gets very little screen time and her presence is kind of calm for her long-term television career to help attract viewers. <br /> <br /> I paid close attention to the back of the DVD cover (version 2 in the UK). Comparisons were made with EXORCIST, which, in my opinion, was a complete insult to this film. There is no comparison. EXORCIST had everything that this film should include, but not - tension, tension, tongue-cheek humor, very disturbing content, great action, excellent characterization, and involvement of the viewer. Ironically, EXORCIST was made just a year later, but in terms of style and execution it seems decades before a different drama. OTHERS will come to fruition in the 1950s, not to mention the 1970s! MASSACRE, HELL HOUSE LEGEND, SALEM LOT only name a few productions. For this reason, others will prove even more disappointing. <br /> <br /> If someone finds the summary of OTHERS interesting, they could read the book or do a little more research on what the book was. I want to skip the movie for everyone.
