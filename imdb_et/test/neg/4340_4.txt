"Suddenly death" the only thing that goes beyond the non-stop action is the incredible number of plot holes. With this and the contractions alone, one can hardly name what is left. To say that the scenario is borrowed from the "Die Hard" assumption, would be the most brutal underestimation in the world! <br /> <br /> Here we have a worrying hero who works in a huge Pittsburgh indoor ice house as a fire at Marshall. At the final of the 7th final of the finals, he gets tickets so he can treat his strangers' decisive game and, of course, spend a little time with them. Also catching the competition, but for political reasons, is the United States Vice President (Raymond J. Barry). When a host of incredibly well-organized mercenaries grab a VP box and require hundreds of millions of government money, our hero Darren McCord has more than a bit of plans. <br /> <br /> Every time these new formulas are made, it seems that everything we do for innovation is nastier bad guys and more and more outstanding and terrible ways how good guys are destroying them. Director Hyams and his screenwriter have gone over (not because it is an original sin) in an attempt to make us bad terrorists. Terrible bad guys come from secret service, homosexual abandonment of security and civilians (both old and young), and with little attention to the relative threat of each victim. <br /> <br /> Van Damme has many spider-cuffs and weapons, heroic and deadly tricks. The script asks little about Europeans. Almost everybody has walking opportunities in addition to Powers Boothe, who once played a signed, low role as a serious, hardest older ring leader. <br /> <br /> There are lots of smart cinematographs and enough explosive f / x to keep someone awake. But really, it is all that activity that is busy. Although there are some nice sequences, nothing can be called terribly brilliant. <br /> <br /> Saturday, February 10, 1996 - Larger Alliance in Melbourne
