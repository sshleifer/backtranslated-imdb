I can't believe this film has 6 stars in IMDbis. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, not the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode. The plot is predictable. I couldn't take care of any character. The dialogue is cheesy. The musical pictures in the movie made me feel loud (including the crazy neighbor of Kiefer Southerland and the incredibly flat joke that ends the movie). Jeff Bridges's accent is funny - I can't tell which country he should be. This must be one of the most exciting thrillers I've ever seen ... after the character of Sandra Bullock disappears, there is nothing going good for 45 minutes. I would give this film a negative number if I could.
