This two-and-a-half-hour film was recently shown at the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) at 10.00. After that, it was scheduled at 1:00, but I was wondering if anyone would wake up to see until 3:30. Open scene is a challenging man that lasts four minutes of movie time. This is a threatening sign of what comes: good 144 minutes more the same. There is a man standing in the sun and a woman against the wall. This is repeated 15 times with very little dialogue. Sometimes these very long slow sequences interrupt shocking photos, such as female genital closure, which is shown during one full-length film time (the audience laughs in the last 20 seconds, saying, "What's the message?"). The story is reminiscent of Dostoevsky's novel "The Brothers of Karamazov", where the cretan falls in love with a woman of mild morality. In a rare situation where the crowd laughed (more desperate to try to justify that there were already two hours for nothing to happen), it was when a British tourist statement that he did not see things clearly after the Eurostar train drove 180 miles per hour, The translator translated the automatic automatic exchange of units from the English system into a metric system that "they do not see things clearly because the train ran 300 kilometers per hour". This film was amazing that the quality of cinematography shows that a lot of money has been spent on it. It wasn't a movie kitchen 8mm test. It was carefully planned, structured, worked, and edited. But I got so little about it. Some of the comments accused of the embarrassing detail, just like the Dandling Keychain protocols with the door open. Okay, it was observed, but what was it? In the first hour, the stationary people went back. The rest remained out of curiosity: there must be something at the end. Never was. And maybe it's a movie. All movies in the theater are packed. It wants to be different. Nothing happens.
