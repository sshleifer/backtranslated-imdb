too bad this movie is not. Although the "Nemesis Game" is somewhat fun, I found it hard to stop my belief in the length of the film, especially the situations Sara himself put. Should we believe that: <br /> <br /> 1) This hot chick goes to abandoned abandoned buildings and dark metro tunnels around the middle of the night to solve some puzzles? <br /> 2) The main characters are said to be experts that they play fun puzzles, but don't put all the "I ever sin" riddled to the end ... and then ... and then ... get it. .. he must make the whole mirror to put the pieces together? I know it was a filmmaker device to show the audience what's going on, but do they really think we're stupid? <br /> <br /> 3) When Vern and Sara go to Chez M to question the blonde, the whole building doesn't have one topless chick. Nada. C'mon. I know this is Canada, but I look forward to more Shannon Tweed. <br /> <br /> And someone else notices that when Vern surfing the web found this riddlezone site, when he remembered the link cursor fell under the arrow and did not turn into a small hand (RECOMMEND ALL COURSES IF THE CUSTOMERS ARE HYPERLINKILE click)?!? I want to say that if you play such an important role in your movie on the internet, get at least little things right. Geez.
