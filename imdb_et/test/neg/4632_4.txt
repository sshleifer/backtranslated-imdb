The history and experience of the last couple of decades have shown that intellectuals who talk about sex are the most uncomfortable and intellectual thing anyone can do, but it wasn't quite as obvious in 1986. The characters who are dissatisfied to find comfort, security and joy of sexual acts are in fact an unhealthy motive that makes them so intolerable - what they hide from more sex. This ride is linked to the "American Empire Fall", which is reflected in the film's early interview. <br /> <br /> So the idea that relatively reluctant people are talking about sex and that this speech should be exposed is how frustrating people are. Arcand gives at least this ride and momentum by doing interesting things with the camera, for example, separating most of the characters from a single frame, exposing their ultimate loneliness and cutting them quickly, showing how they fight each other more when they agree. To give Arcand credit it is a lot of intellectual life, a constant struggle with other intellectuals to stand out, even if everyone knows that calling is stand alone. <br /> <br /> But yes, characters and deeds are unsexy and pathetic. I think this movie is a lot more of its time than it should be, which is why it is dated. It is also the exact type of mental buffering in the dialogue and references to people, such as Susan Sontag, which makes art house films so popular around populist entertainment members. All in all, I will still take it - it is among the people who focus on their place - it is just that it is not really interesting or important for anyone who is not. - PolarisDiB
