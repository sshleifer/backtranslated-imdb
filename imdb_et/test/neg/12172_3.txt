Terrible. I hope I can save two hours of my life by warning you of it. I just finished BTW. <br /> <br /> I love good genre movies. It's not one of them. Show me sci-fi music, dramatic farce or religious activities, look at all of them. But you can't just throw epigrammatic smiles at the rambling, camp, shock-horror festival and pull my applause. <br /> <br /> I love philosophical movies. It's not one of them. Everyone who has been amazed at the depth of this film has not recently read a good book. Or ever. At best, a "thought-provoking" dialogue is very small. Maybe it lost something in translation. <br /> <br /> I love good horror comedy. It's not one of them. Laugh! I thought I would never start! Confirm? Only when we try to think of a polite way of recommending our feedback on the film, did Rupert recommend this film with uncertainty, but even he can't raise it. I wish he would have shot the director when the zombies were. Dante spun in his grave.
