It is a thing absorbed by itself, between two unlikely people who are married to another person. It is high on my list of the most boring films and I'm very romantic. My husband decided after the first hour of three hours when the time had rarely appeared. Desert is an outstanding, endless sand and the sun of Katharine's golden hair. But cinematography is not a brilliant film unless it is a National Geographic travel plan. An excellent Sahara landscape in this poorly prepared stage is like setting a perfume on a pig. <br /> <br /> The film is turned into a badly burned, dying pilot named Count Laszlo de Almasy, who has remained under the care of Canada. Military nurse, Hana, during World War II in Italy. He seems to remember a little about his life, but through his book, his story appears very slowly, his wife named Caravaggio, who appears mysteriously on his deathbed. Almasy was a Hungarian cartographer who worked in the Royal Geographic Society to map the Sahara Desert. He entered into relations with his wife Katherine, a researcher who turned out to be a British spy. At the same time, Laszlo's wicked person is doing his things with a Sikh called Kipik, who is involved in disarming mines. <br /> <br /> There are many quarrels about this movie, the length and length of the races. I don't blame you for acting, it's not just a good story. Caravaggio seems unnecessary, his relationship with the Almasy sketch. He offers a scene of torture, but the film does not seem to have any important purpose. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the two sides of this thing, Almasy and Katharine, are strangely insecure, low and dull. They are just not very nice, so no one is happy. Almasy is a cool, remote, naughty, and ultimately desperate husband's wife. Katharine is also isolated and disgusting, not to mention the lack of mercy or lack of mercy for her imperfect but loving husband ... after managing one tiny tear in his eye corner when he dies. <br /> <br /> This is LUST's story about love, as well as pearls like "I can taste you". Almasy sings his colleague's ridiculous erotic obsession with his beloved neck cavity, which definitely shows Katharine's focus on his body. The victim of this invulnerable adultery is the unhappy husband Geoffrey, who is treated little more than unpleasant discomfort. Katharine's sense of weakness is that these lovers can afford their much hostile rampant passion, all like a quiet night sung in the background. I am not sure whether the intention was to contrast the purity of the carol with their selfish lusts, but it was certainly not impressive to the disappointed undertone. We have a complete frontal nudity with Katharine, but their sex scenes come as cold, selfish, shimmering, and sometimes even hateful ... not warm, loving, giving or even really passionate. If one of these two feels the emotion to the other, it is completely selfish and will definitely NOT love it as I define it. <br /> <br /> Almasy's return to the swimmer's cave to restore his body to his beloved goes rather than moving. Katharine must be outdated for a while, because it shows a very good color and hardly seems to see it hard, not at all. Of course, this is all for a dramatic effect, because this story is seen by the Romans (usually one of them) does not understand the decaying, dirty body. To get the body of his adorable lover, he has betrayed his companions and allies by giving his cards to the Nazis, with English-speaking pieces of villains. Whether he keeps his final promise to Katharine, his terrible act is not something I admire. <br /> <br /> Kip seems to be a pleasant companion and Hana is generally pleasant, but their romance is not the least interesting, but a short wartime that bounces on the parties that refer to little to divorce. Moving back and forth between the two provisions (the Sahara Desert and the current Italy) proved to be bothersome and unpleasant, but indeed the two stories were weak as the water of demand. The only spark of the whole picture was Kip's tense mine scene. <br /> <br /> I wasn't totally heartless, I had some sympathy for the current Almasy seriously burned and dead state. However, perhaps my biggest complaint against this film is at the end of euthanasia when Hana obliges her patient to overdose morphine. We should feel that it is justifiable and morally acceptable, because it probably has affection for Almasy, cries out when he makes a deadly syringe, and reads aloud from his supposedly passionate Herodotus book that he is dying. The amazing masterpieces of David Leah should not offend this pathetic, immoral story. Yes, Arab Lawrence also has a desert, but in Lean films (Doctor Zhivago, a brief clash) there are things that deal with things, sympathetic characters with admirable containment, guilt, and some perception of a betrayed spouse, not all self-immolation for this pair. Ryan's Daughter shows the cuckold man's loyalty and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> This movie is said to be an intellectual, tremendously overwhelmed dull and nasty trim that unfortunately goes out as a great love story. His best picture of Oscar does not speak well for the Academy. For those who don't know why people are so hard on this film, the answer is simple. It's terrible.
