After seeing this movie I felt sick in my stomach and if I had seen one more minute, I should have rushed to the bathroom and vomit. A sick movie that wasn't funny and wasn't worth the money, no money at all. If anyone wants to see this movie, don't do it! Your children will never give you forgiveness and require sickness a week. So if you appreciate your child's education and want to stimulate your child's mind, you won't see this movie. I ask you, DON'T!
