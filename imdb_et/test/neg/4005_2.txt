I think this movie really had a bad production value. Lack of action makes me think that they should mention it as an early docute. Maybe there was no money to do that. I feel badly that it was a kidnapping of Jackie Robinson's big league. I believe he was much better than many of his day's white players. He had to be really big to break the barrier of time. No, that would be a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> I would like more information about its creators. They could be limited by the quality of the participants who were ready to implement the project. Maybe there is no money for good people.
