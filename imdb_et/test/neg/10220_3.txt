The debut feature of GW has almost failed and not because it's not trying ... In fact, it's. It's darker because it's a writer / director / technical eternal Nick Gaglia underwent the same rehabilitation that he's in the film. Sometimes for the first time a filmmaker who is full of vitality, accompanied by film students with thumbnails or two, moves to a style that is too unequal, insecure, and dramatically depressing, so that the personal side of the story, to the very personal side, gets a good story. Gaglia, who was 13 years old when she put in a scary program, which mainly tormented and temporarily beat her "patients" with crazy intimidation tactics, psychological entertainment *** that could last for days, and attitudes from detective leaders who would do most of the Nazi attacks, finally escaped when he was 15. I'm happy he went out, though it can help if he now goes to a real detoxification for his filmmaking skills, only a few days to learn things like say, structure, right lighting, fluid camera movement, attendees with actors, and other basics that will be lost here. <br /> <br /> This is even more depressing because Gaglia is dealing with a topic that should be more publicly shown (a recent article by Newsweek, which refers to a similar AA culture rehab). Sometimes it is wondering if certain personality studies can work better than documentaries as narrative dramas. It is a constantly nervous feeling over GW, where it almost seems that Gaglia wants to tell the truth, but does not know how to properly transmit it through its characters. A person who thinks it is the closest to him, Bronx teenager Tony Serra (Gallagher), whose mother takes detoxification in New York, would be closest to Gaglia, in fact it is a more one-dimensional nature with very little company (we see short a freak-out, a black-white, an old home) and a little connection to his mother (Moriarty) who has more potential that has never been left out of the cold stone. goes to his kids to another. I think there is a story of a two-year crisis. in the case of medical care, it is the cross between anger control and some bizarre religious sect, where the chief physician Hiller (Insinnia) is in general control. But soon, Tony's sister Sofia (Donohue) ran into the program, and, contrary to Tony's repeated annoyance and alleged non-compliance, she headed through a three-step program and when she's released she can escape. Sometimes a broken nightmare with one woman, a 22-year-old mother who has been in the program for a year and a half, thinks she has become a prisoner who is not allowed to leave, and when the father of the main siblings comes and pays a visit to Hiller , when Sofia finally returns to them, with some raw power, very briefly, that Gaglia can at least gain some gain in pure melodrama. <br /> <br /> But these are moments little and far. This is not just the bad characters that are mostly reduced stereotypes that are like hysterical D.A.R.E. rip-off (maybe some of them, like angry black young, passive-aggressive advisers, or even Serra's older sister, whom the siblings rattled when they shot together and almost threw the program, would resonate more than some time to develop more time). The fact is that Gaglia, in his many roles in his small $ 30,000 budget, is so unclear that no potential potential talent can get through. He uses over colors, mostly with shades that look like urine-covered), he moves his handheld DVX camera as it should be an intense area of ​​the city of God, sometimes capturing the mark just in the frame, his choices of music are similar to pseudo-indie soft rockers possible the worst choices and Naneel Serra (inspiration?) and Krakowsky, who feel as liar as possible, are even a fake interview. <br /> <br /> Can Gaglia simply not get any interviews with the actual victims he was with, and turn to a possible artistic cathartic plan B? The bottom line, no matter how many heart-like real biographies you may like, don't worry about it in the theater or even renting it if you love the last scene where two kids looked at the digital huddle of the Hudson River in the last words: Dedicated to children. Oy.
