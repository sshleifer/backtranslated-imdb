When you watch a documentary, you notice that the director is totally inexperienced and was actually in the Quentin Tarantinos video store. Put two and two together and you will realize that Quentin is doing his old buddy, despite the fact that the bud is quite talented. Was it tough? Well, look at this movie and you'll understand it's not. Too slow at the beginning, too meaningless in the middle and too slow to finish. This means that. Eric Stolz & Delpy were the only two charisma. And Kemp actually made OK. But the rest was really bad. One example of the plot's stupidity was when the "lead wire" accidentally left behind its mask mode. What happens? Well, the other robbers decide they can also remove their own people! With great thinking. Violence was relentless and crazy. But not in the "cool" way. Rather far. I was wondering if it was meant for comedy. More stupid Tarantino, who had a good name for this garbage. More to deceive me to see it.
