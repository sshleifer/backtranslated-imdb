I like Christophe Lambert as an actor. He has played in several good films (Highlander, Subway, Greystoke, ...). But I can't even think he's played in this movie. The story is almost nothing, the special effects are very bad and the actors. To continue the movie, I only have one thing to say: this is the first time I watch the movie and I want to leave in 10 minutes.
