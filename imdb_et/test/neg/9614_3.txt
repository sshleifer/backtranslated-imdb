Not even "less", but just a bad movie. Cinema equivalent of dirty old people. Ugly in every sense: unimaginable script, static sight, dirty clothing, strange hair, unlikely actors, and one truly unjustified rape and strangulation scene. There is a perverted sense of humor of the director, but it is not applied consistently; the film only lives in its cruelty. Women are particularly bad; "Frenzy" can be used as proof that the director was misognist, although a better explanation for me is that maybe it starts with his TV series and "Psycho", which he himself described as a training to see if the television team could capture a satisfactory function - Alfred Hitchcock had a lot of abandoned art and trade. "Frenzy" seems to be a great captain bow to the convention, trying to go with time and give the audience what he thinks they want - in the form of unpleasant nudity, nudge-nudge eyes and general nastiness. I will not abandon the old man for his rest, but I don't want to remember him tired and lazy and bombing - time to look again at Vertigo!
