The time to kill is based on John Grisham's first novel, which he wrote before he was famous, and that which did not proclaim him famous. (This is achieved by the company). That's why this movie didn't get much later, after Grisham was fresh out of the movie dollar without taking out the useless books. Unlike most of them, this book was actually something. It had meat, it was weight and had a heart. Namely "A Time to Kill" puts you up. <br /> <br /> Here we are a black man (Jackson) in a trial for murdering two white men who raped and tortured their 10-year-old daughter. We have an underdog lawyer (McConaughey) who is struggling with a great bad system to save his client. And by the way, the whole thing is set in the background of Mississippi racism, with hoods in the FAQs of men's burns. In other words, we should give compassion to Carl Lee Hailey. We should believe that a father who loves his daughter is entitled to kill those men who raped her. We should know the injustice of the system, where a racist white white jury could judge a black man who was simply trying brutally to get a crime. We should feel that we are standing side by side with people who sing "free Carl Lee." <br /> <br /> But the issue of racism is the smokescreen and the whole thing is well-established. Carl Lee Hailey was a vigilant. Yes, what he did was alleviating, but in fact he is not innocent. It would have been true, irrespective of his skin color or the skin color of his daughter, judge, jury or other attackers. <br /> <br /> And what is so hard about this movie is that it paints anyone who believes that Carl Lee would be convicted of being racist. The message seems to be that if you think the law should not be taken by the people, you might also want to burn the crosses on the lawn where you carry the hood. <br /> <br /> This is not the first time a heavy dose of sentimentality has been added to such tales and this is not the last. During the movie, killing Tapa remains quite loyal to the book and the actor is not half-bad. But it played the hand he had been doing. Even good casting cannot raise bad source material.
