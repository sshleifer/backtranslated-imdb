I don't remember a trivial, moody and low film, in other words, a real chick flick that is the worst. How can anyone watch this movie and recommend it to others? Only if they didn't like them, they made a mistake. All in all, it seems that the worst women's aspirations are. The actual content is not all happy and low. Yes, I ask the masses. Well, not a member of the masses. What is a trivial load. I wanted to leave the cinema within 5 minutes after the start. And I think I'll pay 7 pounds for that! I think it is worshiping the cinema like most of the media these days. So I like a bit of reality in my music that calls me or what?
