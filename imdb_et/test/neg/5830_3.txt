The final draft - a scriptwriter (James Van Der Beek) locks himself in his apartment and gives up his psychosis, trying to write a horror script. Not a terrible assumption, but execution is terrible. It seems like the direction and writing of the first year and probably too. The director jumps from hell to everything. It is meant for disorientation. What it is is annoying. So much that small bundles are inconsistent. Writing is predictable and does not use most of the ideas suggested (orange bags). It's like they run out of time and beat it at the Toronto Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a jaw-dropping "oh my god is so bad that it's good" bad. It is boring bad and will irritate you for a long time. James Van Der Beek is not a terrible actor and barely holds the ship above water. But it is too common for this psychosis to be offered in the film. He is just a retreated man who one day sees people and hallucates things, then decides to act easily. The reason is that. Maybe there's something in the water. Now, Darryn Lucio, who plays his "friend", is a terrible actor. He shares Chris O'Donald's similarity and is even more disturbing, supernatural. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the movie is good (dull gray and yellow), but because this is the only thing the film does, it doesn't mean anything. This film wants to be a Jacob ladder or mechanic. It's not even a secret window. This is a preppy girl in the class who decides to change Goth. <br /> <br /> Not annoyingly awful, but its emptiness fools you. I've been thinking more about this criticism when the filmmakers did it. <br /> <br /> D
