Well, the title of the summary should tell you everything. FRED I AM RAY - a modern low-priced king, whether it is on a television or directly on video (I doubt it will produce a silver screen anymore;> <br /> The creator of such a culture (?) As the Hookers and Dinosaur Island ... <br /> <br /> Well, I like this guy. He's mostly entertaining (clearly cheesy, campy and especially inexpensive way) and if he's one thing, he's a pro - something you can't say to everyone in the movie <br /> <br /> But this is one of the most glowing of your ove. Insipid's action, endless scenario and flat jokes make your brains numb in a few minutes. If you're sure of FOR goodness (or rather bad), check out the above and generally his stuff from the 70s and 80s (I think he has lost a little bit recently).
