Roger Corman has enjoyed his cinematic share of his outstanding low-budget career, reaching over 300 films. Although few (if any) call him great, the hidden connections of his films with underground culture (by reference, respect or influence) have provided him with a complex legacy. Throughout his career, he has also developed a bad habit of restoring his films ("Piranha", "Humanoids of Deep", "Black Scorpion", etc.) without improving them. "Raptor", "Jay Andrews" and "Staged" (Jim Wynorski, a man who is one of my favorite kinematic joy, "Chopping Mall") takes this practice from the mid-90s into a worrying low. "Carnosaur" trilogy. Wynorsk's credit is in quotes because "Raptor" is not a tribute to "Carnosaur" movies, not even a remake. "Raptor" is a "Carnosaur" movie, or at least the film's dinosaur death scenes, randomly assembled with the original plot and some new scene traces (many of which are composed of "Dino's Eye View"). lame an attempt to make the scenes you entered less visible). "New" material was written around video footage, on the contrary, and it is totally unobtrusive, which has big logic gaps (eg two separate teams are sent by the military just to be recorded in Parts 2 and 3 where soldiers had different uniforms that could to be involved), which is amazing given the little logic played by a "Carnosaur" movie. The actors' lack of sense in their character (though fairly, the dimension of any character is presented only in the script once, maybe twice) highlights the terribly wood-making of b-films of the 1950s, and it certainly does nothing between the scenes of attack that is worth looking at . What is even more embarrassing for the participants in the new scenes is that the physical structure is clearly different between the new actor and the actor of the original scene. If the only scene that produces a film response is the oldest trick in the horror book, "Spring loaded animal", something seriously wrong. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, this despicable practice is two b-class numbers (who don't have to worry about destroying their reputation because they haven't) rip off their material, the cheapest and fastest dirty tricks just because they can they (why else should somebody feel that he has a hanging series designed to hang the "Jurassic Park" series?). I can't say much more than that, this film carries my highest recommendations; the only good thing (after watching Melissa Braselle's navel) is that now I don't have to see any Carnosaur movies.
