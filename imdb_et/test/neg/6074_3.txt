This movie is proof that a good actor is not in the right direction. Ed Harris is terrible. How could you play an actor like Rambo to play "Maestro"? He does not show any credibility at all, and Beethoven overlaps. Long hairs don't look good at all. The main actor lacks all the nuances needed for this character. Camera shots are cheesy and too ordinary. Lights must close characters. Poor pouring and cheap direction. Damage! The only scene that is worth the movie is if Beeth (I hope you don't care about calling me through his nickname?) Makes a girl's song joke. Anyway, I hope Harris can find his way back to a real movie where he really shows his hairy talent.
