I'm shocked by all the good reviews on this film cover and IMDb. It belongs to your local video store's $ 2 bin. To say it's a B movie, it's extremely generous. <br /> <br /> In addition to the lack of one-off redeemable features, just a bit better than average, and the ugly 80-style picture quality, this movie script is boring and inanimate. This movie is not just boring - it's pathetic. (Undoubtedly, sometimes the two main characters are somewhat interesting chemistry.) Even the final plot twist - rather the only plot - will not save this movie. <br /> <br /> Rent "Diamond Men" if you need to, but don't be afraid to turn it off if you are worth it. 2 out of 10.
