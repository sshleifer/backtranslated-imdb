Salesman Lenny Brown (Woods) is losing his ability to sell ice cream to ice cream for the Eskimos. Brown and his wife Linda (Young) live in California to shine by living in a high-housing shelter; the luck they lose when the federal government changes tax laws. <br /> <br /> Seven hundred thousand dollars in red and need a "push", the unabashed sneakers will raise a huge number of Colombian marches to powder their horses until they are quite hungry on monkeys. After a short cleaning, Linda's coke-induced miscarriage will see Lenny once again in her quarry like pinball between the top and bottom. Lives purgatory followed. <br /> <br /> Modern take Reefer Madness, whose perverted echo is Albert Brooks' lost in America, The Boost overshadowed the release of tabloid revelations concerning alleged forest and youth affairs, and their angry fall. Woods, a horse trainer with Sarah Owen (now her former husband), blamed her filmed filmmaker for a $ 2 million lawsuit during her filming, citing Fatal's Attraction-style late night phone calls to her fiance and a remarkable incident leaving her and Owen's left baby sleep. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the absence of chemistry among supposedly loving leaders is one of the most frustrating aspects of this last day of exploitation flick - the only real passion Woods shows to Joungi when he strikes him around the room. The script is also a terrible terrible, maybe alleviating Young's upcoming performance if it is said to "stand up with me - I'm behind the ground". Further, when Woods's nervous dramatic person has lost, his nervous descent loses credibility when he actually saw it begin. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Boost must be seen in context: 21st century cocaine use is everywhere. But in 1988, when America still had an unpleasant "war on drugs", the people seemed to be in a very dangerous situation - one of the most hurtful and hysterical images of drug abuse.
