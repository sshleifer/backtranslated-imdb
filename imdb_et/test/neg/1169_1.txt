I have a holiday home near plainfield, WI. Ten minutes of Gein's property is accurate. I have seen my land, the cemetery where he is buried and where he made his excavation, and I have bought a hardware store that was previously owned by the Worden family. While visiting California relatives, we decided to rent this movie. It was disgusting. The real story of Ed Gein is so annoying and creepy why the creators of this trash bin decided to build their story. The actor who plays Ed is a very big man, Ed was a very small, bright and shy man. It's part of what makes her story so scary. He had no assistant to build the graves, and anyone with the land knows that there is mostly sand containing little dirt. You won't break a large part of the sweat digging. They did not have to hire an actor from the wrestler's body, but do their research. And if the writing wasn't bad enough - there are no mountains in Wisconsin and I'm pretty sure 911 wasn't available in 1957.
