I liked Mr. Magoo's cartoons that I saw during the growth. And I enjoy Leslie Nielson's comic skills. So, I thought this marriage should bring a funny child. <br /> <br /> I couldn't be wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie was just terrible. I don't remember any funny moments. That's one of two or three times (hundreds of movies over the years), I wanted my money back. You leave this movie abandoned because you can't use that time better. In comedy, the plot must be drawn by an observer and be a framework for gags. This plot doesn't. It's just sure it's like a shore-side fish.
