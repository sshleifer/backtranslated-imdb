Lucille Ball's "Mame" version is, in my opinion, one of the worst performances ever recorded for the film. After seeing Lucy from her different sitcoms more than an astronomical procedure, I can tell you that I really love Lucy, but this film is a fiasco of incredibly bad casting, music and dance. Robert Preston is the only sustainable arm that is small enough to be blurred. I don't know what he thought, and I can't imagine how the studio or director advised him, but I saw this embarrassing activity. I could be really cruel and suggest to laugh at it, but it's too bad even to get it. Don't waste your money or time.
