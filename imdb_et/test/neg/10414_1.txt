For this film, I was pulled by my successful, low-key real story. That means twenty things tend to be in Big Apple and come home to live with their parents and even more with a floppy brother. It could have just worked, but there is a problem. And the problem is called Casey Affleck. <br /> <br /> Casey Affleck is almost catatonic in this movie. His acting mantra must always be as tense as possible. Or "why talk when you can?" Or maybe "put yourself in a coma as soon as the camera rolls". Lips Are Moving Talking? Barely. Facial Expressions? Missing. Do the muscles face? Atrophied. Something? Something. ALL? Zip.
