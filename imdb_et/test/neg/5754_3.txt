Hercules ended up with many promising TV shows in the same category, which could have been a really great classic but a sad joke. <br /> <br /> I really like Kevin Sorbon and his support, but I did not take care of the direction that the show took after the film equivalents. I believe that the show would have been much more successful if they had kept the same form they did for the movies. <br /> <br /> I looked at the beginning and lost interest. Later I met it with an odd episode, but my attention to it was happy to make it a commercial break.
