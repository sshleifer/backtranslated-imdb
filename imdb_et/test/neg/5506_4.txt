I can't think it's Franco's "sick" of the "Marquis de Sade" for one thousand Sodom days. People (in this case women) were kidnapped to serve as a slave to a privileged elite? Check it out. Kinky sex? Check it out. Torture, including whipping? Check it out. Accidentally selected victims are killed? Check. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the goodness Franco did not go all over the scene and introduced the cinema audience to the joy of coprology (and indeed copropagyi), another perversion that repeatedly stays in de Sade's annoying long and nasty saga. <br /> <br /> I hope that this movie will fall into the "so bad" category. But even the number of naked meat acres and numerous sexual encounters did not compensate for the unpleasant dialogue, terrible action, hard-to-understand plot and - just put a tin hat - dubbing AND English headlines (belt and braces) in women's costumes). However, Alsation gave a very professional result. <br /> <br /> Of course, I can make a mistake with de Sade. After all, I was unable to understand that the actor who played the "prison" main organizer was trans-sexual. In the future, I need to pay more attention to the size of people's hands. <br /> <br /> According to another reviewer, the movie was banned in the UK. Well, this is obviously no more, though I think the nip-needle-stitching scene was cut to satisfy the censors. On the DVD, it was clearly visible on the Spanish trailer (which I watched to compare it with English). <br /> <br /> The DVD also has an interview with Jess Franco, although you need a better understanding of Spanish than mine. Unless I'm wrong, it's not duplicated or subtitled. And he points out that the character of Franco is Ajita Wilson, which is hidden by mustache. It is ironic, given that he was surgically removed with the necessary additive.
