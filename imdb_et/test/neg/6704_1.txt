First of all, I am a gay man, although I do not live my life in the so-called "community", and thanks to such films, gay thematic movies are not my favorite musician because 90% of them are crap. Like this one. f I can give it to zero. (I do not understand all the positive comments, except if they were made by all those who made the film) I stopped it with a 24-minute mark when the so-called "Anthony" straight kissed Adam outside the restaurant for whatever reason. And how does the son steal the canteen if he doesn't even live in the city? Wire Transmissions? Actor HORRENDOUS! Audio editing? (Listen to "Anthony" and Adam when they sit at lunch while sitting in the garden. Every time the camera changed between two so-called actors, the sound changes as the microphone did not have a filter). God forbid, buy this movie.Horrible terrible terrible acts and just stupid storyline.
