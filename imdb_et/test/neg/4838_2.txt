I don't understand why anyone could waste their time or money on a trash like this ... Don't do it wrong - I love good west - I said "GOOD" - it's just a trash <br /> <br /> Actress is terrible - Val Kilmer must know someone or owe a favor or something just to use his face and name in this ridiculous mess ... <br /> <br /> For those of you who enjoyed this movie, I'll make a list of your names to make sure I don't look at what you recommend - our tastes are definitely different, but it's your right to express your opinion no matter how far it is. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 2 just when they throw out everything and don't read them .... Just bad in all areas ...
