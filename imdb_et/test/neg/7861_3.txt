In the 1990s, several attempts have been made to revive the old Matsumoto series. Yoshinobu Nishizaki tried to revive the old Yamato saga in a ridiculously bad form of "Yamato 2520", which was left entirely after two episodes. Captain Harlock was confusing and pointless "Harlock Saga", while Galaxy Express 999 wore that name hacking. <br /> <br /> Once you've seen "Queen Millennia", you remember that it was a wonderful movie in your own way. Maetel Legend tries to follow this already completed chapter, and find a way to do it. <br /> <br /> This film takes all the tedious aspects of the general film of cellulosic science literature, being badly disturbed by the melodrama pace and insult to injury, breaking in some of the most famous characters of the Matsumoto universe. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming aspect of this movie is a good work of art, but the rest is so amazing that it doesn't save it from total loss of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you've enjoyed Queen Millennia or Galaxy Express, do yourself a favor and leave it hacked on film. You thank me.
