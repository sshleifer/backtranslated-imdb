Some Spoilers **** Soap has some great moments to recommend. When Charlotte and Veronica go close, this is a beautiful, low key, truly erotic scene. I also loved music scores and soft, silent cinematography. It is not clear whether the curious stopping and original structure of the film is due to its initial digestion (serial researcher is quite annoying). My biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd portrayal of transwomen and his life. Of course, she has to be shown as a sex worker (yet), scattered, impractical, absurdly frilly / girly, completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and can't make interpersonal attachments in the world. What's more, he has always shown the growth of beard within two days (for a somewhat odd reason) than to emphasize how his life has dried. And he is waiting for a gender redistribution operation if he appears to have done nothing to convey his transition. In fact, this character resembles a drowning queen, not one in the middle of the transition. <br /> <br /> These are typical fantasies of people from outside who are not really human. The fetishisation of the GRS operation is a way to objectively refute people who go through the transition. At least this movie hasn't impressed. At least, why not what someone who really is transsexual plays ... I thought the male actress depicting Veronic was fine, but not better. Much better was the woman who depicted Charlotte as a very complex character full of energy, self-worth, desire and contradiction. If she was thrilled by so many women, Charlotte could go and find her bar within two seconds. Yes, he was pulled into Veronica, but rather as an abstract idea that someone has the characteristics of men / women (gentle touch, but with a good punch), not as a unique person. Yes, what A soap says about love is often cute and touching, but that does not mean that the stereotypical minority must be more stereotyped in the process. <br /> <br /> This movie also proves that the Danes are bad dancers. With such a promising assumption (which can be better done in a movie such as "Different Girls"), the latter is the last postponement of the film.
