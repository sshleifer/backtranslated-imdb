4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> This movie was not as funny as it was, it wouldn't even be a character that invested in emotion. Eugene Levy is probably the most funny .... The rest of the majority is doing their job, but the story doesn't really go deep and there are many holes that never get full. It wasn't really fun, even though it was sometimes funny. <br /> <br />
