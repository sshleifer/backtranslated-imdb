This absurd film was "Goodie-two-shoe", a teenage girl who really wanted to be Valedictorian, but finds her obstacle on behalf of the teacher Mrs. Tingle. Katie Holmes, who plays this "good rubber", faces "the greatest dilemma of her teenage life" as her classmate boyfriend with the final exam, which should help them test the test of Mrs Tingle. Ms. Tingle comes together, catches Holmes, a classmate and her best friend with her exam. Convinced that three of them were planning to take the exam here, Mrs. Ting fascinates her with the opportunity to destroy Holmes once and for all the claims that might take Holmes to her class. And the classmate who apparently has Holmes with his eyes always thought why he didn't give him the time (he's an idiot)? In desperation, Holmes and his friends are visiting Mrs. Tingl in the middle of the night to try and convince him to believe Holmes is going to cheat. It all keeps the fire somehow when a classmate guy points to Mrs. Tingle bow and arrow, threatening to do things right for Holmes. Mrs Tingle is fighting back, but eventually Holmes and her friend are imprisoned. <br /> <br /> Mrs. In Tingle's captivity during Holmes, they do everything to tie him up and drag him on his bed to blackmail the wrong images they had taken from an unconscious trainer in bed with Mrs. Tingle. I found myself as a candleholder when the kids were home to Mrs. Tingle's house, eating their food and going to their private job. At one point, Holmes found Mrs Tingle's class book and deliberately changed her grade in favor of her gradual reduction. The end result was a childish attempt to bring back comedy economically at the beginning of the film, solving pure irony, shock and absurdity. <br /> <br /> It must be the most unpleasant and the worst evil character, Holmes, will play throughout his life. I wanted to help Mrs Tingle freely to dig the grave at Holmes. He was manipulative, selfish and enticing. She even slept with her classmates despite her best friend's overwhelming interest ... and she didn't like her. In an attempt to destroy your challenger grades by grabbing Mrs Tingle's class book to take her best friend, you would think Holmes would eventually get what she deserves, right? Unfortunately, he gets everything his hearts want, showing that evil, manipulative, selfish, and beating power can get you what you want. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Tingle was what you didn't like. They didn't bring me this point to believe he was the woman who had to "teach" it. He was like any other rigorous teacher who even gave his generation an outrage for justified reasons. Personally, I felt that his views on youth were confirmed with Holmes and his friend's activities each time. I was hoping he could call the police and nail Holmes freely. They held her in bed, ate her food like a pig, drank a woman's wine, shared her personal belongings and think we believe she doesn't deserve a bat everybody's head? And the classmate must be one of the most enjoyable characters in film history. Forget the idiot, we need a new word that is not in the Webster dictionary. He brought great problems to Holme's life and made things worse when he stepped into Mrs. Tingle's house without calling Holmes and the corners and Mrs Tingle. I was excited every time Mrs. Tingle had the chance to kick her off, or stifle the best friend of the wannabe actor. <br /> <br /> If you are a teenager and you want to see a teen manipulate and make a lie, you can get him into the world, watch this unforgettable, cartoon-filled, unintentional movie dude.
