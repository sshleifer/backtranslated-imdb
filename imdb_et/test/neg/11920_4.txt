!!!! FULL SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The prerequisite is this: The shop is burned and Assistant Sergio asks the father of the child who started the fire to accept Sergio. br /> <br /> So far it is so good, but the fair timing of logic Sergio agrees to do so for $ 25,000, but why? Come on boys if you were a good looking white boy, if you risk letting you get a longer incantation in a tough prison (a very real possibility of firing) for the sake of 25 size? I know I wouldn't, and if you saw that you had a criminal record, no employer would want to touch you with a ferry, so it's $ 25,000 for all work and welfare checks? There is something else that seems to be without a prerequisite, because Mister Lumpke has told Sergio that his son was making a fire that seems to be aware that he may find out too much. Do wake-up clocks not remind you that someone wants to keep you when they told you something? <br /> <br /> I think we don't think such details would be thought, because PYROMANIAC'S LOVE STORY is not expected to be an intelligent thriller, it's a light hearted romantic comedy / chick probably the best girls night. Looking at this comment page, it is obvious that the film has its own defenders, but as a cynical man I was not too impressed and William Baldwin goes to the top
