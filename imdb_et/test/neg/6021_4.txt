"Clubbed" is another "will"? Entering the Brit fisticuffs genre and being sure to keep the punter who is not expecting too much moderate entertainment within ninety minutes after some beer. But for anyone looking for intelligent, high-quality entertainment, this is best avoided. <br /> <br /> The amazing script has so many misconceptions that even Colin Salmon's caliber actor has been looking for. The action has been set in the 1980s, but it is never clear why, especially if they have not been able to take off convincing feelings during this decade, more than a few 80s of soul recordings, occasionally zoot-suits and a handful of 30-year-olds will wear on the soundtrack . Then we see the central signs that learn texts such as Sun Tzu's "War Art" and talk about how violence should be the last resort, while the same characters seem to be too willing to start punching all the testosterone-based, unimaginable abandonment of chavies that fight over the chip bag. <br /> <br /> There is no sign for "Clubbed". Nor is irony, fineness, or sin. This is a movie that talks about pleasant memories of Guy Richie's early gangster films, which, despite their mistakes, were certainly much more meaningless, better editing, smoother dialogue, and packed more emotional punch than it would make a small saga. Anyway, they're ten years old - isn't it time to try them out?
