Below the average blaxpoitation action / melodrama, where lovely Mrs. Grier plays a private eye, helping her father (Rudy Challenger) and his partner (Austin Stoker's original "Assault on Precinct 13") whose lending activities are at risk. <br /> <br /> I'm honest - I agree with some other user comment on this movie. "Sheba, Baby" is less than a satisfactory script, a direction that is not particularly distinctive, action scenes that are at best moderately entertaining, and one of Mrs Grier's more non-writing supportive pains (although D'Urville has an important supporting role) Martin, as well as the familiar name blaxpoitation). I have the feeling that this routine film can be put together quickly to force her to become immensely popular. <br /> <br /> Stoker was definitely good again, although Mrs. Grier does not have such a good role - or dialogue - as she has been in other films, although she does what she does best, and it plays sassy, Sexy sister in revenge mission. <br /> <br /> The non-stop soul / funk soundtrack is at least nice. <br /> <br /> Mostly, people who want to see all of Pam Grier's movie repertoire are recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
