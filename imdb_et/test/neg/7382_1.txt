I found that Super Troopers is at best lightly entertaining (I was impressed by the ripoff of the police academy) and I hopefully leased this movie for the better. It wasn't. <br /> <br /> Writing is absolutely terrible and the pace of this movie is even worse. In this movie, it doesn't seem to be happening as a whole, or it really gives us a reason to give something like that. <br /> <br /> An actor who plays Felix is, however, completely endless. probably due in part to the dialogue he had to do. In short, this movie went wrong in so many places wrong. where the characters are trying to be funny. But if the dialogue in Clerks pushes the story forward, it will hopelessly consider it in this movie. Movies should have a proper balance between action and dialogue, and if it is tempting for filmmakers to try to get a ton of delicate, funny dialogue, it's just not always working. Especially if they are not good at writing a dialogue. I hate to say this, but even "Extreme Heist" was more interesting than this movie - and this movie was such a low budget that it was shot on a video clip.
