What a terrible movie! I did it for about 50 minutes and started to stop the chapters until the end. The plot is nothing special, and film dialogue is different from the main story so much that your head explodes. Many useless minutes just wasted characters by listening to jabber something that was not relevant to the plot, and / or something that could be said in a shorter time. The camera's work is shaky and grainy. It seems that Mr. Milligan had to take his finger off the zoom button! I also noticed that on some points of this film, Andy seemed to hold the cramps and shake the camera uncontrollably. The connections between the scenes were nervous and did not flow. Murder images were nothing special - incredibly and ridiculously fake. As the title says, barely bothered. This movie lasts about 1 hour 20 minutes and the murder scenes take about one minute of the whole movie - if it is. Which sad garbage this film was. Andy Milligan is probably one of the worst directors who interrupt humanity with their talent management and camera work. I usually get it through really bad horror movies and later laugh. BLOODTHIRSTY BUTCHERS, but I can't. I'm just angry that I spent an hour and a half watching my life (what I didn't do to get it back). Take my suggestion and DO NOT see this movie if you are going to sleep. TERRIBLE.
