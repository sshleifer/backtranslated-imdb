Given the reputation of the film as the worst of the worst, I was looking forward to seeing Wood Crappus Opus (my word); it may not be more intuitive than the others I looked at - but being a REEFER MADNESS (1938) film making school, GLEN or GLENDA is not as "enjoyable" as its genre efforts. br /> <br /> This is also evident in Horror's legend from the corner of Bela Lugos (his first three co-operation with the director): one wonders whether he was really aware of what movie it was (taking into account the actor's history) the unknown drug and his area of ​​ignorance because of). Moreover, the idiosynthetic handover of Lugos is perhaps the most uncomfortable here… although Wood's script is mostly to blame for this - given the impossibility of dialogue (with recurrent meaningless "puppy-tail" and "big-bodied actions"), he gave the sick star! By the way, Wood himself plays a central role (under the pseudonym Daniel Davis) - and being equally worthless in this field, has proved to be a comprehensive dog; Dolores Fuller - his wife and adults - was equally unattractive (he also appeared in JAIL BAIT [1954]), but at least the picture where Glen finally ends up wearing his angora sweater gave Tim Burton a pleasing biological ED WOOD (1994) famous poster! By the way, the last film is expected to have a fictional meeting between Wood and Orson Welles - well, for all purposes, GLEN OR GLENDA represents Ed Wood's CITIZEN KANE (1941) considering its gleeful tendency to tricky narrative techniques: indeed, the plot's best yarn is padded with stocked stock (many of them are insignificant, such as the amazing incidents of S & M) and the dancer's sequences of dreams (as evidenced by the unpleasant demon that represents the horrible bushes that would make Martin Scorsese cry with jealousy! however, at every step of the approach, only amateurism. <br /> <br /> What it is worth is this edition I watched the "Extended Re-Edition", which included a six-minute "depraved" video (directed by W. Merle Connell), what was censored in the original release! once so often (which forced me to roll back a bit to get the sound back on the track) - although fortunately it was a source of conversion to DivX, not the film itself.
