That thing. Oh god, this thing. I can't even name that movie. Film is something that does something. goes somewhere. is somewhat similar to a plot or SOMETHING. I don't know how I do it. I really don't. First of all, the dark fields are the worst film. and I thought it was. then the pirates of the ghost island showed me wrong. and now, for the third time in a row, the second film goes upwards to prove me wrong. <br /> <br /> (sighs) OK. Dark Harvest II: May. lord, it's terrible. Let me finish it for you. Man realizes that the daughters are threatened by some magical psychic power that he gained from his second popcorn of law and competitions to find them in the corn field. Of course, this is the largest cornfield of existence that is the size of Jeepers Creepers, Corn of the Corn and Signs. the main character whose name is Shy (fantastic name btw) then goes through the cornfield. digs time ... and runs through corn. and an incredibly sad thing? I really don't leave anything out. It's pretty much the whole movie. The only thing I leave out is how he gets two police officers who want to arrest him ... I don't know. pretending to be an actor. I don't care about this point. She goes away and the police have been killed off-screen. holy mess is the killer? Apparently yes there is, as he filmed in the movie almost 4/5. but wait! then he runs for a while and there is, you guessed it, you ran through corn and dig. Then there is the end where she can get her daughter. Huzzah. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie is that it is boring. it's totally, INHUMANLY, TREMENDOUSLY boring. I can't explain how frightening this thing is. nothing happens, the characters are as attractive as the root channel, and it is only one and a half days. The only good film that came out of this movie was that I and my friend could have found the illumination thanks to the nirvana situation that this film put on us after our brain drug had to keep us alive. During the next madness I found a lot more enjoyable wall and my friend found a new passion with a smile hysterically, while the whole floor falls as if it had a cramp. This is the madness that this movie brings. it's not just bad. it is bad for your health. Kate looks awesome with the image of the AWESOME scarecrow killer that I would completely consider dressing like a horror con, but it was the most misleading box ever. DO NOT TAKE YOU! Don't look at this movie. watch the better corn movie. Every film is better for corn. just don't let him get you! don't! 0 out of 10
