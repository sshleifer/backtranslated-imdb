Spoiler Warning !!! <br /> <br /> This is probably my least favorite Cary Grant movie. I spent most of the time thinking: ignore him, leave him, etc. Is he trying to kill him? Should we assume that after the end, if he persuades him to return home, he will eventually kill him? I see a couple of books checking that this is the reading that some viewers / critics have taken. Early finishing is ultimately a more sensible way to film a book than to make an end - and that is an unreasonable change to end like, for example, Altman's The Long Goodbye. Unlike Hitchcock's earlier examples, where the murderer was not a murderer because the star is cast (when Gosford Park refers to Lodger, Ivor Novello does not mention the murderous habits), the end of the book is certainly not excluded. <br /> <br /> Robin Wood's Hitchcock Films Revisited writes: "Because one mentally" swiches "ends, the change of every scene, the apparent strength of narrative dissolves, the illusion of" reality "of fiction breaks down, the film becomes" modernist ", in which the narrative process is in the foreground. "I like to play intellectual interpretation games as much as anyone else, but if the movie is not easy reading, it won't work. It fails. Even after weighing some deadly milk powders in some Hitchcock films. <br /> <br /> Irritating skin. The year is 1941. Nothing in the movie says it is in the past. Beaky (Nigel Bruce) keeps his money in the Paris bank and goes there to make financial services? Does he not know that war is? Are there any flights from Croydon airport? Is he in good condition with the Nazis? How can one never assume that Germans would shoot him as spy or something. <br /> <br /> Curiosity. When Johnnie and Lina's dinners with the mysterious writer Isobel and his brother, the pathologist, are present in the fifth person who has never been explained or introduced - wife tuxedo. The credits say he is Nondas Metcalf who plays Phyllis Swinghurst. Isn't this an example of how lesbians were encoded in 40's movies? Will we take him to Isobel's lover? Books that talk about gays / lesbians to be opened and hidden in Hitchcock (eg Robin Wood again) do not include Phyllis Swinghurst.
