Classical author C.S. Lewis once wrote an essay saying that no children's story is worth reading, watching, etc., if only children get it. I would say that this movie is easy to defend your arguments. <br /> <br /> About five or six years ago, I loved it, watched it only three or four years later and found it to be damp, poorly animated, well-written and confused and with amazingly repetitive and terrible songs (I'm looking for you, hi-cockalorum), showing a production that aims for cheerful stupidity and terrible, but which results in a ugly, slightly, depressing confusion. <br /> <br /> Show it to your child, but I would recommend that you do not buy copies or try to sit while watching. If you want something in this era, but with a real charm and mindset, go after 'Oliver Twist' or the BBC's shining adaptation of 'The Delights'.
