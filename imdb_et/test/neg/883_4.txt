If you read a book before seeing a movie, you might be disappointed as I was. The book was great and I was sure after the movie preview that the film would be great, but I felt like I was watching a movie where the director and the director didn't even read what those characters were. The film is short and they never feel like they were really in love and felt like the only mates. Even if the film did not move in the same direction as the book, the romance of the two characters would be stronger. I think both Diane Lane and Richard Gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry, but they just didn't develop a long enough story to see how they longed for each other. The book was a true story of love and I think this film would have been much better.
