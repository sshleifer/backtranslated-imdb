And only one in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is Margaret Leighton. She is a wonderful actor both on stage and on the screen. However, we have little chance to see him. I think this is especially true in the United States. <br /> <br /> Here he plays compassion. Not only that, but he is also very beautiful and he was supposed to be a bomb. <br /> <br /> Walter Pigeon doesn't keep the Drummond performers' tradition. He's always trustworthy, but he's not very fun. He's not rascal or knave. As a result, it seemed to me that it was a little capable or tense. But check it out for Leighton.
