I saw the star of the movie in the * Daily Show and thought I could tune in (the movie premiered at Comedy Central, then went to the theater). Oh Vey! <br /> <br /> This makes "Clown Shake" out like "Citizen Kane"! Avoid, avoid, avoid at all costs. Not a laugh, not even a smile. This film turns your face into pimples and your eyes break like the "Raiders" last remodel. I can't even think of a worse movie, be it "Manos" or "Ishtar". As the Pythons wore, run, run away! Why did someone illuminate this light when they didn't use their money? It is terrible that there is no good line, not one good joke and only one bad thing ... in making this movie. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been fun if it was done properly. As it is, I find the new pancreas so loud. The devil who participated in this travesty.
