Hair, a film based on a broad match, does not achieve redeemable cinematographic features. you can't really play and make a movie about it. Whether it is the temptation of film music to see this movie, it really reduces the quality of a large-scale exhibition. worse than seeing sitcom rashes. the musical fiasco and cant believe that others rated it so high.
