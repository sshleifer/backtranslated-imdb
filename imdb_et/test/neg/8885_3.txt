This film had very few good points, special effects and action was definitely terrible. But it was a film that was made with a small budget, so you can't expect much of it, it has some laughs (I doubt they're meant :)). The scene where the old woman curves and touches the manure on the floor puts it in her nose and goes to CHUPACABRA! The really fooled raspis voice was invaluable. All in all, if you have nothing else to look at and just want to laugh at a truly outrageous flick, trying to make Blair Witch Project a success, then grab it after what doesn't bother.
