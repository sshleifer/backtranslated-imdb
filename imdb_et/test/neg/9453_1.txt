My friend loves sticky horror movies so I can often see such a small budget stuff. But this is the first time I've been forced to write one comment ... <br /> <br /> Simply put, this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen! Even worse than Boggy Creek II! <br /> <br /> The movie's entire budget seems to have been spent in the midst of a short scene when Dr. Klaus stands in this chamber and changes all the vampires. The only good thing to say is that with some beers it was fun (but for all the wrong reasons).
