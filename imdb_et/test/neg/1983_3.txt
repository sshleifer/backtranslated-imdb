I like Kinski, he's a great actor. I've seen this movie because I've heard that this movie has autobiographical aspects. <br /> <br /> The film is full of symbols like a piano that drops in a river or strange shots on the walls. Then the narrator always says abstract phrases like: "The boy sells happiness, but his box is now empty." It's really annoying and wasn't really necessary because everyone understands what this movie is. The film shows how a Kinski character was a woman and how she kept them under control. If there are really some aspects to this story about Kinski, he was really a pig. So it is not necessary to watch this movie unless you want to see Kinski naked or want to laugh at the bin.
