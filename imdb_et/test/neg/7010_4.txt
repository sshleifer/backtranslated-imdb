*** SPOILERS *** Hot and sexy Linda Blair, like Witch Amelia Reynolds, is very irritated by her friend and rival Witch with Erica Barens, Julie Strain. Amelia got her husband Hal, Edward Albert to get her job at the Giger & Greengrass law firm more than worthy of Larry Barnes, Larry Poindexter, who happens to be married to Erica. lose control over your car and end up almost killing. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> </p> This is when Larry returns to his former wife Carol, Rochelle Sanson, things will really warm up, emotionally and sexually. The perpetrator, Amelia, is trying to take over the body of Carol's dead spirit and finally murder Larry, whom he considers to be responsible for the injury to her husband, Hali, who was permanently disabled by a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> Not much story, but lots of cheese and soft core action with poor Larry, whom Amelia manipulates through the resurrection of Erica, who is going to kill her when she wants her back as soon as possible. Amelia is a little banged, not knowing who is and who is not dangerous to her. Amelia gets even her poor and innocent gardener Stan, Michael Parks first loses the family's bloody house invasion, then his thought when the police accuse him of being a murderer, and finally it's life, breaking Ameila himself. As he did, he runs in Reynolds House, under his control, as mad as the one who is trying to kill both him and Hal. <br /> <br /> Larry Parks saw and acted so strangely that you had the feeling that he accidentally walked "Sorceress" and experienced his role in Stanina playing. Without the help of the script or the rewards, he improvised his way and then slowly realized how divine-terrible bad film really is. Stan was killed by the film early because he didn't have to suffer, like those we look at, through a painstaking and moody movie. <br /> <br /> This is evident both to you and to the Sorceress makers, that all of the shenanigans on the screen must reach a certain promising and successful end and that the movie will be finished with a trick. The end is the best thing after Miss Blair and the rest of the very well blessed woman that can be said about the film.
