The Mexican werewolf in Texas is located in the small town of Furlough, where Anna (Erika Fay) lives, her best friend is Rosie (Martine Hughes) and has a Mexican boyfriend named Miguel (Gabriel Gutierrez), who has decided to track down the beast that has terrorized the city, killed cattle and several residents, including some of their friends. Local Mexican legends speak of Chupacabra, an evil creature of myth and legend. Erm, I'm currently in trouble because it doesn't really happen so much ... <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Scott Maginnis I didn't beat the bush here and just say that the Mexican werewolf in Texas is a terrible period. The script only refers to the word "Werewolf" once, and the rest of the time it is called Chupacabra, I really suspect that it was not really conceivable as a werewolf. "The creatures of werewolves seem mostly hairless and resemble some witch dogs, there is no reference to anyone changing during the full moon and actually attacking a few times a day, there is no transformation scene and at the end, if it is killed, it will not change anyone. To be honest with the title, there is nothing to show on the werewolf movie, and even then the title is just a very popular American American horse in London (1981). This is a type of homemade crap that I personally think kills the horror genre, how long it has been since it was a real low-budget horror classic like Dawn of the Dead (1978), The Evil Dead (1981), Halloween (1978) or on Friday 13th (1980), all made on shoe strings budgets, may be The Blair Witch Project (1999), but in recent years & crap like the Mexican werewolf in Texas is absolutely in some way classic. The characters are terrible and things just happen around them, the dialogue is trash, the temple is terrible, the story sucks and practically sent me to sleep, and as a whole, this movie is just nasty, I'm sorry, but I don't know how to describe it. <br /> <br /> Director Maginnis does nothing to trace, there is a tedious hand-crafted camera art that can easily give someone a headache and a quick "flash and you can change anything" that just upsets and irritates equally. It's not scary, nudity, no tension, no atmosphere, and special effects are terrible. The monster really seems poor and it's no wonder Maginnis keeps it hidden or cuts his scenes so fast that you never see it. There is almost no color in the image, it is almost dark black or over saturated desert oranges, which makes the eye aching. Gore consists of some fake guts (blinking and you lose them!), Some bloody wounds and broken hands, a big deal. <br /> <br /> The estimated budget is about $ 300,000. Low, but I just refuse to accept that there are many low-budget horror cinemas to make such a waste film that make their little budgets far. The whole thing is the look of a home movie, it's not style and is quite boring and boring to look at. Acting suck well, though you probably already knew it. <br /> <br /> The Mexican werewolf in Texas is likely to rent / buy / watch a few people because they may mistakenly believe that this is a sequel to John Landis classic, and that is not even the right werewolf. Don't be fooled, it's terrible, and I'm tired of having time / money at home like home.
