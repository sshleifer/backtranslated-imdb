I like bad movies, but it's a steamy heap. Don't waste seconds on this pile if it's shameful from the operator to the dreadful sound and devastating action. Fifth graders could have made a better movie and the first graders could have written a better script. Do you want a real summary? The ugly chicks in neonbikini are dancing too long. Degraded plot deteriorated as a result of twilight actions. Location sets were not even satisfactory. The scenes of the church take place in the dance studio and oh yes - what are the two blue dance numbers, <br /> <br /> Oh, and the total number of naked breasts that couldn't even record this movie - 0. Add it to the trash.
