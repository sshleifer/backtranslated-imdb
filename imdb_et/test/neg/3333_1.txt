A ridiculous movie, terrible editing, the worst scenario, a ridiculous act, a story that is completely incomprehensible ... <br /> <br /> If God decides whether to continue the films, judging it, the film industry in the world would now be dead. <br /> <br /> A great movie that shows that cinema shouldn't be made by people who "think" they can make movies. <br /> <br /> I still think of those two gypsy girls who appear in the movie for over half an hour and we never introduce us ... <br /> <br />
