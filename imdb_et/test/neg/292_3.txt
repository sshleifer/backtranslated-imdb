Reject: Simon directs a small team of special agents who specialize in finding missing people and returning to all possible odds. Their last mission is the grandson of their friends. He seems to have been caught in a particularly cruel criminal network and all who are looking for him are lost. But now Librarians are on the case. <br /> <br /> Comments: It's pure B-action, through and through. Its main phrase is an unlimited offer. Ammunition is unlimited, they do not need to be recharged once. There's an unlimited supply of bad guys so heroes have something to shoot. Breasts have unlimited offers, many of them are empty, in vain (and as always unsuccessful) try to pull the holes in the plot. And there is an unlimited supply of bad actions (that's almost like Erika Eleniaki's presentation of what it is?) And actors who don't seem to care more than salary (and why should they, if nobody else seems to be) > <br /> And like most B action movies, there is an unlimited number of bad weapons to fight. But they seem almost ridiculously bad. I think I saw more realistic winning attacks when I was playing a cowboy boy. <br /> <br /> But then I don't expect much, how can I get an action film called librarians? And it really gives you something you could expect. 90 minutes more or less bad things to do with scenes. But I'm sure I can call it entertainment, it didn't interest my interest very long. <br /> <br /> 3/10
