Do you know the old I saw a train wreck? One of the ways you can't look at it? This movie is not so good. The only reason you still stay is that you brought your children and you can't leave them alone in the theater. You may be exposed to the sun. <br /> <br /> Tim Hill should never work again after filming spam in a movie. He succeeds in taking a decent comic artist into Jason Lee and making him a robotic, insecure actor in this production. <br /> <br /> I didn't find much hope for this movie. If that wasn't the only family movie, I took my son for Christmas, my wife and I wouldn't have gone. God, I wish we could go back in time and stop. I leaned toward my wife in about 10 minutes to tell her what that stinker thought, but she beat me to a blow. <br /> <br /> I'm not kidding. It's dirty. Only the usual work of David Cross saves this review only one star. <br /> <br /> The story is tempting, insulting, and stupid, as you might expect from the movie in this genre (though the last one) Curious George "was happily intelligent and enjoyable." Action is mostly poor. It was best and worst for the audience. It doesn't work. <br /> <br /> The old chips were clever, mischievous, and cunning. br /> Does the film fail in retrospect, in remorse or in a brand new production? The final shoulder? My son could not wait. Spend your money instead of Curious George.
