Okay, I watched this movie when I was very little, and the day we cleaned the cabinet, I see it! I thought "I have no idea what the film was," so I went on and put it in. OH MY GOD !!!!! This movie is so bad! I've never thought this film would ever be as close to my favorite movie as I did, but I smiled because all the jokes were so rodent and ridiculous Not funny !!!! So many things in this movie were funny because it was so STUPID !!!! This movie is not good at all. I should say whether you want to watch this movie, which is definitely better not to expect and if you have already seen it, trust me, I also feel your pain!
