I admit that the original love for your neighbors' TV shows is a secret admiration - mostly because they have a peculiar abundance and bad taste that synonyms with so many programs of the era, but I lie through my teeth (a very uncomfortable position) when I made this big-screen spin -off is nothing but abomination. Scenes that open up to voluntary vandalism are not only pointless, but also amazing - it has never been explained why the film opens, watching the people who follow each other's house - and there is nothing about it. By the time the movie discovers the oldest joke in the book - the threatening mother-dwarf dragon suddenly persists - the crash is followed by an obvious revelation that it develops a soft spot for the father of a black neighbor, moving her descendant son to ever-deeper, ignorant rage, the most discerning viewers turned on. Take it as a warning if you do not want a cheap intermediate spin-off with terrible action, static direction, and the overall comic elegance of a burning orphanage.
