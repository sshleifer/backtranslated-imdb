The human traffic has been "just been there, done it" experience? only this time it's pretty weak. <br /> <br /> The main topics studied are paranoia, male impotence and jealousy? but only lightly and badly. <br /> <br /> Many movies want to mimic Trainspotting's (drug / club) culture? but it does not include the low time / income drop that Trainspotting deals with (eg: death / addiction issues, etc.). Is he even trying to find a similar monologue by Ewan McGreggor's classic "Choose Life" speech? but "Milk bars are on me!" Yes! '? What is it? <br /> <br /> Characters try to analyze their lifestyle, but if their lifestyle is so low? their analysis becomes dull and repetitive. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack (for a movie trying to be cool) is pathetic. Does it include Fat Boy Slim and CJ Bolland? come to people? good dance music IS is better than this! <br /> <br /> Characters become shaky and annoying (especially in the midst of a movie) and the absence of characters will soon hide. There are a couple of funny scenes? but they are little and far. The mother who was trying to sons in the bedroom was quite fun. <br /> <br /> But please? I'm sick of Star Wars analogy scenes. I thought it was a lot sharper in a couple of Kevin Smith films (ie Clerks and Chasing Amy). By characters? Yoda is a drug debt, so is it short and bald? Huh? <br /> <br /> My score ?? 4 out of 10 ?? do yourself a favor and see Trainspotting or Go instead!
