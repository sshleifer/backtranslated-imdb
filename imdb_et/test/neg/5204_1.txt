**** SOME SPOILERS **** <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie that you have not already seen browsing online. Nothing is shocking for this movie. In the film, the man is astonished by the goat, there is a break of the bulldozer and the lesbian face burns. All of these "extreme violence" scenes are so fake, it makes one wonder why anyone would even want to recycle this trash. I just can't believe I spent the hard earned money on what must be the worst film. Don't let the inspections fool you, this movie would be a shame that someone ... except prisoners who want to torture prisoners. For REAL UTILIZATION CLASSICS, see Bloodsucking Freaks or even the newer Doom Generation. Death Island sinks to the bottom of the movie toilet and it must exist.
