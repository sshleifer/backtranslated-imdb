I just want it to be down to F to give it! I put it in 1 vote. I've even classified it as a regular movie, but as a R&D film, and it's the worst, flat, crappiest and most terrible movie I've ever seen. Music is all terrible, not to mention the fact that R&D connisuer.it is not even ridiculous smiles, and the viewer is ready to sit through many painful scenes where he makes cheers.avoid it in the trash at all costs! this is the worst 80's teen cinema.
