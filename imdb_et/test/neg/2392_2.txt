A good idea left behind by heavy hand production. <br /> <br /> Quite a few dialogues were incomprehensible due to the level of music / background sound and this did not help the reviewer. Welsh's accents were not uncommon from time to time. After all, I lost my will to live trying to follow the dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie didn't know if it was a farce or a black comedy - and they needed different approaches. Some incidents were placed so thick that they just deserved, some were so incredible even for the type of plot that they just didn't have to follow. <br /> <br /> Action was the main good - although America just got a clone "Back to the Future" to a mad scientist. The little boy was very good. <br /> <br /> I looked at it all the time, but God knows why: I never remember laughing.
