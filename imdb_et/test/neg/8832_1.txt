I have watched the VERY CORRECT CUT, so this is the object of the rejection of the so-called scientific atheist. I don't know where to start, because it is such a stupid source. Faith in God <br /> <br /> He believes science is a religion and hopes that we believe in him as we are God. Only the language used in his postulations has to be considered. <br /> <br /> Faith. These goods are widely used in everyday behavior. Just think about it. When he gets to the electrician, he believes it is correctly connected to the wiring and switches on the switch. When he gets into the plumbing, he pulls a chain in his bathroom and waits for the water to flow in the right direction. As for religion in science When I was in the chemistry class, I believed and taught that the atom was the smallest part of the electron and the theory of onion skin. It was taught to me as the atomic theory of "writing in stone". Why should we believe any scientist, especially if he exceeds the parameters of his field? Dawkins argues that religion is a fall of civilization. Religion is a civilization. Can he or any other atheist tell us what civilization is created and cultivated by atheism, barbarism or bravery? He now lives in the last stages of Christian civilization and takes all the benefits of it without its source. I found that Dawkins is an arrogant, dictatorial, judicial, obvious believer in eugenics and Nazis in his attitude to youth. How dare he say what a parent can teach his child. The child is the genetic of their own, not the people and the parents, so they inherit their beliefs. An example of this attitude was his dismissal from Adam as "he never exists" because he has no evidence. So I have no evidence that Joe Blogs live in New York, but well. I haven't found any proof yet. It does not deny his existence. I notice my argument with the Bishop of Oxford that the prelate is selective with what it takes and believes in the Bible. Well, Dawkins does it too. Where does he draw it between the historical document and the religious claim? He is also selective. I heard a lot when Dawkins came with the ALTRUISTIC gene. What a hoot. He desperately looks for evidence of his strangeness, and when Piltdown's man was invented, we now have this so-called ALTRUISTIC gene that puts us in the care of our youth and other members of our group. The problem is that all animals do it - not only monkeys and evolution are the most capable of survival. not sure and if he really thinks we will become more secure than race then he will not read the same newspapers as I have found his incredible incredible, to discourage that if we only have this life then we should enjoy it. So how does it equate it to its obvious position as a European poor to a poor poor in Africa who has destroyed and probably raped and starved his entire family. Does he help him? I note that all his opposition to religion is a) that they are traveling. Well G K Chesterton announced that the only fighting war was a war against religion b) we oppose the use of contraception and abortion and homosexuality. All sins against command 6. It's funny. <br /> <br /> As a Catholic, I find the proclamation of Pius XII's resurrection dogma in 1958 erroneous. He, Pius, never said that he had been discovered when he sat somewhere. If Dawkins doesn't know it, the revelation ended with the Apostle. Pius would have had years of advice and documentation that has been signed over the centuries to make this proclamation come. Also, as a Catholic, I find the dismissal of all unmarried people happy. which is angry. We, every day, fight the world, meat and the devil. We're the military of the Church. We can also glorify the sunset and admire the beauty of nature, even when we believe in God. The problem with Dawkins was that he interviewed dirty parades and extrapolated them to all of us.
