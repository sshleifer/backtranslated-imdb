This is due to the California-based militia town where he made a home video and put it on the rest of the world. Legendary in some circles as the largest cinematographic turkey, this film is rightly probably a bad film. Part of the comedy, part of the giant monster horror movie, this movie is full of non-participants not acting. The plot has something to do with the giant monster created in the area by rubbish and pollution and going to rob. A monster that we don't see until the last 20 minutes is quite cool to look for, but isn't cool enough to justify watching the last boredom. Honestly even hardened bad film students are going through a tough time. This is a haiser.
