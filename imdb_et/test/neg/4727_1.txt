Oh, how I laughed during the first scenes. This silly little movie of a 11-year-old who carries a gun, steals cars, robes the shops, houses a wagon, expands money from other children, burns the house, lets the rats buy drugs, distributes drugs to his mother and his friends, and then kills the boy. What a great comedy! But it wasn't meant for comedy. It was meant to be a social drama. How is it? The events in this film are absurd and ridiculous. Characters are all stereotypes of immature imagination due to 4-year-old comic book protection. Dialogue is ridiculous; people speak like moles. This is a very stupid movie. <br /> <br /> The first scenes are really funny, for all the wrong reasons. But the unintentional fun of the idiotic space ends in a short time and after that they rarely laugh; by that time, the viewer cannot believe what he sees and is alternately surprised and bored, followed by (if he has at least half the brain cells). <br /> <br /> Short film but feels like eternity. The film is actually a seriously designed attempt to show a young degenerate world by imitating films that are much better than "Fun". There is only such air of fraud; children, adults, not everyone has confidence in their activities and in dialogue. The leading boy carries the film as if he had seen all Jimmy Cagney films at least a hundred times. And typically, it is enough that the boy does not constitute a reservoir of evil, but rather a poorly articulated little artistic talent. Of course. Every young hooligan is misunderstood - society made him bad. Bad child. <br /> <br /> The film is embarrassing; a clever, occasionally fun collection of clich√©s designed to make a film that has no intelligence and meaning. The intellectual level of the film is zero.
