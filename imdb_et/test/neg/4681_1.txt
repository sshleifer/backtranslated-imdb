Andy Milligan, an independent filmmaker in New York, directs this small "treating" version of his Sweeney Todd legend. Sweeney breaks the throat of her haircut customers and her cohort, Mrs Lovett, makes them meat pies. Thank you for being well versed in seeing this movie for travesty. Milligan, for my money, must really work for the worst drivers of the slowest race. Ed Wood looks like Orson Welles. This movie is so bad in so many ways. Let's take Milligan to the runners. The quality of the film is grainy. The sound quality is grainy. Many scenes look like Milligan used a video camera for the film. Credits say, "Photography and director Andy Milligan." He wants to take credit for the ceilings that appear after the death scene? How would a cruel musical result be chosen for the film? Film reduces one bad transition after another. Little logic is used to create a plot. The story has little to do with the actual Todd legend. The scenes of murder are somehow but not terrible. Hands, feet and other attachments are cut with the skill of editing: dirty! And we'll take a chicken pie in the scene. Yes, it is there. The pie maker did not know that the entire breast nipple filled the whole porridge? Later, we hear from our characters that they were "cautious that they didn't get caught" for 200 plus killings. Of course, they have a couple of breasts who can't keep up with what's happening (sorry it was too tempting). The actors are not really bad at all. Some even have talented sounds and all seem to be real English articles. Many non-erotic nude scenes are forced all the time. Milligan has seemingly gender issues. The fibers of the plot are not bound. The end is almost insecure because of the camera's little work. I could go on. Do I like something about the movie? Not much to be true. I have a high level of films in this lamp with low budgets and marginal talents, but this film has no real purpose other than crude oil and sick.
