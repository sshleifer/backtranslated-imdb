Oh boy. Where do I start with this slime? This is one of the few real-budget movies on my list that I've seen fit to give 1 rating and it's not quite high for product value. This film has no respect for the Bible account and is treated as a ridiculous fantasy of the whole story. I could not recommend it to anyone except to see how low society we have become ... <br /> <br /> The first thing Noah was absolutely not with Lot's friends. Anyone who actually read Genesis could say that Abram was the one they thought. Writers were just trying to make the story through all of Sodom / Gommor's subfield and it seems inappropriate because it is. A witch is treated as a pride of a butterfly ("You were kissing! You were kissing!"), But at least this is a step forward in the fun of moving Voight into Anacondas. <br /> <br /> But these crimes are unfortunate compared to the ethical treatment of this movie. God is a small, incomprehensible person who changes his mind with the smallest whim. ("I am one eternal perfect, but I can be wrong") What? Where do they get it? Such a God ... no one should ever pay attention, much less worship, praise or love. What the director says about it, I don't claim it. I just know that the responsible treatment of Noah's Gulf should not be so easy. Shame on these people.
