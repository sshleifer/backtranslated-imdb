If you are looking for a movie with Everest's beautiful pictures, you can enjoy this movie. Just skip the mountain views. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Alert) If you believe that like me, life is valuable and not wasted, this film will leave your bad taste in your mouth. 6 people died, 5 Sherpas and a member of the Japanese party just so one man could ski down Mount Everest. <br /> <br /> The film raises the question whether the continuation of the expedition meets his personal purpose was still worth living, and he responds to the stressed "Yes". <br /> <br /> Skiing is part of the last 15 minutes. He drives for a short time, then falls on the rest of the path until he stops with snow.
