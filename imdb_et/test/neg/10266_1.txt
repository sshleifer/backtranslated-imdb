Please, why did Bava have to add insult on Earth to insult this pathetic maturity? <br /> <br /> First of all, we look at the "viewers" at home from some unknown ding. -bat, which informs us of the effects of the previous episode that show the victory of humanity over demons (yes yes). <br /> <br /> I can tell you that "now" that this is not the case anyway - has something to do with the demons, because this is a whole new story with a completely different background. Bava, as usual, makes a random look that doesn't even look like the main context of the story. Acting beyond this terrible and all-encompassing concept of demons on TV, Oh God, I'm not going to go. See for yourself. <br /> <br /> As usual, ridiculous copying, nonsense scenarios with no sense, and especially unanswered questions, are treated. How typical is the first batch of nonsense. <br /> <br /> Generally, if you are one of these DVDs from the Argentinean collection, maybe you want to do it otherwise, avoiding the plague, it's not so close to the first, so you could like a plague.
