The rooms are the story of a man who loses everything except his incredible girlfriend and the idea of ​​a maize dog he intends to patent and sell. Immediately her uncle dies and leaves her house and car and she can rent and hire some roommates. Then his girlfriend gets drunk and deceives her so she goes and writes the book about the roommates and becomes famous. <br /> <br /> 88 minutes. None of these plot details have been studied in detail, which you read above is more or less as interesting as the film. When her uncle dies, there are some breasts on the screen, one of the potential roommates whose interviews are, is pretty funny for about 40 seconds. The end is literally the worst I've ever seen. I want the other 87 minutes back from my life! <br /> <br /> I had not thought anyone could make such a small film: Certainly, are such things public? The script must not be longer than twenty pages and the budget must be minimal, as the entire movie has about 3 locations and a car. The only conceivable use for space is, in my opinion, when you hold someone hostage and want to keep them from human nonsense. If so, you can repeat it and you have a gibber wreck during the day. <br /> <br /> One and a half in 10
