As powerful as Phoolan's real story, this book, which is based on the film, came out before he was released from prison and had the opportunity to say it. It is allegedly based on his diaries, but he is illiterate. How does it work? <br /> <br /> This means some areas of the movie are accurate and the actor is not bad, with some sensitivity. <br /> <br /> Indeed, although this story must be old in the TV series. Much happens to the far few seconds to cram. <br /> <br /> Read your autobiography. Highly recommended. This is a fantastic story.
