What is the injustice of a movie's rating - on the IMDb scale 2.1. People, it's much closer to 3.0, I'll go out and say where I've done it. Come on - how can a movie about a static electricity network that surrounds land and foreign amorphous cellular structures, and not give it at least 4.0 creativity? Then you have such a great dialogue as "Dave, look at the composition of this mud." You know, I don't think they ever returned to this mud. Whatever it is, it's like a flick that the "Z" movie diehards live in, and I can relax now. In fact, I saw it quite a few years ago without being sensible, and Corman's headlines such as "Huge Leech Attack" and "Grandmother's Wife". I don't know what charm can be, but quote the character of the movie - "Whatever it is, it works fast!" the third element that competes with your normal red and white blood cells. When the astronaut John John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) came back from the dead, I saw the visions of a scene that could have been the predecessor of the 1979 "alien", but that was not the case. Instead, the budget constraints limit the image to the abandoned Big Bird, although this concept was still nearly ten years away. Who knows where one thought leaves and rises to another? Look, it's not that bad. Not so good, but not so bad. Every time you join a landing accident astronaut against aliens who are committed to taking over the Earth, you have a winning combination. Throw the cheese monster factor and you are on your way. Remember - "A wounded animal that is not great".
