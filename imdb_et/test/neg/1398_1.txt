This is the most unfortunate excuse to show comedy I've ever seen. I'm confused that this guy got his show. It smells of comedy centrally for complete and complete despair, trying to fill the gap left by talented and unmatched Dave Chapelle. He's a tip for Nedi's bags of gold: isn't the punchline funny? Do you need that extra thrust? F *** ING YELL IT ON THE VEHICLE. Easy, no? And as an extra bonus ... stop half the jokes ... HOW YOU ARE RE-TAH-DED !! or DUH-DU-DUUUUHHHH! Oh man. So funny. Beaner ... fun. Wetback .... will laughter ever end? <br /> <br /> More brain to explain your point, I quote for example. Mencia jokes about how "slowed" is the construction of new orleans, because it is so close to the water. Genius. The line between the big comedian and hacking has never been so clearly drawn. Although a good comedian found humor hidden in the tragedy, she found some fine ways to make jokes that we all can laugh and comfort, Ned gets obvious. Move the city. Great. Wait, is that funny? Ned has no intellectual capacity to find the deepest meaning of things. The hurricane did not flood the city. The Levee project was underfunded and seriously needed federal dollars ... and see! They broke. I think it's God's way to tell us we shouldn't be there. After all, he has a place in Congress. What a fool is. <br /> <br /> Chapelle was tired of being a racial comic captain in her head. He was tired of it and we laughed at him at all points. Although mencia says black people can't swim *, Chapelle took the black and dark white domination beyond 300 meters. You don't have to be nervous to be nervous. You need to be original. <br /> <br /> The legions of Mencia and her fans are like a closed gay guy who laughs too loudly in gay jokes, thinking that it somehow disguises his insecurity. Except, of course, with Ned, he laughs too much for "slowdowns". Du-du-duuhu.
