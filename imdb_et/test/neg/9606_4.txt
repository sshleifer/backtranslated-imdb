I tried to show it at random, but actually it doesn't sit well with me. Although performances are good, writing is not. The two oldest siblings, Derek and Casey, are equally annoying; I have the impression that we should be next to Casey, because he is a protagonist, but I don't find him very pleasant. Parents are constantly portrayed as helpless. The three younger children are the most traceable items in the exhibition; Lizzie and Edwin are the sweet ways they come together, and Marti is divine. The plot lines are a bit far removed and the whole assumption is often difficult to swallow - mixed families are common, yes, but this family is not really all that is difficult to mix. All in all, I think it's under the thumbnails.
