The rented (thank you for free letting), as probably filmed in CT, where I live ... could have been filmed in the tunnel for all this thing! In the dark, ninety percent of the time and just a terrible experiment with a low budget flick, which can be good if you do it right. In short, a number of young adults who feel the fall of the meteor and then fall victim to aliens on the island of lighthouses, assisted by a keeper and a woman. Analysis: <br /> <br /> - works = terrible <br /> <br /> - writing = uninspired <br /> <br /> - story = done a million times with different settings <br /> > - Production Values ​​= Budget (Light) for Budget <br /> <br /> - Effects (Creature, Digital, Other) HORRIBLE, BLOOD CHEAP LOOKING <br /> <br /> So you get it. To add insult to the damage, filming the final credits - really now ...... who cares! Shocked by a universal company, they even look at it even afterwards. <br /> <br /> Finally try "CREEP". Low budget, but well written, well-behaved and quite well, horrible!
