I've seen some cinemas. Over the last couple of years, it seems that manufacturers and managers have tended to make films that bring me closer and closer to madness. Hannibal was no exception. I didn't expect much when I went to watch the movie. The book was ridiculous and said, "The book is always better than a movie", I didn't assure me that this movie was anything but a trash. But what I saw was a film that made all the other bad films better than they were. <br /> <br /> Usually when I see a terrible movie, I find myself more interested than anything else. Unfortunately, I could not even laugh at the sad apology for the film Hannibal has. The movie was filmed with a promise, I think. He had Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore and Gary Oldman. And the lead was Ridley Scott. There have been many less talented films that have been tremendously better. I would have cut so much from this movie that I doubt anything would have been left. It was pathetic. The story was so ridiculous that it seemed like a complete idiot. What's even worse is that the book was even crazy, and there were some scenes that were too extreme to add to what is sad about the movie where <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER AHEAD *** Ray Liotta's brain was baked in pieces. This scene, which is more than any other, made me cry because it placed its predecessor on such a monumental level. Tallies' silence was one of my favorite films. But Hannibal had two hours plus a joke. This movie should only be viewed if people want to learn how to write a good movie.
