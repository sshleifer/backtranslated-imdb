Well, Anne is too old. Wentworth looks younger than he and he shouldn't. Louisa is too young and cheerful Oh sister Mary is too beautiful. She should be average, not beautiful. If this actor complains about how Mary should all, I think she is too beautiful to be a complainant. Lady Russell is too old. It's crazy. When you read a novel, she is Anne's older, more mature friend, maybe as old as Annes's mother would be about 18-20 years older than Anne - so about 50 EI 70! Her crazy, doesn't fit. How is Anne so cute at first? He smiles when he says, "Oh the worst is over, I've seen him now, the worst is over" yes right. OK, if someone has seen the version of Roger Michelli of 1995 if you can't compare the two. This is correct. It's far away. Read the novel and you know what I mean.
