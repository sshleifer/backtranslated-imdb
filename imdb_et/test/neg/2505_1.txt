First of all, I even refuse to read this work from the Music Video ... I have this short film that uses the excerpts of the song "Thriller" from his soundtrack. I cannot have a music video longer than the song itself and the song must play the entire length of the video. Calling it in a music video is like a big Gatsby poem. In addition ... let's face it ... "thriller" is boring for 14 minutes, including the highly dated werewolves transformation, a meaningless Vincent Price poem (precisely because VP says it doesn't mean it's not flat), and most less threatening zombies I've ever seen. Of course, this was definitely a cultural phenomenon, but don't forget that it happened at the same time as Team A was on TV # 1, so it doesn't give too much credit to culture ... One last point about the effect of this movie on music videos. .. what exactly did it do by adding an equation that "Billie Jean" and "Beat It" didn't add yet? What I can say is that it only added some pause to a song or a dancing scene ... so you could say that all this video really gave Puffy inspiration to make more annoying music videos.
