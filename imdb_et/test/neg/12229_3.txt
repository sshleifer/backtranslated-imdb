Comedy, which attacks inspiring sports movies, says Comeback's story of a trained trainer, Lambeau, who takes over the silicon-backed college college and leads them to the football championship. In the process, this lifetime loser discovers that he is ultimately the winner himself, redeeming himself, saving his relationship with his family and friends, and finding that there is really no "I" in the "team"! <br /> <br /> I decided to look at this unrated version of this movie. It was thirty minutes longer and I though it may be better than theatrical release, hearing people hated this movie. After all, thirty minutes of extra material can add a lot to the movie. Well, I was really wrong. It was as bad as the recent "meet spartans", but it was thirty minutes more torture! The scam is short because if it gets longer it would be superfluous! Honestly, I love stupid comedies. Heck, I liked "Date Movie", "White Chicks", "Epic Movie" and "Little Man"! I think when it comes to spam, it's either a hit or a miss, and it definitely missed it. <br /> <br /> On the light side, I say about six of the many jokes in this movie, or seven I made a laugh, even some that made me laugh out loud. But it doesn't talk much. Following these jokes was more of a scene of torture and discomfort. In fact, there are so many product placements here like the Spartan meeting, the dance series are so much and funny jokes. I say one more thing I like about this movie are songs. They are great songs here. In general, look at if you like spam. Leave it out if you like a funny movie.
