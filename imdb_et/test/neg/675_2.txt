Looking at this and for a while, two things are remembered: One - do not know which girl wants to be a "model" and two - to the nearest ice cream shop and have low-fat apple trees. /> <br /> I tried to be a fan because I liked this reality contest. No other "famous" model thought about it and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks. But when the series continues and I have come to the conclusion that it is a pity for many people who are trying to get out of the mountain. Women should not look at it, teenagers should stay away from it unless they report on it. <br /> <br /> Many women try slots to compete in "Americas Next Top Model". They live together, the cat fights together, cries together, gets through meaningless modeling with meaningless modeling of people and fashionat, and loses and almost all of them say, "You see me again". Heck, I'm trying to see what happened to those who won the DID. <br /> <br /> This is a dream for some girls and good for them. Looking at it, I hope other girls who see and run like Hades are different - like college. models joining the group. It even made me think more about it because I'm sorry. "Full Motives" were no more than medium-sized women who compete with what I think is the smallest group of models they've ever chosen - so naturally make them seem more even. Bad, bad, Tyra and team. <br /> <br /> But to be fair, "Americas Next Top Model" is not a "full-featured" model, but an imaginary image that can be massively marketed and sold in a very beautiful way - and this exhibition just looks for the next fresh meat, which is added to the mixture. So the name of the exhibition. So it is damage to judges, photographers and associations. Thus, Tyra and his consistent "it me" combine the angle of each camera. But then again, this is one thing I like about this exhibition - an ex-model that gives others who do not have the opportunity - to enter the doors. But after that ... everything else has a status quo for the industry, so there are no surprises or weeks for the program.
