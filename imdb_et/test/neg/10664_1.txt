In Bollywood, it is not uncommon for valuable movies to become hits, good movies and good actors who don't make it big. <br /> <br /> AKS is such a movie <br /> <br /> Himesh after the music director and the singer tried to act as a hell man just because his songs hit, which means he becomes an actor. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers were confident that the movie would work, or the songs were hit, and of course Himesh made the cheap public as usual <br /> <br /> The movie tells a bad story, such a bad direction, such bad action, that makes you lighten <br /> <br /> Indian rickshaws in Germany, Himeshi stunts, and a lot of stupidity Himeshi's cover are intact even when it's in a car that can withstand. <br /> <br /> The direction is bad Music saves grace, though most songs sound the same <br /> <br /> Himesh is trying hard, but unfortunately his emotional scenes are a joke, there are no expressions, he is best suited for his music manager and for some song He cuts down the unfortunate picture Hansika is terrible Malika is okay Sachin Khedekar is okay, Dars han Jhariwala hats
