Bloody Birthday is a completely trash movie from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I found that the actor is pretty good because of the movie genre and its obvious low budget. I don't know what's going on with cinema, but it seemed strange. Too saturated. Maybe it's a bad transfer to a DVD or maybe it always seemed, I don't know. <br /> <br /> There's really no redemption to talk about. There are some deaths, but not quite jokes. I'm not worried if I was you. The best thing for a DVD was a 15-minute interview with Max Rosenberg, who was very fun and honest. He had nothing good to say about director Ed Hunt and admits that the film was unsuccessful, but he wants to do it again because he believes he has a good plot. But he died in 2004, so I think someone else is the challenge. Just as things have gone in the last couple of years, I would not be surprised that today the cinema is at least once a week. It can't be worse than the original, but I couldn't care less about whether it was made again or not.
