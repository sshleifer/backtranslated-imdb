As if the world needed another Seagal movie. Add a number of actors who are well ... not really actors, a bunch of heavy metal music to compliment the rape and, of course, the hot-looking chick skin without hips, and we stop ourselves from half the budget. Why, oh, why do people sabotage themselves by participating in such films? <br /> <br /> The FBI embraces two friends and sends them to "New Alcatraz", where the first prisoner in prison has unexpected guests. <Br>> <br /> The first rate that works everywhere, especially any scene that involves a good boy tragedy. Indeed, the director tested and pulled a modern, hard edge for the film, which he did best. Take it too often and HALF PAST DEAD gets too bored too fast. What more can be done if the inmates are just talking when hostages are constantly asking what makes the main bad boy motivated? Unnecessary action draws a little, if not "light".
