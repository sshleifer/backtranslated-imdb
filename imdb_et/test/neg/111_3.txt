This cheap, grainy filmed Italian flick is about a couple of legacies from a mansion in the Italian countryside that stops at the house, and then finds himself killed by the ghosts of people who died in this house. <br /> <br /> I wasn't impressed by that. It wasn't really that scary, mostly the way a cheap Italian movie should be. The girl, her two cousins, and one cousin's girlfriend traveled to this huge house for some reason (I couldn't figure out why) and I stayed there, cleaned and checked. The characters coming in and out of the movie and the points are quite boring and most of the deaths are in a hurry. A girlfriend hits the house when she escapes from the house after a dream of her death, and the scene is pretty good, but then things slow down again until confusing to the end when male relatives are killed with a strange way, and this weird guy (I couldn't figure out who she was during the movie, it was or maybe I just can't remember) going to the one girl who attacks her until that other girl kills her. You hate to finish the end, but well. The female cousin decides to stay in the house and watch it and show that she lives there years later. End. You really don't miss anything and anyway you won't find it anywhere, so happy with you.
