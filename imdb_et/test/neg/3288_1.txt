I would mark this exhibition as terrible if it was not the fact that it was in the same network as the seized development. Because it is in FOX and is updated when AD is canceled. <br /> <br /> It is absolutely without words how bad this show really is. But let me try to describe it. Take a very low price for Archie Bunker and let him out with humor that would have been out of date if he were married to children. Then take a lot of lines from the AD (son is ugly, boring girlfriend) and fool them so idiots looking at sitcom can understand them. <br /> <br /> If you look at it, I, like your family, have lost all respect. If you are a fan, you should love FOX's new comedy Til Death. It looks like a real funny, cutting-edge stuff. I mean, married couples can't ... brilliant.
