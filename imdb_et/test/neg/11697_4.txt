Serious spoilers, but some very small spoilers. <br /> <br /> "Acacia", Korea's contribution to the increasingly popular Asian horror, concerns a man and a woman who decide they get a little bit and decide for a child. A child with a common obsession with dead trees in the family garden will eventually disappear when the couple finally has their own child, and the above-mentioned tree appears to be a despicable family itself. <br /> <br /> And that's it. The film moves at snail pace, turning on over 100 minutes with 80 minutes of material. It is essentially a slim family drama with a scary tree, and there are very few intimidation, just tree pictures that play surprisingly strange noise from above. But the idea that a tree is the mother of a child is quite original, but it is not used to its fullest extent. This separates "Acacia" from most of the new waves: films such as Ju-On and Ring tend to do the opposite and the milk holidays idea until they are red on the face. <br /> <br /> The film will not end; realizing the child's destiny and the actions of the parents not only make the story curious, but also occurs by editing a machine gun that is difficult to take at once. The final sequence is undoubtedly horrible, but it seems too little too late. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is not too much in cash, but the "movie renaissance" that Korea is going through today was not able to feel that this film could have been so much more.
