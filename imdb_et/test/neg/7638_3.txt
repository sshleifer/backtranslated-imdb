I'm sorry for people, but these enthusiastic reviews of this "Respiro" movie on this prestigious site are very strange. Is it madness, I ask and found no answer. Of course, the film is filmed, in part it's almost a documentary. But then it is a fact that, for Grazia women, she shows every sign of heart disease and I was thinking of the whole film she has. His behavior is completely worrying and the villagers (shocked) really do want to send him the right institution to see what he can do about his condition. She needs fast treatment! His behavior is inferno for everyone around him, his wife, poor children (especially) and fellow citizens. Let's be romantic about it! I hated this mental portrait of a mentally ill. WHY, if God doesn't want her husband to heal her or at least try to do it? Why dread go to Milan (a big city, definitely, but many ways able people to treat him)? Tightness? Irresponsibility? Anyway, I was inspiring myself on this site to rent a movie on a DVD and after I saw that I posted it to others to give them an opinion on it. Frankly, I understand why the film didn't get more Cannes as an indicator ...
