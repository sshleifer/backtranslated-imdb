Usually I love these "Stranger within" thrillers. Some good examples are "Fatal Attraction", "One White Woman" and "Audition". Well done, they can be very fun and worth an hour or two of solid shock and fear. Of course, the opposite can be true: badly done, they can be annoying and stupid. "The Hand to Rocks Cradle" is one of the last. <br /> <br /> Bartels, Claire (Annabella Sciorra) and Michael (Matt McCoy) welcome another family member. But Michael is convinced that the busy Claire hires a nanny. One day, a woman named Peyton Flanders (Rebecca DeMornay) appears, and as she seems perfect, Bartels hires. Of course, when he appears, their idyllic life is slowly breaking down ... <br /> <br /> This film suffers from many problems, but the biggest one is the villain. Peyton is never credible. Part of this is related to how he has written and how he has acted. The things he should put on the edge are that they are ridiculous. De Mornay doesn't help much. He depicts Peyton as two different people. Although it is true that he should be the perfect babysitter to hide psychotic trends, De Mornay's performance creates two facets of his character. <br /> <br /> Other participants are still good. Annabella Sciorrra is an excellent asthmatic Claire. Sciorra is very natural in this role, but unfortunately the script gives it a chance. Matt McCoy is almost invisible. But Julianne Moore is pleasant when Claire's friend Marlene. Moore is a fireworks display, but unfortunately he only has five minutes on the screen. <br /> <br /> Curtis Hanson is a good director, but you don't know it to look at it. The film has some decent punches, but it is poorly occupied and the climax, while under tension, is actually ridiculous. This means that it works with a script that at best could be called pathetically. <br /> <br /> Trust me when it comes to babysitters, stick with Fran Drescher. It should have gone straight to videos.
