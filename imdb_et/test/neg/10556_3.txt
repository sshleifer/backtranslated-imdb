C.J. as a fan of the earlier movie Latter Days, I wanted to like this movie. <br /> <br /> The most pleasant thing I can say is that it's not a terrible movie. There are some good performances and some funny scenes. In particular, Tori Spelling has a couple of great scenes where he talks to his groom's ex-boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Generally it is a week. The script too often falls on strange coincidences and clich√© moments. (The main character went to Stanford for a golf scholarship and his high school friend does not even know that he is playing the game?) <br /> <br /> In most cases, this film had no idea where it was or what it was trying to say. There are a lot of scenes that are lightly cute, but ultimately they are a waste of time. And you could easily cut half of the film's characters without losing anything. <br /> <br /> For all my mistakes, I have to say that this is one of the best gay movies of recent years. Which says a lot about how bad are the most gay movies. <br /> <br /> I hope C.J. the next movie is better.
