Thinking it was better, this was the worst assumption I ever made. <br /> <br /> Drivvle doesn't describe this movie enough! <br /> <br /> Not only the plot is thin, but I get more emotional action on my pet fish! <br /> <br /> It was a shame to see Pete Postlethwait, whom I respect as an actor who is trying to do the best if he has to work a little ... I think that the cardboard cut out of Stephen Baldwin would have done a better job and actually it has been livelier. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! It can really be dangerous to health!
