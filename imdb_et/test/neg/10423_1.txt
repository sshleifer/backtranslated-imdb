I saw this movie in the cinema. I was in classes in Second City Chicago, and of course, the film's buzz was intense. This is a Woodward film that speaks of one of the indigenous people of another city. <br /> <br /> Everyone knew John's history. Everyone knew how he died. Some even knew that lore didn't make her particularly friendly to women who were in improvisation or comedy. <br /> <br /> But hey. The man led his life and was intensely loved by the people in his world, and he also said that he treated all his loved ones with friends with love and respect. <br /> <br /> This movie. Well. Forget the idea that the poor Michael Chilklis (who is really a big actor) is in a really amazingly poor movie and really has only subordinated the man. <br /> <br /> Forget the idea that they couldn't get rights to every Belush job ... and all the SNL scenes never happened to be portrayed in the movie. <br /> <br /> Turn the idea that half of the information in history didn't even follow Bob's Woodward work. Saying, "Okay ... we have to get confused with Belush ... we promise now for Woodward ..." They also decided to take this wonderful life presumption and make it an amazing life. <br /> <br /> Is he a guardian or a devil? Is the pinball machine an electronic assistant to the devil's assistant ... how many different ends can I get to the movie? This is one of those films after it's gone ... watching what you are, and go with the stunned disbelief "What the hell was that?!" In some circles this film has become a definite cult classic. But good reason. <br /> <br /> A good cult class that you sit around the screen and joke (or throw a gentle lining) on ​​the screen. The cult film is never good. And most people would never look at them in a serious context. <br /> <br /> If you want to look at some of the classic bad 80s fair stone? Rent wired. If you want to know about John Belush ... You can get more information on the walls of Second City Chicago than this movie.
