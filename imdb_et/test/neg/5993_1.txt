Being? Yes, it and the film he is celebrating. Hell seems endlessly frightening when these devils were forced to watch it forever. Six college students are attacking a condemned hospital to save money and fall victim to an ancient monster who has to demand five victims before returning to the "shadow of the world from which it came!" Apart from major logic and coherence issues (plus the fact that it seems to be unfinished), this disaster has worked terribly, written, edited (by J. Bookwalter) and directed, and make-up FX is almost non-existent. It's also considerably shorter than claims (just 80 minutes), but I don't complain. This is the worst movie I've ever seen from the leading producer of Charles Bandi's full-moon productions and the boy who is BAD! <br /> <br /> Please note that I almost did not bother with the review, but it has received inexplicably good comments here and I thought the different opinion was fine. Continue with caution!
