(spoilers) I have terribly seen the movie that this terrible movie was a sequel. It was called Ator Fighting Eagle and I saw it when I was only 8 years old. It made me feel so terrible that I never forgot it. I've been a MST3K fan for a long time, so when Cavedwellers came on tape, I bought it. I was terrible to realize that this was another sad Ator movie I saw so long ago! Ator's costume has in some way ever been hostile to the last time I saw her. How can he wear this little little bikini? Does he not care that it shows he has no ... errr ... package? And the bad Thong ... he doesn't get any line or girl and must keep it all the time from the furry girly doof from Ator. Has anyone noticed Miles O'Keefe walking like a woman? Not surprisingly, he doesn't care how somewhat weak Meela. I'm sure evil, but the bad bad guy Zor is to his liking. I loved the sweaty helmet painted by Zori's cardboard jet and how he spent all his time trying to touch part of the Ator. Fighting scenes are so poorly choreographed that its a miracle that swords can never combine. The boring old man spends all his time standing under depression. Ator runs from a cup that gives her a hate boy, and then she is surprised that they stunned her. He must be quite smart - he invented a glider for five minutes, then flew into space / time in the continent so he drove briefly to 17th century Bulgaria. It was after he created a giant snake doll, of course, and saved Postcostal Meela when he was sitting around, doing absolutely nothing. The real hero of the film was Thong, who saved Ator many times from his unlimited fool and killed the evil Zori. Kudos to Thong, the only competent movie in the film.
