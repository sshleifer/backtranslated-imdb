Swoon focuses on Leopold's and Loeb's homosexual relationships - the side of the case, which has been mostly (and unfairly) ignored since their trial, even in Leopold's own autobiography. But even with this Swoon it is far from being. Worse still, it spins, combines and alters the details of the case, which annoys someone who knows a lot about it, but is confusing to those who don't know it. Although it is an interestingly made film, the Swoon smells. <br /> <br /> 1 out of ten - terrible.
