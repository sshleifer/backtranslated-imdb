Poor Jane Austen should be glad she's not seeing this terrible wreck. So many great Jane Austen films have recently come out that it deserves to be permanently buried with the two other films I despise â€” The Man in Gray Flannel Suit and David Copperfield's 1969 version. My main beef with the film is that it loses the point of the book. Jane Austen tried in her society with gothic mania, and a large part of the novel is the cheek. The film, however, is serious and is treated terribly melodramatically. The light and fun-scented taste of Austen's writing is completely and remarkably absent from the era. Catherine's imagination is both free and uninteresting. Henry Tilney is also terribly unpleasant. Why, I ask, would anyone fall for him? If you're looking for a fun Jane Austen's evening, check out Emma!
