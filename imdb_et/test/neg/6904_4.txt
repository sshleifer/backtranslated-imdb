Let's see a couple of dozen Gary Larson gags, as well as his style of illustration, which is probably a legally hard wholesale estimate of Aardman's character, which is more than a generous spray of art from a variety of Pixar films, positively Lion King-esquire villagers who live in the amount of elephant graves at AGRICULTURAL COUNTRIES , oh and smelly riverhead joke ten years after potential importance. The children (three and five) liked it, but the boy, this was the father's animal. Just another weak test of Nickelodean Films to associate with an animation explosion. I really want them to spend a little more money on shaping the character, the scenario for the director.
