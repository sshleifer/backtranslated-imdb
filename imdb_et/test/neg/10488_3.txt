Okay, it's awful and I mean terribly, just pick out this movie. C'mmon, what are you waiting for in the title, summary and actors like Carol Gilley, Ralph Baker Jr, Dorothy Davis, Bill Thurman and my personal favorite Roger Ready. Yes, B-star John Agar is here a sheriff to get rid of the Texas landscape in a NASA attempt that has gone awry. The film has a terrible performance, terrible terrain, terrible special effect and terrible lighting. I really can't say much about this as bad movies that you could do much worse than finding something awful to sit down. It is satisfactorily short and has many moments of unwanted humor. Missed hints, traffic light illumination, screen off, incredibly ugly score, and of course John Agar, who is trying to be the best in the film's core with a serious presentation. At first, the hardest part is to sit, because it seems that these two teenagers will take forever to get their fire when they travel in the woods along Texas's rear roads, where a big monkey hides his revenge in his terrible way ... Yeah, of course! Night's Fear! Bah!
