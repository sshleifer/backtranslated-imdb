The actors are cute and the kits, though simple, are pretty OK. In addition, there is nothing to record about this movie. Incredibly bad, tears tears dialogues, too much waiting for the plot, lots of goats and contradictions (for example, a pretty young girl arrives from the star on the morning and not just to survive but barely empty!) ... To do this briefly because it doesn't not worth it, even genre fans can avoid it.
