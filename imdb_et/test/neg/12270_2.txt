While I was watching this movie myself (luckily), I still felt embarrassed while watching it. I was tricked by renting it by reviews in front of the cover, and bloody / sharp camera photos back â€” which led me to believe that it was a kind of documentary. These actors are ridiculous, not convincing at all. The story includes the Italian Australian (?) Gang, just fighting with other gangs and then running, fighting, repeating. Supposedly, they're training very hard, which makes them better than other gangs. For some reason, I do not believe that they could indeed have been some of the others who are twice as big. I can be wrong ... no, I'm not wrong, this movie is not enjoyable at all. The assembly of the prison looked like it was a summer camp, but instead of the children, it was a terrible sausage for the actors. looks out and laughs and tries hard to watch. This movie is not worth your time, save your money or throw it in the garbage, just don't waste this movie.
