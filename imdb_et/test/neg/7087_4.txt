I certainly saw this movie because it's a 1950s sci-fi movie - one of my favorite music. Unfortunately, when I was awaiting altruistic aliens or power-mad conquerors, foreigners were the main disappointment in this movie! First of all, you will only see quite briefly in the beginning (and he saw it quite common) and you also got a small look at the spacecraft! Secondly, the alien was neither a wicked conqueror of humanity nor a benevolent friend - but a real strange ball. Finally, the plot seemed so stupid, preaching and heavy-handed that it pulled more pitfalls than excitement. <br /> <br /> As the film begins, five people from five different parts of the world (Germany, Great Britain, Russia, China and USA) are abducted by an alien. An alien gives each of them the means by which they can destroy the life of the whole planet when they choose it - because the alien admits that HIS PEACE will love the earth, but they will not kill themselves to get it. Then he returns them all. While it is 100% obvious that no one would want to use these devices, an alien will report five identities on television without saying that weapons are RESULTS! So all the militarists in the world want to find them and force them to reveal how the weapons work. Much of the rest of the movie is made up of five hidden hiding and one torture to reveal how the device works - as the councils want to use it! This part of the movie seemed pretty stupid. Of course, the USSR was an evil and corrupt nation (sorry, but this is a fact - especially under Stalin), they would never have thought of using it like in the movie! Later, one in five (German scientists) thinks that the equipment can only be used to kill all RPL people who hate freedom. So he uses it to destroy all the evil candies and probably others who were anti-freedom and the world will become a paradise! Preachy, silly and full of holes in the plot - this film just isn't worth your time, though it's an interesting remnant just for how it deals with communism - especially tensions between NATO and the Soviets.
