The non-agricultural family is moving west. <br /> <br /> Walnut Grove's newest knightship is called Charles. He works in a mill, sawing a lot of lumber, but who in hell thinks he is cutting all the wood is a mystery, because none of the inhabitants in all the municipalities have enough money to buy cracking, much less than four. <br /> <br /> City Management is Olsons, a rich but stupid clan who moved to these parts to graze this dough when they sell eggs to eleven cents a dozen. They have two children, a boy, "Willie" and a girl "Nellie", with whom there is only one sustainable asset ... Nellie is hot and fun to spy on her when she is in an old bath <br /> <br /> The city preacher is also the village idiot, because he thinks he is really something special about the field of field trees, when in reality they are unable to keep their boredom sermons and the only thing they pray for because on Sunday is the closest rock to him as soon as possible falling off. <br /> <br /> A city doctor is a dinosaur who saw his better days about 20 years ago, but he hangs anyway so he can give free breast studies in old actions that live in the city. Unfortunately, the only time these ancient hot mamas are kneeled down is to pull the baked bread out to give Dok its services. But it is OK because he knows that these old wenches give good bread. <br /> <br /> The quest for this colorful cowboy collection is Charles's witty woman "Carolyn" and their three girls, "Mary, Carrie and Half-Pint. Mary is another hot chick that all boys laughing when she takes a shower or crap. Carrie is a tedious little boy, but he sticks a cookie in his mouth and you don't even know he's where he is? ... oh, he's there ... he's out in the yard with a pack of cigarettes ... how Lovely! Half-Pint is the youngest screwed in town. He may not have the brain or body to talk about, but he can spit beyond a boy's whole freaking school. <br /> <br /> This is a great city, Walnut Grove, where someone is always falling from the roof or riding a wagon, it is also beautiful, which consists of one building ... church / school-house / town hall / pool room. Ah, it gets a little hairy prairie, but that's okay, especially if Mary takes a crispy age ... this is when you see how hairy it really is.
