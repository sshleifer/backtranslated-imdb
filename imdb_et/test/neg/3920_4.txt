Cheaply made, poorly operated and unimaginably targeted flights to Mars are still fun, despite what it is against. The flight to Mars is planned for five men (three older gentlemen, Cameron Mitchell as a journalist and one female scientist / obvious interest in love) "manning the ship". The spacecraft arrives and finds that there are very human similar marches and technological advances that would turn the Earth into a blush, but not everyone is in the land of martyrs (here are some caves and some spaces). Mars are a dying planet, and one faction wants land forces to repair only the last minute of the ship and then mobilize to attack the Earth, and another group wants to talk about peace and see if they can convince Earth to give them a living space. with a slow-moving rocket ship, a pastel / neon foreign body, where women wear shorts that make a lot of blush (except of course men), and little less offered. Cameron Mitchell is a journalist and is positive if nothing else. ite Chapman is a very short short shorts but adds little action. The rest are filled with older sci-fi veterans such as Arthur Franz and Morris Ankrum, who are doing caring jobs. It is not a golden age sci-fi movie, which is no standard, but it is fast tracked and zippered.
