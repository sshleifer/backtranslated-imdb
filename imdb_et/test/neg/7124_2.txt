The original GRUDGE (original American remake) surprisingly pulled out everything that could be done with ghost lace. It was a dense, dark and moody atmosphere, some good guys and some really horrible pictures. GRUDGE 2 tries to try all of these methods, but ultimately fails, showing us the same old things we saw in the first movie, but also the dirty style that is constantly changing from Tokyo to California. It starts in Tokyo with some schoolgirls moving into the house and now blocked with one police tape. One of them comes from a face-to-face wide-eyed ghost with a girl who is stuck in the closet. He gets out, screams frantically and they all run out of it. Next, cut to America, where her mother sends Karen's sister to Japan to find and take her home. After all, we are a very familiar concept that involves a curious man and girl who is studying the mysterious history of the house. From the beginning we cut back girls who disappear one after another, as well as a young boy who listens to the rented sounds at the next apartment at night. "Scaring" scenes are boring and ineffective. Like Ring 2, avoid this terrible sequel to God ...
