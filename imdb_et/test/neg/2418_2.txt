Where to start? This movie is very entertaining, if you are a new regbit game, but if you live outside the USA and make this game, it is ridiculous. Various rugby traditions, such as "Haka", prepared by New Zealand's "All Black" and only all black. The head of Haka is usually a team member with the best Maori genealogy. It is one of the most important conventions of the modern game and has been misused and represented by the writer. The film itself is quite well targeted, but it is a weak scenario and an overall implementation that allows it to be down. Given that it is based on true creation, it has many tricks. I would strongly urge any US interested in rugby to watch this movie and see what rugby is actually on Youtube because the rugby depicted in this movie is distorted and skewed as far as it is.
