JP3 is missing from Spielberg's touch. It is an all-encompassing attack on the dinosaurs of "your face". Watching this movie was a bit like a skateboarder. <br /> <br /> The script is flat; it asks at the same time and leaves too many questions unanswered. Nor can we really appreciate the movie for all the people they're worth. For example, William H. Macy is too big a talent to compete with dino-thugs for our attention. And Laura Dern was particularly fond of JP1; in this movie he barely has a radar screen. <br /> <br /> The whole JP3 experience was hh. Too much noise, too many surprises, too many signs of death, too much predictability and free. Word to the wise: vote for this island. <br /> <br /> (I appreciated it for 3 special effects; I took the remaining 7 points because I had no originality.)
