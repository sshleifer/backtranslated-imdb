"The Chilling" led by Deland Nuse and Jack A.Sunser is one of the worst zombie cinemas I've ever seen. Why Linda Blair ("Exorcist", "Witchery") appeared in this stink beyond me. stupid: frozen laboratories have revived in a cryogenic laboratory after the emergence of mild strikes and become cannibalistic zombies. The characters are completely one-dimensional and fools, zombies look horrible and not gore. Avoid this cheap trash like plague. My rating: 1 out of 10.
