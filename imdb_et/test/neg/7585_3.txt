I picked this DVD out of Walep cheepo bin because the cover showed one plane I flew during Vietnam (C-123k). I didn't fly to Air America, but I knew it was a C-123 pilot, I knew a lot who did it, including those who flew back to my Reserve Unitis home. I'm not a filmmaker, but I don't know if directors and writers have made such films. The best part of this movie must go to the operator. Flying shots and stunts (though they are completely comic) are great. The film begins in 1969 with a favorite of Hollywood. But in fact, Nixon didn't start Air America, he didn't start the wrong. Johnson was responsible for Air America and Nixon was pretty wrong, War and Air America. This is not a fair or accurate depiction of Nixon as a liar on Air America. Every president has inherited the lies of his predecessors. No one is smart enough to fly with C-123, was stupid enough not to know what they were joining. This makes Downey's character incredible. C-123 was a tough plane. It can easily fly on one engine or two auxiliary power units. It is more likely that one of the shots is shot by a shot. The pilots flying with Air America were civilian CIA workers, they were not financial soldiers. They had a good reason to behave in the future and believe when they survived their extremely dangerous work. They were given twice as long as the old-age pension. They were not required to sell dope or weapons for a good pension. Dope was legal and lifestyle in SEA, as is the case in Afghanistan. When individual pilots tried to make money from the side, it was not a CIA policy. The CIA fought war against communism, not drugs. The writer relied on his story "Warfare". Pilots love the BS someone who buys beer and listens. A writer and director with an ax to grind Vietnam and Nixon. Watch the movie and remember how it begins - it accuses Nixon of what has been around for years. Remember that he did not become president until 20 January 1969. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is a mountain falling into the jungle. Air America pilots put planes in places where aircraft designers have never thought of. They were a lot of funny stories that could have been shown. Instead, the director decided to use a larger rubber scene to show how the CIA was stupid. This scene shows that the director and the writer fell into a pilot call and joke about them. <br /> <br /> MDS Fort Valley Virginia.
