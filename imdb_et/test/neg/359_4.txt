The golden-shouldered man (film) is Frank Sinatra's decent career tool, but he is unable to make a good adaptation of the abysmally fantastic book. You always hear how books have "changed" when they are made into movies - things are cut off, desolate, etc. story. The characters and the setting are just as confident, but not insecure, the depth of the Polish men and women in the book in Chicago. As for setup, it has only become a game phase that includes unnecessary "supporting role" players who walk too much on claustrophobic and inner exterior. The film is dumbed-down, a completely different Frankie Machine and drug addiction. When this happens, Zosh, Frankie, Sparrow lose all their psychological edge. Frankie's drumming, the humble dream of the book, becomes her complete film (probably because Sinatra is a musician). Drugs are treatable, exploitable. Action is decent, especially for snakelike Louie, who is more threatening than the book. But it's just a shame that such a movie can be considered a classic book, which is the "base" of Frankie Machine's actual story. The film just shows that Hollywood can "get something right without being down and happy." In this case, they changed it completely, the cheap Hollywood's fluffy, important and realistic story. I'm sure hell is biased because I first read the book so I can't treat the film honestly, knowing how good a book is. I was actually thinking of turning off the movie (and I'll never do it), so I didn't get my foolish plot mixed up with the beauty of the book. But this is an overvalued film, and although it is not so bad, the book should be the first as it was first. And it should have been the only story of Division Street and Frankie Machine.
