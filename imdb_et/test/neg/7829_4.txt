Olivier Assayas is filming Asia Argento as a woman with a relationship with Michael Madsen. Madsen is a businessman who is in financial trouble. He desperately goes to sell his part of the business from the Far East to Golden Eagle. When Madsen begins to move away from his company, Asia Argento returns to his life. The couple had a terrible love relationship involving his business with Madsen (with this Golden Eagle). When Argento enters the film, the film follows him when we see how he is woven and how the complications are dangerously and violently controlled. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan. In fact, I was quite bored because the film seems to be going from pillar to post in the first hour of most of the time I thought it was about to offer Argento an important role. Argento, directed by Dario Argento's daughter and director, is a unique actor. Sometimes it is stunningly good that he will not give you an inherently injured human being. Sometimes it works and sometimes it's not. I don't think it works perfectly, because the script is too complicated to support it. I don't care what's going on, so her wounded girl rubbed me wrong (she seemed more nutty than anything else). I do not blame the actors, but the writer / director Assayas, who has once again built up a complex story that some participants love to deal with, but that leave the audience scratching their heads because they don't really work. <br /> <br /> If you need to try it with a cable
