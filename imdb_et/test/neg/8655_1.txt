I'd give this movie 1/10. This film lacks the usual cinematic substance and focuses too much on the current skin trend of Bollywood films. I wouldn't recommend teenagers to watch this movie. What really makes me feel that this impressive banner like Yash Chopra Films can ever make such terrible production? They may have forgotten that they have to keep in mind that a larger audience than the "adult" audience that might be exposed to this kind of harsh films would destroy their growing mood and give up things that they don't know or feel. In general, movies must not only be entertaining, but also in some ways. Surely this film is a huge disappointment for Yash Chopra fans, especially for me myself. I'm really frustrated over the plot, act and everything else. Why can't people be exposed to any substance in films that can be captured in the film at least once? The point is clear. I'd like to say briefly: "Frightening - disappointing - lots of adult stuff - lack of a reasonable" substance "- lack of a normal psyche - worthless - could instead take Cornetto or Temptations chocolate"
