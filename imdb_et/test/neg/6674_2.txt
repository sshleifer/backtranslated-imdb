Okay, so maybe the behavior didn't work bad, but I am writing this review as a public service to prevent anyone who happens to be intrigued by this telephony to throw away two hours of their life, waiting for some plot development ever to come. The investigator has an intestinal feeling that made the missing seaman (Guy) and few people who are not involved bystanders and accused seem to be against him. What's the point of staying with this drama? Cries on my fuckin '. I thought (or hoped) that there would be some kind of twist on the plot or a new revelation, but none of them came. All in all, I cannot think of one reason why to sit and watch this meaningless TV movie based on a real story or not.
