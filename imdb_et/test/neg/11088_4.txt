It is difficult to write 10 lines of this film's dwarf. There's just nothing to say. Not memorable enough to add to your collection, and I have a significant number of knives. <br /> <br /> Paul Henreid is playing a tough guy here. He's not the one I would like to play, but he's happy with it. Anyway, he's a beautiful actor. <br /> <br /> Everything, including cinematography, is well-non-memorable. One thing that stood out: a sharp end. It was a surprise. It was also a surprise to see it under the heading "Hollow Triumph". I've never seen this movie before. This is always called "grace". <br /> <br /> If you read the "tight movie noise", then don't believe it. "Tense" is not the exact adjective of this movie.
