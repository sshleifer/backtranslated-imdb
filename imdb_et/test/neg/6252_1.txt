Okay. I admit it. I'm a big fan of b-movies. Back when Michelle Bauer, Linnea Quigley and Brinke Stevens reigned in rust. Then even the bad films were still good. Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just bad. Even a small Brinke Stevens firing point (which represents Linda's role as "Slumber Party Massacre" 21 years ago) does not help. A group of cheerleaders refuge in a fancy cabin after their van breaks down. The psychologist hides them one by one, trying to dress them in different countries. Bad script, bad direction and terrible action make it one of the bad! Leave this turkey and go to "Slumber Party Massacre". 1/2 *
