If you are a horny movie mammal and want to see something that you don't need to pay close attention to, it may be worth it. the story itself is very unreal. dialogue is also not very credible. it is doubtful that you will find yourself in any of these characters because none of them is very pleasant. the actor can be much worse. victoria pratt is remarkably away from the rest of the cast because it seems to have a lot of potential and talent as an actor. although it doesn't say much, it is one of the best shows I've seen in tori's spelling. he looks better with age. in general, this extremely melodramatic film is at best mediocre at best.
