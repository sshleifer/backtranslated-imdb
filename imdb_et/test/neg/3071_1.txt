who reads these comments may think we may have a great movie. I'm Portuguese, and I'm ashamed that this movie was blocked in Portugal. It can't really call this cinema. Direction and "mise-en-scene" are basic (even Ron Howard does it better!); the script is bad and pretentious (really bad Tarantino); The cast is covered with TV stars, models and reality shows that do nothing. When you put in the movie, of course, all such TV show fans will see. I'm also surprised that the people who comment here in IMDb say this movie is a masterpiece. I thought this site was only for people who really love cinema and understand it a bit. All films made for Portal always use the same ingredients and are always terrible. if you think this movie is reasonable, don't tell your loved movies and cinema.
