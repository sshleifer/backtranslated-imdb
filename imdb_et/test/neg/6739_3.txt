When you watch the Seagal movie, you are looking forward to good action. You're waiting for a fight, not just a lot of shooting like in this flick. And: You're waiting for a fairly simple story. OK, I can live with a more complicated story, though it's a Seagal movie. But that is, I don't know what to say. It's really very confusing. At the end of the movie, I had a lot of problems with what happened. And I know I'm not the only one. The story lacks so much information and it is so full of holes in the parcels that it is almost impossible to keep track of what's going on in the movie. There are many people in the movie, people are changing sides all the time and changing locations too often. Terrible. I just don't understand why Seagal seems to be doing a sort of sequel.
