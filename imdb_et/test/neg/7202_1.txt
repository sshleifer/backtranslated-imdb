This is almost a BASIC garbage I've ever suffered. The story was embarrassingly amateur, the graphics were terrible and the actor ... I've never seen in my life. A kindergarten class could develop a more frightening, better-written and more fun concept. I regret everyone who wastes their time on this film, as well as the participants who agreed to this work. It was obvious that they were not given the right direction. Writers must have spent some time in a film school in the "back room" who plays the scythe. Many professors wasted a lot of time on these two. I would be really embarrassed to admit that I knew them.
