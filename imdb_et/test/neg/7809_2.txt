Dreamy young Ashton Kutcher (like Tom Stansfield) wants a date with sexy blonde Tara Reid (like Lisa Taylor). Reid thinks that Mr. Kutcher is gay. Kutcher works for Reid's father, an anal retentive Terence Stamp (like Jack Taylor). Kutcher agrees to "housekeeping" the boss, believing that he will move closer to Reid. Mr. Stamp has a pet owl "O.J.", which will become a toilet. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that allows you to use only "G-rated" pre-teens ready for an "R-rated" ticket price. This will help if they have not seen the plot before and especially like moral potty humor. Remember that people are paid for this kind of activity. <br /> <br /> ** My Boss's Daughter (2003) David Zucker ~ Ashton Kutcher, Tara Reid, Terence Temple
