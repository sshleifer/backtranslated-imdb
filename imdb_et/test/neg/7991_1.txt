This movie is such a waste of time. I don't understand anyone sitting through this trash. Oh, I would have loved it when I was seven years old. I think a seven-year-old child has written and directed it. <br /> <br /> There is no script, no action, no garbage. The best thing to do is fight the roosters. I think I can whip these ninjas and I am not someone you would like to consider tough. Fully convincing and not least interested. I created and laughed at the end of the first ten minutes. This would make people away from martial arts. Great comedy, bad action.
