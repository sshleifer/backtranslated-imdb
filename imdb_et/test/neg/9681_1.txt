This film is a completely inaccurate picture of Noah's Ark story. Manufacturers probably did not read the Bible. This is the worst movie I've ever seen! Noah's wife's name was never mentioned in the Bible, but the film's writers named her Naamah. This film depicts the destruction of Sodom, which is good for 1000 years before it happened, and how is Gamorrah? It was also destroyed while Sodom was. (Perhaps the producers thought Gamorrah did not contain the story and show the city of "Sodom" as you know, which would raise the brow more. It is a miracle that every true Christian wants to participate in making this mocking, ugly, and replicated Bible mockery.
