Max Cash is a charterer who works on the Caribbean island of San Sebastian, has been recruited by Sarah, looking for a legendary boat, El Diablo and its stolen treasures that have sunk in the 17th century in a riff. But something seems to be protecting the position of the ship, because the people who knew about it will be killed. <br /> <br /> I have to agree with those who were under the impression that this is a horror feature. Instead of what we ended up, there was a small rent, a b-grade in the 80's 1977 deep sea adventure movie The Deep, but an injection of amazing supernatural origin and mystery. The story is a tedious confusion (so many contradictory angles make no sense of ceaselessness and encourage a dark tempo) and the technical side is dirty. Nice exotic location and underwater photography. Although the worrying performances were not too bad. Wayne Crawford is funny and in June Chadwick is just next to him. Sheri Able is pretty much eye candy. There are some strange developments that entertain and one or two aria. However, there is a real lack of cohesion. The majority of fatal deaths occur outside the screen, except for the bloody, horrible overture that something invisible does. Again, just another thing that leaves you high and dry. The music is common with its bouncing characters to warn us of the imminent threat and the POV shots get a good job. Tatty, but traceable.
