How to round off all the possible clichés and stereotypes that exist in the genre of horror, and then into one massively cumbersome film? Answer: "Camp Blood". It is an amateur made in a micro-budget and a bit too obviously inspired by "Friday 13". Four of the most intolerable teen characters you will ever see? are they like a ugly, stupid and tedious combination? go to the campsite and quickly find that the murder of a scam suffers. Don't even ask me if the killer's motivations were, or even who he was, because when it was in the movie, I was completely lost. This is one of the worst films ever made, without inspiration or craftsmanship. The production values ​​were so merciful that there are participants who play multiple roles without even disturbing them to recognize them. The only semi-precious and valuable sequel to the entire "Camp Blood" is the opening, where the impressive vigorous Meredith O'Brien sex in the woods with his geeky boyfriend. Yes, I am fully aware that this is very low, but again this is a minor and slow motion film, so who cares?
