For me, reviewing movies is an extension of my love for film and especially horror. The reviews so far have been on films I love, respect, and admire, and I am eager to receive them with prestigious honors and a top ten rating. A lifetime fan of horror, I have the enormous joy to share my thoughts and ideas with big horror movies, and I hope I have the hope of exposing people to movies they might not otherwise look for. I recently started reviewing IMDB films and my initial intention was to focus only on my personal favorites, exploring what I think is essential and a constant value for the horror genre. But films like "End Day" are okay on my side without the dust. Completely without any merit, it is the hodgepodge of the 1981 unfathomable ideas, a badly-acting and shameful cinema in every respect. In the short couple of years before and after the release, we saw that domestic (and Canada) films such as "Halloween II", "Prom Night", "Terror Train", "Madman", "My Bloody Valentine" appeared. "Prowler", "Just Before Dawn", "Final Exam", and "Hell Night", among other things, these films are of different quality but tried to achieve something in terms of story, drawing, showing, direction and general tone. , which appeared in Slasher Era during this rich season, would not be an original "Halloween" or "Friday 13" artistic value or commercial success, but these films were all well done and clearly contributed to the continuous development. was a high-level farce for a fugitive killer who led the high school team members, led by Herb Freed, who can only be expected to never try a horror again with such a travest. The task of creating costly horror movies is to leave those with true love and respect for the genre. failing at all possible levels, the least of which are terribly wooden performances, dime-special effects, irritating musical result and above all the story that does not even contain the slightest tension or tension. A nonsense exercise in wasting the "Day of Ending" movies is the ultimate shame on the horror movie.
