You saw this used DVD cheap and sent it to laugh. I recently found "The Octagon" on a DVD and bought it as a reminder, having seen it in the theater as a pre-teen and loving it at the time. The problem is now the return of American karate films that I've seen so many Hong Kong and Thai action films since then, where fighting scenes are long, fast and jaw. I am thinking especially of fighting at the end of Jackie and Benny's "The Jet" "Dragons Forever" or Tony Jaa's "Protector" of a circular staircase. The Hollywood kung-fu offers are not just "filmed" and even certified by someone like Chuck, occasionally uncomfortable. And what is worse than a fight that is moving slowly? Then you know that it seemed dirty at normal speed so they slowed its effect. It really proves how disgusting the ridiculous looks like they stand and just wait to get a chest attack. Compare it to your former co-star Bruce Lee, who had a burning sensation and attitude. When Bruce attacked some opponent (s), he could almost see that the surrounding air breaks with what was happening. In "Breaker, Breaker" Chuck seemed to accidentally kicking people, with complete nonchalance. When a judge looks at her in jail and condemns her to death, Chuck looks sad, and I thought "OK ... she's doing this" third eye "and starts picking up the cucumber and stepping out of it, but she's not doing anything other than look eye-catching, and terrible, and while the DVD bag gives you hope by listing one hour, 5 minutes driving time, it's actually 1 hour, 25 minutes, so it's 20 minutes more pain. <br /> <br / > For a great fight, press Jackie Chan in the first "Police Story" .... fight at the end of the mall is pure gold ......
