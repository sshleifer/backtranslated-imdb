ABC directs its repertoire company to unrealistic representation of another Australian rural area. Yes, people, it's all there Baca Bourke (Jeremy Sims, little talent actress) Firefighter, Flower (Libby Tanner plays Bronwyn Craigit bush), Fifi (Nadia Townsend) city bitch, Baca brother Joe preggers (I think). Then Uncle Geoff, the great father of the lost springs. Uncle Geoff's scenes are like Tennessee Williams at speed. Only the scarred arm is Russian actress Natalia Novikova as Baca loony missus. He's great. I don't understand why John Waters took someone to Lilly's psychologist spouse. You have to have the money I need! However, it won't take long for Lill and Baca to match this costume. Just look at this lemon to see how bad the Aussie exhibition might be. Frankly, I am ashamed.
