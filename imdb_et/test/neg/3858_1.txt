The famous short story of a man who becomes a prey of a safari hunter who has lost interest in hunting anything other than humans. It's pretty good, and it's been done on film and television many times and done again. Some of them are remarkable, but this urbanized version that injects tired old racism issues just stinks. The Leguizamo stroke is almost as weak as an unpleasant script. Chaplin, this guy's not. There must be people who find a dwarf who can't stop dancing funny, I think I think it's funny in a pathetic way, but it's just not enough to wear a movie. You have a normal Nazi keeper or neo-Nazi no matter what we should think about, a type of villain who is naturally gay, German accents ... get a picture?
