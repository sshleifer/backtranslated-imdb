I just wanted to comment because it isn't listening here, but I just saw the movie I just rented out in 2005 as far as I know and was actually called "Don't go to the attic." I just realized it was the same movie as Devils Harvest, when I was looking for filmmakers who saw the movie. Anyway I am in Ireland, so maybe it has just appeared here and in the UK, but that's what he's calling here .......... he doesn't like this Only Words, that thinks it is CHEESE CHEESE CHEES !! My one character in ten is just one little bit for a nervous bit: o)
