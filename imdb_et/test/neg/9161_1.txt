I'm surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie. Even my 4 and 6 year olds were bored. Helmets are cute ... but the story is too obvious. Not recommended for young people with the least-developed taste. <br /> <br /> We heard some laugh at the audience when we were present; but i was wondering why. <br /> <br /> I do not admit that I am a fan of "chips", but I expected it to be entertaining. It's not even an "escapist" movie as much as possible. Just a difficult hand for "success too young". We've seen more than enough about Britney Spears and more, are we not? <br /> <br /> Don't worry.
