This is a terrible film that is barely recognizable from the book, even though it has similar plots. The time it takes to watch this movie (which is only 1.5 hours) would be much better to spend something else, including watching the grass. Adding poorly made fantasy scenes makes Catherine stupidly unknown. An actor who plays Catherine also gets to the whole good and looks surprised even if she should look lovingly at her Tilney's eye. Honestly! The movie ends with Catherine's fantasy-like scene, where you can't help but know if it has happened or is just a mistake and not a good way to make you think, but in a totally terrible way that brings together a terrible movie. The only good thing about the movie is the title written by Ms. Austen himself. I generally love BBC productions, but it's terrible.
