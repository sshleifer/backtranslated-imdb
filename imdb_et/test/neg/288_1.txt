QUESTION: How does a movie represent two different titles, such as "Librarians" and "Strike Force"? ANSWER: The film is so bad that the filmmakers couldn't even decide on the title !!!! <br /> <br /> This movie is a hodgepodge of martial arts, death prospects, melodrama, romance, and other clich√©s. The story focuses on a vigilant group called librarians led by agent Simon (WIlliam Forsythe). The group is hot, striving for a frightening, multilingual, labeled creature, called Marcos (Andrew Divoff), who captures women and keeps them hostage to the illegal city of South Florida. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds appears in this movie from the pulpit, and his scene is completely off the beaten track. Burt offers a long monologue of any strange twitches I've ever heard. It may have been the Irish Burt attempt, but the overall effect is a sort of perverted Marlon Brando impression "The Godfather". <br /> <br /> This movie also features Erika Eleniak, who has invaded Marcos' bizarre world. Erika's character puts her line with Simon. Librarians and Erika will get a powerful strike force against evil in a movie delivered directly from the editing room to your cable TV converter box.
