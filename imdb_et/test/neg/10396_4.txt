Documentaries about fans are always wrong and they are never worth seeing, but I found what some fans did themselves more than usual without lighting. As a veteran of the original Tolkin madness, forty years ago, I was hoping more than obvious - which is not always true. If someone lives who doesn't already know the fandom, the nature of any fandom who knows or doesn't know the fan, he won't find it here. I can read a few special complaints about the unreliability, the spread (the films that actors are particularly prone to) and the action (fans who do the most - if not the best) - of their fame. The special emotional reactions of the LOTR and the special creative forms of these responses. In addition, the film is quite lazy: it pushes some of the facts that could have been tense, for example. what was the exact legal loophole (the wording of the copyright notice), which allowed unauthorized publication of books in the US (Speaking of it: I take a strong exception to the fact that the cover of this publication is "insignificant" and "psychedelic", "which they were not. very capable sf illustrator Jack Gaughan's work and some fans, including me, found them more suitable and attractive than the covers of the competition.)
