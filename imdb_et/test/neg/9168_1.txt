Hell angels came out of the losers of this movie. Sonny told the director that it MUST not be done with corners and escaped. His version was the two dudes that had to be shot dead, but his proposal was ignored. They were bowed to even appear, much less of the "technical advisers" of such a movie in a stink bomb. Hell angles on JAP bikes? C'mon! (although in Sonny's autobiography he says, "F $ # K Harley Davidson!" and that if they were smart, they would drive to Hondas. (ST1100) Read his car ... he's in HATES Harleys. angels whisper the city with their sewing machine, which sounds like Jap bikes, not too scary, they would laugh out of town.
