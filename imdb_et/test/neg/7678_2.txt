This film is sometimes scary, maybe no more than naked George Kennedy tells his prostitution girlfriend that he wants some more sugar. Fortunately, his nakedness is covered with a coating, but the picture is still more terrible than anything you probably find on the Schindler list. <br /> <br /> This movie's dialogue was inspiring; it inspired me to watch another movie. In one scene, when a stewardess marks men as pilots, Kennedy asks, "Why do you think it is called" cock "? Charming. <br /> <br /> And contrary to what some have written, this movie is very, very bad .
