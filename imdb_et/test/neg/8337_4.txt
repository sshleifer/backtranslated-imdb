The destructive lush due to the cracking of the stage from the La Brea tar mine in Los Angeles. Even if you try to stop the unbelief by ignoring this ridiculous assumption, you still have a ridiculous man in dialogue, meaningless graphic conferences and wildly careless scientific plots that parade the screen. <br /> <br /> I have a theory: every successful actor is assigned to a career at some point in at least one bad film. It was Tommy Lee's move. Although he does a decent effort, the script is just so pathetic that he also falls in the flames (oops, sorry for that). Most supportive pains also prevent hackneyed writing; some actors just phone their roles. Anne Heche deserves special Hall of Shame recognition for the uncomfortable portrayal of the scientist. He is in such a role as Pee Wee Herman so convincing and even if he had at least done a better job. <br /> <br /> Because there are too many holes in the scientific plot here, I recommend that you film with friends and play the game "Find scientific absurds". Losser could be forced to listen to a movie like "Everybody Looks The Same", tapes over and over again. Here is an example of what pointlessness can be expected: the building explosion scheme has been developed, constructed and dynamically set up and exploded in about 20 minutes. Let us not forget the obligatory clich√©s of catastrophic eyes: divorced fathers, scientists, all ignored, unpleasant policemen, harsh street children, dirty teenagers, greedy investors, etc .; everything is present and numerous. The film also worships you with a smooth barrier to political correctness. <br /> <br /> Only for fans of cheese and stupidity. All other viewers: be careful.
