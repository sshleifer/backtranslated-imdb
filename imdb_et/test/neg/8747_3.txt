Jessica is a young, virgin and very innocent girl who lives with her aunt far from the ranch. Jessica is also a powerful psychic who is able to walk, learn, know and esp. When the young and beautiful Gordon Hawthorne comes to visit, he is immediately skeptical of Jessica's powers ... until his skills discover the lost watch and discover the old treasure box. However, the treasure chest holds the centuries-old satanist named Gideon Drew, whose powers are much stronger than Jessica. Despite his warnings of evil in the middle of them, Drew will all regrettably be enslaved to face him. But Drew wants Jessica the most. He needs his dowsing skills to discover his body so that he can rise from the dead and rule over humanity. Does Jessica's powerful fleur de lis, with Gordon's love, prevent old evil before it destroys them all? <br /> <br /> This is not a very interesting movie. Certainly it could have been - the main story is interesting and imaginative, but acting is leading and the whole thing is moving too slowly to keep the interests. Jessica is also too innocent - almost resentment, and Gordon, his love interest, is wood, rigid and completely emotional. No character is very pleasant and a small budget is painfully obvious. The quick end also doesn't help things. Avoid if it is not MST3K.
