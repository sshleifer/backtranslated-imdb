Like one of those loud films. The whole cast seems to be at speed. I didn't get any director's intentions at all. I don't know if he's ever seen Stanley Donen, Vincent Minnell, or even George Sidney's music. Structure, please! This is one mess and I loved Abbat. Costumes that represent unstable photography - act for actors, but love places for places - One thing that makes things all satisfactory is the vision of Meryl Streep, which makes you stupid. No chemistry with her friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) thinks Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the Altman movie and you understand what I was hoping for. I was particularly embarrassed by Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth. However, the audience seemed to enjoy it, so it's probably me.
