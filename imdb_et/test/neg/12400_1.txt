Dire doesn't believe. It's obviously set on the Isle of Man, which disguises like the US - very badly - and full of British actors who can't make American accents. Monster, which looks like advertising materials for strangers at the Alien movie shop, with the stiffest legs ever seen. Girls in the shower, undressed, bullying, blah, blah, blah. You get the idea. Don't look at it, run away, hide, open.
