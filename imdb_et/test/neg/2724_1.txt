Am I the only one who notices that the "realism" of the 19th century ship is wrong. In fact, in the 15th century, about 1620, when the memory serves me, because the "realistic" ship is Mayflower, now as far as I know, Mayflower never came to Australia or even tried to travel to Australia. I don't know who's dealing with research and development in this movie, but using Mayflower and hoping that no one can see that it's a bad job. <br /> <br /> They even printed it on cover art and DVD. I don't know how other people might notice this little threat? Not to mention the fact that the film itself was just terrible, I'd have been waiting for Sam from the guys.
