I think many people who have acted on this matter must come and appreciate it because I'm telling you it's just terrible. The performance is worse than the soapopera bad, the effect is like something you would see from the 1970s episode of the doctoral thesis, the story is, well, no story. And they use the same and 2-minute song over and over again. And the werewolf? It's like a muppet they used in Wing Commander, giants, remembering how bad they saw? The werewolf is so bad. Seriously, the man who drove this thing is terrible and should never be redirected, except maybe his son's school game, but even then he should pay it to the viewer. Ghostwolf is nothing but a bad joke.
