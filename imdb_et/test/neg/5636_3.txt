I didn't know anything about this DVD when I hired it. There was a quick look at the comments, but decided to keep an open mind. Probably an independent film and a low budget, but it doesn't worry me. I look at something with Derick Jacob and as he always played his part well. Damage that no one else did. A few weeks ago, I looked at "reconciliation" with Vanessa Redgrave and she was sublime. In that he just looked up to read the lines. I think the main mistake was casting Vinnie Jones. Frankly, I saw his picture on the cover of the DVD, but did not notice that he got the best bills. A sticker was strategically placed on his name! It was traceable and I liked the story of Dickens next to today. Perhaps, with a more capable actor who plays the lead, it could have worked better. However, it was weak.
