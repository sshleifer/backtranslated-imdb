I saw this movie when he first came to theaters in 1988, and although I knew it wasn't an award winning caliber ... I thought it was. It tells the story of the 5 former cub scouts that are reunited to accept one task that they could not end up as children - which climbs Mt. Whitehead. Of course, the horse scouts have now grown up and developed their personality in many different ways, but not in any other way than the children. Richard Lewis is still neurotic, Richard Belzer is still playboy, Franklyn Ajaye is still a dear Abby of the band, and Tim Thomerson is still a group surf. Of course, the top-notch star is Louie Anderson, the "true believer" in all Cub Scouts. He still lives with his mother in the same house, is still over the Cub Scout Handbook, is brave, respectful and clean, and he unites others for another great adventure in Scoutim. The combination of these tasks, however, is Grunski's brothers, two crowds who have been dropped out of the above-mentioned Cub Scouts. By coincidence, they get into their old den and decide to harass them a little, though harmlessly. Not so safe are the three escaped convicts who think Pack 7 is from the FBI and are going to wipe them out. All in all, the film still has a charm. Watch Richard Lew, who tries to put him in a comfortable bed, for example, and you really have a little fun. For an additional review, the whole film needed more humor than this type of observation. It will not last well after all these years, but will still be guilty of joy.
