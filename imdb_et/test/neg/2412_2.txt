The only thing about this film is the work on the poster of R. R. Geiger. The anti-nucleus protesters, who all saw punk-rippers in the late 1970s, but somehow became non-violent (except for their leader, "Splatter"), occupy cities. Brotherhood boys descend into the bunkers to make them violent and make them victims. A bad acting and bad plot then falls on the true victim, you, the viewer. I gave it "2" because some sexual scenes give at least MST3K potential. <br /> <br />
