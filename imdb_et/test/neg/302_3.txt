The Secret Life begins with the worst possible narrative introduction: "The crimes committed by Jeffrey Dahmer are too harsh to record ...". Okay, what do you suggest? Should we still not struggle, because the film is still not accurate or bloody? And they were right! The film is not at least a little shocking and contains almost no blood or gore. Although I think this is mainly due to the low budget, not to the dreadfulness of Dahmer's crimes. Basically, "The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer" is just one sequence that is repeated over and over again. Young, pathetic and mentally confused Jeffrey picks up the victims (always men when he was homosexual), kills them and tells him how he's not going to hurt them and how lonely he is. It gets boring really fast and even the unknown actor Carl Crew's admirable power can't bring this movie together. However, this version is much better than the fictitious and hopelessly confused "Dahmer" published in 2002.
