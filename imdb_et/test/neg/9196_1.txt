It's a bad and bad film. Full of cliches, unrealistic moments: Beating at the party after the fire is turned off, do not forget that someone has lost their home and property! the roof of the burning building for no apparent reason, stereotypical funeral and tense relationships, fun, fun at the end of the music, unrealistic treatment of the girl rescued by her apartment, a very unreal explosion in the same apartment! ! Have a couple of oxygen tanks in the attic or something !! Anyone with an ounce sees this movie as a joke. It is a pity, because firefighters do awesome work and they deserve a good movie about what they do, but not at the expense of common sense.
