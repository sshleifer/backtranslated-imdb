I bought this movie from a DVD despite a "stale" review and it was idiotic ... This review was absolutely accurate and I've never seen any worse "erotic" movie in a long life! Even though it was partly a lovely filmed and interesting surroundings, plus a nice cover ... But my own Extreme Erotica (c) films are more than 100 times more erotic (just with a soft taste), probably less than 100 times this movie budget! The story is not a logical link to the first movie or the famous book ... Or any new (exciting) slave education element, except for some very strange and sad developments ... Then the main male - Klaus Kinski - didn't look a little like "O" The master he's trying to play ... And not even the lovely Arielle Dombas, every scene seemed delicious!
