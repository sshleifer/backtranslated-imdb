As Ben Elton once pointed out, nothing goes from style to comedy. Steve Martin's latest offer - "The Pink Panther 2" - was recently opened to bad reviews and rogue, while Mike Myers' 'The Love Guru' seems to have won little admirers. <br /> <br /> In 1970 It was Jerry Lewis's move to feel the pain of rejection (ironically, his character in this movie is a funny occasion when someone uses that word in his presence) as "What's the way ahead? he has been driving effectively from the big screen for almost ten years. <br /> <br /> In this Second World War comedy, he plays the world's richest people, Brendan Byers 111, who wants to join the army. his patriotic duty (and also because he is bored to be successful) but has been rejected because he is medically unsuitable. He then decides to start his own private-funded army by recruiting other 4-Fs. <br /> <br /> There are ridiculous uniforms that look like "Rescue" by "Thunderbirds". Here are some good visual gags. When they come to rocket launchers, they will see themselves satisfied until they learn to destroy the Texaco station! Wishing to learn German, Brendan plays a long playing disc called "Songs Mein Kampf By". When this army is sitting, instead of staying in a spicy mess room, they are in a luxurious room covered with a chandelier. <br /> <br /> John Wood is very funny as Finkel, Byers' ever - Also an English butcher. His best scene is a Mafia-type gangster who teaches the Byers brigade to kill. <br /> <br /> The script was not Jerry himself, but Gerald Gardiner and Dee Caruso, author of several episodes. "Monkeys". "Front" is often the look and feel of a television, although you sometimes expect almost a laugh. <br /> <br /> If it goes bad, over the last 30 minutes, when Byers replaces the Nazi Commander, and after the retaliation of the Germans, Hitler will take part in the plot (and Tom Cruise is nowhere in sight!). As a commander, Jerry presents such a playful intuition to omit the description. He gives Brian Blessed a run for his money to "steal in human life" contributions. This is the relief when the final credits appear. <br /> <br /> Maybe the timing was just wrong - announcing war comedy when the Vietnam conflict was scared was not a good idea. Or the public just had enough Jerry (this beard probably didn't help!). What he needed was a good producer, someone who picked him up, and say, "That stink smells. Throw it out!". "Don't lift the bridge, the lower river" is a masterpiece compared to this picture. <br /> <br /> As in the early 1970s, the new comedy icons, Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, and Monty Python, were fresher, bite and, in Allen's case, Jerry replaced slapstick with more human comedies. It wasn't until 1982. He wouldn't have done something like a successful return - as a conceivable talk show host at Jerry Langford's brilliant "Comedy King" at Martin Scorcese.
