I was expecting this early copy of this early Almodovar film with great expectation - Almodovar is a fruitful contemporary director, I enjoyed my 1988 film "The Border of Nerve" and I had read one or two very positive reviews of the film. Well, I had to completely forget the humor the reviewers saw in this movie. I found it just uneven, tasteless and boring. Yes, there are a lot of enthusiasts, dragging people and sexual situations, and yes, these elements might have been shocked by the audience in 1982 (which was almost certainly Almodovar's intention), but most of the value of the shock has probably diminished over the years. In addition, the whole movie seemed very chaotic, no character was particularly sympathetic and "comedy" - even in the dark - I just couldn't find this movie funny. I think it is possible that such a movie has a wide audience, but I'm not just a part of this audience and I'm not sure I want to be.
