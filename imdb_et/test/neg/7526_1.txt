H.G. Wells spinning. There's no doubt about that. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it would have been a decent sci-fi / adventure movie if it wasn't based on the classic novel and the author's granddaughter. I heard it be the final version of the novel. The result was pathetic and easier bastardization. <br /> <br /> The novel is a great sci-fi story, but what many people don't read when they read it (probably because they read it very young) is that it's full of social comments. Eloi and Morlocks are satire of the Victorian England class isolation, and the overall message of the film is that ALL HIGH AND DEGENERATES, the satirical prison of Victorian, are satisfied and their belief that their civilization will last forever. There is no love story, the novel is not beautiful Eloi woman .... in the novel is Eloi's 3-foot childish creature whose mental capacity is not beyond the animal. Time Traveler interacts with Eloi's wife, but it is clear she thinks she is a pet, and still kills her before the end of the novel. <br /> <br /> This movie first tries to give a completely silly background to "why it wants to travel over time." Treacly's romance and the lessons she needs to learn are enough to make the movie fans vomit. Okay, not bad, but it would have been more than we could have seen that humanity generally degenerates, as in the book. More reflections of the times I think, as George Pal's version had a nuclear war. <br /> <br /> General story? Ugh. The complete novelty of the novel. Eloi is too competent and military. Morlocks are too intelligent. UberMorlock is embarrassing and has no setup. He just appears in time to kill him. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba does it well. Guy Pearce is one of my favorites, but he often seems confused and painful. (He said he broke the rib rib.) He also looks unhealthy and too thin as if he had been sick for a long time before he did. <br /> <br /> A sad, unfortunate version of the world classic. Mr G. Wells deserves a better .... much better. <br /> <br />
