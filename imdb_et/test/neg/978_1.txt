I was looking at "Deadly Voyage" because David Suchet was here after enjoying the "Poirot" series. And Jossi Ackland is always worth it, so I went to the movie, assuming it is a potentially useful film. Unfortunately, it didn't have to be. <br /> <br /> I do not care about criticizing film performances, tempo, cinematography, or any other structure; others have already given their opinion on these elements. The only thing I want to deal with is the film's message because it announces in the introduction that it is based on a real story and that the supposed importance of the film hangs there. impoverished black man named Kingsley, who wants to move to the US because he believes he can make money there. Something more, not less - his motivation is totally selfish. (Of course, some people are saying, saying he does it for his family, but in fact he decided to get the children from the income earned in Ghana, so he really just made his own problem.) For that, Kingsley decides to deviate on a New York-bound Russian merchant ship. In doing so, she faces difficult conditions, racist team members and other challenges. <br /> <br /> This is where the film leaves me unreasonable. Why should the audience listen to Kingsley? Just because he has a goal? The goals are not so rare items that should be a priority for him, the goal of the captain of the ship or the woman he left at his newborn child. Kingsley's goal is illegal in the US government's view. It is also illegal for him to steal a Russian shipping company. If he puts it into the US, it would mean withdrawing a system that he has not taken into use. And if he gets stuck, the shipping company will be fined $ 45,000. I very much doubt that any bystander will take care of what they have chosen to pay for someone else; they are obviously for their own benefit. She could have spent the $ 1,000 winning prize at the beginning of the lottery, getting a legal passage to the US, and applying for a residence permit and work permit. Instead, it takes an illegal (and dangerous) route. <br /> <br /> Since Kingsley's journey is illegal, selfish and cannot be ethically justified, why should we care about him or her? Just because he is facing challenges? Why should his challenges be preferred to the challenge of a Russian shipping company in New York without tickets? Because he's black and the shipping company is white? The reason seems to be because Danny Glover (the film's leading producer) and other actors want us to root for Kingsley, as if he were a hero on some sort of noble journey. But if you agree that illegal immigration, theft and the mission of fools are not at all noble, you cannot really care for it. <br /> <br /> Before anyone plays a competition card, I assure you that I feel the same, no matter what ethnicity / citizenship the participants were. Imagine if a British man decided to deviate from a Bhutan train, sneak across the border and collect "unwanted" Buddhist antiquities to bring back to Britain. How much sympathy does the challenges face? Very little, I bet. Why should we feel different for Kingley? Because he's black? Because he's bad for American standards? Filmmakers bank us to share our view that the goals justify the funds, and that a shipping company with a fine of $ 45,000 is irrelevant compared to the distance learning option that an unskilled workforce in the US will earn a little more than it could have if it had just lived home country. I didn't buy it for a minute.
