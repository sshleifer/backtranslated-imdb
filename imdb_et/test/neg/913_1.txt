people, get a clue! I mean, writers don't have any, so I'm looking forward to you ... this exhibition is GREAT when the light imitation shown in '60 shows you laugh! and the exhibition of the sixties is one that has cheap special effects, and it's a must-have-chrissakes! Still, the mood and writing of old exhibitions is in front of MILES. Get HiP Kids! if 98 degrees or Brittany said you were watching it, it would be! You know it! Just bypass them and tell all your friends that you were 'with the scene' before it got too cool!
