Where do I start with this movie? I know it's a mess. Be a script, story or actors. First of all, this film is a very disappointing Salman Khan who gave us the fun of Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge and Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega before that. The second Rani is really annoying, appearing in every stupid movie from Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (happy Saathiya stopped this mess). The story is stolen from The Wedding Singer but destroys a funny movie. No dialogues. Maybe I'm laughing here and there, but entertaining? NO !!! Salman Khan was acceptable in the above films, but here he is crazy. His character is poorly written. One minute he's poor and next time you don't know how he's poor. Rani Mukherjee looks like a regular jain and didn't catch it. He managed to redeem his career with Saathiya because his career progressed during that time. Pooja Batra made a little charm here, but it is still not enough. Jackie Shroff is wasted. The beauty and behavior of Kashmir Shah has been away from her because she chose such a terrible script. Raveena Tandon looks beautiful but gives little results. Mohnish Behl gets the prize for the worst (supportive) actor (they need Razzie because there have been terrible movies in India). He says that stupid dialogues, dances terribly, seem strange and not in his usual form. Just to tell you is more cast, who is also terrible. If it wasn't Raveena's awesome beauty in Aa Meri's life, Bana De, I won't give a movie. Otherwise, Salman's dancing was terrible. Pooja Batra danced in Savarja as a wind, otherwise I would like the costumes to be handed over and the rest (and the dancing of these monkeys) to be blown out of the wind. The album's good song was O Priya O Priya, which doesn't have a good enough picture. The same applies to a half-decent title song. Otherwise, this movie (and the rest of the songs) is not for everyone.
