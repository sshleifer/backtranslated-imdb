I've seen many movies of my time and it really stands out as the absolute worst film ever made in the history of filmmaking around the world. It took 3 effort to watch this movie. For the first time, I drank after 15 minutes of boredom because I was already tired because it was late at night. The other effort I managed to get through in 35 minutes found me sleeping again. I can go on and on, but I think you get a point ...... nothing in this movie happens. Complete waste of time and money. This movie really sucks. Look at this and you know what I'm talking about. If you get 40 minutes into this movie without shaking your head and wondering what the hell is all about, you're really masochist. The only reason I gave this movie is one of 10 because 0 was not offered as an option. I was just thinking that the world should be warned before being either recruited or worse ... buying it in the trash. Later!
