The first 20 minutes were a little fun because I don't think I've seen a movie before {action, script, effects (!), Etc ...}. all the clich√©s used in the dialogue used no effect. These people did not know the horror films or their making or any other film. There is no adult language, a bit of nudity, and no gore, except for the counterfeit, is open to open wounds, and so on. It would have been rated PG in the early eighties and PG-13 today. I'm not sure how he got an R rating or if it actually did. I saw America's international release called "Hospital of Terrorism". I've seen 100 horror movies in the last 12 months and this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Here's an example of how bad it is: There is one scene where something goes green. I'm not sure what it should be, but what's on the screen are some of the baby's green ballpoint pens that the {movie does not cross} over the movie that is moving halfway through the door, it should do something I think sister Sherri owns him. I couldn't believe they had no pride to show this embarrassment.
