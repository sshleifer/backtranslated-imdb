This movie does this in cgi, which means sci-fi, which they actually did more than the original 'BATS' is better. in this movie are simple people running from mutated killer bats. and really bats in Afghanistan?! There are so-called army soldiers on the plot who find the terrorist and who attack the bats and die <_ <but the reason why I gave this 3 stars is that the camera zooms in on the soldiers. it is bad and it doesn't even look like a horror movie. all this movie is a pretty good TV movie on sci-fi. but if you like this movie like sci-fi movies, because just like channel 43 oh and if you don't fall asleep during the movie, you won't be surprised. oh sorry, i think i'll give it 2 stars instead.
