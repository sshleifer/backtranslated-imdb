In no way does this documentary about Miles contain very little music and no perfect music. Although Miles appears on the film, 95% of the interviews are made by other people, not Miles. There are big chronological gaps, many aspects of his life (his childhood, drug addiction) are skipped or slipping, and you know little about what made man and his contribution to music so groundbreaking. Skip it.
