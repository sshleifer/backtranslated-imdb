Well, if you ignore the fact that this movie is characterized by exhausting behavior; and if you ignore the fact that the story is confusing and travels in about five different directions without ever deciding how it really wants to go; and ignoring the fact that I didn't find any scene in this movie that was far from interesting; Well, if you put everything aside, it's still a terrible movie! <br /> <br /> I think it should be a love story rich man / poor girl. I never thought for a moment how this romance ever started between Kelley (Chris Klein) and Samantha (Leelee Sobieski). The unexplained romance is exacerbated by the lack of complete chemistry of Klein and Sobieski. The scenario (by Michael Seitzman) is boring to amazing. How Seitzman managed to get things without sleep is a miracle; that he thinks someone would want to see it as unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that this is really a terrible movie? <br /> <br /> I would give it to NULL, but IMDb doesn't give ZERO votes. So I give it one, keeping my nose.
