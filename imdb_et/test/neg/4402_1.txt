It's like a school video project and a propaganda film that puts both the class and the teacher in bed. <br /> <br /> Totally boring long silent (yes, silent) related video clips. Instead of watching this movie, look at the color to dry or the grass grows - it's more interesting if you don't want to see the Arabs being malicious about them all. <br /> <br /> Sulieman (director) should be the embarrassing waste of the movie. <br /> <br /> It deserves the quality of the film, the nasty ridiculous message of propaganda and the negative number for the script (or its absence).
