For Sci-fans it is better than anything that works on television at any time; it's about the best you can say about it. Good points; repartee and sense of humor are less boring than usual in such films, the plot is cohesive and does not use magical mystical revelations. Bad points; Writers are trying to do good science, but it falls into direction and production (for example, a rock drilling mole that uses overheated stone drilling equipment, breaks the surface with water, a bubble, or a boiler to see), characters are clich√©s and plot formation is a pretty stock standard. OK too tired-to-do-something-other type of evening; but don't wait for any major construction or even talk.
