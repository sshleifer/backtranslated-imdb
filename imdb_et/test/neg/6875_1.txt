In this movie, everything was wrong and I don't know why I bothered it until the end. It would have been more fun to look at the paint dry. I even called D-Tox out loud and it was much better. Here's a basic piece for you: Redneck gets bites against bites that keep 13 murderers miserable and become a Undead killing machine that kills teenagers with zero. During the movie I lost hope if it didn't scare me at all when the killings were bad and there was BAD CGI blood and CGI snakes. It worsened with the thin letters of the cardboard, killing his friend, holding him on his feet and not letting go, so he got attacked by wood and how bad the boy was like a jaw shark. I'm still upset about why I even bothered. I think I'm a fan of horror.
