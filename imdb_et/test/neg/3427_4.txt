I just caught a "goodbye king" cable and maybe it's just because I'm a girl, but I thought it was on the craptical side. The script and the direction are pretentious (when I discovered that John Milius was responsible, everything became clear). Supporters were not really bad - James Fox was outstanding. The biggest disappointment was Nick Nolte, whom I usually enjoy. When he goes to his native language, he starts speaking very rigid, inclined English, and half of the time he seems confused as if he had smoked some of the Borneo rainforests. And then the end - what ??? Learoyd just happens to be in the same boat as the botanist (by the way, is the botanist throwing the bride with a girlfriend or?) ??? The boat just happens to travel comfortably near the mature takeover of the Anglo ex-headhunting army desert island?
