It is hard to believe that oprah winfrey produced this piece of spam, the show was not even able to keep the candle from cooking in the past, including the emerald chunk, rachael ray is the most disturbing show-show and cooking show in TV history, not because ainsley harriot has had terrible cooking figures watched, at least ainsley harriot has some good moments and style, it is not at all style, he is terrible as a host, the kitchen looks scary, writing is terrible, writing is terrible, teleplay is up and opening credits are so bad, it makes me sick. Now I enjoy cooking shows that had a cool style, but that is absolutely nothing like that. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst TVs of the year.
