I got this movie pack called "50 Adult Movies" for $ 18 (45 cents). Many are good. It was terrible. It was hackneyed retread made 1000 times before and every time better. Disappointed ex-jock dares to train a team of juvenile offenders. They learn from him that they can do it when they play with the rules. I'm sure kids and locals were happy to be involved in a "real TV movie", but I can't imagine what the people who started and did this project thought they would already get over the beaten subject. I was looking forward to seeing the "new twist" or "new angle", but to be honest, it doesn't come. Avoid this movie. Forget 45 cents, I want a 96-minute life back.
