EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE throws back to Disney Pictures, but this time Kronk is the focus of attention (expressed by Patrick Warburton), who is no longer a Yzma (Eartha Kitt). Kronk has started a new life and is very pleased with the chef of his own restaurant. Things will happily pass by until Kronk gets the word that his priest (John Mahoney) is coming to visit. Kronk is concerned because he knows that his life is not affected by his priest. One thing he always wanted and never received is his father's "thumbs". Bursting and a huge explosion of cheese in the restaurant leaves our pleasant hero very deep in trouble and anxiety. To save the day, little help from his friends. <br /> <br /> Other votes: Tracey Ullman, David Spade, John Goodman, Wendie Malick, Winchell April and Gatlin Green.
