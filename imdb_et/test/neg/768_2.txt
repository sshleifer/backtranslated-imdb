Tom & Jerry visit Africa and hide themselves in Amos-n-Andy fashion. They even act and speak in a different way, with a very poor standard of degrading grammar associated with a black stereotypical image depicted in many era comics. Apart from offensive images, this comic is not very good. Why did they go to Africa? Probably just to give the audience another cannibalistic image of Amos-n-Andy and additionally over-induced Afghans. The only reason it got one instead of one was a decent few seconds that covered eight octopus. <br /> <br /> One value is worthwhile, which still leaves the head shaking to think about how ignorance could dominate ... <br /> <br /> (Note: I have very cartoons that contain such racially stereotypical images, very Well, it all depends on whether the good content around the drawing exists or if the only reason is the existence of cartoons. In other words, if you were to release "Mammy", shuffling legs, bad grammar and giant lips images from the black face, is there anything else? "Plane Dumb is not.)
