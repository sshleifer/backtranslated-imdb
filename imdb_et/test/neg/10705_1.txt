The plot - in the future, when almost all men are killed with a Y chromosome targeting virus, a (hot) female genetic engineer "creates" in a chemical laboratory - is intriguing. Despite the somewhat promising assumption, the film falls on almost every side. The dialogue is ridiculous. The characters are thin. The study of one sex world is low. The worst part of the film is the Asian detective who supplies the lines that are so fun and viable that you want to vomit. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine how this landfill has been produced on earth. Most of the movie is male. "All men are violent." "All men rape women." "Men are only animals." All women - even the "hetero-cases in the closet" - seem to be angry with men, fear and hate. If you want to see something like this in the movie, you would do the best to look elsewhere.
