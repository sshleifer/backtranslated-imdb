If you took all of the Shrek movie spare parts (dirty ogre, annoying donkey, cute kitty, mandatory dance number, etc.), put them in a blender and condense it for 20 minutes so you have that mess. Painful look; Maybe I laughed once. The story and the dialogue are spoken in an incomprehensible manner, and the people involved in the voice sounded like they called on their lines. The final recast of the "Christmas Story" poem seemed to have been written by the Commission in five minutes. And boy, little Eddie Murphy goes a long way. With this desperate attempt to be under the hips and currents, this show is long outdated and forgotten, while the classics like "The Grinch ??" remains timeless. All involved are effortless, a real "shark jump" for the Shrek franchise.
