Maybe it won them in the 50s, but it is one of those rails that doesn't lose well. It received a live Playhouse from Rod Serling, Level 2, of this preaching, serious and downward man. "The plot" is by the book, the uneasy background of the character of Cassevetes seems striking, and the interests of love are not convincing and half-hearted. <br /> <br /> Sidney Portier gives OK, but the man he was sure was an annoying, naughty tatt. If I have to work with this guy in the store, I probably would like to catch him with a gripping hook. Jack Warden is good because, as usual, he plays Jack Warden. <br /> <br /> Like 90% of IMDb's rated movies (classic, mediocre or crapola), it's somehow 7-point - some stars. It's not worth it in any way. Save time
