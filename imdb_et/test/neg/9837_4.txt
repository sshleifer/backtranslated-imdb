This is one of the classic B-films that follow the use of 2 hobbies. It's really cheesily and Big Stupid runs out with a single liner like a cardboard cassanova. But Jack Elam steals every scene he is like creepazoid Jesse (now Jerome!). My favorite scene is lynch mob and father's voice rises to 10 octaves ("You loved him?"). Danny, Big Stupid's protege, is a surprisingly stupider, but not as nasty as our star star. There is also a nice place to eat in the dining room. Joyce Meadows is a sweet, naive nice gal and probably the least annoying. And those yellow tones (RAWR!). Oh, and the boy is bad, according to Mr. Stupid. <br /> <br /> This movie is a hoot. Watch this MST cover and Crow's terrible Elam tribute!
