Freely relying on Earl Derr Biggers' novels, the 20th-century Fox Charlie Chan series proved to be a favorite for the audience - but when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the studio feared the audience's attention to its Asian hero. It was a miscalculation: actor Sidney Toler took on the role of "poverty line" in Monogram Studios, where she continued to portray her character from eleven films between 1944 and 1947. <br /> <br /> The 20th-century fox had considered Chani's films as a cheap B-film, but even in the studio they were cared for: the plots were often stupid, but the pace was sharp, witty, and cast (which included Bela Lugos and Ray Milland) always an expert. The result was a friendly charm that has tried over time. The monogram was another thing: Chan movies were simple and simple B-movies. The little scripts or the cast and the resulting films were flat, the averages at best, almost badly visible. <br /> <br /> Thanks to enough pain and some interesting plot equipment, SHANGHAI COBRA is one of the finest Chan films made with the Monogram - but even so, it succeeds in unified mediocrity. In this particular entry, Chan (Sidney Toler) is invited to investigate a murderer who kills a cobra-like bite; at the same time, he is determined to ensure that the security of the radius placed in all parts of the bank's treasury remains secure. Are these two lines of seemingly unrelated parcels coming together? Well ... can be! Sidney Toler is always enjoyable as Chan, but most of her Monogram performances seemed "ringing" - and it's the same as with COBRA, as is the case with any Monogram Chan movie. As usual, Mantan Mooreland is a truly enjoyable performer. Changing times have led us to look at the Moreland comedy brand as humiliating for African Americans, but he was an expert in actor and comic and, in this context, took into account what was possible as a black actor in the 1940s. for innocence. <br /> <br /> Fox Fans of the 20th century are likely to find the remarkable disappointment of the Monogram Chani and the newcomers who like the Monogram films are likely to find them after the third level with Fox films. Like other Monogram Chan films, SHANGHAI COBRA is the best solution for designated collectors. Four stars and it's generous. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
