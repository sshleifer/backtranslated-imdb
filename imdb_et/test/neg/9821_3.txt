The book comes from 10 out of 10 stars ... <br /> <br /> PROBABILES INCLUDE BOOK AND FILM SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> If you have never read the Geoffrey House Rogue Male Man Hunt source material, you can probably enjoy the story of Fritz Lang. On the other hand, if you are in my camp and have practically remembered the book, this film is a crash. I assume you have already read the story summary and continue with my complaints. A small novel in a household is one of the greatest intermittent, occasional, free, but only many signs. Fritz Lang and his screen writer Dudley Nichols feel the need to throw the main character's brother and sympathetic relaxing, the latter of which reduces the depth of the story by injecting the external motivation of the scenario where the novel is not needed. In fact, the true summit of the book did not name the escape of the narrator from his underground camp, but rather his confidence in his true motive that he began to hunt. And this is another thing: when David Fincher and Quentin Tarantino get us through the whole fighting club and Kill Bill 1 without revealing the names of their respective main characters, why can't Lang? "Thorndyke?" What hat did they pull out of it? What brings me to my bitterest complaint: the household hunter is so British that he would win the Union Jack when you cut him off. But Walter Pigeon, who plays him, is Canada! He can hardly emphasize the accent that is just a little deeper and more convincing than Kevin Costner's Robin Hood. He looked at his role and was an exquisite actor of the 1940s, but a reluctant hero of Rogue Male? Let's look at Sceptered Isle for a more convincing version. Coming soon again and together, please! I'll direct it for free?
