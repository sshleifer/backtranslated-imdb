I just watched this movie Bravo! and it was terrible. It has a plot of Shannon Tweed movie without nudity. The assumption was interesting enough, winning a lottery ticket in a lonely area, and people who have reasons why they want that money. The characters were tiny, as were observations of human nature and greed. <br /> <br /> For a movie called class warfare, it was very little related to class differences after the first 20 minutes and the predicted end. This film could have done much better if there were more signs that would motivate the ticket and "who did it?" <br /> <br /> Operation was not fantastic, but it is hard to seem like a terrible script. Lindsey McKeon is very cute and I would like to see what she could do with better production with a better script. He's probably the only reason I sat across the film. <br /> <br />
