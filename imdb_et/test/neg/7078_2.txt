I saw the movie yesterday and stopped it for a while because I felt it was a waste of time. The idea of ​​making the film through the eyes of the main man - one of the "bad guys" between all the fantasy and medieval films - is great and offers many opportunities, but ... the film couldn't catch them. I didn't know any characters, the plot was too predictable (to the point I followed) and the second jump in timing changed me. Those who are waiting for a deep understanding of the emotional situation of middle managers, which at this time is a social challenge, may be disappointed.
