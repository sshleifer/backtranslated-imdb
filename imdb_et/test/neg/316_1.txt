Warning May contain spoiler <br /> <br /> I just spent 5 bits on this movie in Amazon and I wish I never spent it. I have never seen any dreadful special influences or action on breastfeeding. I mean, Jack-0 is just a ridiculous monster and his costume looks like something you could buy in a Halloween shop or do it yourself. The action is just terrible, especially Sean Kelly, whom I want him to be so pathetic, that his little lines "COme me PUmpkinman" smiled low because it smiled so hard. I mean, the movie is so terrible that they just had to take a few minutes of nudity just to prevent people from closing it down. I think the most ridiculous scene is when a woman sticks to the toast and gets an electric shock. I mean, I came to see the fake as well as the dummy I can buy at every Halloween shop or do it myself. Well I suggest not to watch this cheesy movie because it's time you never come back.
