I don't usually look at Hollywood, but I was with my friends to see what turned out to be some fun, but completely original. Don't worry, you don't have to think - a story like Tarantino leaves enough clues to make sure we can predict where it will go about fifteen minutes before every "twist" - I sat there worried that the movie was built quite nicely in Hollywood flick, but that would be somewhere to go to the climax. And the boy was my fears - YMCA couldn't save it, but Liv Tyler almost did. I think the man and my twenties helped, but he gave a really good result - apparently he didn't have to do much, except if he looked completely stunningly sexy, but what he did well! McCOOL is definitely not going to be one of Hollywood's great successes (or I should say, "shouldn't" because the American film industry is not going anywhere now and has been unmarried for at least ten years, like AMERICAN BEAUTY, TITANIC and SIVING PRIVATE RYAN, and even they were big shortcomings), but if you are a teenage man, do yourself a favor and see Liv - he is one hot chick. Rating: 5/10. See also: Something Quentin Tarantino, an American film of the last decade, which is its main sexual selling point.
