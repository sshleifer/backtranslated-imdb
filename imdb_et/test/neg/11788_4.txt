It is difficult to do this enthusiasm for this terrible comic-like epic that for some reason has become a cult classic. Certainly, this cannot be due to the completely artificial appearance of the designs or the all-round star. These days the Fox movie channel or AMC is too often shown. <br /> <br /> I have the pain to announce that veteran actors, such as Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine, are even in the confusing scientific literature, none of which is true. It's like looking at an expensive budget spent on a Saturday afternoon for a baby full of cardboard labels and a convincing dialogue. This is a comic book about Jules Verne's novel. <br /> <br /> Fontaine, still to be baked, was still attractive but bears a painful expression on his face, perhaps regretting that he had accepted the role of psychiatrist before reading the script. He does not help with the role of carton but with an imperialist and uncomfortable presence. Robert Sterling, Barbara Eden and, most importantly, Peter Lorre, Frankie Avalon, who sings the title with a voice that is safe to say, have not been better for the tuning of someone's favorite. An amazingly frustrating experience to sit through a movie that wastes attractive light and is an insult to almost everyone's intelligence. Completely convincing from start to finish. The film, as well as the fantastic submarine, drops to the seabed before the struggle with the rubber octopus brings the film to a clumsy conclusion.
