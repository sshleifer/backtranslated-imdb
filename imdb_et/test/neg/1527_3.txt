The topics presented are very interesting; suburban culture, suburban expansion, public transport, oil and gas depletion, energy dependency, alternative energy sources, etc. The problem is that it is pure and shameless propaganda. One viewpoint is presented, then the viewer is grabbed over and over again. You can see the same handful of repeatedly your experts. The supposed "narrator" will sound like a news reporter, but in the end he has even proclaimed the dogma of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the dark side of the movie, there is not so much darkness and a doom message about oil shrinking, but the feeling is that people in the movie really want an after-oil society and everything that comes with it. They paint this image of a utopian society where we all return to the model of an independent local village; walk to work, buy on the spot, grow your food and live a generally idyllic 19th century lifestyle. For them, the post-oil society seems to have a greater vision of the better world. That would definitely mean the end of globalization and even better the end of Walmart. I give them some credit to apply real mathematics to reveal the weaknesses of several alternative sources of energy, including ethanol and hydrogen. <br /> <br /> I gave him 3 stars because I appreciated the old material and the premise.
