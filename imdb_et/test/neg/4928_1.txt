I just saw this movie "Fantasy Filmfest BERLIN". I'm not impressed. <br /> <br /> When the story goes. Too girlfriends return from their Mexican vacation. Waiting for their luggage, they can get to know a couple of boys who then take the city with the last and of course the wrong bus. There is also another older man on board, so it is strange that you think he is one of the bad guys. The other is the driver. <br /> <br /> Shuttle takes them to industry and then one after another, small blood, some limbs cuts, violence, mostly playing for fear. Girls At the end of some ups and downs, heres and there are some not too new scary moments, everything is dead, but the leader and the girls. the girls get to some garage where one of them is killed, admitting that she had slept with another girlfriend. The other girl, which is the conclusion, is sold by the left-wing predator (yes, weird was killed) in some commercial boxes in Asia (the final picture is for freight). Story. Tons of gaps, the questions you ask yourself, the open ends and the conclusion that is not good revelation, but complete disappointment. I do not see how such an unprofessional relaxer would rob dozens of women (as shown by a driver-filled drawer ... aha). Acting. Mediocre best. <br /> <br /> Third. Factor. OKAY. but I AM by torture, nothing more than myself. Trafficking in human beings can be a good reason for terror, but it is not used as one, but as a background. <br /> <br /> Fourth, music and sound. Some nice events, but the industrial landscape, warehouse garage and truck sounds are not really explored. Music? Without it, it would have been worse, but beyond that. Some pseudo-moving synthetic strings are emotional when girls reach their final destination. OK, I guess. <br /> <br /> Decision: OPEN IT!
