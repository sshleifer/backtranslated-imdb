This movie tried, but in the end it was a waste of talent. He tried to be "sexy". I do not put the works of those actors, such as Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson (who find something besides TV shows that deserve her talent.) I just couldn't find, even Mrs Wilson's so-called. The middle seduction scene with Mrs Barkin, which is a real emotion, although I know these people tried to work on the scene. When the sexual elements of Wilson's disrupted sexual victim did not touch our heart (which he did not even finish, which he did not deserve), the plot's murder element did not. Maybe it was a script or maybe a direction, but I didn't know anyone in this movie, and without that feeling, the movie doesn't work for me. If you are interested in a movie about lesbianism, there are at least two films on both sides of the spectrum to look at: 1) "Bound" delight with joy that works well on the dove; and 2.) A fairer and more relevant story about a lesbian who grows in the hell kitchen "All Over Me". It is a well-defined indie since the mid-1990s, dealing with this age problem, not with forced sexuality. Both would be better than Mercy, which has nothing.
