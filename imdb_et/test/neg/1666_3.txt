This is probably my least favorite episode. I've been living in Cape Girardeau for some time. I can tell you that there are no ocean or shrimp, fresh crab or scallops near Missouri. Cape Girardeau is the only inland located on the Mississippi River. It seemed that the number plates came from Mississippi, which could explain why there was so much racial tension. Missouri and Mississippi are two completely different countries that do not touch each other. There is a lot of roads in the city, and none of them is road 6 or route 666. This whole inaccuracy was very disturbing. Cassie also didn't seem like someone who would want to run Dean if he was well educated. I didn't buy them in pairs or enjoyed long love. Jo was more dean style.
