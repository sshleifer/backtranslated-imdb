Usually I prefer a lot of French films over America, with explosions and motorists, but this movie was very disappointing. It is not possible to write a spoiler because nothing happens. This French couple has lived in Lisbon for years, and they will return to Paris's wedding. They tell the other friend that they have dinner, that they are divided. Then nothing happens, they don't know if they want to divorce or not. I may not think that their hesitation creates a bad film, it is very human to hesitate before making such a decision, but it can be treated in an interesting way, giving some flesh their desires and relationship, but that does not happen. The theater is sure why the two together or want to share. The only piece I enjoyed was a conversation drunk. It was true to life.
