I want to believe that all new horror movies coming out of Japan are sharp and enjoyable today. <br /> <br /> Spider Forest is not so. <br /> <br /> I rarely see anything and end up wasting time, but Spider Forest was an exception to that. I was very bitten. The filmmakers succeeded at one level; throughout the film I couldn't stop because I wanted to see the answer to the mystery that has been told. I couldn't stop viewing. That's why I was so angry at the end of the movie ... they pulled me to POC for up to 2 hours? WARNING: Spider Forest is one of the Japanese "ghost" stories, though you do not know it is happening. <br /> <br /> I never want to see the Japanese ghost story again. They are fake and alive. "It's a ghost story" has become like a big carpet under which to sweep all and all the insoluble plot holes that you have in your storytelling.
