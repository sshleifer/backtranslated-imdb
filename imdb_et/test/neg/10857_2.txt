This movie is next to a variety of super-bad harsh biker characters that are loosely connected but have no real story. Some scenes are nicely filmed. If they took the same story and team and made a movie called Gent, who was the coolest character of the movie and came up with an interesting and continuous story, it might be decent. As it is, prepare for a flat series of tough boy character intros who all do nothing but ride bikes around the desert all day and cause problems when everyone is ever sunburned and keep their hair and clothes perfect and never need to look for a home or money etc. There was a kind of backdrop of different people killed and treasured, probably a plot.
