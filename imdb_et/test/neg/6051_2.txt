I thought it would be a good movie, boy ... I was wrong! Fast Summer: Special Class B effects with Class B effects on all D-Class movies. Don't make me wrong, the story was pretty good and not a kid, so the adult also drove with it, the "hero" is good looking, so most women like it :-), not the full chick flick because it contains some combat scenes and with some blood <br /> <br /> but the way it is released ... terrible <br /> <br /> special effects-> better suited for TV shows> kids show <br and finally ... we send some actors back to the show school, if they ever stayed there. <br /> <br /> Trust that 2 hours are much better waste. <br /> <br /> You are alerted.
