The film has been placed in Newcastle, Tyne, northeast England, where I was born and raised. The film is also basically dishonest - how it depicts the city, the children, but above all the men of the city. In this film, they are all stupid, violent, stealing, thugs. <br /> <br /> I think I could comment on the plot (predictable), performances (competently unsatisfactory), direction (lazy and unimaginable), but for me this is all irrelevant compared to the director's insult to the city and its inhabitants. <br /> <br /> So my summary is an invitation to director and writer Mark Herman to leave the north-east.
