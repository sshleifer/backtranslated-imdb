Does anyone remember docudrama THREADS? This is a drama documentary that shocked Britain in September 1984. While Mick Jackson's nuclear weapon horror film is not entirely happy, I can respect it. Unfortunately, I cannot respect this 20-year-old documentary on terrorists who have shot down a radioactive dirty bomb in central London. <br /> <br /> My problem is that the production values ​​of the director Daniel Percival are far too good if it would have resulted in cheap production values. Cinematic art is great, but in this type of speculative drama do we need great and well-lit Oscar traditional cinematography? What we definitely do not need is a musical score because the blast survivors slowly step out of the smoke. We also do not need vaguely known cast members. Did anyone sit there asking himself, "Hey, what was he? I know this face" many times? I know I did, and it's very disturbing. <br/> <br /> The biggest shortage of production with DIRTY WAR is that someone decided to make it a doctrine with too much stylistic emphasis on drama. The HISTORY operation interrupts eleven times from Sheffield's action and becomes HORIZON's publication on the consequences of the nuclear war before being reused for fictional characters and THREADS is very effective for it. The information provided here stifles the drama that drowns in the displaying and completely convincing dialogue. Phone characters are not really the characters they just cyphers have to inform the audience what happens when radioactive material is exploded. It would have been better if the headlines were to provide such information. The worse thing is that director Daniel Percival used the same technique as THREADS a few years ago with his doctrine about smallpox. She should have used the same style with DIRTY WAR <br /> <br /> I should also put my cards on the table and say that although I do not consider most Muslims to be terrorists, I get a bit of television products like HAMBURG CLOCK, GRID and DIRTY WAR must remind me of this fact by putting over to me what is somewhat typical of PC attitudes in television companies nowadays <br /> <br /> the studio discussion that Bob mentions here, but I have also heard that it was discussed elsewhere , and I can't think it's making better views than DIRTY WAR itself with its hot arguments between different political factions. If DIRTY WAR is remembered twenty years after that (very unlikely I know), it may be remembered that this debate caused more than anything
