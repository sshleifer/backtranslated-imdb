Heldeke! The BBC does not intend to pull this pedestal to swallow drots with that time. I agree with this novel that Jane Austens finds it hard to imagine especially for a modern audience, the heroine is barely Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund does not think that would cause a woman to miss her heart. But I have to say that I hoped for the last improvement and was unfortunately disappointed. The main story was preserved, but the dialogue had changed so that everything that was Jane Austen's tone, way, feeling, mind, depth, was diluted when it didn't disappear. If some of the earlier adjustments can be seen as a date, its weakness must be that it is too modern ("his life is one long party"?) Casting was generally enough, but I think Billie Piper was the wrong choice, he needed somebody more restrained , I didn't get any impression of the hidden depths under the subordinate base, he was a funny kid. I see I have to wait until the BBC repeats its magic.
