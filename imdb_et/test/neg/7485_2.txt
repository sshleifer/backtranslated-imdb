Jon Good's husband (just one of the worst titles in the movie) or Red Right (another absolutely terrible title that doesn't mean the film doesn't have anything and no importance) under which I saw it is 'Salem, Massachusettes 1978' ( by the way, the year that was probably the best thing in those 365 days), where five old college friends meet for school, gay boy boy Roger Mather (John Kuntz, this surname just say it loud ...), Martha Alden (Kim Brockington), Rebecca Lawson (Jenna Stern) and her boyfriend Jake Stabler (John Doe), Alan Hobbes (Michael Kevin Walker) and his wife Sandy (Megan Rawa) plus John Good (Marc Ardito, why is "John" spelling different? ) and her husband Sara (Abigail Morgan). According to the word, there is an awkward tension in the air, and when someone mentions his "lost" friend Calef (Jason Winther), many unpleasant memories come back. Then there will be phone calls, mysterious nosebleeds, hallucinations and guilt like the real horror of the events that happened years ago ... <br /> <br /> Produced, directed and directed by Kurt Gioscia who also wrote the thing and Kurt St. Thomas, who also gets credit for artistic direction, and if it wasn't enough, both are in the movie! Personally, I thought Jon Good's husband was terrible, I mean he can't eat or anything! Ha ha ha, just kidding! Seriously, although I did not think about a large number of films, at first it is rather slow, and the first 30 minutes are a definite postponement of reunion, consisting of a lot of each other and the boring nature of the exposition of a building. The film never explains what their strange nose bleeds are for God, the mysterious phone call, the almost non-existent death of one group, which may or may not be natural, and what the hell was Sara? He has met somewhat, sexual madness, dirty talk, shameless, bitter blackmail, ignorance-all whore, apparently sleeping by almost every man he meets! Some of the dialogues he displaces would not be in the porn and it just seems to be in complete contradiction with the rest of the movie that plays more than drama than the horror / thriller it was supposed to be. Then there is an end when it is even worse to leave the movie literally all hanging without closing, which I still can't see. The whole thing was also very predictable, I mean, someone who watches it does not know that if they all mention their friend Calef disappeared, wouldn't it be any more? <br /> <br /> Directors Gioscia & Thomas make a shameful film, along with predictability and annoying climax, Alan's retrospective story, which I simply do not understand, because he has no more or less importance than anyone else and at what point he speaks ? The reasons for this story have never been made clear or developed. There are no tensions, because the whole thing is so-called numbers. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is OK, but something special and some places and clothes did not seem to me to be very authentic, it has never convinced me that it happened in the late 70s. Action was fine and how is the surname of actor John Kuntz? I think if his wife stood next to him, we could describe them as a couple of Kuntz, right? <br /> <br /> I really didn't think much about Jon Good's wife (the breather would have been better! Ha ha ha) & I'm not sure who likes it. Forget about any gore, horror, violence, intimidation, atmosphere or excitement, just forget everything that would have made this movie traceable because it's not here. Not recommended.
