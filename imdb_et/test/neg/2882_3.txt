I do not recognize Haneke's above-average skill in film making. For example, I appreciate his steady natural day-illuminated setting, which is a powerful way to sense powerful realism. However, with regard to the content of this film, I am very sad to see that in the 21st century, pathological dominance-submission relations or feelings (and / or BDSM practices) are still pressing. The problem the main character has with his mother is incredibly topical, such as Walter's alienation and misunderstanding (I do not mean that the lover is disappointed, not loved in the same way that is understandable; he looks at him as if he was crazy or as a monk , come!). I mean, D / s is not something new in the world and I think it's rather stupid to treat a substance as if it were something "freak" or pathological; it is not. In general, films dealing with this topic have been lagging behind. <br /> <br /> So, in my opinion, this movie is a rather programmatic film that is worried about very obsolete psychonal theories (isn 'it is almost embarrassing?) and it doesn't really relate to real life and experience, related to D / s relations (personal experience, forums, IRC chat rooms, even recent researchers suggest).
