Okay, so not every Australian movie is so good. Yes, maybe very little and much earned. But Take Away is an absolute bomb that qualifies as one of the worst films I've ever seen. I wanted to like it. I thought I'd give him a fair move. I've even met with one of the screen writers Dave O'neil, so I feel it's a scammer who gives a bad overview of this film, but ... The plot is rather thin (I don't worry about it ... read this synopsis) What I can forgive: There are many movies that can do it with some decent jokes. Unfortunately, Take Away jokes cover his plot like a $ 2 prostitute skirt. Probably the only laughs that came from the 6 other people living in the cinema were in poor action and dialogue. Take Away goes like a week-old Dim sim ... You can understand this joke when you see a movie, but the joke isn't worth it.
