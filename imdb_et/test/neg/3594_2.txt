"Danger" is not funny. It is trying hard - too hard. but rarely smiles. It's not, just looting. One of the main characters carries the whole movie on his face with a fool. There is no doubt that the less talented Brothers of Wayans celebrated, wrote, and made a film that they were completely blind because of the lack of talent. <br /> <br /> The accident consists of a number of unpleasant jokes. The punchline can be seen in a mile, but you have to wait until it all opens. There is no glowing single lining here and no lovely dialogue. Just one scene after another joke after another. The jokes themselves are minors. Loc Dog (one with perma-grimace) speaks to a beautiful woman - but then she has ... bad breath and then she picks up the nose and then wait for it (remember you always have w-a-i) she farts! How funny is that? Ten years old boys can find jokes because they haven't heard the jokes so many times. Alternatively, if you like to be completely drunk or stoned, you can watch it and maybe even have fun. The challenge is drunk enough to reduce your mental state to the level of the movie without going out.
