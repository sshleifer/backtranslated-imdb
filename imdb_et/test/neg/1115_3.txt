I saw Wicked Little Things as part of the "8 movies to die" horror record, and that was the only movie that deceived me. Don't, mom, her little girl and her teenage daughter are in an abandoned house in the mountains of Pennsylvania. Every night, the vengeful spirits of the children killed in the coal mine start running and kill someone they find. <br /> <br /> I think the director was in the banking industry against his viewers so that the kids could kill the murders and eat the flesh of the human being (with lots of close-ups, like a nice respect to George Romero) because the film isn't just scary. Simply put, there is too much to create evil children who run their next murder site. When somebody starts to help, the kids who come to the barn (oh spacing) will come and kill. <br /> <br /> Think about why kids suddenly walk as slowly as they catch their crops? And not because I have experience with it, but I think the shot blast throws the child much more than this film means ...? Nor does it help the mother to be one of the worst parents I've ever seen in every movie. "The door lock is broken"? You have eighty-year-old BEARS and MOUNTAIN LIONS! FIX IT, MORON !!! In addition, the mother and her eldest daughter are too close to the age, even during the teenage pregnancy, and there is quite an incredible death, which means that someone is trying to push the sludge out of the car with their butt. <br /> <br /> I'll give it 3 because he tried. It's not bad as a dropper movie. But for good intimidation, go elsewhere.
