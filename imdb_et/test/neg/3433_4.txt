I found this movie okay. Romance, comedy, drama. Bank robbery, unique cast, great music and storytelling! <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie was mostly a garbage and I tell you why. <br /> <br /> a) It's my biggest problem: editing. This movie is by far the worst editing I've seen on local car resale ads. The editing could have been better done by a deaf Parkinson's patient who touched iMovie with a dead cat. There are scenes where two characters speak to each other and their lips are moving and the sound / video is not in sync because it is clearly duplicated. Why was it duplicated? I do not know! Duplication of English! Votes were made in the studio elsewhere on certain scenes! Don't They Find The Boom-Mic? They are not expensive; Jesus, even myself! And I'm not making movies! </p> </p> In fact, he didn't seem to want to be part of this project, and his action was equivalent to D.A.R.E. schoolchildren. At least John Krasinks showed enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Yes, John Krasinski is the only reason I leased this flick, and that's the only real reason to look at it. He has done good, witty results, and he was the three-dimensional character. The character of Dean Edward was quite thin, as was his face. <br /> <br /> Final word? If you're a fan of John Krasinski, it's worth your time. If not, don't even worry. Editing
