First of all I am in the mid-40s. I was in childhood because I was a child so I have seen many different things. IMO, it's not as bad as the crowds who gave it a 1 or 2. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a low budget horror flip. Dialogue is soso and sometimes tolerable. The basis of this film base is actually pretty good. For those who are old enough to remember or fortunately see them on DVD. It's very similar to the 1970's movie. Just add blood and small gore, small T&A and swearing without big names. That's T. I'd rather look at it than Jason vs Godzilla or any other consistent mess there. Not so good, EVIL DEAD was a LOW budget movie. At least let them try your guys. With an active MIL budget, it would have been a pretty good flick. My score is traceable 4.
