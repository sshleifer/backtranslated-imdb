Duncan Roy's writing and direction is really and regularly down par. In fact, it's smelly. AKA is almost as bad as his recent (terrible, self-serving) remake by Dorian Gray - an absurd, tortured dialogue between "upper-class" characters, at the same time idiotic and pretentious, amateur, cordial. Characterization and scripting - and sometimes acting - are like a school game ... but worse, there is some papal self-confidence in that direction, which is just a soul that destroys if the director has not clearly understood ... he's just not good. Diana Quick must shame. DR should come out of the movie ... seriously.
