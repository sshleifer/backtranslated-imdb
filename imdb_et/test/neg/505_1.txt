It is now the infamous West, which was (at that time) the biggest budget disaster in Hollywood history. I was lucky enough to see the complete 220-minute version of the theater in 1990. It was really amazing how the BAD movie was! <br /> <br /> They had a great performance, a story based on a real case (fighting between foreigners and Americans in the 1800s), a wonderful landscape ... so what went wrong? Three Words - directed by Michael Cimino. He was so full after "The Hunters of Fear" that he went out and made this god terrible to the West. He's not entirely guilty. His previous film "The Deer Hunter" was considered a masterpiece and United Artists gave him free government to do something. They let him alone ... and everything went wrong. The costs went out of control and Cimino demanded repetition of the sequences until they were perfect. <br /> <br /> First of all, the sound is terrible. The whole sequence goes by and you can't do the words that the characters say. For example, the character of Jeff Bridges is introduced during the dance series, but I have no idea who he was! The dialogue in the introductory scene is incomprehensible! It is the director's fault - he should have ensured that the dialogue could be heard. Some scenes let you fly as much dust as you can to do what's going on. The story doesn't make much sense and Cimino took great liberties with the facts - only one person was killed in the actual story - Cimino makes this massacre. Here are some obviously beautiful sequences that are completely broken by the lack of story and incomprehensible dialogue. Also, the sound was not the fault of the theater - all the prints sounded so. <br /> <br /> This garbage closed United Artists and was the end of Cimino's career. An example of a curriculum from a director who is so full that he does not understand what he is doing. Jeff Bridges has said it is the worst film he ever did. This is the man who made the "Throne"! Sure must-miss. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty good book called "The Final Cut" that describes the whole disaster. This will be 1. I want IMDb to have negative numbers - it deserves it!
