This movie is incredible. It is a small budget, poorly written, meaningless garbage. But on Saturday afternoon, which stumbled on the TV, I still find one of the most entertaining things I've ever spent in front of the TV. The bad thing about this movie is epic - maybe not Ed Wood epic, but close. Prerequisite is hysterical (men are forbidden to be too dangerous and imprisoned! - football stadiums), pseudo-ditch culture is ridiculously odd (there is a minor sex trade with women who dress men to serve) ") and the title" last man "is rocky from Rocky's Croatian show I could not see the end of what I have to suppose, that it was so dripping with the syrup "what have we all learned about it?" nonsense, which would lead to a toothbrush, but only in the first two thirds was so memorable even if the latter the third turned out to be the rest of the pale imitation, it is still useful for anyone who hits the camp, the foolish, the creepy sci-fi B-flames.
