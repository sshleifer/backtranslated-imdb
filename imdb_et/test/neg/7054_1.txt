My brother worked in the movie when I saw this movie; I saw it for free and still walked. I've seen a lot of movies during my time, but it was the worst. When people ask me what is the worst film I've ever seen, I mention this movie in less than one second. This film is bad because it goes from one flat plot upwards, it encourages stereotypes about black people that are sick and the flow is terrible. If you want to see how children cry and vomit at the same time, check out this movie. Okay, this movie is not a good "bad" but terrible bad. If you are like one of those people who watch horrible movies like myself, you can't even make that very short movie. Please, God's love will destroy all copies of this movie.
