I saw this in the movie theater and it was a terrible movie. The way Michael Oliver, who has become even worse now, is the greatest intolerance I can't. Junior disturbed his father because he did not go to school, which became his father Ben madly mad. Also, Crazy Dance rider is not fair to Junior because he doesn't let him drive. And the fact that Lawanda Dumore is as creepy as the serial house for Junior, because she threatened Junior's threats, so I can't tolerate that movie. Even though the movie has been released to the theaters again in the expanded version, I still can't see this movie because this movie is not something I can't even tolerate. In fact, it smells!
