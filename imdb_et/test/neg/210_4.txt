One of those movies with no big twists, and you can predict that it will happen a lot. Matt dillon was awesome again, but the rest did not play much as they should have. <br /> <br /> At first it was exciting, but at last it was slow and predictable. flicks where a good man wins no matter what happens.If you have absolutely nothing to do, you can try it out personally i found it not worth watching. The story could have been more interesting and the director could have made this B movie less than the happy ending ended.
