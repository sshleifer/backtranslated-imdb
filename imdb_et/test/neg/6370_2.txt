I was in 6th grade and this film was played on PBS during the series "Wonderworks". I clearly remember sitting on the couch looking at the tears in the film that finally run my face. Jesse is the main character of an unusual friendship with a girl named Leslie. Very simple, but careless mistake, one couple dies. At that time I found this story very powerful, because a deadly mistake is exactly the kind of mistake a child makes and that every child watching a movie finds it very easy to identify and feel the emotional weight of this tragedy that arises Last year I finally found VHS copy. I should have kept my memories. Watching the show as an adult was completely shocked by what this terribly made film was like. My girlfriend also remembered the memory of the film, and she was quite sad as to how badly the film was compared to her memories. <br /> <br /> Many adults are likely to have good memories of watching this movie when they were kids. I strongly urge these people to leave their memories intact and not see this movie as an adult.
