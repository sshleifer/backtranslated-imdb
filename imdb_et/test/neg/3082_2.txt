"Dedicated" as Heather Graham is committed to rescuing his wife / marriage and then to the Dedicated Psychiatric Department if he did not: what smart and clever use of words. <br /> <br /> One of those useless philosophical films in which narration is a series of oh-wise observations that limit poetry (90's chique-club poetry, better known as "chit-chique poetry"). Oh, this is je-ne-sais-quoi ... Writed / guided (or "wicked") wife (Lisa Krueger, no matter where you are), this is a futile, lethargy-looking new movie full of new Age's spiritual nonsense and characters that are interesting, but that have just seen before or just dull. The Latin people in this film, as part of poor urban minorities, are usually respected as their "mysteriously-obsessed" primitivis as "spirit superior" people, which is the "highlighting" of the political correctness of this film. The whole thing is inanimate and stops only when random good members appear (Kay Place, Baker, Wilson). On the other hand, we have Casey Affleck, one of the best examples of why nepotism is equivalent to a first-degree murder. I have rarely seen a more apathetic "actor"; a skinny, ugly moron who passes through his lines in a sleepy way, almost as if he were half-awake in almost a dream, besides the weak voice that is one of the weakest voices I've heard in my life. (He must have gone to Tobey Maguire Lethargy School of Acting.) Choosing this idiot in ANYTHING tells everything about ANY's film, the director or producer of ANY. So Lisa Krueger is a gifted waste of space. We also have this hero who played a leading role in the MST3K fraud werewolf; I think his name is Goran Vishnjic, but I'm not sure. See her ridiculous pressure and stupid speech.
