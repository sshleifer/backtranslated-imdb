OK ... so ... I really like Kris Kristofferson and his usual simple lines delivery in his movies. The age has helped her with her soft energy-saving style and steals the scene effortlessly. But the disappearance is his wrong move. St. Moly, this was a bad movie! <br /> <br /> I have to give cinematography and actors, including Kris, to try and understand their terrifying and confusing story. None of this was reasonable, and Kris probably didn't understand it, and he just walked through, hoping someone would come to him and tell him what it was all about! <br /> <br /> I don't care that everything for this movie was in love with the project or any of these nonsense ... I've seen low-budget movies that had a lot of goodness. It had no zilchot, nadat, zippot, cause ... a complete waste of good talents, landscapes and celluloid! <br /> <br /> I leased this garbage box and I want my money back! I want to invest 2 hours ago in this F-class waste! Don't watch this movie and waste 1 minute of your precious time when you go through the space where it plays, or even open a case that holds a DVD! Believe me, you thank me for your advice!
