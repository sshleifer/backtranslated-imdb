I'm a big MD fan. But I call it as I see it. This movie hit. The plot was redundant. Access to Heads of State in this movie is easier than accessing a local grocery store. Come on! Tone Loc has a wooden plaque emotion. Release! Editing is negligible. Actors and I use this term loosely as they read their rows in the valium. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been better. Dudikoff has the potential, but he chooses scripts that just scream, "Stinker." <br /> <br /> If you would like to watch a good Dudikoff movie, I recommend Crash Dive or Avenging Force. If you've never seen your movies before, it's not what introduces you to your work. You walk away from the bad taste in your mouth and think all his projects are bad.
