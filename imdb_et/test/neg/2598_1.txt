I have not seen many "Family Guy" episodes and it is a pretty sure contribution that I will not see too much in the future. Some people say that comparing this example to "The Simpsons" is unfair. I think this show doesn't exist if "Simpsons" didn't come first and I think he wants so much to be "Simpsons". I don't understand what's so funny about this show. In the episodes I have seen, I understand where they wanted to laugh at me, I understand that someone thinks that jokes were just being spoken, but the joke is not funny. I think the whole exhibition is lazy: the title, the jokes, the lack of all the inspiration. <br /> <br /> The best shows on television (comic or not) are created as follows: a script is written, it passes several rewriting, things that do not work, are inspired, created good things, more transcriptions are added and then filmed. <br /> <br /> I picture This "Family Guy" episode has been created: the script is written and filmed.
