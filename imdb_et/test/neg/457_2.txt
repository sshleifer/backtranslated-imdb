The bad second string of universal images of the actor of the mother's boy movie, who is doing criminal research for the army, is to repel the young man's success as a romantic. Robert Montgomery directed and celebrates this short adaptation of the story "Come Be My Love" and his exemplary performances of this era are even lazy. The plot is blissful, predictable things, and writer Robert Carson has given all the really funny features (as was the case with films of this period) to the black virgin. It's always nice to see Ann Blyth and Jane Cowl support, but they can't do much. * from ****
