I have to agree with the other two remarks. I waited more than one month to see this great new example of A&E was jumping. What a disappointment !!! The exhibition is pretty much Ryan Buell. Her voice transmissions are campy, not horrible. It looks like he's talking about a can. From another episode that is about 30 minutes or so (when ads are removed), he goes again or follows what he knows is demonic. He can't say that name, anytime someone has to pass on that name, writes it on paper and gives it to someone else. Not very informative or entertaining or credible for the rest of us. Why can't she name her? ... supposedly it would give the demon more power. Funny, I always thought that demons wanted to hide their true identity. If you know the exact name of the demon, it doesn't allow you to throw them out. Now the next episode, which only appears for a while, is called "exorcism." So Ryan already needs exorcism? It is not said that this cannot happen, but the show so far has not provided any evidence or proof. I can tell Ryan that when I was a little child, hell, if I were an adult and someone gave me a little sacred water to scare me, I'd be looking for help elsewhere! Besides, if you do not use holy water and blessings, etc., do you not only threaten to be angry? I'll probably look tonight, but if these episodes are just as ridiculous as the first, then probably the last time I watch it!
