Looking at this movie for the first time twenty years after its release, I can't do it quite well. Why is it such a big hit in 1986? Its amateurism falls from every scene. Jokes are flat and predictable. Sexual scenes are exploiting and from above (this does not mean that Miss Rudnik has no nice breasts!). Singing is "schrecklich". The only really funny scene is the big shot when the gangsters die to break the dance - the feature that made the movie firmly in the mid-eighties. It is quite amazing to me that I cannot understand what the enthusiasm of a busy audience in 1986 was (and probably still today, reading the comments from my colleague's IMDBers).
