This is the first time I have commented on a movie that I haven't looked at until the credit. The reason is simple ... people must be warned: this is one of the worst comedies of the new millennium. I usually stay away from many comedies that have a bad taste, but I thought it was traceable. An unfortunate decision based on other Ashton Kutcher comedies that were (semi) enjoyable, such as A Lot Like Love and Guess Who. The charm and laughter of these two films wasn't (and I mean nothing!). Operation is terrible, especially "boss". Tara Reid was not surprised how she dared to call her an actor! The condition is thin and the primer is not thickened at all. It's not a problem if you can keep it funny and / or sweet ... but if you probably thought it wasn't cast at all! The script seemed to be not quite ready and I wouldn't even be confused when the director made some transcriptions while shooting. My dog ​​could have seriously written a more uniform script. And he's not exactly Lassie :-). <br /> <br /> Stay away, even if you like a nice butterfly-comedy (like me). This low quality movie is not enjoyed by many ... <br /> <br /> I (almost) never give it ... a 2.
