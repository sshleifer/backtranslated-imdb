This documentary does not shed any light on what it would be like to be backstage during the Hard Knock Life tour. Allowed that I was not there, but watching this movie, I didn't feel like myself. For such a movie, it is not exactly a compliment. All the time I watched it, I can guess it is, "What are they leaving?" When all this is over, the only rapper you know is having some insight is DMX, and that's mainly because he's just talking about his dogs. Waste of time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
