Often I do not give two films to a horror film because my horror is my favorite genre. The film can be a BAD because it is not a masterpiece, but can be enjoyable on the basis of unwanted humor, curiosity, and the like. An example is a large number of horror sci-fi films from 1940 to 1980. They are enjoyable for genres and culprits because their "bad" is fun. However, there is no "Piranha" (1978) original humor or effective gorse music in this film. I think that in 1995 it was a period of political correctness, so it was minimal on television. Now in the mid-2000s C.S.I. Shows TV's Absolute Blood Festival! (Good for horrible fans!) <br /> <br /> William Katt and Alexandra Paul are not Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies (original 1978 stars.) It's not Katt and Paul's mistakes, but writers and directors who created its a naughty turkey. The main mistake of this movie is how the main characters interact. I'm not saying this is part of the plot. <br /> <br /> This TV was likely to have a bigger budget than the original, but floped as a good horror, as seen by the user here. Use the 1978 Original when you're in the mood for a killer-fish movie!
