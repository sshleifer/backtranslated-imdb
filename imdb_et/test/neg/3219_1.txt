I'm a mammalian mob / gangland movie so I rented this movie. This movie is a complete train wreck. With all the big namesmiths of this movie, I can't believe how bad it was. It was so bad that I started to laugh hysterically at the end of the movie. An actor, better known as Zues or a big guy on Ice Cube's "Friday" movie, makes incredible work throughout the film. The first thing I told Blockbuster when I turned the film back was removing garbage from their shelves. Don't rent this movie unless you want to waste two hours of your life. When they come out of the queue, they don't know if it's twice as bad as the first one. I'm more cautious about renting so-called mob / gangland movies.
