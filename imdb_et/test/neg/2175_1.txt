This scary and boring film made me think Chaplin was a real Hitler, because only someone so bad as he could torture people with this bear. I saw this movie remastered, which made the suffering of this cruelty more difficult. This film is nothing more than a pathetic, repetitive film that, instead of calling two hours of laughing, caused two hours of suicide. After the first 10 minutes I started to want the gas to start talking about the theater. <br /> <br /> If I could give ten out of zero, I'd happily do it. Avoid at all costs!
