Basically, the first two Critters films were already stupid, but good and fun. This movie is more of a B-film, it's silly, but all for the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> This is the first sequel that really doesn't follow the first two films. Basically, all the characters are new and this time there are not many hunters (well, as good as none, because the bounty hunter of this movie looks too late) and its budget has probably fallen again. To save even more cost, the movie became a setback for 4 parts of the movie, which is just as bad because it directly follows this movie and made the same people who are involved with it. <Br>> <br /> This is just a typical B-genre movie with no originality or entertainment. This makes the Critters 3 a real superfluous step that you can easily do without. It is allowed that things could have been worse for this movie, but it is not quite good either. The film simply falls into scientific literature / horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> Also kind of weird to see how Critters has suddenly changed in it. They have about doubled their usual size this time, without any explanation, and they are even more Gremlins than in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is only interesting because it was the debut of Leonardo DiCaprio's feature films. He was in this movie for about 17 years and of course he was looking for children as he was still doing. I like to see this famous actor in my early role. It's fun to see how they work and whether their style has improved and changed over the years. Of course, DiCaprio only got better, but he was already sort of transferring his lines in the same way he did these days. <br /> <br /> Really too silly and flat. <br /> <br /> 4/10
