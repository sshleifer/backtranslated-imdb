Man alive, is this game bad or what? The graphics are below par, even if it was playstation 1, never mind Gamecube. The gameplay is pathetic and the camera is moving disorientating. What a worthless game! I totally love Warner's Batman animation and it's cool that they do all these games. Batman: Vengeance could have been very good when they went to a good start, avoiding all the Gothic visual images and people engaged in voice, but they stumbled seriously on playability and graphics. The result is a boring game that seems incredibly cheap and not fun to play. I really have to emphasize how bad the graphics are. Don't let color schemes fool you. I've seen better things at Commodore 64.
