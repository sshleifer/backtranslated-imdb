Before I start, "small" correction: IMDb claims that Richard Gere is 180 cm tall. Wrong! I went over him ten years ago and he can't be an antenna ** bigger than 165. I'm 183, and he looked like a baby next to me. <br /> <br /> Should be called "Wheatlands"; an appropriate title that complements Malick's previous (and much better) movie "Badlands". This film shows that not all directors have the main purpose of entertainment. In fact, some of them have the main purpose of showing wheat in all their glory. <br /> <br /> The film is frustrating and relatively infinite with a mandatory tragic ending. Nothing more than an average and predictable triangle of love triangle, where two-thirds of the triangle do not live over the film. Thanks for this visual quality; although it has a real 70s, there seems to be limits to how it is possible that the so-called. You can dig them up with 1500 mm cameras, no matter what I care about, but they are still wheat fields. <br /> <br /> Gere, who at first seems uncomfortable as a lower-class factory-worker-wheatfield worker, is quite confident, while Brooke Adams seems far and cool for most of the film, making one wonder how much he loved either of two pieces. But for those who are looking for a movie that shows all the famous colors of the wheat field, they don't look any more: you've found your dream! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading your "biographies", contact Richard Gere and other Hollywood Intelligent Heavy Vehicles by email.
