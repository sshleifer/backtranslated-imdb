Being a big street fighter fan and enjoying the previous movie, Street Fighter II: Animated Movie, I was really looking forward to it! <br /> <br /> However, the film seemed to have no real sense of direction or purpose. Most of the characters I could not associate with and just lacked intense action that made the other mentioned streetman's movie so high. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good points, animation is great !!!
