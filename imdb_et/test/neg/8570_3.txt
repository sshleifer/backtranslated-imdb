The title describes it exactly. This film drifting was nothing more than a typical "teenage group who killed someone accidentally when someone haunts / kills them 20 years later." The only twist is an angry ex-classmate or a lovable psycho / loser, it was a nun. Nun wants to eliminate girls from sin, blah blah, girls accidentally / deliberately drown nun, blah blah, nun haunts girls, people die, movie ends. The only thing that made it traceable was the scenes of death that were pretty cool (especially where the elevator door hanged on the hands of this fat woman), but even they couldn't do that great movie. Brian Yuzna should confirm his head to refuse. I'm sure I'm glad I rented it and didn't buy it, or I would be unbelievable. If you want to attract nunsploitation, look at Demonia or something. Stay away from this garbage.
