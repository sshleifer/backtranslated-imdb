Forgive me, but the work of director Peter Hall is terrible. If you can't get us a lot, why not kill someone's cat or dog. It will definitely reach the audience. This viewer is tired to see that animals have been sacrificed for the film. And believe me, I saw it before opening the package. When predictable you can. Take the cute animal then kill it terribly. I've never been a fan of De Mornay and this performance tells me why. With an oral and somewhat stagnant interpretation, I found it quite stupid and forever boring. I liked Banderas, but I felt bad that he had to play against De Mornay. He has done much better in other films, namely "Philadelphia", where he was honest in his dialogue. In this chestnut he did his best to keep his character real. But the writers, Green & Rush, did a good job of blocking it with their tiny story and insane dialogue. Please do not let us undergo such entertainment. Some of us are not stupid nervous plots, sluggish and generally long-term dialogue. Seeing him go away with him, made me furious.
