The film begins with a 30-minute explanation of war, human cyborgs, battles, history, and then two players in a gravel mine. They travel around the gravel well / desert area for about an hour shooting each other. That's it. Must make around Â£ 10.00 to make the change. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Note from Ten: Acting -9 sets 1 Costumes -9 Direction -50 Production 1 Title intro 4 <br /> <br /> I think this film would be improved by: Lose comment. (Let the observer decide what is happening). Remove some terrible CGI. Add some techno-rave music to it. They can just save it .......
