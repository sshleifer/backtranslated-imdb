Imagining the character of Ichabodi Crane was so incredibly unlikely that my wife and I were hoping that a rider (or some other character) would not only let Crane's head down but do it slowly and painfully. <br /> <br /> This Brent Carver man played it up as he was on Broadway. And he was such a relentless jackass that we had no compassion for him. <br /> <br /> I could continue to criticize this film for failure, but I do not want to devote energy. <br /> <br /> Just leave it out and go to the Johnny Depp version. Do it or rent a sleepy Hollow Haunted Pumpkin (animated). It's pretty good - fun for kids and adults. <br /> <br /> Better yet, read the original story of Washington's Irving.
