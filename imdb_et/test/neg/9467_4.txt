The titles of this review are the first lines of this film's playground, the song "My Favorite Things", "My Favorite Things", an excellent demented parody. And this fun little detail is not the only aspect that makes "The Body Shop" aka. "Doctor Gore" (1973) recommended to my fellow Gore / Trash fans. The film, which was created almost entirely by J.G. Patterson Jr., acting as producer, writer, director and leading man under the name of Dr Gore, is no doubt, but it is also undoubtedly fun and that all involved people, especially Patterson, were aware that they didn't do it exactly the masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dr. Brandon (Patterson) famous but totally crazy plastic surgeon loses his beloved wife Anitra in an accident. With his hunchbacked assistant, Greg (Roy Mehaffey), he now kidnaps beautiful young women to build a new, perfect woman from his body parts ... <br /> <br /> "Doctor Gore" is undoubtedly a movie "so bad it's good â€œBut it also has features that go beyond normal laughing. Mad science has always been one of my absolute favorite fear themes and is actually one of the coolest topics for ridiculous Gore trash bins. Probably fired with a minimal budget, "Doctor Gore" honors "Frankenstein" films, especially James Whale's masterpiece "Frankenstein's Bride" (1935), and looks like the appearance of early Troma / Herschell Gordon Lewis Gore tiles like "Blood Feast" (1963) - only it looks much cheaper and crappier. Apparently, J.G. Patterson's motive was not only to have fun to amuse: Being rather ugly, looking at the companion, his dr. Brandon's role for Patterson is to make a couple of hot, barely dressed young women (who later ended up as a donor built in Dr. Brandon's lab). <br /> <br /> Most gore is pretty well done on a small budget. The dialog includes some very fun features ("Get it, it may be a door ... and put the coat so they don't see you being a fraudster."). In addition to the aforementioned theme song, "Doctor Gore" also includes a tasteful look from a national band called "Bill Hicks and Rainbows" - my new favorite band, NOT. For the rest of the movie, I wondered if Bill Hicks and Roy Mehaffey, who play the tempted assistant, are twins or even the same person - these two look exactly the same and have two independent obese, red-bearded men who would look strange in one movie watching it coincidence. Other than J.G. Patterson, most of the majority did not make any other film. This is the first movie Patterson has seen from a couple. Unfortunately, in 1975, a man died of cancer. <br /> <br /> In general, Doctor Gore is a movie that's definitely not for everyone. In fact, it's a complete mess. But it's also fun and recommended for my companions who are strange and cheap camp things. Dictionaries should display a screenshot below this trash flick.
