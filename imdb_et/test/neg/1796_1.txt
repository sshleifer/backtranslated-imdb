After a bit of a novel, Heart of Darkness, I watched the movie to see what was complete and absolute disappointment. At first I assumed that the film would help to put together a book puzzle. However, although I read the novel, the film didn't make any sense at all, so I couldn't imagine if I had lost the book if I had missed the book at all. It seemed that the writers picked out their favorite items and put them in a movie and left out something that could help viewers understand the pointless plot. This terrible movie didn't make sense at all, and I would strongly advise you not to look at it because it does nothing more than leave you completely confused and confused.
