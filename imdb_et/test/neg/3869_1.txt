"You know - I've been in some cities where the girls were not really beautiful. In fact, I've been to some town where they're ugly. But this is the first time I was in a city with no girls at all." that the great classic fans remember this phrase that belongs to Vin ... one of TRULY's magnificent seven (first movie) ... <br /> <br /> Now I would like to express her here again. You know, I've seen some movies where the plot is not so good. In fact, I've seen some movies where the plot is terrible, but it's the first time I saw a movie that doesn't have any plot at all. <br /> <br /> OK. Maybe my above statement is a bit up, but honestly ... how can you call the plot that is going on in this movie. A bad guy (oh, don't ask me to give you my name, because I don't remember, and he's not even close to Calvera, who is the name and character unforgettable ...) trying to build a church named after his recent sons who were killed in a battle, and this bad boy kidnaps the poor villagers to force them to build a church ... <br /> <br /> First, how big must a church be to force hundreds of villagers to build ... is it some Egyptian pyramids or something? but OK, we stop here with a bad boy's plot and an absolutely forgetting character and say a few words about ourselves ... <br /> <br /> Yul brynner's good old Chris, always calm, always quiet, spoke less, but wise wise is missing (unfortunately). Oh no ... he's as calm as he was ... but now he's calm so fake that you just don't buy it. (imagine that he will meet a good old friend Chico, whom he has to rescue in so many years, and there is only a few "hi, hello" and not even a handshake (as far as I can remember) more like two strangers in some internet chat, not Chris and Chico. It makes "new Chris" rather than a robocop or terminator rather our beloved hotkey ... <br /> <br /> I don't stop here with other characters. Just nothing ... (imagine how a strong actor like Yul Brynner is so much fake, what other characters look like) ... <br /> <br /> There are still some attempts to give each of us background information. for example, one woman is a favorite man, the other is a man in the dark past, whom the Indians raped and killed, and since then has killed everything and everything that moves ... but these characters have no meaning, or none of them take your heart. <br /> <br /> I remember being a little child and when O'reilly (character of Charles Bronson) died in the first movie crying. Here I just didn't care about either of them ... even if all of them die with the whole movie team, I don't seem to care any more ... <br /> <br /> So, please go and see this movie ... I recommend this because you have no other way of seeing anything worse than then.
