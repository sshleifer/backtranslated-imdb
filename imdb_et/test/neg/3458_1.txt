CRAP! I accidentally watched this film's way of thinking that a stream of swimming appeared in 2003. I am deeply sorry for wasting one hour of my life. Shame, who gave this spam award. I looked at this movie thoroughly - in fact, I didn't see it to the end. After an hour I couldn't stand it anymore. I'm disgusting that people are entertained by such a harsh script that catches and does not violate ten other human interests and such BA-AD activities. PAINFUL. I appreciate it with 1 star 10. The amateur can do a lot much bigger movie.
