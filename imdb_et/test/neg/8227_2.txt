Image of a couple of college kids in my former hometown, this film focuses on some "luther". Recently parked by Luther (revealed to us by a password pad in one of the most ridiculous scenes of time) runs in the local Kroger food, eating his old woman's neck with his metal teeth. <br /> <br /> Luther runs a farm where he eats a dude, steals a car, binds an old woman and goes hunting and killing. Oh, and the SUPERBOY TV show chick gets naked.
