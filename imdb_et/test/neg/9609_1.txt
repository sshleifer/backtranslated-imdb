There is so much to dislike about this exhibition that it's hard to know where to start. Unlikely characters, terrible plots, terrible writing and terrible action. Don't even start with uncomfortable theme music. <br /> <br /> Moreover, this exhibition has not been in contact with the United States audience, as all of Canada has heavy references throughout Canada. "Tell Derek whether you're going to Queens College in the autumn! How are you beans? We should wait." <br /> <br /> It has been said that other exhibitions have been filmed in Canada for financial reasons such as Stargate: Atlantis, but although these exhibitions have suffered some outrage (as Rodney called ZPM "Zed-PM"), they did not show focus on life in canada. <br /> <br /> MTV runs Degras (the second show based on the Canadian teenage experience) during the day when no one spends time (most teenagers are in school if it breathes). I put it for the same reason. Shows that focusing on teenage life in Canada does not translate well into the US audience. <br /> <br /> This show should be canceled and the rest of the masters burned in the oven.
