Leave this Hollywood version, real garbage. A cheap offense to the glorious original "Spoorloos" or the English title "The Vanishing". It was completely unnoticeable from the typical, grotesque Hollywood fashion, usually due to the bean counters for a bunch of talented companies who have no idea of ​​something artistic, they are just looking for a "successful formula" and want it to be applied to everyone's income. Similar to the terrible "Scarlet Letter" made in 1995, which spun the original story so much as to fit the MacDonaldsland crowd, that it became aberration, not even a bastard, but a bunch of shapes that are similar in shape but do not look, feel or even far from the spirit of the original. Except for this movie, which had at least Gary Oldman, who is interesting to see something he does. This dog has nothing to do with it, even the most talented Jeff Bridges are embarrassed. A great tragedy is not, and should never be, a "good film of the year", but rather one or more, unfortunately, too frequent tragic events in life and allows the reader / viewer to draw meaning and understanding of a person's condition. br /> <br /> Take a great advantage if you are looking for a rental and leave this grotesque garbage and take the original Dutch / French collaboration in 1988. This is a great movie. This is a terrible mess.
