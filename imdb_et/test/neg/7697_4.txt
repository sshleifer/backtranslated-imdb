I saw this short movie from Ridley Scot's The Duellists movie. Scott had no film introduction, it just started right away. <br /> <br /> Boy and bicycle are hardly an example of Ridley Scott's second job, it is not similar. The film shows a boy playing Tony Scott around the bike. Guess? That's pretty much what's happening. The boy rides around, hesitating and meaningless with a confusing dialogue. The film was filmed in black and white, and as it was directed by Ridley Scott, I waited for some cool cinematography or visually striking sets. Instead, something was treated for me. This film is not even good for the first effort. However, I recommend that every Ridley Scott fan should review it at least once.
