I think that in 1997, Hollywood was not publicly celebrating homosexuality, so maybe I'd like to give them a credit to put this movie together to show some courage. One just wants credit to be given to them to bring a really good movie together, and in my opinion "In & Out" does not qualify for this list. This is the story of Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline), an English teacher of a small town high school, who, on the eve of his wedding, is a former student who happens to win an Oscar and who then has to go through what can only be described as a self-evident period when he reaches a homosexual situation. For me, this was the first problem with this movie. Howard didn't really have to be gay. The film would have been more funny (and perhaps even more thoughtlessly provocative) when Brackett was carelessly straightened, despite the stereotypical gay aspects of his life and the city's faith after Oscar's speech that he was gay. (Actually, I thought that the existence of these stereotypes in identifying him as gay could actually be quite offensive to the gay community, but also straight men who love poetry and believe in the relationship properly!) <br /> <br /> wore. Apart from him, most of the other cast members (though fine actors) were people who didn't succeed on the big screen. People like Tom Selleck and Wilford Brimley and Bob Newhart are good actors, but not big movie stars. I actually thought that the more fun (than very small) role in the movie was the supermodel Sonya played by actor named Shalom Harlow (speaking of stereotypes, I loved my oh-so stereotypical model line), what I promised to do I have to shower and vomit! Finally, what really turned me off on this movie was the ridiculous ending that started at the graduation ceremony (and frankly, even if someone decided that termination was really necessary, the film should be finished instead of continuing with totally unnecessary weddings. ) <br /> <br /> Basically I got some but nothing else
