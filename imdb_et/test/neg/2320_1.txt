For some reason, my father gave me a copy of this tape. I think my big uncle, Buddy Baer, ​​was the giant of this movie and my father-in-law thought I'd like to see it. I had been a child for years and then I didn't like my son. My son, then two, looked at it and was hooked. Every wake-up time in front of the television played this terrifying video. I went to work when the songs were left in my head. Two "controls" were worse than higher-level surveys. The dancers looked like the refusals to slip the Ed Wood's horror and Abbot and Costello called in their parts. Fortunately, I was able to disturb my son long enough to lose this videotape. Frankly, I think it was "The Ring". <br /> <br /> Buddy Baer is Jethro UNCLE (Max Baer, ​​Jr.), not his father, to repair another reviewer. 0 out of 10.
