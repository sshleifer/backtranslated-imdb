Adding only the people who considered it "unacceptable", I note the following without showing the obvious FLAWS, which some commentators have clearly said: "Film" is captured on video (which type of camera I do not do) t) notice), but on the operator it was all the time in AUTOFOCUS (!) so some easy movement turns it on and off. In many scenes, the actors themselves go out of focus for their scenes. It alone screams "Amateur". <br /> <br /> I also noticed that the sound of the gasoline generator that lights up the lights ... can be heard in the middle of the spice. /> <br /> Also that follows one light source (and on several occasions leads participants) moving around. It looks like a newspaper with a camera light that follows people who are like luminaires. There was no credit for lighting design / DP and I know why. The filmmakers did not see the need for someone who actually knew the light of the picture (note that I didn't say the movie). So be prepared for a single spot of outstanding attention as the source of exclusive cinematographic lighting for most movies. UGhhh !!! <br /> <br /> This is probably the most technically unavailable production I've ever released commercially. I bought this title because I like the bad cinema. It is usually so bad that you can laugh at it. It's just so bad that it's invisible. The ninth plan of the outer space is "Citizen Kane" compared to its title.
