If one movie star is called Sticky Fingaz, you should know enough to stay away. Stay away. HOUSE 2 is just the same, this time with zombies that cross college college (man, how it has to save money). As usual, "zombies" do not give any direction that speaks, and gave very little makeup or costume. They look like zombies in one of these endless Italian zombies that are cheap since years. That means they don't see the zombies we know and love from George Romero and Dan O'Bannon's zombie clips. People who fight zombies are all non-factors who shoot weapons and do little else. Some who have written here feel that the sequel is a little more focused than the original. I have to say that I am pleased that the successor's director continued the 360-degree contribution to the shots that helped to destroy the first film. HOUSE 2 is still the same, which means that nothing happens in 80 or 90 minutes. There's one set of soldiers with a zombie football team that could have been at least funny. This is not.
