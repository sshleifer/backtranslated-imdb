This morning I found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie was there. I found myself thinking, "Oh yes, there was Mr. Magoo's movie, isn't it?" This is more surprising because I remember this film after a contradiction (the visually impaired group said that the film was humiliating). I even went to see this movie on the opening day because I'm a fan of Mr. Magoo and Mr. Nielson, if I thought he would be a great choice for playing Mr. Magoo. I even remember animated animated credits because I thought they were pretty fun. <br /> <br /> After that, it's all empty. I think it's a pretty sad statement about any movie that is so flat, so cute and so worthy of it that you don't remember it. I understand that Leslie Nielson is not always known for first-class comedies, but I saw her "Spy Hard", "Scary Movie 4" and "Police Squad 3" and none of them was a great movie, but I remembered at least * something *. Mr. Magoo, however, is completely empty. <br /> <br /> I think I now thought that if all the film-related contradictions were not really created by this studio, in the hope of creating a little bit of little interest in an otherwise totally worthless movie.
