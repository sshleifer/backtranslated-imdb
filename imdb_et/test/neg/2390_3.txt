Although it is not a complete waste of time, the eighteenth was not all lovely when he was pretending. Also, are they not the age of the actors they represent? 18, my butt. McKellen could actually have shown in the film that he was 30 years old and asked us to believe it. Even Michael J. Fox was more plausible than doing "Back to the Future" in Parts II and III (okay, maybe not; they're probably the same credibility). either perfect action or superfluous action (Paul Anthony's so-called silence, Clarence Sponagle's lifetime moments, and while I am in favor of Brendan Fletcher, it is best to watch him and more, Freddy Vs. Jason), incomprehensible scenes (faster than Britney Spears marriage, incest to prove the point and the man who needs help to urinate but still has one hand free? I think it was the writer's fantasy), the whole movie from despicable characters (Anthony can play someone who is 18 years old but acts like him there are 12 and some odd "john" thrown so that Anthony's character Pip can save the day? Did the baby really have sex sex? sexuality with strange activities / scenes. For the positive side I enjoyed the voice of Ian McKellen, seeing (rarely depicted) ) straight / gay friendship, puppy love (someone who gathers stuffed puppies, ie), good score, some decent dialogue (love segregation) gays and pedophilia? would love it) and act as a female (also cumming). I can't really recommend it because it's really trying to be too many things? gay tolerance, gay hustling, homelessness, WWII epic, priesthood, first love, faulty judges etc etc? fish festival.
