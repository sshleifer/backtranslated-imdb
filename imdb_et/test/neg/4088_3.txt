Although I am not too much a religious person, I still had relatively high hopes for this film because of its amazing Steve Carrell, and its prequel, Bruce Almighty, was actually a creative and clever Christian-themed comedy. But Evan Almighty does not come close to the original originality and freshness and cannot decide whether it is a comedy or a sentimental film of faith and family values. If it had chosen one clear path to focus on these topics, it could have realized its potential, but the result of these two blends is a film with a very flat and dry sense of humor, a cheerful dialogue and motives that try to give the film a lot, but practically offensive to the intelligence of the audience and the very confusing and blurry of the film's opaque message. It was very evident that Evan Almighty was very poorly written, the film has numerous plot holes and elements that make no sense. For example, while a large number of exotic animals across the planet appear to Evan when it builds a flood to rescue a ship, is their inclusion really necessary if the only "flood" that is taking place in the film is in the neighborhood of downtown Washington and the suburbs, which means they don't not to destroy the danger? Filmmakers seem to be lacking in originality to modernize the Bible's story, and instead of doing so at this time, without changing the plot of land, leaving many of the elements that simply do not fit into it, making it an idiotic motif and writing a film. All in all, this work is tragic because Steve Carrell and Wanda Sykes are not exposed to the ability to act because they are wonderful signs, and it was so badly written that it tends to deviate from many of the film's themes and is affected by mocking the first film. Finally, Evan Almighty is also offensive to this brilliant actor and any semi-intelligent movement, because it is both unhappy.
