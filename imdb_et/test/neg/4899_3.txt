This is a shame Barry Humphries' infamous Sir Les Patterson character was the debut of this film in this cooked spy / comedy. <br /> <br /> This film reminded me of Beatty / Hoffman's shark Ishtar (1987). Humphries should have learned about the mistakes made in the movie - if you intend to change gear on the concept, DO NOT USE! Like Ishtar, the first 20 minutes offer something different. It would have been nice to see that the anachronistic and nervous Patterson splits the Australian policy in the world. One of the signs even suggests that Patterson is confident for the present time - you think Humphires would have had a field day to comment on Hawke's government (I can take a picture of a scene with Patterson and Hawkie at a drinking competition). But instead of the film that might have been a clever and even biting look at this world, we can run Patterson around the world when James Bond tries to save the world from bio-chemical weapons that end in steam before the half-mark. <br /> <br /> Fraud.
