I saw it in my in-house house one night when it appeared on television and my mother said it was one of her favorite films. Well, he can do it. <br /> <br /> Look, I can get the chick flick now and as long as it's good. But it is extraordinary, unrealistic, and simply predictable, despite some of Hudson's and Hane's good performances. It's unpleasant how fast a woman can agree to see her taken away. Well, they say love is blind ... <br /> <br /> A nice and clean happy ending that almost cut me. And how often did we need Otto Kruger to repeat the title? It happened not once, not twice, only three times!
