Before I really flick this movie, I just want to say I love it absolutely. First, how many times did the characters in the movie have the phrase "You're Right"? I'm sure I thought for centuries before I gave up and started watching the movie again. <br /> <br /> Second, what the hell is these blue monkeys doing? OK, so the Dansen family led a very private life and was one of the blue eyes of one brown eye, but since then it has turned people into carnivore blue zombie creatures. <br /> <br /> and finally: 'Old faithful here to protect me' hahaha :)
