It's just another bad film by Chuck Norris. Norris plays the traces of the wounded attacks by police women. He took the boy three years ago, but he gets him somehow through the nutshell bars he uses using what looks like a dentist. Then the killer escapes in a cleaning car and drives over 400 feet of rock and survives to spend time in a refurbished theater. Irish Jack O'Halloran is the best thing in this movie, but like Superman II, he doesn't say a word. Somehow it should threaten him more. Ron O'Neal's Super Fly fame and Steve James have wasted the city mayor and Norris' sidekicki. The film also includes the idiotic subgroup of Norris and his girlfriend, who have a child outside marriage; it is so in the 1980s. When you join Norris' "serious" actor and the overall musical hint that announces every forthcoming scene in a predictable way, the movie becomes a cleaning job. The structure that arises during the quest for a killer in the theater is interesting enough when Norris climbs through the shadows to discover the hidden path, but the end-of-the-fight is disappointing in such a promising way. Cannon Films is another disappointment and it plays like a movie made for television. * 4 stars.
