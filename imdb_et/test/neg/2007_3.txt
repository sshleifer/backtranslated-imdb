Wow, there's a lot of poison directed at this movie, and a lot of it is deserved, but it's not all the time the film. (This is probably "Zoolander".) <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you are something, really drunk or just in the mood of a "B-minus" movie, you can make it fun. <br /> <br /> Yes, as others said, the first part of the movie probably makes you look at the Bram Stoker novel. The two main characters are called Van Helsing and Me, the ship is Demeter and they are in the Carpathian Galaxy. Later you will find that Van Helsing is the offspring of the original and it just happens in the 30th century with Dracula. Suuuuuuuuuuure. <br /> <br /> Oh, and to add originality, this "spooky ghost ship" has another mark called Ash. Familiar are familiar? <br /> <br /> There's a paper-thin character and anachronisms like the aforementioned manual wheelchair and Coolio and Tom Lister, who talk about the 20th century black slang. But what really makes the movie ridiculous is the end. If the characters happen, the waste has been two hours before. <br /> <br /> As I said, you want to see a fool playing the "Mystery Science Theater" and your mind is about the same mode you need to watch the "Great Vegetable Rebellion" episode of LOST IN SPACE so you can find it redirecting. Otherwise, put this bet, it's done.
