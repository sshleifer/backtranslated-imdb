The thought is that Dionne Warwick is making a song for the vocalist Jacqueline Susan's best-selling book (la "Puppet org") ... although it is really too bad, this is not the silvery Patty Duke's Neely O'Hara. The "Love Machine" is really boring. Even a final hit (with Academy Award Fighting!) Can't save it. Dyan Cannon seems to be in his heavy pancake with mild and clumsy falling embalmed (although his small, suntanned figure is a beauty to see), John Phillip Law is a leading wooden block, David Hemmings, in a gay-style terrible photographer. And where does Robin Stone walk at the end? Does he travel to the waterline to get some sailors? If Cannon had cleared his masculinity, he would be sure. In this case, "Love Machine - The Final Episode" could be an interesting flick. Certainly it is better than this awakening snooze opera. * 1/2 from ****
