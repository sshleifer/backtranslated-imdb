Yes, on the cover of this movie I had a wish to watch this movie as a child. This was called "Screamer" with this particular cover labeled "Men turned out!". It was even this twisted-looking skeleton on the lid that made all kinds of cool pictures in my mind. Maybe a movie about a strange virus that caused human flesh to burn, perhaps a movie about unnatural zombies that are more bloody than what you usually send, a science experiment that went unbelievably wrong and now strange men whose flesh drips on their bones go rampage. Yes, all of these thoughts ran through me, one who wasn't a fish boy on some of the islands where virtually no gore and everything was drilled. This movie is really a dr. Moreau Island as nothing else and, frankly, the film longed for me, it is five of the many scientists and not tasty enough for my taste. These films bring a lot of taste and not enough blood to my taste. Yes, I know I have a strange taste, but I can't help it, I like my horror movies either really bloody or fast moving, and this movie is not really exciting.
