Probably the biggest thing about Wild Rebels, which is the most painful, is the hero. He has a LOSER written all over him, but it doesn't stop him from "getting a girl". Probably one of the worst racers in the world who thinks he will stop racing after the car has fallen. Well, his new job is still racing, because he chooses a biker type to ride in the car when they commit crimes. Rod is not really tempted, even the situation where he is thrown is pretty stupid. Finally, in the lighthouse scene, you want Rod to die with all cyclists. Get it: He's twice, once in his hand and once on his leg, and still manages to step up the stairs. If only Jeeter had a better goal ... <br /> <br /> Avoid this if you don't look at the MST3K version.
