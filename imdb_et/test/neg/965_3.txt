Sometimes, Hallmark can get it right - like the 10th kingdom - but many of their fantasy movies are in the final category. I've seen that the version I saw is cut (demon [?], Shown in trailer and ad photos), but the movie that made the movie shorter can only be a blessing. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILERS HOW TO ASK FOR ORIGINAL REASON: <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie will update the story to the beginning of the 20th century (?) and Gerda and Kay (here called Kai-le Lex) will be a fan, I waited for him to say that "the dead do not solve the puzzles" 18-year-olds. The main story of Hans Christian Andersen is being tracked: the boy gets his ice in his eye, goes bad, the snow queen removes it for solving the palace, and Gerda is going to find him by taking different adventures on the road. <br /> <br /> Since the two main characters are older than the original, it takes a lot of time to get them together and fall in love. Unfortunately, I was never convinced that they were particularly in love and certainly not in love enough to understand Gerda's endeavor. By the time the main project starts, the pace of the film has slowed down. Unfortunately, when Gerda starts to look for Kai, he can just pick up a peaceful walk. <br /> <br /> A story that seems to go somewhere is a few strange improvements. At the beginning of the movie, Snow Queen Gerda kills her mother, but it is not explained. The iceberg living in the Snow Queen palace is more than it seems (though it is probably because the producers realized that the bear's feelings about the snow queen would be a fairy tale, but not in a modern movie). Again, it has never been explained. There are also clues that Snow Queen has an erotic desire for Kai, but never. The script is also full of anachronies that really make you feel like a "fairy tale". <br /> <br /> Production looks good, although there is evidence of penny crushing: The Snow Queen Palace is a hotel where Gerda and Kai lived with ice. The three main characters are played with different successes: Kai appears on the spot like Gerda, but when he finds Kai, who is warm to him. Bridget Fonda looks great like Snow Queen but seems to be in a different movie for everyone else. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the film is dissatisfied. It looks good but drags and doesn't have magic.
