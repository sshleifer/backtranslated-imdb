Oh yes, I testify that I am guilty of seeing this trash. I can't say that the foreigners forced me to force the gun on my head, tied me in the chair and made it impossible for me to close my eyes, and then this terrible apology turned on the film. No, I did it with free will. I deliberately tortured myself. Let's go through this fact. - Action is an insult to humanity. - The plot (if any) is ridiculous. - The development of characters is terrible - the characters in the movie are clich√©s that you would understand from your usual comic book. - Editing is sloppy and unimaginable. - Camera operation is low. - Dialogue is just the worst thing about film history. - Leadership: Well, let's say I bet it wasn't Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> There were never so many talents to add to these facts. The director must now smoke to forgive himself for this poison in the world. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Passport in Paris is one of the worst films. Persistent!
