I watched the first 10 minutes of this show, which I think I was coming now! One of the worst shows on television. It's not even funny. It's so flat it's nasty. I gave her a second and a third change for five minutes. Don't waste time. This is one of many examples that have to go. Talking about regular night time, you have to go. All CBS exhibitions. All exhibitions at ABC. All shows at FOX and Joe Buck. All new CW network exhibitions. All exhibitions at NBC (Accept The Law and Order series). The whole morning and afternoon chat shows. All television broadcasts by the European Court of Justice. And every reality shows there! Every stupid game shows. to the end! All home improvement shows! And all the media news. it is all. Is there a 24 hour bad news loop. Yes, I have favorites for Monk, Law and Orders for me.
