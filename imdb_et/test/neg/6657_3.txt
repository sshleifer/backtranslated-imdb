This plot had more holes than the OJ Simpson alibi! <br /> <br /> I noticed two Star Trek references in the movie and ironically, we have a wizard that Andy Garcia plays against <br /> <br /> who is the opposite of Vulcan's philosophy, "Many Needs > <br /> Needs to be considered by few or one. " Let's just say that trying to save your son from cancer will put most of the rest of San Francisco at risk. Michael Keaton's character is also unrealistic. He does not want to kill many opportunities and is angry when Garcia foils try to kill police at the same time. The child's doctor is responsible for his faculties even after he had taken hostages several times over a short period of time, but he put the tracks on the wide footpath and loses it. <br /> <br /> Andy Garcia's Child is Anatema in this sense <br /> <br /> He is the most sympathetic and real character, one of the bright spots of the film. In addition, he talks about the line that must be caused by serendipity in the fight against cancer, which is equivalent to Keaton's motivation to escape. All in all, the movie was not a complete trash (see Dusk to Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money <br /> <br />), but disappointing in terms of talent.
