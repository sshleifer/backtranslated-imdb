Flat is really the best way to describe this movie. It has a real bad script, an uninteresting dialog, and characters, and it's not just about anything else. <br /> <br /> Too many characters and the problem is that you don't care about them. The lack of a movie is one of the good and clear main characters. Instead, the film has a little bit of it, it's a little hero, has a little bit of love, and has a little villain. I want it to be just a little less Ghoulies, although they are mostly very annoying in this movie. <br /> <br /> Ghoulies are supposed to be devilish beings that murder joy. In this movie, however, everything they want to do is drink beer and watch naked college girls. Moreover, someone had a "brilliant" idea to let Ghouliesel speak at that time. It really works badly and tediously. Ghoulie dolls were definitely updated for this movie and they are more detailed and able to do more, but at the same time they are more fake than previous Ghoulies films. <br /> <br It is clear that this film's goal this time was more comedy than horror. The film is like a flat 80-year-old high school comedy (although this film was released in 1991). It's humor is really the worst and worst thing in the whole movie. It is so incredibly annoying and not at all funny. The story doesn't go anywhere with its story, and the movie is just basically one big mess that never seems to end. The line of the Ghoulies plot seems to be basically anything else in the line with other line lines that include human characters. The film is not about the terrorizing Ghoulies of the college, where people try to hunt and stop them. It is no surprise that this is Brent Olson's only written film. He just doesn't get the talent and I think he has discovered it and has returned to college. <br /> <br /> Even compared to previous Ghoulies movies; this movie is just terrible! <br /> <br /> 2/10
