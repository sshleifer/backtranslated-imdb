I saw the movie many times and every time I am more and more frustrated, which is a shame, because the EX YU films are usually very good. The shame here is that Holiwood tried to shoot from a place and people who have no idea. My own coming from the Balkans (Macedonia) found that this film was disappointing. Just that Bosnian characters are not understood and not really depicted. To understand the human mentality of EX YU, you need to know their background, the way of life that makes them cry and laugh. And the film's director didn't take it for granted. When we (EX YU) make films, we build a lot of symbols that make the characters recognizable and pleasing, and mostly represent the truth (if it is based on a real story). Movies like "Pritty Village, Real Flame", "Tito and Me", "Underground", "No Mans Land", "Rain Before", "Black Cat, White Cat", "Otac na sluzbenom Putt", Rarely is a Balkan cinematic masterpiece and nothing can be compared to it, not a half-baked story and a Holiwood studio, as someone mentioned in the panel that the story jumps from one end of the city to Sorry, but when the film is made, it's not only for the American armchair, but for the rest of the world, and some of them live in the Balkans and Sarajevo. in case of injury, half of the things come from Bitola in Macedonia where I come. ng scene movie, where the bride is to shoot the sniper.And what was it to add real shots to the news covering the movie? Anyway, it is very disappointing because the truth is far from the movie. It is a shame that nobody consulted real people on how to live in Sarajevo before they filmed. The book is one thing and the real life is another, and this movie lets both down.
