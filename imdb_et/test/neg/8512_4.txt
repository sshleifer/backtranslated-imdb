Shirley Temple's films about the twentieth century fox are not insignificant because they are poorly made (Darryl F. Zanuck watched most of them); they do not preserve most of the "classic" landscape among cinematographic films mainly because they are weighed with the depressive Hollywood syrup optimism. The audience of the 1930s was pleased to see a dusky, often orphaned girl, that adults would see fools (they worried and twisted their hands when she danced her troubles). Seeing them years later, Temple vehicles are barely a story (always supported by musical sequences to strengthen content), and its timing (always too perfect) and exaggerated reactions can leave the most modern viewers running their eyes. No one could be blamed for their astonishment over the performances of the Temple (screaming lines at the top of their lungs) or the perversity of their dance stages, which may have been with the sailor's "At the Codfish Ball". However, the fantasy aspect of this story, previously filmed in 1924 by Laura E. Richard, is enough to draw them into the spirit of right saccharin. It seems Shirl pulled a ship accident by a government-appointed lighthouse keeper, but when a public official finds out it's not in school, he is threatening to take away the child. It is not really important if a brown-faced officer has the idea that the temple has not been properly raised (the woman has almost immediately become an old-fashioned man); you can see right away that the temple can be kept, taking care of yourself and your parent's guardian (as well as a local widow with hooks as captain). The temple is not the only thing that was practiced too much; Guy Kibbee's January is considered to be a wide-ranging response so often that you don't know if he was filming one day. The dialogue is within the waterfront metaphors ("You can't rush the trout!" ... "Well, don't give up the ship!), And anything from the whole company looks strange embarrassed. ** from *** *
