Don Wilson stands for Jack Cutter (Ooh is a real harsh name!) A vampire cutter who rises against a vampire army will see that the story is a bit different, because vampires can't be killed with silver, cross or sunlight, but rather to hit the neck (as a comfortable budget cut) and this is here Cutter enters the reporter (Melanie Smith of Trancers III fame). The sequences of Night Hunter's action shake for some reason during combat sequences, and while it is meant to emphasize mood, it simply makes the movie more banging. What's even worse is that these struggle sequences are botched unbelievable because Wilson's martial arts concealment is disguised as a clutter. Of course, the most interested is that it is already in front of Blade, but the problem is that it was done with a small budget and it was Don Wilson. It's Roger Corman, and it's basically a turkey movie that most people wouldn't see. Unfortunately, I'm the bottom feeder and I'm serving the store's part, looking for precious stones, in this row you always work in turf. With Night Hunter I can just be stinking the world. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * 4 (Awful)
