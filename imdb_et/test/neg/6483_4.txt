At the height of Al Jolson's popularity and the Warner Brothers Jazz Singer, who was the highest gross weight in 1927, it was inevitable that other studios would put a few vehicles out of their Jolson-esquire characters. But even though Jazz Singer felt that he was the first to talk, Matinée Idol has no singing voice (now hidden by Johnnie Walker) and only has to do with his visual manifestations. <br /> <br /> Matinée Idol was known at the beginning of Frank Capra. Capra's first few full-length features for Harry Langdon show a very vivid, overly-styled style that made Langdon's mediocre slapstick almost invisible. A couple of photos later and Capra has learned to somewhat relieve, with some regular and decent camera work. However, he is still not able to do physical comedy. The longest comic routine - staging - seems to be some good gags, but it's all cut into different corners of the camera, and the comedy can't naturally flow from the performances. Theoretically, a good part of the jokes are in the headlines, but there are too many of them and none of them are very funny. <br /> <br /> Capra is, of course, a mature beautiful and romantic director, and you will see that she is starting to develop in this respect. He truncates the line by closing the Walker and Bessie love scene, where he first sees him in Don Wilson, to rise up a literal link between them. Then, in a couple of mines, there are a couple of beautiful and delicate framing that resembles the scenes of love at the beginning of the 30s of Capra. <br /> <br /> Johnnie Walker, Columbia's response to Al Jolson, is not an extraordinary talent. His comic timing is good, but there is nothing to make him stand out. Bessie Love, however, is a pretty good actor with a very expressive face. Knit him to deal with physical comedy and lose his dignity with boys. Lionel Belmore also has a good role, which seems to appear to be an up and coming character actress in the late 20s and early 30s. <br /> <br /> More than his fair share thanks to his director, who later made a handful of masterpieces. Even this is a very uninteresting piece and, like most of Capra's works, before he met Robert Riskin, he was disappointed.
