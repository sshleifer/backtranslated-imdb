Why C Thomas Howell Doing These Movies? Cruise (a one-off star from Howell) makes WOTW's and Howell's tremendous hit with this flat effort. <br /> <br /> Where do I start here? Product Values ​​- Start with Good Things. The look and feel of some of the scenes in this film is not too bad to remain honest. The settings are good spots and the direction is not too bad. <br /> <br /> Script - terrible. A series of stupid scenes that could have been placed in any order that would appeal to the entire movie. Many times, when the scene blackened black and reemerged second in the same room, it was innumerable. A very bad story (but it was also the Cruise WOTW) takes some accusations, but the debilitating scenario kills it. <br /> <br /> Special FX - Okay, I don't want to be too harsh because I imagine the budget was less than the cruise on the cruise - but in the overall context of the movie, the consequences are bad. Some pictures are quite impressive - mostly far from destructive bridges, from Washington, the liner. But the "alien" machines and tentacles are basically terrible. Also, the quality of the camera is fuzzy on some shots and cuts it completely with others. <br /> <br /> Act - I'm a fan of Howell, but since he has reduced himself, he has long gone back to "overactive" error. See her performance at The Hitcher and compare it to this movie. There is no comparison. He exaggerated his facial expressions, sliding hands and feet (where he got that running style) and, in the final coup, looked at the scene where he lost his family's photo. Hysterical. But after all this - he is still the best actor. Busey is embarrassed to watch and Peter Green (Zed is now dead baby) mumbles insecurely through his single scene. I could not honestly understand one of the words he said - I even went so far as to try to allow subtitles for this scene - but the DVD didn't have subtitles. It also seems to be a real family thing, because Howell's son, director's wife and line producer make this movie. None of them are good. <br /> <br /> Direction - not bad, but not good. <br /> <br /> Score - loss. <br /> <br /> do nothing for Howell when he tried to bring it back for a long time. He should look at Rourke and try to find out how he did the A list, but if he does such things he doesn't have enough careers. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
