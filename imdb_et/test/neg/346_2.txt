I think you can't imagine how these people actually work ... !! Before I came to the studio to watch the boys' work there, I thought quite the same way as you. But since I saw and worked on the boys of this TV show, I have to say that they really deserve respect for what they do all day. It's not really a simple job. And the actors who may be terribly bad in your eyes are really big people and many of them are really capable of acting! I do not believe that the material given to them can really show that this material is not very good. But they are really good! So I don't believe you, before you see these men working there, get a judge over them! And I shouldn't have decided on them before I met them, but I did it and I am very ashamed now. So please don't let yourself decide about these great people if you haven't seen them working there.
