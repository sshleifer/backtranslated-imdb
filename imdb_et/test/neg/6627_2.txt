Or at least predictable retirement! This movie is terrible, terrible, terrible, rank, purulent, messy ... well, you get the idea. NEVER look at this decaying rubbish if you do not have the desire to die because it is definitely your killing. (I survived only because I didn't miss the first half hour.) Carrot Top is a bad comedian and even worse actor. I can't believe he's got someone to fund that big time and the waste of money. It just shows that some people have no disruption when they think they can make a belt or two (literally ... I can't imagine it is more than $ 2!). <br /> <br /> And somebody please tell me what possible motivation Courtney Thorne Smith (a semi-decent actor, definitely above all) had to write on this evaporating cave. Was he bored between this 3.5-second dry spell between Melrose Place and Ally McBear? Or did he owe some karmic debt to the most annoying person (aka Carrot Top) on the planet? <br /> <br /> I give it 2/10, and it's probably too high. I'm trying to save my '1' for movies that make me vomit, and since I didn't see it all, I was fortunate enough to have a reputation for content. I don't think I'll look at it again to find out if it's really worth 1!
