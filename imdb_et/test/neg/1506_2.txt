This movie is so terrible that it's funny, not quite Troll 2 fun, but still funny. The actor is terrible, the music is cruel, and the story doesn't make a dark sense. The story revolves around a man dressed in a terrible grandmother's costume that kills the party's people. Death scenes are so badly made that they are fun. One girl is repeatedly plundered on her chest, but she is not screaming, trying or protecting, nor herself or running. He also manages to survive, even though he has been caught repeatedly. Another scene of death, including the rope, is also very fun. There is no idea that a plot has been set up. Grandmother seems magically moving from one area to another (for example, hiding under the leaves under the forest where the victim is just standing, appears to someone, even though it was behind them ten seconds earlier), people are capable of very inappropriate moments (would you stop and be able to get someone if you were tracing a murderous maniac) and the double twisting at the end is completely ridiculous, it seems they just threw people into confusion. I advise people to watch this movie when they love terrible horror movies like Troll 2, The Dreaded or Blood Gnome, but don't look at it when you're waiting for a scary horror movie, you're frustrated
