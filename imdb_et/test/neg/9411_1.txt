Very bad script and action. I was very surprised that the director was able to convince his lie of an empty story that doesn't tell us anything new. Everything is a clich√© of "mentor" and "talented immature students". The characters are not 'even interesting or compassionate. Artistically, it is so empty and irrelevant. The colors are very personal and light. Only a poster can be tempting. Al Pacino tries to give his character deeply without success. Too bad because sports betting can be a really interesting topic that many may be involved in. But I can't comment on this movie in any way when I got out of the theater 20 minutes before the end. Everything was so predictable that it was the waist of time ...
