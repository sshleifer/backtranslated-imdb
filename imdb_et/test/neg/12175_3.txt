The appeal of this film must be artistic in the Euro style, because there is no substance there. A lot of things happen that seem to go somewhere ... but it never goes there. <br /> <br /> The entire 10 comments line is hard to come by, as this movie is a totally empty experience. The cemetery has many nice photos, some really disgraceful zombie effects, some flashes that can bring surreal humor, and a weak existentialist end. These elements undermine each other. Just when you can enjoy a creepy mood, there are some stupid bouncing heads or zombie sexes. To shout for boredom, you would tie a minimal story line - and it would break down into a ridiculous illogical. It's like someone who took several semi-baked B-films and threw them into a blender. <br /> <br /> What comes mostly is movie * meaningless - and * not good. It is obviously an impressive fan of the art gallery who sees the depth of emptiness indistinguishable. All others should remain in this harsh confusion.
