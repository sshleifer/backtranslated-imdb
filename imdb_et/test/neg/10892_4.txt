As horror movies go, "Rest Stop" could have been on many levels better. Director / writer John Shiban shows that he probably had the best intentions to launch it. Unfortunately, he wasn't sure what to do with the material, or maybe he was under pressure to offer a different film about what he was going to do, studio or supporters. Several endings are included in the DVD, but unfortunately the option chosen for the final product is probably not the best. <br /> <br /> The idea that a psycho travels behind a distant part of California is a great opportunity. After Jessi's disappearance in a horrible resting place, things are out of hand. Bad Nicole is left alone to take care of herself, which she finds along the way. <br /> <br /> It was clear that, in the background of "astonishing grace", there were troops trying to get Nicole a Jess desecrate on her neck without making a careless sex that the natives did not know. <br /> <br /> Look at it at your own risk. There are many gore for genre enthusiasts.
