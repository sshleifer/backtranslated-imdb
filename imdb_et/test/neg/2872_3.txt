this movie was very bad. this is the quality that many Indie films have: humor that is full of long spaces that are totally boring. Any hard hard BAM magera fan likes this movie, but then it's probably the only person to see it. someone gave me this movie, knowing that I was a Jackass fan and was a fan of viva la bami before the scripted nature of this show was thin. To explain why this movie is not working, I should just say that myself is playing <br /> <br /> a man who is a terrible girl with him. And pretty much the movie you've got between Ryan Dunn's boyfriend and Bam magera, like a cheerful resentment. Dicamillo's performance is at best strange. This is a humorous little non-specific Canadian French accent that pretty much has a range of performance (basically funny for 5 minutes and then "ok that you already make enough aliens"). Maybe it would work if they would go to the parody, but whatever they do can make a film with an IQ of zero. I love toilet humor as much as the next man, but it's not even buggy. the humor from this movie is completely inside and the audience, even those made to Magera and the company, are out of jokes. <br /> <br /> The next time a mager is given a full bag of money, we hope he won't blow it on some deceptive pet project
