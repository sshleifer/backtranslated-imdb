Okay wait, let me get this street, this site actually has some moons that think it's one of the best Halloween sequel. I even read someone who says it was as good as the original. Bad what the crap doesn't think I have watched every Halloween and clearly unlike some people knows what makes a good horror movie, and this S-shower is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen in my life. Frankly, when I was John Carpenter, I would complain to the person who wrote it, or turn to a hunter. Seriously, the steep of Halloween is almost all garbage, two were crap, three were stupid, four were fine, five was five, H20 was right, resurrection hurt. However, I find this to be the worst, very bad bunch of sequels. Why? Well let me just start with some beaches not so much with a review, but with a useless beach, why Halloween 6 Michael Myers is one of the most exhausting films I've seen for a long time. OK, where should I start, ah yes the son of the plot. Basically, the plot is mixed, containing cultures, Thor signs, and more. It's just stupid it's really, the movie is trying to be flashy and intelligent yet, its heaped with such a terribly done way. Why does Michael Myers have reason to kill people? Easy enough explanation Micahel likes to kill his relatives, which would be enough, but we do not have to be black and mysterious cultures and signs of Thor and fame. God is so bad that he made me cry out that it really was, writers have tried to add the character of Myers, but have actually been able to do the opposite. Apart from wearing masks and boiler suits <which is a completely different color, Myers are not just original or even two men, maybe even four. This is another reason why Myers has become a Jason Voorhes parody? I thought it was supposed to be the opposite, but Myers is so similar to Jason that he kills people indefinitely. At first, he was tempting his victims for his time and as a result, the whole thing was much more tense. It just walks in the deaths of people. I mean in half an hour that we equaled the amount of original killing that was just ridiculous. Oh and Myers seem to have a big head, I mean its huge and hes loads. What else is nonsense, oh yes, the return of Tommy Jarvis is pretty bad, actually all the characters in this movie are fucking bar Dr Loomis of course. I can't catch a little baby, I wish he would be very upset. Our heroin is boring and interesting. And his whole family is a terrible number of actors. Mom is garbage, brother is bad and Dad thought it was his first part or something? He was like the goddess of the gods, he was actually more evil than Myers <By the way, if his death is one of the most sad things I've ever seen, I think even on Friday the 13th day wouldn't be so ridiculous. What else is garbage oh yes yes Tommy Jarvis, doesn't know the boy's name, but he can't really act, he's trying his best to be serious and everything, but I just wanted to laugh at him. I wish he was actually dead if everyone had died, it would have been pretty good. It is terribly obsolete and dead on all accounts of Donald Pleasence. Although he is on his last legs, Pleasance is still outstanding in the short term. That's a pity that such a franchise cornerstone had to be goodbye. What else is garbage, oh yes, where the DJ can get it. First, how the hell did Michael manage to get into this bath when he was five minutes ago in his house? Secondly, it was just a meaningless killing that could increase the body number, but it is just another pointless peace that adds to this movie. It's actually the death that told me all that it was useless for such a movie.
