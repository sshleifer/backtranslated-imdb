The first time I saw it was the date she was, and she thought it was a fantastic movie. I didn't. <br /> <br /> The second time I saw it was on television last night. It still sucks. <br /> <br /> Love Story Sucks. Because Julia depicts a whore on the street, it's reluctant. For me, he was a librarian with miniskirt and heels. He had no rough crust for him. He was not tortured, afflicted, angry, starved or anything else. His "HOOKER" sign was so bad to compare a cubic zircon with a diamond. The two simply don't fit, no matter what they look like. <br /> <br /> The ONLY cast that I felt was worthy of 2-year-old vendors who were perfectly cast. They did such a good job that I hated them in a few seconds when they were on the screen. They had a real definition of small roles. OK, so the movie wasn't completely trashed ... two unknown sellers saved the movie. <br /> <br /> Apart from these two salesmen, the rest was ... including big names. just mess. Was anyone an ass-kisser or had no reason to perform any dialogue in the film, but only with Julia Roberts or Richard Gere kissing. <br /> <br /> It was a movie about how to drive high heels and tight skirts in Beverly Hills, people write to you and guys working in hotels with gawk, as if they had hit a baseball bat on their face. <br /> <br /> While in reality women are dressed with nine sides of Beverly Hills, horses and prostitutes are at a higher level, but as they do not suffer the mad Madonna looking for jewelry or patent boots, they may see others doing it . <br /> <br /> Lying in a hotel was painfully sad and someone with a real character was less than a minute on the screen. <br /> <br /> This is a romantic movie, comedy, drama and even a prostitute who faces prosperous clients every day with the hope that they will work perfectly. <br /> <br /> The story is about July and Roberts is a PIMPED (yes PIMPED) multimillion business game and limo. <br /> <br /> He is still in possession, still talking about how to act, how to move, what to wear, what to say, where to go and what to do. She is more in control than the street boulevard, but Disney / Buena vista sandwich to swallow it. <br /> <br /> There was a black-toothed black man by Richard Gere and instead of AK-47, instead of filming the film, the woman has to fight the harshness of prostitution. The same story, different characters make very different perspectives. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, change the black man or the Asian or Spanish white man, whether the inter-land agreement will change many weapons or drugs, and the whole concept of romantic comedy will be thrown away. <br /> <br /> I'm worried that a pretty woman is still in the trash, dressed with ribbons and bows. <br /> <br /> I didn't like it 15 years ago when I didn't understand it and was led by Hollywood hype. I hate it now that I see real decorations called "love". <br /> <br /> This movie is not a romantic comedy. This is the story of how to control a woman as long as you have the means and income for that. <br /> <br /> This is an insult to a strong woman, weak women and women in general, as well as for me on a television screen. <br /> <br /> Do I hate it? Yes, yes. Does it suck? Yes Would I recommend it to you? NO ... well, maybe when I hated you. <br /> <br /> Will this review be posted? We see. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's all right now.
