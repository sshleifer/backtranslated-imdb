If this movie goes to a nearby theater, consider it a threat. I was unlucky enough to see this movie in Tokyo. As a Dutchman, I was surprised to find a Dutch film that plays in a metropolis like Tokyo. I thought it had to be special when it came to the Dutch movie in Japan. So I went with my friends and told the theater staff happily that we were Dutch and we were curious about the movie. It turned out that it was one of the most adoptive, stupid, foolish, least spoken English movies I've seen in 10 years, and I left the theater to try to avoid employees because you almost feel responsible for this disaster film. Sometimes it feels like you know what the director wanted: Lola Rennt, a Trainspotting type movie. Instead, it was more of a MacGyver drug with an outdated breakthrough music score. But if I didn't feel too annoyed, the movie was unintentionally fun because it showed the Netherlands its smallest.
