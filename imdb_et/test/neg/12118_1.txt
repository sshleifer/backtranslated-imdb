Friday evening Jonathan Ross must have the people responsible for Rosses rubbing their sweaty little palms. They know that the BBC has no imagination when it comes to telling them that if they have Jonathan Ross at their disposal, they are quite happy to just sit down and half-run this primeime nest. <br /> <br /> Ross is spending the most on an exhibition that takes care of his ego and smiles at how much the BBC pays him. The exhibition is a complete copy of many of the US talk shows - Leno, Letterman, Conan O Brian, the list goes on - but he and his team have clearly seen what the masses can do for fools in Britain. The unfortunate situation - does he have any competition? Parkinson has gone to reality, he was never really much except the maintenance of the ego of celebrities. Isn't anyone more funny and slippery on the British screen than Jonathan Ross? When Ross has built up his ego enough, he continues the very boring concept of the rigid celebrities of the green space, trying to move on with each other. When A-Lister is present (which is so often as it is not now - as other conversations show they can turn to - advertise their last movie) - he spends the next hour flirting or trying to be their best friend in the Universe. Sqeamish when he was with Ringo Starr - a man who doesn't care about his ass - Ross really begged his cell phone number (if a common policy for this show is Jonathan Ross to get everyone a number so he can be seen in the right company if not working). Of course, Ringo said how it is - and just said I don't like you - a dead pan serious. <br /> <br /> Ross has to camp all the awards and TV shows - the masses get over it.
