This is a black and white minstrel sample, a cheap biography of a certain Dixie Boy Johnson star. Did this person ever really exist, do not know, but given the cast lists, certain "Lee Lasses White" and Roscoe Karns, who play this character, also play, I assume that the person was there and that it is a white wash red) for his career version . Such a plot, as it is, follows Dixie Boy's career from depression to his wife's death, his abandonment to friends, and his return to his daughter's sixteenth birthday and the stage debut. Another forgotten man, Benny Fields, plays Dixie Boy. The man is a lovely baritone voice, but he has no ability to act and it is a boring one-off screen. Gladys George is bravely striving to revive his works. Judy Clark does the best Betty Hutton I've ever seen, though I believe she thought she was herself. Filling a lot of musical numbers for a 70-minute short time, he earned the Oscar nom. Worth a look.
