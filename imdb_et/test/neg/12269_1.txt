I love watching Australian films, but this steamy heap was just embarrassing. The DVD cover seemed promising, but you know what they say, don't understand the DVD with that lid. I also noticed that it won the best actor for the prize, but the contest must have been very bad, because acting in this film is pathetic. It just seemed that the director thought he had enough talent to lead and act if he really had to focus on one part of the film making and get it before he spreads too thin. Music was pretty common. The story really didn't go anywhere. It was just a series of struggles that had been put together with a bad script and cheesy dialogue. <br /> <br /> I'll tell all the filmmakers who want it. Watch this movie. This gives you the hope that your movie will win something during the festival. <br /> <br /> But they are good to enter and go. I hope they learned some lessons and their next venture is a little better.
