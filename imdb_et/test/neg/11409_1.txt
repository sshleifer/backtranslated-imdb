In another horrible horror film, I find it so masochistic, we have a bunch of friends who have been bitten in a house that is killed one by one thanks to a zombie horde that spurt yellow blood and has very bad dental problems. However, the first 45 minutes are talked about, and given that young people cannot get out of the paper bag and have been given the most banal dialogue to say so vaguely, it is particularly painful to sit. If you manage to keep it awake because of this nonsense, things can't do better .. the effect of a bad make-up and cheesy, a favorable basement (non-special). As for the summary ... well, what is betting, that the old man who warned them about going to a horrible mansion emerges and saves the day for the last two survivors (of course a boy and a girl) with his mystical powers? Please .. life is too short for these movies. Give the time you would otherwise have worn out if you looked at this truism, helping the community, do a couple of swim in the kitchen or something. You feel that you have actually done something productive with your life, and you have not put money in a studio that cancels out empty rubbish like <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is too late for me ... now where I did a copy of this "Pumpkinhead"? 1/10
