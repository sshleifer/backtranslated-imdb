I'm going for this game and it's boring I guess. I waited a little more. The main problem with this is that hacking is extremely difficult, even if you read the instructions you can't. Graphics are not as good as Pandora Tomorrow and Double Agent. This game could make some improvements, saying that when the guards are pouring in the water and you shoot a shocking stick in the water, the guard will fast, but nothing will happen. I think it is the worst of the three. I haven't played the first one, but I've played Pandora Tomorrow, this and Double Agent. However, this game deserves 4/10. There could be some improvements.
