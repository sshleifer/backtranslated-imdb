The film deceived me for a number of reasons: first of all, for me, the realistic future was well-built, but it had only a marginal role. Then it was a weak copy of Lost in Translation. Near the Middle East, a family man meets a new girl abroad, karaoke bar, camera movements and images - all this was a very bad imitation of the great Lost in Translation, which also had credibility. This film tries to be something brilliant and cultural: it is not. I don't know why Tim Robbins even saw this movie!? The female main character is terrible - did she have a prescription in the minority report? And why do you need to show the vagina to such a movie? Lost in Translation did not have to show excessive love scenes. Is that right for it? This movie is not worth even watching video stories!
