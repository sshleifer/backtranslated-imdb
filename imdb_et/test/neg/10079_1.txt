This would probably be a good movie to see ... assuming you've already seen all the other existing movies and thoroughly exploring your own and your surrounding belly. God, this movie was incredibly uncomfortable, some of the worst (or non-existent) writings have ever been recorded on film. There is no saving for this film; even animation is kind of flat and it's just a waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Run. Fast. It's terrible. <br /> <br />
