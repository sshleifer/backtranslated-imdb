My friend, who is even more of the 1970s cult movies than me, suggested it to me and gave me the copy I watched. But I was not as enthusiastic about the result as he did? or Michael Elliott on that? was. The film is a hybrid of HOX OF WAX (1953) and THE Texas CHAIN ​​SAW MASSACRE (1974): indeed, I would like to say that this was the basis for the earlier reconstruction of 2005 much more than the original. ! So we have a distant and abandoned Wax Museum, which is incredibly viable dummies (I guess why is that?), Because his apparently harmless curator (hammy Chuck Connors) has "penetrated" the stranded teenagers (including Tanya Roberts). He also has a crazy brother? PSYCHO (1960) tones added to a good dimension, until the same twist in itself? who should be a mechanical genius (shown in "poltergeist", which is not involved in the first murder). The film benefits from Pino Donaggio's score, but being so derived and not particularly well-launched, it reaches a purely superfluous (and rather confusing) genre.
