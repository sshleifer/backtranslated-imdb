Stupid movie, fool. They seem to throw every imaginary clich√© into the blender. Particularly "liked" was the part where two teenage girls get to clean the French president's water. Because we all know how America is committed to protecting the environment. Kyoto, anyone? And a French chef who probably hasn't seen or tasted hamburger ... That's why people think Americans aren't in culture. And the fact that we meet our children when they come to Europe to "see the world" (ie eat in foreign capitals McDonalds) They are not as stupid as two ditsy preteensit in this movie, but they have almost as much cultural enlightenment and good practices .
