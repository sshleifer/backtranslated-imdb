This is one of those films with great potential. Brilliant actors, a very interesting director's debut and a haunting "Survivor" plot. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't work at all. <br /> <br /> Get Started: Cinematography is stunning. The beauty of the Namibian desert also shows the ruthless surroundings, including in the pictures. And then it is. Pretty good. Jennifer Jason Leigh has never been better. It also seems that Bruce Davison has developed his character from Altman's "Short Cuts". <br /> <br /> Then frustrations: Janet McTeer. Romane Bohringer. And the plot. Why is Levring playing "Lear" to play? The whole idea of ​​allowing Shakespeare to express his despair and inner longing does not work. It looks like a facade. And it is clear that the tragedies are due to the choice of "Lear". They just have to match Script with Levring and Academy Award winner Anders Thomas Jensen. <br /> <br /> And sex. It takes about three days, then more or less all the characters are sexually frustrated. Dahh !! Sex is always an easy way out if you have a land crisis. Janet McTeer's part breaks down mainly because of this ridiculous idea. The sex immediately changes the plot to the ground. Instead, they could focus on dialogue. There must be a conversation between all the characters, but we see them mainly in smaller groups. Talking about them is as dead as "Lear" and the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> "King is alive" is still not the worst Danish Dane '95 movie. But if you compare it to the latest Lone Scherfig domestic dogs '95 movies "Italiensk for begyndere", it won't work. It's not a good movie. This is bad. But that's beautiful.
