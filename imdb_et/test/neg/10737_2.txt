Just a few words: it's good that George A Romero is still among us when he was dead, he would be forced to step out of the grave to vote against the people who made this "political satire" And the saddest thing is that I actually agree with the feelings of these people. Yes, there are zombies and they have a good reason to get out of the grave: vote. Oh, and one of them finishes The Doctor from Startrek Voyager. It's as scary as it gets, people. If you are looking for a horror movie, I suggest you continue to watch. And if you are looking for a wise political satire, you are also in the wrong place and not just because this series is called the masters of horrors. But don't let me keep you back: suddenly you see something I miss. Although it is likely that you will waste your time as I have. Let's just say that I prefer my Zombie movies where zombies stand in front of the camera.
