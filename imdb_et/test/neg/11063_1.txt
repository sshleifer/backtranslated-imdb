It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. Parallel to Blair Witch and just as annoying. Flashing helmet lights made things difficult to see and I think epileptics should take into account because there are moments of strobing that makes this movie even more annoying. I think if they were quieter, they would have found a way out. Then, if you think a geek can fight, he may even break the nervous system. Oh and when it's the one who is sexually, he realizes that when a girl says she can hear something. He can hear something. One of these men must at least have seen Scream (where they draw your attention to such things). It is also a big draw if the assumption offers so many promises and then someone writes the script. So I'm sorry I got it in a video store a week and I still want my money back.
