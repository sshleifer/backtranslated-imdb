Sometimes you ignore this little voice that says with your head "away from the movie". We should all pay more attention to this small voice. It may be the worst movie I've ever been through, or it may be the best reason to remember that your DVD player has a hotkey. Made from somewhere close to $ 1.99, "The Cavern" is obviously a fast cheap, which has been a setback for the current scary caves with many dark-claustrophobic spelunkers-unknown threats like "The Cave" and "The Descent". A couple of years ago, there was a similar rash with similar films that used marine ships instead of copies. Everyone had scary boats / submarines - many dark-claustrophobic adventurers - unknown threats ... same old. "The Cavern" is really "Blair's Witchcraft" only this time, when we lost ground and did not disappear on it. Throw a battery-powered flashlight, a cow with a monster glued to it, and one of the strangest twisted tips ever put on the film. Saying this, let me encourage you to listen to me, with little voice in your head. I'm your friend. I want you to have a happy life. Stay away from this movie.
