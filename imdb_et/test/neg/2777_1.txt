I'm not sure I've ever seen a movie as bad as that. Awful acting, whole spot plot, terrible special effects. Here are some moments of "so bad for your good", but not enough to preserve interests. The woman who plays Tracey looks ugly. Some dwarfs are relatively worrying scenes that will leave you feeling so spoiled. On the plus side, the operational scenes are quite entertaining for special effects, as is the chase of a car where one car is "trying to pull us out" without actually contacting. Think the budget doesn't go to cars. Oh, and what looks like the postcard of Taj Mahal is shown every time they cut into a fancy foreign country.
