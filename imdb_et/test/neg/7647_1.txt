Frankly, one of the worst written, directed, and behaved movies I've ever seen. It looks like a TV movie. And it's bad. I can't believe people are hiring Danny Huston after seeing it in the movie or they still allow John Sayles to make movies. My husband and I found this movie on television one night and got it forever, we finished the house during the cleaning. . . and it missed us yet! It made me think that critics have been as light as Sayles's previous films, such as Lone Star, who was timing her, but not really much at the end. Spend your time something better. Something.
