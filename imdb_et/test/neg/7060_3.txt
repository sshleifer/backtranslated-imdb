I like many Myrna Loy movies. This film was made before the character's character's personality was developed. It would be a nice short film, but it seems to be in full form forever. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy seems to have said what to do and do with her. That's all you can say about her. <br /> <br /> His gypsy character is filthy and the film has many bugs, such as a jewelry store. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably interesting for Myrna Loy fans, but even as such it is a disappointment.
