What a waste of time! My 5-year-old daughter brought it home from my mother's house and looked at it as a family. Nobody liked us. This insane little film, full of striking contradictions, obvious Christian themes and terrible film quality, is not yet bold to look at. It seemed a bit like a bad high school drama class movie making. How sad to see that talented actors (Chris Atkins, Gary Busey and the company) mourn their way through this subtle and awkward story. The only good thing you can say about this movie is that the dog is cute. The film could have gone straight to the pound. Avoid this movie - your time is better spent drying the paint.
