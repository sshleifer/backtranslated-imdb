The fearsome mishi, which includes predictable story and bad-to-bad, gave the PC clich√©s ad nauseam (races worked together, the heroine was smart and beautiful, the man who sacrificed himself to save another life, the father / daughter relationship, etc.). The film looks like something created for online TV and should have been there. Even talented Tommy Lee Jones can't save this BOMB. I urge you not to waste money or time on this cinematic destruction from the time when the disaster films visited Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Two stars are only given to CGI people and the ability of PR-nations to get even one filmmaker.
