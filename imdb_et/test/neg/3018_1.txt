Although it hurts me to some extent that I bother to baptize this new series of comments - mainly because I hate to give the wrong impression that it really is in the public interest - I have to throw my chips on it. <br /> <br /> Simply put, I have never felt such a convincing and ruthless cancellation of a TV show based solely on the value of its advertising profiles. And if you don't know, I'm a guy. <br /> <br /> Listen, comedy network: although your existing original programming is already politely "questionable" quality (I) You look at you, "Girls are going to be girls") you've really crossed the field. Whoever shone this thing green was not able to leave it at the moment. <br /> <br /> Best of luck.
