Calling it a "Sunday School" movie can be generous, because even as a Christian, I found the religious message so one-dimensional that I wouldn't want to see it in my church. The message is, "Read your Bible, go to church, and sign up for fire insurance, so you're not left behind." There was no love. I think if you get down right now, I don't believe in the god depicted in this movie. The man who was supposed to have all the spiritual answers came up as Count Dracula. <br /> <br /> In addition to the spiritual / religious element, the script was annoying - saying the same thing over and over again. It could have been some of the actors who couldn't give convincing features for the first time, so they just said the same thing and again. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the latest scenes. I thought it was a point without anyone going to school on Sunday or Sunday. The film wasn't all bad, but a big part of it. <br /> <br /> I support more pure movies that are well done and that present truth in a non-preaching way. It wasn't one of them, I'm sorry to say. I took my family to this movie, who wanted to support this movie. Now I want my money back.
