This criticism speaks to 4 small friends who went to see Angels and Demons movie on the first night, although it was a school evening because "Angels and demons are worth it." Two out of four had read the book. Of those who weren't, the boy was wearing pink lean jeans. It was the least eventful part of the evening after watching the terrible angels and demons. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a laboratory where the antimatter is created when the second process takes place. And probably someone knows about it or something. Note that I'm very confused. I don't get what happened: they just made antimatter. Vittoria finds her father dead ... WHAT? The Illuminati symbol sent to Langdon is PRINTOUT, not burning on someone's chest. They take out the X-33 scene. They take Maxmillian Kohler. They take a lot of CERN and related symbols. They take Hassasin out and replace him with some British British guy. They take out the Illuminati Diamond. They take Vittoria's rape scene. They take Langonda's fight with Hassasin (now the British guy cracked). They take the press out, watching them around. They take the death of the fourth cardinal. They take into account the fact that Camerlengo becomes a pope. They're taking Camerlengo's big scheme. They take Langdon as a helicopter and land on this island. They take into account the fact that Vittoria's father was a scientific priest. They take Langdon for fun and, unfortunately, they take Vittoria's sexual complaint. <br /> <br /> In addition to a movie that has lost all its details, HORRIBLY is the movie. However, you have to admit that there were good things. For example, the Sistine Chapel holiday must have been extremely difficult and very well done. The explosion scene was MIND-BLOWING. In addition, USE THIS MOVIE OUT OF THE BOOK FOR THE PEOPLE WHO IS NOT READING.
