Kennan Ivory Wayans was so funny at Low Down Dirty Shame that I had to see it and it was one of the worst things he did and Steven Seagal didn't help much. For Jim Campbell (Keenan), this is the beginning of some strange religious killings. He is surprised to see a new partner who is waiting for him to work next to him to break up, but Jack Cole does not seem to be all who thinks he is until Jack's former husband is killed in one of those ritual killings that will eventually make suspect. It's the same as all of his other films: the past of smoke, CIA involvement, and now trying to be a regular cop. Why is Steven dressing like he's in a Western movie? And the prayer lies, which makes things a little confused.
