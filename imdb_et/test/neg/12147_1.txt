he must be the film of the worst gay themes of all time. Who told some of the participants that they can act. Bad sound - bad script - gestures go so far as to defy reality. Nightclub scene with only one actor and duplicate crowd scenes. <br /> <br /> After watching similar low budget movies, I was ready for something innovative - but not the usual pathetic. <br /> <br /> Parents and friends should not really encourage anyone to do this. <br /> <br /> And there is no DVD menu; its worse than VHS tape. Once you get started, you have to look through the whole thing - fortunately, the back and forth button quickly works - there's nothing else with this movie and DVD.
