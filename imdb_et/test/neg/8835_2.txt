I have no idea how commentators could consider it to be decent B-Western countries. Or how one commentator said the plot was more coherent. Nothing can be further from the truth! This movie is one huge non-yet again! This is "an insult to the noble B-West movies of the 1930s. I've seen a lot of Wayne's early Lone Star and Republican peoples in the West, and it's the worst. <br /> <br /> A bad boy is known as a shadow - to cry aloud! Initially, the Shadow scheme keeps open side teachers. At the same time, his gang falls on all the livestock in the territory. Then they decide to go bank robbing. To do this, they have to shoot with a city gun - there is no explanation why it is needed or how it got this little toy! <br /> <br /> No charts are detailed enough to recommend a plot here. Shadow is probably just a general bad guy with all sorts of evil schemes. <br /> <br /> He gives his hands to his wealthy through a safe wall. (Knock-knock, who's there?) He's probably a psychic, because when his henchmen have to talk to him, they knock on the wall, the safe opens, and - PRESTO - he's there. (I can just imagine that he has come into contact with them and says, "I have secret, unpleasant instructions to give you our next evil act - meet me with the wall and give them to you.") Why Shadow requires safe communication with his armed forces army Like most of the elements of this confusion, it has never been explained. <br /> <br /> He has a hollow hollow in a hollow tunnel across the street from which many of his malicious murders are located. He also has a hidden panel, which is NOT concealed in his secret camps for counterfeit safe If it is not safe behind it, it hangs on its cow-free beach, which masks Matlock as a shepherd. We find out that he has murdered the real owners of the ranch - two brothers The Dead Brother's Daughter has recently arrived from NYC in the 1930s (judging by her wardrobe) and apparently she has never met her real uncle because she breaks it! <br /> <br /> a lats bad guys wearing black hats and good guys in white hats, you have to watch this movie. Here, the good guys all ditch your hats in favor of the white headbands that make them look like they've all suffered head before being shot! It's like a basketball game - only Wayne has to tie bandanas around their heads, instead of just taking off their shirts. <br /> <br /> Maybe the strangest end. Immediately after being subjected to Shadow and his gang, we jump far enough into the future to see Wayne and his wife (erst-brother-in-law) on the front door of their home. (Don't forget that there is little romance.) There, Yak Wayne plays with a 3-4-year-old boy dressed in Injun's honor! (Hiyoo, skookum fun!) <br /> <br /> Wayne was the legend of the screen because of this pointlessness. Only a superstar (packer or not!) Can override this entry from the movie description. Long live the Duke!
