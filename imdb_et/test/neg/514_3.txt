Pun intended. This low budget activity / horror car Don Wilson's ability to pull things is something that is direct-video-ticket prices. <br /> <br /> Plot: Wilson is a humorous vampire who comes from the local fire for law enforcement after he is forced to kill the night for the public. The police are chasing him, the vampires are pursuing him, he's reacting with beating ... a lot. <br /> <br /> The story is a little more, but it is so unreasonable that you don't remember it honestly; I think people actually talked about the movie, but it's under discussion. The plot is nothing more than Wilson's architecture to kill as many vampires as possible during driving times, usually by hitting them. <br /> <br /> Technical data is anemic in one sense. Small color handling, amateur use of lighting, simplified use of camera and angle. Blood and gore are noticeably limited, odd for this type of film. The worst shooting habits are the offensive shifts to the super-shaky cam during each fight. When the camera starts to bounce at speed like a thigh monkey, you know that Don will first throw it away. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a bad movie that can be done with some friends and a lot of cynical humor. Otherwise, don't look if you really don't want to look at things. <br /> <br /> 3/10
