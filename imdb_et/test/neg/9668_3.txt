Visually, this film is interesting. Light is literally thrown together with cinematography and an appealing introduction before the headlines that hoped for hope, but then - b-film is a b-film is a b-film, no matter how much the sight is seen. This film is surrounded by one of the world's best known Albert Fish lives. Fish at the beginning of the 20th century is fast and blurred in life before it began killing older children. This film is based on two themes: the life of fish and the head of William F. King, a leading researcher. Which records this film from changing to Hallmark's spectacle and conventional sorting when it comes to serial killers is the direction that is a two-edged sword; director Scott L. Flynn draws enough attention to the b-actors to keep their mistakes from shining too much, but at the same time the king's corner created a really boring and stereotypical view of the American police. Of course, as he deals with fish, he met with 10-year-old Grace Budd, who killed him, though I am not sure whether his mother was a media-conscious person whom Flynn was really trying to emphasize he was. I don't want the fish to have more psychological diving, let alone the very little time it took to fish. All in all, it is interesting for those who are serum killers but mostly hopeless; but if the director makes another movie for another serum killer, I can see it in the hope that the holes are placed.
