When I read two other comments, I had to wonder if I had seen the same movie! <br /> <br /> Perhaps living in Australia lives a lot, but we call it sci-fi or fantasy, but people just don't. <br /> <br /> I couldn't pass this review without commenting on it myself. It will heal after the first half hour, but I doubt most would do that far. <br /> <br /> Yikes.
