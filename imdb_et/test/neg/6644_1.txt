To date, I've never seen Elizabeth Shue because of the smell of this movie. Poorly acted, poorly drawn and racially Neanderthal, it took place in Chicago, where every black person probably lived in a blues club. . SPOILER AHEAD. . . . . .. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: His "blues" solo was even more painful to watch than his helpless action and its introduction - "Nobody leaves without blues singing" - was as stupid as the post. The children he was characterizing was babysitting, were effortless, and before the end of the film I wanted all of them to happen to be terrible. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that there is one special thing about this movie; the insult to the film takes me a lot, but this relaxing piece did what Chopper, Phantom Menace and Catwoman couldn't do - sick to my stomach.
