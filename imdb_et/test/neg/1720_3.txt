Oh, boy, this is another comet-hit-ground movie. If you go one year or two years from Deep Impact, Armageddon, Space Cowboys and other stupid foolish movies, you think people would be burned with this concept. Probably not, because I rented it, hoping it might not be terrible: Dennis Hopper was in everything and he's a good actor, right? <br /> <br /> I forgot something important: with Peter O Toole, Robert De Niro, and many other reputable actors, Hopper is sure he will appear in horrible movies. Not only that, but it looks like he prepares them when you take in unforgettable classes. His appearance in Tychus is so terrible that you expect Divine or Edith Massey to appear in some scene. <br /> <br /> I don't know what else to say about this garbage, unless you're in things that fall down to see Deep Impact and then Armageddon and Space Cowboys. Forget others together. It's really the bottom of the pile.
