Before seeing this movie, the 1998 version was my only experience of this dickens story. I didn't enjoy the movie very much, but this 1974 adaptation is moving in a very tiring fashion. <br /> <br /> The actors do not seem to be the main pair of Michael York and Sarah miles are particularly wooden lawsuits. for me, the only real interest was the Anthony Quayle's intelligent jaggers. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, but the story itself is great. it is a real lesson from how your distorted values ​​and obsessive principles can destroy you. live with open mind and do not care what other people say, you're what you are when others can't do it, ****. Pippi was told early but he didn't listen. <br /> <br /> The weird old lady reminded me of the old Kaspar hauser story, not the same horrible level, but the way she shaped her child to create her personal brother against the opposite sex. Pipi's childhood didn't look much better. The end didn't look like the rest of the story style. the kits seemed cheap and come to the impression that I was not surprised that it was indeed a TV movie (which I had no idea when I borrowed it from the library). <br /> <br /> Live and learn. so many good movies, so little time. that's why there are reviews here. so you shouldn't waste that time on such movies. <br /> <br /> 3/10
