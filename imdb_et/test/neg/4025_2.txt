I rented this DVD because I'm a big fan of science literature, but that thing (I don't call it a movie because it was obviously very fast on the video), they seemed to miss it. I'm still not sure what it was. These men are dressed up in some strange S&M equipment, and I think they're from another planet, but it's not so meaningful in this low, low, low budget movie. If that were their first movie, I cut them somewhat to relax, but I think it's like their 5th movie and it's really very bad. <br /> <br /> Very bad, not one good actor is this movie. This director must have liked to work on such a terrible film. Don't waste your time or money on this DVD, please don't make people do it. DVD rentals are not even worth 0.99 cents. In fact, I tell them that the DVD was confusing to get my money back. I don't believe anything bad, but I have to be here. My advice to people related to this drowning ship - please find another profession. How could you make such a rotten movie? I would give these negative letters if possible, it's so terrible.
