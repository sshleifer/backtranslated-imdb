Why did I buy this movie on DVD ?, Well, a short answer would be: I really don't know. As for the longer version, it comes from the fact that I really like Tatyana Ali and she is playing Alicante. <br /> <br /> Now is Tatyana Ali doing a really good job in this movie? I have to say that this is one of the best, and he designs a pretty decent actress. I look forward to seeing him in action if there is better material. <br /> <br /> That said, this movie was terrible - and my score is based on: 1 star is not the worst movie I've ever seen, 1 star Tatiana Ali and 1 star that didn't think it deserves only 2 stars for the worse movies. <br /> <br /> And the rule should stick to the scramble, not to say my favorite rapper a little, but some seem to like it - and when he's there, I'd be glad he doesn't see a functioning scene. <br /> <br /> Ving Rhames: Ah man, Marcellus Wallace, what you're doing here - you were a cool man before. Just because Michael Caine is a fiercely brilliant actor who has had so many terrible hints as well as good, you don't have to copy him from Ving. <br /> <br /> The other half-big names cast: It's OK, there are paid bills, and we all have to do things we're not proud of from time to time. <br /> <br /> The film itself. It's so massive, it's hard to know where to start. It's more than the scenes thrown together, as the director says, "We have to say it, and we have to say it." There is a story, unfortunately, there is nothing surprising about it or inside it. At least, the story of changes in the story was too obvious and therefore predictable what happened all the time. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: Reallynotgood
