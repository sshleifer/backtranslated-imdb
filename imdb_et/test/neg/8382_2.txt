Studying the differences between religion and culture in college, Mindy (Rachel Miner), the best student in the class, convinces her schoolmates Cassandra (Taryn Manning), Bailey (Glenn Dunk), Alex (Joel Michaely) and Morgan (Victoria). Venegas) investigate Kwan Yin's worshiping massacre for their leader Owen Quinlin (Robert Berson) twenty years ago in California. Quinlin had found an ancient ancient amulet in southern China that would give him immense power after sacrificing the human soul, but one woman stands and destroys. But after Morgan's death, who apparently committed suicide, the students discover that Quinlin has come back and drives his souls with his amulet. <br /> <br /> The Cult story is not entirely bad. The scenario, direction, actors, lines, camera, CGI and edition are terrible, I was totally bored and tempted to use the DVD's FF button, but I looked at the 90-minute life and watched it. endless crap Saturday night, my voice is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Amuleto Secreto" ("The Secret Charm")
