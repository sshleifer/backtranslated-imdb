I'll give her another chance, but I was disappointed at first. It wouldn't be a second series candle. It has a lot of meaningless dialogue that doesn't add any story at all. I agree with others that it does not seem to be an interesting story. It's slow and tiring, and I only know what Comanches is going to do. Maybe it first relates to the second part, but I have to follow it and find out. I'm from the apache heritage of the Texas / New Mexico area, but I don't know much about what's going on. Maybe I don't know the facts, but it doesn't make me much educated.
