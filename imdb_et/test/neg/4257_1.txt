Good cinematography, good practice ... cannot justify a story that is not and cannot be acceptable to any society. Amitabh has often used the media to sell this spam by saying that - if such a case happens ... then what? I would like to ask her if this is the case for your child or grandchild (say a girl), what are you doing? I think every parent has to take special care of the relationship with a 60-year-old neighbor if you have one. Such films should be banned and discouraged because you inspire more of Nithari's cases. Such acts are outrageous and punishments in films are punished .. it should be a story of morality and not respect their deeds or them.
