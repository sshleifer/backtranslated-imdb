Stan Laurel was in late films until late 1920s. During this time, Laurel was certainly not among the top students of talent and his humor is not nearly as good as the modern ones like Lloyd or Keaton. But for the second-level short comedy he created a decent niche. In terms of film quality, they varied wildly. Some, for example, DR. LONG AND MR. PRYDE was terrible, while most of them were below average. <br /> <br /> FROZEN HEARTS are an odd film. Like many films made for Hal Roach and distributed by Path√© during this period, the costumes were absolutely first-rate and the film seemed very nice. Nevertheless, and with James Finlayson's similar support, there was one thing they forgot to add to this movie, humor. No jokes seem to work and the film looks like drama, not comedy. Only truly foolish title cards will poll the type of film that it should be. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to try to see all of his Laurel and Hardy movies and then watch the solo movies. In addition to DR. BLACK, try seeing SOILERS and MUD AND SAND - two of his more tolerable solo-short.
