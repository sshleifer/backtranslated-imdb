POSSIBLE SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Quaid and I like Meg Ryan. Waiting for them together, being married and all, I wanted to see the chemistry on my screen. Okay, saying, I think they're acting, their external relations didn't have to go through their performances, especially with this script. <br /> <br /> How stupid the professor can glue himself to anyone. I can't remember the original, but I can only assume that O'Brien was probably handcuffed to his leading wife, probably inevitably. If I were "tied" to someone who would be very angry. I would definitely have broken it quickly. Meg didn't even show a little surprise. Dennis should hit me and yell at me. This part of the movie was so terrible - especially Meg had to go to the bathroom (# 2) between the rubbish dumps in the dark at night. Ewww. There is no f **** ing way! <br /> <br /> What is Dennis for every suspect in every movie. The shock first asks questions later. Not once, not twice, but too many times - I could have read if I was so inclined. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the movie was the drama of Nick and his family. Too bad for not getting more from the plot. The presumed off-screen drama leading to this tragedy. I think it could have been written without Dex's endeavor. <br /> <br /> My fault lies with the author of this scenario. If the director and others are not so much aware that it is not possible to recognize it. <br /> <br /> I don't even get the real reason why the poor Dex was murdered. How ridiculous it is. Even when Dex had a real killer and explained the reason (a real "film noir" moment), everyone seemed bored on the screen. Oh, _____ happened. Oh. (Yawn) "Dex even says it's a stupid reason for a triple murder. Oh tension, you can cut it with a spoon. <br /> <br /> If someone, but Dennis had been in this movie, you have to give it 1/2 stars (just because I've really seen it worse) but in this case 1 1/2 star. <br /> <br /> Dennis and Meg stars, see ANYTHING ELSE.
