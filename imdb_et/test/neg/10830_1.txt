This movie does not even save the grace of being so bad that it is good. It's really terrible. It is closer to the language of an exciting parody than a disaster film, but unfortunately they were serious. Made for TV but not worth it. It contains the moment of each cliche and the cheese option you imagine. Does he save the city from the flood? Does his wife admit that he still loves him? Do they flee before the flood drowned them? I can't explain how bad it is. An amazing predictable plot that makes you so nervous. Bad effect (although I was fair, I have seen worse super-set bubbling water). Bad script. Scary action. Hidden. So bad that you probably should be drunk and look.
