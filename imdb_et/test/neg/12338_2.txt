The downhill racer is essentially a film that sees only a terrible ski trail. Although there is a story here, the character of Robert Redford, the skier who is trying to make a US Olympic player, is so strange and uncomfortable that you don't know why to care for him at all. Gene Hackman adds nicely at an early stage, but this is a film that can be viewed by sound, and it should not make a big difference.
