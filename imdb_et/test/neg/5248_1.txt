The rental of this direct video did not expect amazing cinematography. (Not to say just because the movie is in the cinema.) Only very loosely after the story left in the epic poem, this film follows a unique story of monsters and super-people. Overall photography is controversial, with its medieval and post-apocalyptic mixture (reminiscent of Mad Max). Rock and techno soundtrack boot, one has to get off feeling a bit behind. Fighting scenes, though incredible, are fun, and Christopher Lambert has some of the most interesting weapon combinations I've ever seen on film, though often it is inefficiently inefficient. The special effects of Monster Grendel are surprisingly effective and one of the few highlights. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert provides average performance in Beowulf. It's not nearly as memorable as Highlander, but at least it wasn't as poor as Fortress. A strong mold is quite neutral. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good adventure story with a complicated and interesting plot, I don't recommend this movie. However, if you want a flip-flop, full of camping scenes and a somewhat predictable plot, find a copy of it.
