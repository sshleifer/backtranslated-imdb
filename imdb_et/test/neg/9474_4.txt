First, let me get it from my chest, which I hate Octopussy with absolute passion. What is so depressing is that it had so much potential and a very good opening sequence, unfortunately posting an opening sequence that all goes down. First of all, there was no beginning of the plot, but Moore's apology to tell his funny jokes. Here are a number of sequences that would change the weakening of the Bond fan, such as the sequence in which Bond turns the clown into a dispersed bomb. Roses are pretty poor, Louis Jordon has no effect, as Kamal Khan and Bollywood veteran Kabir Bedi are as poor as his henchman. It's funny that when people talk about what the worst Bond movie is and Octopussy is ignored when he can easily give them money.
