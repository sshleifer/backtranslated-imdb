Visually beautiful and exquisite music, this movie is otherwise quite tricky for television quality quality. The romance between the two characters, which includes the cultural and educational gap, is not simply plausible. Of course, we knew at an early stage that our persnickety heroine would make it easier for local people to find true love, but it would not be less regrettable that the film had to take such fully anticipated turns. This film had a lot of promise, which makes it shameful that the promise was not realized. Maybe there is a nice dinner table cable, but I definitely wouldn't recommend renting or buying for a fee. I'm sure the sound is great.
