This spaghetti Western uses three American leading actors who take a little bit of a typical spaghetti aura. The plot has an amnesty that the New Mexico Governor gives to all criminals who want to start a new life. Typically, such an opportunity is limited to past events, but in this film it seems to kill as a license, because even new crimes (such as the governor's threat) are forgiven. The story is an endless chain of killings, where almost every character aims to provide more carcasses. Only a few drivers have durability. Clay McCord's worshiping nightmares associated with a childhood event, surprisingly, killed many people. In the midst of eternal intervention, such reflections are not reliable. Compared to similar films like BANDIDOS, none of the characters in this movie liked me. <br /> <br /> Apart from weak content targeted at certain customers, this film is well captured, the kits are somewhat detailed and the average is exemplary. <br /> <br /> 4/10
