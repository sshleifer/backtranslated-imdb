If I could have given this movie 0/10, and this is the first movie I want to consider so low. It's worse than terrible. When I watch the cinema, I would like the cinema to pay me for watching it (at least a minimum wage). Some camera shots were quite effective, but there was a lot of garbage eg. a reflection of the villain in a mirror that separates his head and shoulders sideways from his body (seeing belief). Several completely useless killings of innocent civilians. 2 murders that made me laugh out loud because the victims' actions / facial expressions were shooting. I was looking at it only until the end (fast back and forth 10-minute boring meaningless dialogue) hoping to see Seagal fighting on some decent hand, but it was almost absent (it should have been known that when he kicked somebody threw under the elevator showed this is the slow end of the music - "action" the end of the scene. In one scene, we see that Seagal's hand starts to move slowly over the neck, which makes it clear that his hands have never even made contact. it is a shotgun that blows him on the 2nd to 3rd floor of the street. All in all, this movie is a waste of time and a complete joke. It looks like a very low budget (even in Seagal). The color is dull and gray. I could go on and on ... just like this movie, but I wont look at this movie if you have insomnia.
