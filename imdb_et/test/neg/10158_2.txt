It's cozy. The crime scene from 1949 often plays more like a film by Coen Bros which has been filmed in the 1940s, filmed in black and white, except that here, the church's ear is not so well-tuned - maybe we could see Oscar instead. as a precursor to a feeding script, such as Road to Perdition. Frankly speaking, it is a wonder that filmmakers and critics do not consider this film to be a classic everywhere, considering how much it offers an over-structured modeling conception that is hidden in the wrong meaning (like any grandfather of such "fake art" films), Citizen Kane or something by Murnau.) <br /> <br /> MGM is usually a studio that can't do wrong in my eyes, and I think every story, any atmosphere, even "sharp realism," will only benefit as a result of grotesque overestesting. You could say I'm a disciple of Minnell School. However, the Dashiell Hammetti stripe is somewhat easy to touch to write fashionable hard dialogues that may want to have one or two scenes without it, like "Careful, Mr. Wiggly, or you have thirteen fish fry and you don't need to eat them." I did most of that - "Mr. Wiggly", unfortunately, did this cutting - but believe me that dialogue is just something that swelled and rebelled with non-sequences. Even the leading police spouse, played by Arlene Dahl, speaks as he is under one eye under a six-shaped scarf and the Christian name Rocco. By the time Van Johnson has a sign line, "I'm sick as a result of the death and killing of death," you know how the fixation of a writer with decorated literary equipment - in this case zeugma - can ever be misunderstood as a "street." <br /> <br /> For those who have displaced the Naked Gun series, this is the funniest police-n-abductor movie.
