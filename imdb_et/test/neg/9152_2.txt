This movie - like most other life-long movies - was based quite blissfully on the "best seller", played more than reenactment as a real movie. The only difference here was that Meredith Baxter wasn't there. Women of this age do not age even over the age of 20 and generally acting actors are pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Its characters were all clich√©s and one-dimensional. The story was fun. I do not recommend this, but this is something people who loved this book and people who look at this network think it is great. I only looked at it because my girlfriend wanted to see it so she wouldn't have to read the book her sister gave her. It wasn't made for me like me - my girlfriend cried at the end so she didn't think it would be as terrible as I was.
