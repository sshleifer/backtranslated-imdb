When you look at the cover and read about it, you will remember a completely different film than here. Then maybe I read the summary of the second film "Mausolem" because the two films of this film appeared at about the same time, both with common basic elements. But reading this movie here I know that I saw it and not that, and this movie is even less that could be imagined with this title film. I'm honest, I'm looking forward to a more zombie type of picture and you get that movie to some extent. However, there are more things that include occult and strange abilities, a confirmation that the chaplain has taken off the opening point of people at the beginning of the film. The film also has an old theme where children go somewhere they don't belong to, they have some crazy party, in which case it is actually a mausoleum. The second film that I don't believe is the key feature that plays an important role in the film, and I also see that it is higher, but it was not the movie I was expecting.
