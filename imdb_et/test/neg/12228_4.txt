The only question of time was that sports movies would be corrupted! And there are many movies that need to be seen that are fun. But the biggest problem I had was that it stood for the recognition of movies. "The Comebacks" director and writers forget to create something. Although I have to admit that I was laughing at certain scenes, "The Comebacks" would have been so much funny. Participants forget their lines seriously and have a straight face across the film. Fraud requires it, and this is the main reason why stupid jokes in such films work. Because of this wrong failure, jokes never hit their mark. Some scenes take forever and usually in spoofs that don't have to be a problem. Take, for example, "Naked Gun". There is always something on their screen. In The Comebacks, they didn't even bother to let things run in the background. Only a few factors make this movie worth watching! It's fun to see movies that are fun. And Jermaine Williams is an ipod. His parody on Cube Gooding Jr. as a radio was fun! He seemed to be the only cast to get an idea of ​​what junk was. Not totally bad!
