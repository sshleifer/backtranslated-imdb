Will the Liberals, like Alec Baldwin, not get through their heads that they lost the 2000 and 2004 elections? It's ridiculous. Lame swipes WalMartis, unmarried employees, George W Bush and the stock market, let alone the deliberate GWB accent used by Balwin's character in the movie, just makes him outrageous and bitter. As credit rolls sour grapes continue "Special Thanks" is given by Ken Lay and other CEOs from Enron, Tyco, WorldCom and IMClone. Let me let you do something - if you put all of your money into one stock of the company. We don't need this excuse to tell the movie to us. What a waste of Jim Carrey's talent - from a trailer to a totally different film - what I got was the 90-minute commercial of DNC, how to frighten people not to invest in their future, keep them stupid, and keep them depending on the government. No wonder Hollywood is in trouble and can no longer make a decent movie - maybe you could get the original idea and put it on the screen once ... though I shouldn't be surprised because Jane Fonda was the original.
