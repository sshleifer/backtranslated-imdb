I have 10 year old computer games with a better special effect! The plot is unpleasant and very predictable. Most participants seem like extras without experience! Everyone has Scottish accents. It's like looking at a Scotties team from Star Trek without personality or charm. If necessary, tents are put up by people! Tents with all the allegedly high-tech devices! Seers who look like they weren't sure the camera was on them. Something that cares about you when these people survive or not! It looks like it's done in someone's backyard and garage using low-cost devices! Nothing seems original or even a little fun. Don't waste your time!
