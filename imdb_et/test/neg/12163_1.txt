Okay, I think I'm pretty much a fake, corrupted, and destroyed Stephen King's story (when they get to "Screen") like any of us sad masochists here. I know well that most of them are badly done. Waiting for it. I'm planning this. I promise it humbly ... <br /> <br /> But this time ... GEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ ... Okay, so I think I saw this thing years ago ..., fine. I thought I remembered it was pretty good ... BRIGHTNESS ... As I say (in this word, annoying, at the roundabout) I really did not try to be nervous and not expect much, but what it was, Mini series ? I only have one thing to say: D ...... R ..... A ..... W ...... NO ..... U ..... T POSSIBLE justify that things minute by minute are dragged, with the scene "ENDLESS", "MEANINGLESS" and "me numbingly SLOW"? I mean every bl ** dy scene has two people, "DISCUSSING", how they feel and back and forth and D ... R ... A ... GI ... T bl ** dy well O ... U ... T After about an hour and a half, what I think is about 1/2 running time (I didn't check, sorry :) Finally I got it completely! One and a half hours after what happened to the original accident ...? They ran away when the shop guy killed ophthalmologists, news photographers and the LOTS & LOTS & LOTS curving dialogue. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I promise I don't have to have endless meaningless action; I love LOTS movies that don't happen much, but at least when they talk and such FULL things are spoken and symbols are deepened, thoughts are transmitted ... SOMETHING !!! ??? Okay, I admit that the actors and the people were not too bad (except, of course, Stephen King). I liked the store boy, I thought both older people were fine. I liked the general and the main woman. It's just when they could have cut out all the HOURS of the fillers, that's all I say. I think there is a Sci Fi Thriller that is ... ... right? you know what really won the prize when the shop boy made one of his TIME unnecessarily, completing phone calls, this time he talks to God who knows that WHO gets all the emotional (anyway) and acts like he can't do it. .. WTF !!! ??? This man has clearly shown that he is a cold bloody and effective killer. What HELL was about ??? So, just multiply it by about 500 and this is basically the reason I finally half-turned off; it was either it or hung yourself, I swear! I mean, there are other king's "adjustments" that are flat, but at least they're moving ...! I think maybe if you are a "story" yourself and don't forget to do it and wait for SUPREME & DIVINE's patience to end, it may be useful. <br /> <br /> I doubt it sincerely and humbly ... <br /> <br /> I don't write these things very often, but this time I just went or I couldn't sleep at night (as I did during the Show :)
