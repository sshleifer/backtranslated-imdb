It was really the most painful experience I've ever had in the cinema. I will give up such light criticism as "maudlin" or "historically inaccurate" or "horse crap" because just our sympathies would go straight to these words. If the director makes a large-scale spectacular love outfit, then for God's sake, take a REAL HEIGHT HEIGHT LOVE EPIC! Why worry about such ridiculously convincing second-degree harlequin romances and such boring shifts that we could care less than the most decisive struggle in Canadian soil? And for pompous people who think, "Well, this story must focus on the characters!"
