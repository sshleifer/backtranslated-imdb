Scenery Grace Hayes celebrates in this covert little movie. After years of production, he visits a small college town to check out his grandfather's son. The child does not know who his mother is and when he sees him in a local town shop, he is a hungry jerk. The problem is that he is a college clown, the other part is that he is really spoiled. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, it turns out that Mom is really wealthy and not only funded her son's life, but is a great contributor to college. So he has the idea to force a young man to mature. He talks to a man who raises Peter and has cut his support completely - hoping that he will rise to the event. It also turns out that he puts the screws in school because he thinks all these kids have to stop playing and more responsible. <br /> <br /> Now that he's pretty stupid. To show that they know the value of hard work, he hires a bunch of them to sing and dance just in the purchased city shop. Tell us what to do! Next is like a long and not very good talent show or maybe a poor version of the music of Judy Garland / Mickey Rooney! I recommend that children try to make money for something else ... or sing and dance until people start paying for them! I know I would pay them. <br /> <br /> Considering that talent is far from talented, Peter is a bad actor and his exchange with an adult is almost instant, the whole thing is a bit difficult to take. No ordinary standard is a very good movie, this is a hidden movie that should have been dull! By the way, it is interesting that Mrs. Hayes' son, Peter, is actually his real son of life. The only problem is that Peter Lind Hayes is a really terrible actor. He's not a good leader and he's coming out like a bored and uninteresting or even reluctant. Above all, all the foolish impressions she makes are really bad and she has the sponge removed from spam. Despite this terrible progress, he had a rather successful actor career. Who would have believed it if you saw him in ZIS BOOM BAH - because here he is as welcome as the Buboon plague!
