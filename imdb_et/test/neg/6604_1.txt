not many people outside Poland have had the opportunity to get acquainted with the brilliant writings of Andrzej Sapkowski. he is very popular in poland for his fantasy short stories (I believe that none of them has ever been translated into English. Unfortunately!). A short story, wiedzmin - the main character of sapkowski books - is a traveling monster slayer, a man of exceptional strength and skill: he is your very favorite Tolkien-style cool man. unfortunately, no one sees it after watching the movie. The "wiedzmin" film is nothing more than a set of random scenes containing wiedzmin and other signs of sapkowski writings, but not eben, which is initially similar to plot and dramatic pace. if some movie shots show attractive naked women, it doesn't add any quality. the film gets worse and worse every minute and doesn't even meet the requirements of the "really bad" category. if you really are into fantasy and want to learn something about wiedzmin, read books instead.
