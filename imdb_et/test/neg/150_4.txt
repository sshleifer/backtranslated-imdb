Not as well done as "pork" flicks that are inspired by it ("meat and blood flowers" or "damn experiments") and that do not transmit any real philosophy, the video feature that is barely function long adds hardcore sex (with mosaic censorship) ) for its inspiration. Special make-up effects that include abdominal and disembowelment are pretty good when they are illuminated. The feeling of manufacturing amateurs is disturbing. It all seems cheap and lazy. The lighting is tough and the sound and editing are sloppy. A simple story includes a porn actress who gets into a real sniff movie. Just when he gets tired of violence, real abuse begins. In the movie's hero's scene, the actor cuts the woman's stomach graphically, fills her member and continues her things. I didn't find "Psycho - The Snuff Reels" shocking. On the contrary, I found it to be a desperate attempt by amateurs for one "guinea pig" and its bloody ilk. Interestingly, it was spread by the leading fetish producer Aroma.
