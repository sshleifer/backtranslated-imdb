Can anyone give me the reason why only one American dies in this movie, and if he does, it should be a very emotional scene, but if the Delta Force team kills hundreds of Russians, slow-moving scenes or thousands of Arabs, also slow-moving scenes , you should rejoice and say, "Take it, you non-Americans monsters!". I know I used a lot of "slow-moving scenes", but that's because the state of action of each movie is, you thought, slowing down. Every last one of them ... And this team should be called "Invincible Slow-Motion Bullet-Dodging Force" because they have supernatural abilities to help them defeat. And if this supernatural power fails, they have some regenerative strength that is all they need to kill their complete and non-American army between them and victory. Here, nobody cares about having fallen asleep with another scene with a ridiculous slow motion ... That means they don't laugh out loud with bad, cheesy dialogues and incredibly bad stories. What is what I did ... There are some unknown actors that are probably unaware because they don't even play characters. They just play boys (and don't forget big countries) ... The only quality is that special effects aren't so bad (though they're slow moving) for a TV movie ... But it still sucks ... and at the same time it is so bad at the time that it is good ... OK, maybe it will end up being a bit too repetitive ... <br /> <br /> 25%
