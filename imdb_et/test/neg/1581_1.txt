Wings Hauser and his son, Cole Hauser, make a film about neo-Nazi criminals who target a gay man and terrorize the city. Wings plays the hero and his real son is a villain. A fairly low budget movie that doesn't have many redeemable features and for some reason no one has seen it! Perhaps because it's a rather ridiculous and ridiculous movie, and the studio understood it! Perhaps Wings Hauser himself prevented the spread of "Skin" after he saw it himself! Maybe people just didn't want to comment on such a bad movie! Oh well! I like acting like Wings and Cole, but it was a movie they both had to skip. Wings led, wrote and was "Skins"! Very bad and stupid movie! 1/2 out *****!
