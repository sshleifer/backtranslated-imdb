It was only when I looked at the trivia section that I learned that the original producer / star of this movie, Tyrone Power, died at the time it was made. Undoubtedly, this explains why all the people on the screen have their own thoughts on other things, the symptom of which appears in a very early scene that involves a battle that can only be described as a pity. Do you know when you have painted the wall until you are completely bored? Well, this is the expression that the fighters have on their face when they are sliding their sword very incredibly. <br /> <br /> The center of the plot is Soloman, King of Israel, who has a relationship with Queen Sheeba and her people are not happy about it. You can't really blame them because there are few things in the world that are more beautiful than the motives of Israel, although the Israeli women seem to be here like Cherie Blair! Today, Israel is also a very cosmopolitan, with most Israelis born outside the country, but would it have been true a few thousand years ago, where everyone talks about European and American accents <br /> <br /> the dance sequence that must be considered plausible (And not what is not praise), we have a climax where the heavily overrun Israelis have to defend themselves against a massive Egyptian army who cannot read the card unless they knew it was in front of the canyon. That's what I can't - although the Egyptians spend the dark time out of the sun, ten minutes are spent on an Israelis who never understand that they are charging for an intermediate river! Isn't that somewhat illogical? It is also a revealing mistake, as the horses, chariots and men in the canyon are obviously miniature figures. The movie ends anyway when Soloman kills his deceptive brother and praises God for victory. But who needs Moshe Dayan, Arik Sharon or God if you have an idiotic enemy who doesn't see the abyss in front of him or waves the sword as he paints the wall?
