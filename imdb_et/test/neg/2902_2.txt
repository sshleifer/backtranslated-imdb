... and the boy is deaf. A female artist is taken over by the spirit of a recently dead ninja, straps down her panties, pouring tomato juice on her body so that her boyfriend can hit it, performs a seductive dance, then the police who killed the ninja whom he possessed will go out. Only one-eyed ninja captain will hunt it. Just like in real life? Sho Kosug alone wanted to believe in the choreography of martial arts (and his involvement with violent children). It is highly combined between genres.
