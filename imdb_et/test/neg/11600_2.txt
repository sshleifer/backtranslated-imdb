First: warning. <br /> <br /> I recently saw this movie on a DVD in the Universal 'Hitchcock Collection'. Printing the sources seems to be immature, but the image is a bit soft, suggesting that it may be a copy of the second generation directly from the video. Framing is too tight, so all the compositions are terrible. The title of the movie is also cut. I collect from other IMDb reviews that a much better version is available. <br /> <br /> Mr. and Mrs Smith are just a footnote to Hitchcock's career. <br /> <br /> With his long interviews with Francois Truffaut in the 1960s, Hitchcock gave a thorough overview of his entire body of work, but all he said about this picture is that he did it for Carole Lombard and that he didn't understand it so easily photographed in the scenario of Norman Krasna <br /> <br /> In fact, there is not much more to say. <br /> <br /> This is a comedy of screws in the same form that happened in one night, his girl's Friday and Philapdelphia's story. Carole Lombard is typically a weak husband who learns that his marriage is technically invalid, goes out with his wife with the most common intentions and spends most of the picture "divinely" unreasonably. <br /> <br /> Robert Montgomery does it well enough for his wife, but it's hard not to suffer with patience. Long before the end of the movie, the audience says: "Drag a silly cow, he's not worth it." <br /> Geen Raymond plays the best friend she is dealing with. He should be a judge, an "old family", although it is not obvious from his accent and only really gets drunk (which he otherwise plays very well). He is a respectable, generous, general gentleman, so Robert Montgomery understands him as a bully and patronizes and has made many jokes a butt - although he has not been so badly treated with a similar Ralph Bellamy character on his girl's Friday. br /> <br /> This film looks like people who knew only the comedies of the screws by reputation but hadn't really seen them. For example, a strong screw comedy is a strong central idea with several ongoing comics that are intertwined and overlapping. Here, all comedy elements are simply pulled out like necklace beads. This is a comic comedy number. <br /> <br /> This is the same direction. Usually, these comedies run at an ever faster pace, which eventually rises to hysteria. Hitchcock doesn't get it. His direction is somewhat sleepy and the picture becomes a consistent sequence of scenes, all seemingly overwritten (but malnourished) and a little too long. He was never a particularly good actor director, so he just lets you do that. They do OK. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock had a good sense of humor that he often used in his thrillers, but he had no comedy in the genre. His later fear of Harry was also unsuccessful for similar reasons in this film, but at least he was involved in this picture. Here he is just in motion. <br /> <br /> All the people involved in this movie were good professional professionals, so it's not very bad. It just seems a bit of a derivative, over familiar, too long and finally flat. <br /> <br /> Mr. and Mrs. Smith are one of the fans of Carole Lombard and only for Hitchcock graduates.
