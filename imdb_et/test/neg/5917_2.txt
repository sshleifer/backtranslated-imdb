In the 1930s, Hal Roach's studios had a comedy on the world, such as Laurel and Hardy, Charley Chase and Little Rascals. Most of these movies are extraordinary and have been out of time. The less well-known Roach product, however, was the tying of Thelma Todd and Zasu Pitti (later combined with Todd's equally contradictory Patsy Kelly). Try as I can, I just can't stand these pictures - they're just not funny. Unlike Laurel and Hardy, there was no chemical sense between Todd and his two stars. Before I think I am a crank, understand that I've seen and seen several hundred Roach movies, as well as many other early comedies, so I'm familiar with the genre and within this genre this team is the worst. Part of the reason I think I'm right in the team is that as a lower-level team, Roach was given all the scripts that no one else wanted. When Stan or Ollie hated the idea of ​​this plot, it was often given to Todd and Pitts / Kelly - and usually it showed. <br /> <br /> In this movie, however, the team is absolutely the lowest. It is difficult to imagine comedy, which is a less ridiculous and more complex plot. The film begins with the Zasu jury and Thelma as counsel for the defense. For Zasu, he is completely annoying. NOT a lovable type (like Stan Laurel or Lou Costello), but just a completely annoying and grumpy person who is tense and unpleasant. Like Thelma, as usual, he is a fairly happy "straight man" and has little to do, but to react to Zasu's nervous behavior. </p> diet pills. Given that the pills are very dangerous, if the attorney asks Zasut to try to swallow, it just seems stupid. And when they were called "pills," they were rather big black stains larger than golf balls. Their ingestion seemed only natural and pointless - even in the case of small-eyed comedy. If they find that they have swallowed the pill and it is really explosive, it panic and runs like idiots until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> As I said, I'm not a fan of this team. But even for those who like to enjoy a movie, there is no legitimate laugh at all the short ages! When I talked about this review with my husband (who also saw the movie with me), he thought my score 2 was too generous!
