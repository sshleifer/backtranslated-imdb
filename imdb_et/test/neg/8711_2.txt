The only reason I give the second letter is the first half of the movie. It was a story of good transmission. I like to see some fancy characters to add color to some well-known story. But the other half was terrible !!! Yes, this story was a violent aspect. But the writers of this film chose only violence and forgot the good things God did for the Israelites. At the end of the film, Scott saw that he had received messages from a huge giant head instead of talking and hearing from God. There were some tremendous problems with deviation from this scripture in this transfer. And a big surprise, there are no favorable deviations! The depiction of their Moses as the screaming bare man who did all this against his will is totally wrong. It showed Moses, who had to yell, to tell God. Reason The Scripture says that God spoke to Moses all the time and not only after anesthesia. They received the righteousness of the people, but could not show that God spoke to Moses with the voice of Sinai that the followers heard and believed (chapter 19). They also forgot the pillar of fire and cloud that led them day and night. <br /> <br /> What was Joshua all about? The right peace, who loves a Jew who would not fight before Moses threatens him? HIGH (He was known as a great warrior) What is the great speech Moses gave to the army that they helped God enough and now they were independent? HIGH (They won only with the help of God, as they had shown in their own scenes, when Moses raised his staff) And what was the damage to seeing the Ark? Instead of transferring it to gold, this movie was in a tight budget and added small gold chips to it! Oh yes, it was a "servant calf", not a shoulder with little chips. Someone forgot that they came out of Egypt with a great deal of golden respect from the Egyptians. You don't know this when you look at this regret. <br /> <br /> By the way, some of those who kill Israelis after the Golden Calf case say "men" and do not mention women and children who are happy about showing viewers. Oh yes - Manna was not the only thing that was sent from heaven - don't forget the meat birds. The Bible also mentions Jetro, which brings Moses his wife and children, and then Jethro says back to his land. It doesn't say Moses gave up his family. <br /> <br /> Well, if you don't know the real story, read Exodus yourself. If you know the real story, you hate this version.
