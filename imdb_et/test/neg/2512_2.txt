This is a pretty useless remake. Starting with the original headlines, it was a real mistake, as it reminds the viewer of what was a very small periodic cooler. The new version that follows is redundancy. <br /> <br /> Brian Kerwin is a townsman photographer who returns to a semi-deserted wilderness town, where scattered clichés of stock characters spread: Lollipop sucking the Daby-Doll Lolita, ornery old coot prospector, kidnapped vet and his Asian wife. <br /> <br /> Kerwin's character is witnessed by "something" crashing into the mountain and soon after the strange things happen, when the strange blue stone is scattered. The temperature starts to rise, the water in the whole area stops, people start to behave strangely, things explode. Kerwin's character gets into and out of his car more often than humanly possible in one movie. The film has no sense of place, character development, humor or tension. Everything that made Jack Arnold's original creepy Cold War paranoia classic has been abandoned. It runs easily through its minimal tendons and ends easily. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not very special - the inside of the ship looks like a staple film surrounded by ropes that then hung from the camera to frame some of the most unlit and cumbersome wires ever put on the screen. The script is repetitive - all say at least twice, Kerwin says at least twice during the movie: "Let's get out of here" twice in one scene. After all, things are not explained - why do foreigners, for example, need all the heat and water? - Not that someone looks after; if filmmakers don't care why we should? <br /> <br /> An actor is enough - better than a script that is sometimes badly practiced by improvisational quality, it deserves. Although often the actors see that they want to get the thing as soon as possible, there is a remarkable example when Elizabeth Peña registers the "hands of the frustrated despair of a short, symbolic moment" before her son Stevie expels to look at her "angry sumpy teenager smashed something down table "gesture. <br /> <br /> Consistency bugs include a (GB) sticker on the back of the Kerwin Jeep that appears and disappears, the double effect of gas in an explosive car, where cities are in two places simultaneously - once Alien Stevie POV shot right after Elizabeth Peña closed the car door twice. The film makes the biggest mistake. It's boring.
