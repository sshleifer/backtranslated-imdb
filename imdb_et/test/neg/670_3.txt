Compared to other "sand and sandals", Egypt leaves much to be desired. The film is based very well on Mika Waltar's well-studied novel, which focuses on Egyptian physician Sinhue's adventures in Akhnaton, as well as on his travels in Canaan, Mino Crete and Africa. Unfortunately, due to the moral constraints of this time, much of the Sinhue story (which is romantic and sexual), which remains on the floor of the cutting room, remains instead viewed by Victor Mature's wood with exemplary rolls and rolls. Even Gene Tierney? leading lady "staff" of time? he cannot see his best in this flick, and does not give a somnambulistic report that can only be justified by the fact that the actor had serious psychiatric problems at that time. There is a lot of rhetoric and theological machination over the idea of ​​monotheism and polytheism, but Michael Wilding is as tiring as the revolutionary Akhnaton that somebody wants to unleash him and restore the old religion before the second raid. My advice: buy a book from E-Bay, rent something other than Solomon and Sheba, and then call it night!
