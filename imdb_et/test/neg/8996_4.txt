Naach A more detailed overview can be found anywhere on the web. This is a good image, although I do not fully agree with it. Taran is a commercial boy and consequently only from his point of view. one in some part ... I don't even compare Urmila and Anthara. Both are good! The first is better performing talent, although the latter is well on its way. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I like the character of Anthara. He is true to his art, which is not touched by unnecessary emotions and certainly not too practical. He is a dance scientist, in fact he is so confident in his theory that even his comparison with a scientist would offend him. Hey. Donald Trump .. Maybe you have to ditch Melania, here is Anthara and you've already built Taj Mahali ... isn't that easy? On the other hand, Abhekek is a practical companion for money, power, fame, etc. Thus, the two, although they were struggling to break into the film industry, are unable to face their own style and way of life. This is very typical, but what I like about the film is that he says what Abhima says in his whole runtime, in one scene! What's new? This film looks at the film industry at a different angle and how different people get into it. There's always something else in RGV movies, it's different, it's too slow for its standards. In some parts it pulls one almost to sleep. <br /> <br /> Noteworthy It's hard to say anything other than the first half of Anthara's movie. I think this leather show was necessary for the dance classes involved :-) Anthara also sees a yoga pro, she is too flexible, almost like Prabhu Devi. Aby Baby improves every movie as an actor. I am sure that his film program will cost a rich dividend. The title song was really good, music was generally above average.
