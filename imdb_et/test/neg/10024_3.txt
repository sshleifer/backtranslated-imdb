Uhhh ... so do they even have writers for that? Maybe I'm picky, but I like a little dialogue with my movies. And as far as movies are concerned, only the development of character is enough. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Prey does not guarantee this? and if you think I'm hyperbolic, you just have to look at it yourself. Scene after the scene, we just get actors who are looking for themselves lost and uncomfortable, giving up the script. Outside calling each other's names, when they are separated in the forest (natch), the only cases where these people say something substantive, when one character explains the constellation Orion (clearly plagiarized from Funk & Wagnalls; bright fare, no?) And another repeats the story of an old campfire that doesn't even have anything to do with the plot (wait for the plot?) At other times, Prey is actually a galic that shoots his characters far enough away from the boom mic so we can't exactly hear what they're doing saying. So we get the whole scene where the actors are worried! On purpose! Seriously, I've seen more dialogue in a quiet movie. It would be like the filmmakers sat in a Rancho Cucamonga bar at the end of the 80s, and one looked at him and said, "Hey, I really consider it a sweet idea to burst into fear of the gag. The whole function around it." And ... they did. To be fair, Prey was probably a writer aboard. I think someone had to mark and mark the sequence of the scene. However, I am absolutely convinced that this film had no editor. There are outstanding breaks, a boring table and a feeling of zero. The filmmakers have nothing else in the "script", so they fill the runner-up taxonomy of the forests where our natural and mad teenagers get sliced ​​and cubed. These movie players are all filmed in simple, day-to-day light in a completely reserved way and without atmospheric photography. If it seems to be a science film, it's because it is. I'm pretty sure this is all the footage in the nature exhibition - all that is missing is a nasty geographic alderman story. <br /> <br /> More exciting materials from the welcoming floor space: a scene where two men discuss sandwiches with cucumber and cream cheese and another scene where a supportive character is put on a banjo that seems to be a whole minute and a half! Minutes and a half! It's a lot of banjoing to start with celluloid, not to mention the final cut of the movie! Make, guys! The real victims of this slaughterhouse are brevity and refraction. <br /> <br /> Indeed, in the last 25 minutes, the film takes a lot of steam (comparatively), where much of the carnage has been condensed and where Béla Bartóki's "Strings, Percussion and Celesta" music is broken. Vaudeville's great Jackie Coogan makes it fun to look like a tubby, a bumbly park traveler (this was her last role if you can believe it). And there are some nice moments, including tearing the neck and the above-mentioned decapitation. The make-up for the killer (Carel Struycken, also known as "Lurch" from Addams Family Films) is also quite effective and makes him look like a strange hybrid of young Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. In addition, if you love terrible, straight cuts, you need to check how they surround the puppy. I promise to spit it. Usually I love movies that are at a level that has failed, but the first three quarters of Prey are just so eternally boring that they pretty much ruin the rest. All in all, this is a very embarrassing and tedious thing, and although it is not all bad, it should only be seen by weak Slasher graduates. Why do we do it ourselves?
