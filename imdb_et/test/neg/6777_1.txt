I accidentally saw this picture on television one night when I couldn't sleep. It didn't help the least. I found that I was looking at the ceiling, trying to forget that face. I could happily ever see this picture, just because of that face. <br /> <br /> Now, don't get me wrong - I love fairy tales and nursery rhymes as much as anyone. But this twisted and scary transfer is just disturbing. This is mainly a cruel laughter and exaggerated features that scare me and I still have a nightmare for it. Please, please, do not allow your children to see it. It's far, the FAR is too scary. Please, please, hold it.
