Incredibly, "Vampire Assassin" is significantly worse than atrocities like "Tequila Body Shots" and "Zombie Nation" - and these movies are TERRIBLE. Writer / director / star Ron Hall lacks both charisma and operational ability and is obviously capable of the most basic management concepts. It is possible that the film has ever seen the worst camera work, editing, lighting, sound, visual effects, music and fighting choreography. Rarely are two shots cut off, nor does it see much in low light. The amazing dialogue speaks very slowly of the extremely unattractive pain that stretches the film almost deadly in 87 minutes. This is a truly ridiculous embarrassment for all involved. Obviously, this is seen by horrible filmmakers, but it is very difficult to sit down as experienced as a bad movie viewer. The fact that Ron Hall thought it was actually released is amazing. If you are a film director and you think it is necessary to add a few frames of the word SLUG before the title appears, it is left out of your rough editing - and obviously you can't collect energy for changing their frames - then your standards are obviously so low that they are offensive. I'm surprised that Lions Gate / Maple agreed to release this movie from DVD. Despite Rudy Ray Moore's very short films, this film is an extremely self-conscious work by Ron Hall - he clearly thinks he is an amazing actor and must also believe he has better writing and leadership skills - but the film is so incredibly incredible, that it is hard to believe that he would really want people to see it because they fear cruelly excoriated as i do now. Jaw, unpleasantly awful movie. I'm not kidding.
