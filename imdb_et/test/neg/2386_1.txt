"The New Twenty" is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Yes, some may argue that smaller budget pictures that are smaller may seem worse, but I argue that the pseudo-intellectual anti-formulaic indie film that pretends to be more is worse. <br /> <br /> "The New Twenty" was written and directed by Chris Mason Johnson, and I will never regain my 91-minute life that I wasted on my film. <br /> <br /> THE SCREENPLAY & CHARACTERS <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, the scenario could not provide the hero or hero with a moral core that the audience would like to see or not. The story says that three dramatic conflicts are man vs. man, man vs. man. world and man vs. The scenario focuses on a group of friends at New York College and is concerned about the dynamics of man and self, where the character of each film is in the stupor of depression and self-destructive behavior that the film atrophies the audience with very eyes. <br /> <br /> Every major character gives inexplicably bad behavior (a heroin addiction that has no history, why this character's addict; a fianc√© who has a relative to his / her groom's boss / investor, although the character is written too smart to have sex with such a weak character, a man who starts as a decent guy but is attracted to an attractive investor, and for an unknown reason converts a similar unpleasant business to a jackass. cyber geek who does nothing but searches for dates online, and a gay asian man who gets an HIV-positive parent man, but not having scenes, why relationships work and why love develops). <br /> <br /> Important scenes creating the cause of this character's addiction, groom's suffering, and self-expression that can explain why he slept with his sleeping bag; back a story that explains why a decent man would attract "Gordon Gecko" characters and become a jackass; story of robbed cybercrime; and more there is no relationship between an Asian person and an HIV-positive boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Without proper details, all character actions seem to be forced and livened up. <br /> <br /> CINEMATOGRAPHY & SCORE I found that Mr Johnson's direction is clear, leaving participants emotionally connected. <br /> <br /> Cinematography can, at best, be described as everyday. Mr. Johnson chose a small space to shoot and could not catch the grandeur of New York. This failure created a claustrophobic film that was watched as a filming, not a movie. <br /> <br /> The result was embarrassing for most movies. I assume that Mr Johnson is guilty because he could have asked for a complete score to improve the understanding of each picture. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION <br /> <br /> "New Twenty" is a tedious movie omission.
