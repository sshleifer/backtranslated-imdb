VERY and Tom and Jerry short. Jerry tells a story that turns Tom into love and loses his rival Butch. Tom is Jerry's best friends who shook me a little. A copy is also provided in Cinemascope. In general, I found this Tom and Jerry comic sad and depressing. Instead, I could just put "Puss on boot" and I would have been happy. This experimental animated short is available on the Warner Brother 2-DVD Spotlight collection disc. This is the latest set and I hope Warner Brothers will decide to release another volume soon. <br /> <br /> My degree: C-
