Animated series: <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux was an immoral rebel that was all and all. He was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, witty, corrosive, confident, sarcastic, deadly, unchanging, and vague. The original Aeon had layers of depth layers. He almost never promised to show his personal emotions. The original plot was amazingly vague and thought provocative. You can never say what Aeon's motives were. Aeon was a military anarchist, while Trevor was a radical idealist, so they could never have a stable relationship. <br /> <br /> In the movie: <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux is working on Monicans and his political motives and personal motives are very clear. He was pretty, loving, vulnerable, easily tolerated, emotional and very predictable. In the film Aeon had one depth layer. The plot was obvious and lively. Everything is fully intended for you from the beginning. There was virtually no conflict between Aeon and Trevor, at least in terms of personal philosophy. The only conflict between them was that they were on different sides. <br /> <br /> The film was a terrible disappointment for me. I felt Friday. They took the idea that one of my favorite animated characters, pushed him out of all depth and personality, and pumped him full of Hollywood clich√©s. The essence of the animated series in this film disappeared completely. <br /> <br /> The only reason I don't give this movie "1" is that the visuals were incredible. It was pure to see some familiar animated scenes like flying CGI eyes.
