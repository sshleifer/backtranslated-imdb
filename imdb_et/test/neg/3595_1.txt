Now I know that a lot of black humor is amusing to typical black things like gold teeth. But that doesn't mean they're always funny. Don't be a dangerous example of this. The city dweller is definitely a satire. The problem is that Wayans and consortia not only try to satirize a typical "ghetto" culture, but also disparage current statements made in urban elements such as Boyz 'n' Hood or Menace II Society. Personally, I think that the makers of this film should take their heads out of the white movement of their white masters. In addition, the film itself is terrible. It's not absolutely funny. Jokes are racist. Instead of satirizing the genre of urban games, film artists show their views on the black city of the "ignorant" city (ghetto). Now there are some more jokes in this movie, but I believe this is the main price. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is nonsense and the creators should use their talents to make a constructive comedy / satire movie. They have examples of men with black hats (which were made before this movie) and on Friday.
