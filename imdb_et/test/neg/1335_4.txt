Well, I fell for that. I saw this box in the video store and saw it for "Girlfight", which I heard very much. In my own defense, the titles are similar, and they made the box cover design again so it seemed almost identical. Anyway, in a nutshell, they obviously made the whole package / promo of the cover to take advantage of "Girlfight" buzz / success. I put it in and got a bad feeling when they started showing trailers with low-budget direct-video clips and even worse than the movie's main song music video, which sounded like lift music and highlighted brilliant clip clips in the movie preceded the main function. When I saw the first few minutes and Maria Conchita Alonso appeared, I knew I fell for it. (don't get me wrong, he's a talented actor, but I knew he wasn't in "Girlfight", a movie that I was under the impression I rented). <br /> <br /> So, in addition to the fact that I feel frustrated and crazy about myself, the movie is not to look any further. The plot includes a young Latino woman who is the daughter of a former champion boxer. One of his close friends is a female boxer who - and I saw it all the time as it was really sloppy - was seriously injured during the game, with an average champion named "Terminator", who resembles a larger, more inflated Ike Turner female version. Of course, Belle decides that the only thing to do is get a boxer and apologize to her friend. She lives with her caring, supportive, still defensive father (her mother died during cancer when she was younger) who just happens to be a policeman. His interest in love, as well as caring and supportive, but defensive, is also a policeman who works with his father. Hmmm, they both have jobs that threaten their job responsibilities ... don't know what's going on? She starts her workout and meets a slippery driver who, of course, pretends to care for her, but wants to take advantage of her. The actors they hired look like a very small rent on Cary Ewel and are so young that he can succeed with the mustache. His action was also really bad. I'm not even going to go to the plot any more, because anyone who has seen Rocky or almost everyone knows exactly where this movie goes and how it ends. <br /> <br /> It wasn't a terrible movie. Most of the actors were OK and the leading actor was very good. There were good and strong Latino role models. The final struggle made me interesting, although I knew everything that happened long before. The actor who played the "Terminator" did a great job because he didn't want Belle to take him to $$ and he would have been Belle again, though there were no surprises. My favorite moment (maybe the only moment I myself did not make a mistake to borrow the movie erroneously) was when Belle struck her slippery driver after she showed her true colors, hugs her and then turns back to Suddenly fake a punch and watch him cringe back in fear, showing that he is really one responsible. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was really bad, my main complaint. One of their attempts to be funny was someone who was talking about boxing, saying "size is not important" and a woman who is irresponsible, "now where have I heard it before?" Other features that should have a dramatic effect are "Doctors said I should never walk again!" "Come on, you know you trust me!" and "Your mother would have been so proud of you". I could go on. Nothing you've heard millions of times in bad soap operas or weekly movies. Maybe I'm too thoughtful - the filmmakers made the effort and I sat through the whole thing voluntarily ... but just because I didn't see when I was working. You might get worse (especially if you are looking for strong female characters), but you could do a lot, much better.
