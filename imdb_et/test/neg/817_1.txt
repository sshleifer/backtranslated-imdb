I say that. If you want to see art, you go to the art gallery. If you want to see the movie, you go to the theater. Embedding art and film is trying "where the heart is" catastrophic. This embarrassment is amazing. You like Dabney Coleman, see "Short Time". You like Crispin Glover, see "Bartleby". You like Uma Thurman, see "Kill Bill". First of all, if you like Christopher Plummer, see "Silent Partner" because his character here is a terrible torment. In fact, this whole production is embarrassing. Of course, to make a man's artwork intriguing for a few minutes, make it short, but don't let the audience make meaningless meaning that is filmed entertainment. - MERK
