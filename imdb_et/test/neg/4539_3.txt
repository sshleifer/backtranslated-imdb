Anyone who sees this movie notices that the makers threw a lot of money on this film. It is interesting that they called it "Hole"! Production values ​​are good for short films. The hole tries to find a big budget and does it in some ways, but it is hampered by the video format it has taken. I speculate whether it was shot at 35 mm and it would look incredible and would raise the content somewhat. Many Hollywood movies look good and sufficient for the audience, no matter what the story and content. <br /> <br /> My honest opinion, 3 of 10. Maybe Ishimoto is the next movie.
