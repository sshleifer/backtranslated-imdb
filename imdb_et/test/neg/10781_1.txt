Sometimes the movie is so bad that you just follow the fear. This is one of those movies. Of course I can't get biased. I'm from Chicago so I looked at scenes exactly and I can't find Billy Crystals at all funny. And I can't stand for English photography (Tony Scott etc) with the smoke machine running overtime and all the soft lighting. I think we should believe that Billy Crystal is really in Chicago because she's wearing a Cubsi jersey. Oh and the plot. If you really think about it, these guys should be locked, not bad guys, because they're more dangerous. And, of course, the police have a clich√© on the edge of the pension. But the most fun scene is the climax where good and bad boys die in the Thompson Center (public building!) Of course, this is a cool building, but it is equivalent to making huge drugs in a white house.
