I hate being too critical, but it was really bad. I like Baldwin's brothers, I just want the talent to be more evenly shared between them. I liked the general plot, but the quality indicator was too much and too little. <br /> <br /> My favorite sign of the whole thing was bald policeman. He reminded me of Dmitry Valtane (I believe Jeremy Roberts) from Start Trek 6: Undiscovered State. Just without hair. <br /> <br /> If you have a Hollywood video MVP program and you are really trying to get your money, go through one of the three MVP movies you take. For some laugh it is worth it. <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive special effects in the whole performance is Stephen Baldwin's shotgun sound. I think this will allow you a little bit of quality and excitement for the rest of the performance.
