I'm sorry, but I just don't understand why someone really likes it. It is stereotypical and REAL homeschoolers are NOT as they were at this show !! Personally, I am glad that it was canceled after the first few episodes. I would like to say that such an exhibition would certainly be a good thing if everyone knew that home educators were not really and the whole story was just for the show, but unfortunately not everyone is aware of it. If somebody who watched it believed it was going on in the life of a home educator, I feel honest about them. It reminds me of the image they have in the "Mean Girls" home school for children. It's sad, really, people think so. It's a complete garbage, IMHO.
