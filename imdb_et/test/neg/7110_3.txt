This 1988 film was recently shown on cable television. We wanted to see another movie that allegedly started, but because of the mix-up, Rent-a-Cop, appeared in that period. We never saw it when it was commercially released. Bad decision. <br /> <br /> One wonders what "Rent-a-Cop" was for the people behind the picture, or how they sold it behind the sale in the studio. This film seems to have failed a lot of time. This movie doesn't add anything new to its genre. This is completely predictable, because if the main assumption is shown, we know how it will end. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds plays a wooden church. This actor can do better, but who knows what happens behind the scenes or perhaps the direction given to Jerry London was the opposite. Mr. Reynolds has one expression throughout the film. He just doesn't register any emotion at all. <br /> <br /> Lisa Minnell, if the whore who saw the original killing of a Chicago hotel makes no sense at all. Her della and church romance seem to be fake from the beginning. He and Mr. Reynolds play one-dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this turkey.
