Eddie Murphy took her career for the time she had the juice she wanted to make, HARLEM NIGHTS, an expensive look, but ultimately a blank gangster saga, production, leadership, writing and starring. black nightclub owners / gangsters who ran a ricky club in the 1930s led by screaming (Eddie Murphy) and his father (Richard Pryor) and their attempts to avoid white gangsters who think they are taking over the turf that they think rightly, just because of their color. It was an idea that probably seemed great on paper, but definitely lost something in translation. It was a tricky piece for Eddie and I think she's getting too little here trying to be the whole show. Of course, Murphy and Pryor's joy was on one screen, but the rest of the great support casts, including Arsenio Hall, Redd Foxx, Della Reese, Michael Lerner, Danny Aiello, Jasmine Guy, Thomas Mikal Ford, Stan Shaw and Eddie's brother are really worth a little to do ( although I confess Murphy's fight against Della Reese is hysterically funny and probably the best scene in the movie). Murphy clearly poured a lot of money into this film and a lot of it on the screen. The art and direction set is impressive, and breathtaking costumes could have won the Oscar, but it was a big draw for Eddie because he was trying to wear too many hats.
