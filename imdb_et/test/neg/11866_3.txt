Yes, this is your typical direct video responsibility. And, of course, they do their best to change it a bit, but can't do it miraculously. Snipes delivers the perfect joy it always does. Colloca proves that you don't need any talent to mark a movie, but only a sexual complaint. The worst part is that it didn't cover my bad movie basics, which is: 1 ?? Cheap looking villains. 2? Perfectly timed with one liner. 3? A strong car drives with massive explosions. 4? The hero fucked the hot chick. 5? Many naked or little clad women without reason. OK, I lied, it covers them, but it does so terribly.
