I saw Winnie Heffalump a few days ago. A nice story based on the well-known characters created by A.A.Milne. Although Winnie, Piglet, Tigger and Rabbit are all in this animated feature, the main character is Roo this time. He communicates with a terrifying Heffalump who is not at all intimidating and shows everyone that friendship knows no boundaries and everyone wants and deserves to be happy. I love this movie and I love it even more than 10 or 15 years younger. Unfortunately, I would like to become a child again to enjoy this much more of Heffalump's story, but all I have left is the feeling of sadness when losing some kind of childhood and innocence that this film is full of? I was delighted to hear Carly Simon singing, Joel McNeely gave an excellent score.
