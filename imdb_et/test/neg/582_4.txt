Lou Costello (sans Abbott) plays the "garbage collector" (and inventor of the time-controlling machine), a self-employed small town secretary, who conceals a citizen's niece. After the spat, Lou girl (Dorothy Provine) runs a misty cave - why it's foggy, we never learn - and appears as a 30-meter giant. It is definitely a good sport, and he doesn't bother to try not to look ridiculous (it would have been impossible anyway), but the screenwriter is really cruel to his character, turning him not only into a gigantic but scary well. Give bosses Costello while destroying the army troops who have been summoned, but there is nothing funny about transformation. Last year, the film, which was crushed by the 50's attack, has Lou Costello in his last bow, but it gives little more. Special effects are marginal, while the script needs funny lines and direction faster. * 1/2 from ****
