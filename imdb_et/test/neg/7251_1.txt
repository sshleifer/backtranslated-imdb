Although my exposure to world cultures is limited, I try. It was a movie I tried and hated. Worst of all, after so many people have heard of typical Hollywood fare and stereotypical cartoons, I saw that Eastenders is inevitably realistic. and he wants to do it as a waiter. The goal is high, I always say. Brad Dorif, or a faxed photo of him, or quite likely a wedge-shaped wig, was hard to say, offers to hire Clint when he gets a pair of shoes. <br /> <br /> Clint and a huge entourage, probably misleading throughout England, trying to get her some shoes. Eventually they reach the suburbs home. For whom it is not clear. Mother helps girl to shoot. Oh, now you have a reality! Ms. Brady may be a ridiculous stereotype of American housewives, but she never helped Marsha to get rid of the vein. Heavenly Grace! The father comes home and sings some Elvis stories and then pursues the children. <br /> <br /> Why did Clint borrow money and buy shoes in another store? Why didn't he go to church and kindly ask the nun for help? Why didn't he climb up the shoe store and put it? I just don't know! None of these things seemed to be under him. Benevolent groups, such as goodwill and the Salvation Army, are people who help people. I know the people who work there! If someone with no money appeared and needed a gift, the staff would give the person the shoes. Maybe not Prada or Gucci, but some kind of foot covering. Not many of these groups give mobile phones to the most vulnerable, but shoes are not usually a problem. What a pointless concept. The world, or at least the western part of it, is not just that cruel. In England, maybe it comes from "Queen's Royal Charity", not from goodwill, but people who need a gift will get them. <br /> <br /> Apart from looking for footwear, there was no perceived plot action. Not that it made the movie faster or more acceptable, remember. Despite repeated testing of the tape cover, I didn't look at the 20-hour extended version, but it just seemed like that. <br /> <br /> Did Clint get her shoes? Did Brad Dourif's cardboard sections hire him in the restaurant? Did I ever look at anything else abroad? <br /> <br /> [spoiler] Yes, yes, and yes. <br /> <br /> As for the fate of this particular movie, I decided to finish it all. I took out my S&W .45 and came through the cartridge a half inch hole. Blammo! (I definitely did it back.) I put it back on the tape sleeve, returned it to the rental area and amazingly NO ONE ASKED ASK! Of course, this means that no one else has rented it for at least the other three years I lived in that city. Others knew something I didn't do. Life and learning. <br /> <br /> BTW, if you rent something you have never seen before and someone has done it, take that sign. And if you work in Kroger's video department, I'm just kidding. <br /> <br /> Footnote: this classic has not yet seen the daylight on DVD, for which we should be grateful forever to the digital gods.
