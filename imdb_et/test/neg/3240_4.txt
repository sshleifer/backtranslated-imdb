With so many bad appraisers, it made me think about what people think when you look at a pretty bad director's flick? Did everyone expect a super-hit flawless movie? In no way, you already see, Raj Kumar Kohli loves multi-starrer movies ... All his previous work with several starrers, but no one was flawless. Take, for example, the first John Dushman, so many mistakes, but still fun. Jaani Dushman is a prestigious fantasy movie about a snake who can be in any form (Arma (Kohvik) Kohli), revenge for the suicide of his lover (Manisha Koirala) for the people who caused it. . Its a pretty good, big star. But I think it could have been a lot better. For example, take the script, can't say its flawless. For example, age: <br /> <br /> Does 40-48 year olds still study at university ?? There's a lot more, I don't read more, but there are ten more. Solid 5.5 is good for that. <br /> <br /> ** 75
