I know everyone said that this movie was totally crap and I agree with them. I spent a few years after seeing it to other people saying it was a mess. I advised them not to see it. But when it came to TV, we saw this ad. I turned to the family and said, "I know it's sad, but I mean looking at it". My sister turned to me and said, "Yes, I too." And you know what? It was funny. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie. It's a waste of time. But it's a waste of time. It may be thought to be enough messy and fair, but I thought it was really funny comedy. I didn't like a few bits like when the fish hit the car, but after that I thought it was good. I loved to sit there and choose all the famous Australian faces: Flacco, Elle McFeast, Garry McDonald, etc. <br /> <br /> So if you want to waste your time, watch this movie. Otherwise, look at the drama or something.
