Especially if you love terrible movies. When I started to see it for the first time, I can say, "I hope there is dance." Imagine my joy if not only the two main characters danced, but the main ghost started to dance. AND Sherman Hemsley sings the song song on it (not to mention the song song). It makes me a little sad that she broke because of this movie, but I've never liked her as an actor and she should have known it better. Even the director does not take credit for this movie (and you should watch some of the other films he directed!). <br /> <br /> One warning note, but the writer seemed to be joking about, um, the lower areas of men. For example, one character will discover the book "The Wedges of the Darkest Types". I'm not kidding. And this is the most disturbing part of the movie for me. In addition, you will find the most hidden video rental shops in your city, get a movie, invite all your friends and laugh until you cry with Ghost Fever.
