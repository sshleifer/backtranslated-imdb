Warning: This may include SPOILERS !! <br /> <br /> First of all, I watch a lot of lifetime movies and realize that they are just like that .... Lifetime movies. Some are big (really), some are good and some are bad. Unfortunately, this movie belongs to the last category. In fact, it started with some potential .... a single, divorced hard-working mom (who goes to work at 2:00 pm) cuts her home from work and says she doesn't take it too well. Stalking begins as soon as a phone call hangs up and expands, that his home is spoiled and completely trashed. So she goes to her mother for the night and the next morning her mother's car blows. It seems like the pain of our hero who deals with going to the underwear and jewelry! So the police put him and his son in a secure motel to keep him safe and what does his mother do? She goes to work, leaving the boy alone at night in a strange motel room and tells her to order PIZZA !!! I couldn't believe it! Then it's really stupid! And the end ended me angry because it was so ridiculous and typical. Too bad because there seemed to be opportunities.
