this movie is honestly the worst garbage I've ever seen. it is slow, less primer and boring. operator deserves to be shot. Inadvertent comedy had several aspects, one of which was Jared's strange camp. Many laugh, but also many horrors. Don't look at someone anywhere. If u hate someone, we recommend buying or renting it. big waste of time and money. Thanks Gus Van Sant ... not. I don't mean to say anything other than Never see this movie, it makes u want to jump on the rock. Hope Gus and his companions read this comment before it is too late and it will make another or another catastrophe that seems to have been shot with the camera on the phone.
