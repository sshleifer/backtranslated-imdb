for me it is not a good TV show, animated or otherwise. This is, however, annoying to the nth degree. There are a few reasons for this, not in any order. First, one of the most pointless, and still annoying characters, the character of Batmite.this does not show any purpose, though it is meant for a comic relaxation, but it doesn't work in this way.Next up, Joker.i thought it was really ridiculous to have the character let go of that ridiculous laugh after almost every sentence.talk about repetitive.this gets old really fast .. also don't think it was the right actor voice character .it just doesn't sound at all as a joker should sound.lastly, they made Robin look like a complete dork.other than those problems, the show is not so bad.but these are big enough problems to drastically lower the likability factor for me, "New adventures Batman is 3/10, at best.
