... what a porn movie would look like if you took out sex and just left bad dialogue, cheap kits and bad behavior, you would be in Galaxy. <br /> <br /> This movie came out when the original Star Wars proved that there is a science fiction market. This, in turn, brings some gems like Alien and revived Star Trek. Unfortunately, it also led to bad movies and it was probably one of them. (I'll probably say, because I hadn't heard about this movie a few days ago. I missed it in 1980.) <br /> <br /> Here's the main problem. Dorothy Stratton couldn't do so, so for most movies she didn't even try. I understand that his tragic death has given this film a worthy cult status, but I do not understand why for my life. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the movie tried Spoof Star Wars, Star Trek and Aliens, but they are obviously not understandable if anything wrong, it must be FUNNY! This film was not, or at least comic, about jokes that would have been funny. Science Fiction is mature for parody because Spaceballs and Galaxy Quest proved. But this movie did it badly.
