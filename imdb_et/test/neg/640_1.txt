This is a really terrible movie. Lou Diamond Phillips simply calls it. Miniature models of the train are ridiculous. It looks like the plot is developing (an alien is on board, there is an eco-terrorist on board, and the conductor is dead and the train is under control; oh, and the train goes one hour before running the train, oh, and this train has this nuclear waste ...). I mean, come on! Aliens' monsters are not intimidating (though they are many) and the actor is sad. See who the boy is playing "next president" - do you really think he could be the president? For the sake of prosperity, he has played bad guys with all his acting career!
