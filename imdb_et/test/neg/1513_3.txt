Aside from the fact that this film was made (I thought it was a good idea at a time when BOTTOM was so popular, it was one thing that was bad about GUEST HOUSE PARADISO) what happened with light? No artificial lighting is used in this film, and I watched it on network TV so it wasn't that it would look tiring on tape. In fact, the film was so dark that it was impossible to see what hell was going on. But if that dialogue were something that maybe it wouldn't be bad
