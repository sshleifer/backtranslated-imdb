I say that Ben Johnson and my Kazan people say, "Ben Johnson?!" He was the boy of the gods MOVIE STAR, COWBOY and 1976 he was scraping when he played the sheriff for a fool intended for TV disaster films where they created KILLER BEES ONLY BORN, which everyone probably thought they would come to us at that time. So these are the bees and they kill some people while driving in their mouth and under water. Finally, these idiots find their spit and die and this woman is trapped in her car. The cops are like what we do? Yes, bees die when it's cold. So when can we do the cold? I know - New Orleans Stadium! So they drive this car and the accompanying murder of murderers on the streets of New Orleans, where there is a whore, saying, "OR CLOSE OR YOU TO ASSOCIATE DAMAGE." And the homes of tens of thousands of future victims of floods with their broken toilets will become a narcotic dome for that particular bee. I don't know what the biggest reluctance to this big city ... well, but it sucks. Most conveniently viewed for an extremely dull-orange 16 mm print, although Betamax is a good alternative!
