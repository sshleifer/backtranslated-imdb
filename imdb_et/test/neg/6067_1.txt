Kreestos: <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrible, terrible, burning. Acting for the poor. Many shortcomings in the plots. I don't recommend it at all. <br /> <br /> From Wikipedia: <br /> <br /> Artistic Licenses The manuscript of this work has been attributed to two copiers [1], both male and not female, as depicted in the film. <br /> <br /> Copiers did not deliver results or change the score. In fact, Beethoven's defects from the original score were a mistake. <br /> <br /> The film is in Beetov's Ninth Symphony in 1824. Throughout the film, Beethoven has shown that he is hearing impaired, but is able to understand the people who speak loudly. In fact, Beethoven lost much of his hearing seven years earlier (1817). Beethoven never experienced permanent deafness; his condition changed to silence and terrible tinnitus. The ninth symphony was made at a time when Beethoven's hearing had seriously deteriorated. At this point, most of Beethoven's conversations included the use of laptops. It may, however, be said that he was also able to read the human lip, as evidenced by his demand that people saw him speaking to him. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Beethoven puts a hint on Moonlight Sonata. This is anachronism because Sonatat nr. 14 "quasi una fantasy" did not become "Moonlight" until several years after his death.
