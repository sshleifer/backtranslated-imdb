It is always interesting to watch the horror movie after so many praise from other fans. Experience has taught me that you should never generalize the fan taste within the genre. My expectations for this movie were much higher than my opinion. <br /> <br /> Children should not play with dead things. This is a good plan movie that moves too many times to carry it out. I was thinking that the band of actors who directed the revival of dead bodies was interesting to me. But all degenerated into cinematographic chaos. For participants who were mostly competent and astonishingly expressive, tasks were offered that were unable to consistently characterize. Some of these characters come from the whole cemetery attack process to explicit criticism, back to ambivalence. This is one thing the characters have in the heart of film change; it is another to create a too dynamic, round attitude that loops every ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Another controversial element of the movie is the premise. Does the main protagonist want the ceremony to be a thirst for the theater, or did he actually push the dead with the spiritual powers? Even with the above-mentioned drawbacks, I would recommend this movie to other horror fans, because I believe that only real horror fans will appreciate the dark components of the atmosphere and will be able to ignore the plot's contradiction. A scene where the rise from the grave is extremely haunting (even for a veteran-zombie enthusiast) with the excellent combination of landscapes and sound, and a large selection of qualified players selected to play restored dead. Current filmmakers should learn from CSPWDT about the right use of video and audio techniques for mood development. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you are a zombie movie graduate like me, you should take the time to find and watch this movie. It's a fun clock.
