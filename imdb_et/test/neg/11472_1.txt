I watched the director cut last night ... glad that it was a free rental, even the dollar would have been too much to pay for a "movie noir" to watch this experiment. Anacronisms (modern phones) were annoying to me, not wise, rather than budgetary constraints than anything else. "Non-traditional" pain also found confusion. When I have to follow the story to wonder, "What the hell is there a black chick / queen of queen?" then the narrator has failed me. Again, not wise in my opinion, but the annoying and irritating and very movie school final project-ish. And for the sake of letting you shoot in black and white, use at least some of the techniques used in old films that take full advantage of color. No light nuances, no gray tone, no depth, no texture ... just black and just white ... boring!
