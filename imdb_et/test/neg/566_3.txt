I loved the first 15 minutes, and I loved some of the dialogue in the tribunal - which proved to be the best show for the director's method of working over time, but that movie eventually disappeared. Even if it is viewed only as a metaphor of a source of oppression / oppression, which was and is prevalent in the relationship between the US government and its "less famous" citizens, it is still lacking in punch and credibility and ultimately left me to look for the obvious end already happened. <br /> <br /> And despite the record: in spite of frightening rumors, this movie is never banned in the United States (I can't comment on UK censorship rumors, but I'm suspicious). Hollywood refused to distribute it after his original film festival, and I am more than willing to believe that the Nixon government influenced this decision somewhat; However, the fact that it never appeared on American television reflects the rather cautious and advertising-oriented business of this media. As for the current, you can send your day to your DVD with Amazon through your door within a few days.
