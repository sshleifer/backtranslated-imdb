Experimental filmmaker Nathaniel Dorsky says some films are structured like a camera mounted on a dog that goes under the alley, sliding down the road. <br /> <br /> The movie is. The structure is "Kurosawa started as a child, she became a child, then a young man, then a film director, then he started to" masterpieces ", then grew old, The End." The word "masterpiece" is used in this film a lot to describe Kurosawa's output without explaining what * makes her films so good / big. Just because the screen-narrator who reads the script says the film is a masterpiece, should we kiss her back and accept that a particular film is one of the 20th century's greatest works of art? And one more point. Paul Scofield's voice is used as Kurosawa's voice when extracts from the director's memories are read off the screen. She brings pear-shaped Shakespeare tones to the text ... but why? If you made a documentary about Billie Holiday, would you use Dame Judi Densch as your voice ??
