Unlike other western spaghetti, it has signs that are almost meaningful and can be identified to some extent. It still has the western buggy of other spaghetti. Spaghetti, by the way, is another word for the West, who has no plot, no signs you can't take care of, and a funny gun that doesn't make a little sense to the era, and based on great music, so that viewers feel something. It is more light, like Bud Spencer and Terence Hill together. They were also better than the junk made by Eastwood and others, which sado-masochists make to see their friends when they get the chance. Everyone seems to have had fun with the movie. It was good to see a giant actor, such as Gilbert Roland, who wasn't even mentioned in the movie rental box, but who was clearly the biggest name. His character was very enjoyable. At the end, there is a triple segregation that is much better than what it says (The Good the Bad and Ugly), just because the characters are at least a bit pleasant and a little identifiable. Not a good movie, but it's a little fun.
