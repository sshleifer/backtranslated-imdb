This movie will show you the map and then explain the radar and it will be quite some time before you see deadly death. Probably a better film of the 1950s, this date is a bit slow movement and the end of the end is not very good. Although it has its moments when Perry Mason's boy claims to be an old man, and when he says, "I've narrowed the chances for one," excuse me, but if you narrow down something, you will have a few or more options not one or more options. If you get down to it, you haven't narrowed it down, but you've actually understood what it is. The monster is a standard 50 sci-fi fair, better than say grassland at the beginning of the end. Action is a sub-par and the heroine is the most unpleasant ... in fact, in some shots he looks like a sloppy man. You see a lot of fighter stock and other things, but you don't see much deadly death.
