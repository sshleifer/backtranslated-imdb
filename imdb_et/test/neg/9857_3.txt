Kasparov vs Deep Blue is undoubtedly an exciting story, but I don't think you would know when watching this movie. I think it focuses too much on the conspiracy theory that IBM cheated ... and what does this theory bind? The idea that at one point the computer made a move that "saw people". I'm not a male master or a computer scientist. And although I have no doubt that the movement seemed humane, it doesn't seem to me impossible that a computer that once created the most powerful chess could be a surprising move ... or that such a machine could win even a genius like Kasparov. The film gets too much from this theory and it is not enough for the people involved ... that could have made it more interesting. The direction depends too much on the meaninglessly whispered narrative perception and the image of the 18th century chess machine, which looks like one of the animated gypsy people you see in the carnival. The story was also slowed down by many empty Kasparov shots, which reviewed the "crime scene". I have no doubt that Kasparov and the male community found IBM's behavior, but I do not think it would be different if you find another big corporation. At the end of the movie, you will feel that Kasparov is a huge bunch and Deep Blue programmers are either victims or scams. I think if the filmmaker wanted the viewer to believe in the theory of conspiracy (which he almost certainly did), he would have had to provide much more evidence. In fact, more evidence would be a good idea first. The whole thing was in my mouth with a tasty taste.
