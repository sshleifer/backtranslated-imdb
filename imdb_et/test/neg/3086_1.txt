One of the worst films I've ever seen. Yes, I know I'm not a target group. The target audience is women who are either college or middle-aged or old who think. I'm not one of them, so the makers don't mind if I don't like it. But it does not excuse the fact that dialogue and plot are terrible. The main character, Phoebe, is going to Europe to find out what happened to his sister, Faith, who committed suicide. Phoebe is a man of the kind that I hope nobody can find. Faith is also a character with very little credibility. Wolf is the only person who seems to be somewhat reasonable. As I said, dialogue is boring and uninteresting. The plot sometimes makes absolutely stupid things. The absolute worst thing is that Phoebe's and Faith's father is an artist, but his paintings are absolutely terrible. There's nothing new, interesting or refreshing about this movie. If your boyfriend, you pray for its ending. If your chick can sit through it but you may not be imitated.
