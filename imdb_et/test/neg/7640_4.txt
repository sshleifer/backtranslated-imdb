According to the summary of this film, I believed that it would be a story of an unusual woman who contests social conventions with her. I like strong female characters and wait for the movie much along the lines of "Chocolat" with less fairy tales and bites. What I got was cast in despicable letters. <br /> <br /> To make a character film effective, I need to get in touch with people or compassion. There was no one I could interact with in the movie. Grazia (Golino, whose work I admired by Rain Man) depicts mentally ill, probably bipolar women who are often rude, aggressive and violent. Her husband bickers and screams when she does hit or slapping someone. Children are rude. They scream at each other and at the movie in the movie. They attack other children without provocation. Violence causes violence. It seems to be an island of unknown, aggressive, violent and rude people. <br /> <br /> The direction is not convincing. There are mixed scenes that try to be art, but wore the viewer. The location is extraordinarily proud, but even it is not stuck so it could be on film. <br /> <br /> I should recommend that you stay away from the movie's failure.
