I have a lot of work for Mr Argento, but this film does not have many features that make his films truly unique. Opening the movie is great and gives you the opportunity to get a really scary horror movie. As for the rest of the film, there is no structure or purpose and it doesn't build much. However, there are some good performances and a good atmosphere. The end of the movie is weak, considering everything built up. If there should be a huge climax of some great proportions, you will instead find a very typical conclusion that too many other bad fears are being used, which makes them feel they just need to pack it up. A couple of scenes are very memorable for these images, but in the end, it does not make a movie for a good movie. If you don't feel like you have to see everything that this director did, I suggest you pass it on ...
