*** SPOILER ALERT *** Forbidden and confusing firing drama associated with a bad plan to burn a large holiday center before the New Year's Eve. Julian Fane, Guy Doleman, is behind the $ 10 million Australian Blue Mountains Valley Guard, and decided to collect his project in his flames. It must take place by 1 January, two weeks before the project's insurance policy has ended. <br /> <br /> With his thinking for his workman and architect Howard Anderson, Tom Skerritt, there's no idea that his boss, Julian Fane, is planning to burn the resort he's built, and maybe he did it in the fall. Anderson becomes a bit suspicious when Sophie McCann, Wendy Hughes, insures her that there is a great fish between Fane and Proud Alliance. It turns out that Fane himself is proud of Allience or 60% of it! This explains that Whey Fans has all those firing fires to collect ten million dollars of insurance, which is at least twice the size of Valley View Estates. <br /> <br /> We have later been killed by Sophie McCann in a swimming accident to keep her from what is going on in the Valley Valley Estates and Valley View Estates. This is when George Engles, James Mason, insurance researcher at Lloyd's of London, who secures Proud Alliance, shows that Fane takes the powder, leaving his ace burner himself out of control to blow Fane's entire plan. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Anderson has understood for both Fane and Engle, who, unlike Fane, wants to see reasons that are never quite clear in Valley View Estates, but watch the last seconds of the movie to understand that this is a writer and director. The burner is exposed when he plans to make his girlfriend with the rescue of Anderson. Then we have this wild chase where the firefighter loses at the Valley View building site just to make it fire, with Howard Anderson, where he gets burned until the fire came to a sudden and unexplained end never became clear what happened to the big with cheeses in this health system, which was bad and thoughtful by Julian Fane. It would be like Fane to go Scot-free and only her unstable and kidnapped henchman, an arson who was just a tool for Fane's crimes, ended up the only one who paid them.
