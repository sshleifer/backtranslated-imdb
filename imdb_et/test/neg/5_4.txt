I wish I knew how to make such a movie. It seems to be divided into two parts - sequences of action and personal dramas to the land. This results in Ashton Kuchher's survival through a swimming school, guided by Master Chief Kevin Costner, followed by Alaska, where there are a few outstanding salvation deaths. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the scenes on the Beach were so stereotyped in so many ways that they should be a barnacle. A typical bar room fighting between navy boys and coast guard bodies ("puddle pirates"). Experienced old timer, Costner, who is "married to the Coast Guard" by offering a bar for the elderly. An older leader who "tries to prove himself to be 19 years old." Abandoned ex-wife to whom Kostner's farewell visit. The seemingly sadistic demands that instructors put on swimmers are all aimed at achieving loftier. A talented young man hobbled to worry about the past. <br /> <br /> The problem is that we have seen it before. If it's Kevin Costner, it's Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or Lou Gosset Jr or Vigo Mortenson or Robert DeNiro elsewhere. And in the weather, there are elements that are disgracefully drawn "Perfect storm" and "dead calm". None of them are fresh and none of the old stereotypical characters and the situation behave like originality. <br /> <br /> It works best as a documentary that takes place in a swimmer's school and what can happen after that, and even it is a bit weak because we don't get much in the way of teaching. This is mostly a personal conflict, romance, and effort to wash. <br /> <br /> This is a disgrace because the US Coast Guard is rather noble equipment, its official mission is "the safety of life and property at sea." In wartime, it goes over to the Naval Department and serves in winning roles. In World War II, the Coast Guard was able to fight the winner of his rank. <br /> <br /> But again, you don't learn much about it. We don't really know much. The film is divided into consecutive visual displays and not too much. Disappointment.
