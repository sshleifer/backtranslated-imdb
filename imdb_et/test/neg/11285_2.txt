Like someone who loves baseball history, especially at the beginning of the 20th century, where Cobb was the main figure, with colored signs, I had seen this baseball film. Well, it was not a baseball film that was disappointing. No, it was just a sportsbook account to be with Cobb in the later years of the ballplayer, while the two collaborated in the book. Even then, it could have been a more attractive film than they did. <br /> <br /> Simple Cobb was nothing but a nice guy, a very talented player, but brutal because he did something to win you. ... and he was viscous, scary and fought a lot of demons. He was so hated that his own teammates tried to prevent him from winning the title of the strike for one year. Nonetheless, this is a man's superfluity. It makes him almost comic-like. <br /> <br /> Watching and listening to old man's beaches for two hours is entertainment? No, it's not. One day I would like to see Cobb's true bio-region, which shows him on his ball game days and if they want to portray him as an evil guy, no matter how they did it here but a bitter, godly old man who makes himself a ass in front of a reporter is not fun to watch .
