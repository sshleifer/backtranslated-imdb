It is very simply all of the syndicates and not the original uncut / unchanged NBC episodes. It's not a complete first season, all eps are edited to match 21:00 syndication, which means that the jokes are cut, commercial fade is added, all Harvey Korman's intros are not here ... very badly done! Shame on the series I've been waiting for .... booooooooooooooooo! If you are a real death fan of Mama, don't buy it and go to http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/main/help/whv/customer_service.jsp and send them comments on why we are unhappy with this butcher's classic sitcom!
