As an early representation of the 1960s instability, Diane Arbus (Nicole Kidman) can apologize as an early flower head. The film itself does not deserve such a latitude. Lack of character development, motivation, and justification of character behavior make the film very disappointing. I sat watching and waited for some sketchy explanations of activities to find that Shainberg promised me a glimpse of what must be inside the joke. Since some of the facts presented did not match much to Diane Arbus's life, it did not help to make things clear. <br /> <br /> Diane's "normal life" wash was a great contrast to his amazing colors. "awakening" with Lionel. And the trap door staircase was a good example of Diane's attempt to inject her new life into her existing family (but I don't see how this trap in her dining ceiling could connect directly to Lionel's apartment, which was two flights Maybe my analysis is a bit too written to look some character development and public relations that goes beyond one sentence or one comment, and I would have liked to see at least one Diane photo.
