During my childhood I have seen the first three "Critters" movies and enjoyed them. They were fun and fun horror comedies suitable for adventurous children of horror. I've never seen "Critters 4", so I finally decided to review it. My decision: a forgotten and pretty bad flick with a noticeably low body number. The script by Joseph Lyle and David J. Schow is both predictable and clich√©, the plot's "Alien" and "Star Wars" and kits look strange and dark The film's tone seems to be deadly serious for the whole slow and boring. "Critters 4" was probably so low a budget that filmmakers could not afford optical effects, those who were taken from "Android" are seriously dated.4 10. Avoid.
