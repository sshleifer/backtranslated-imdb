Rose? Is there anything in this episode? It introduces our two leaders, the doctor's slowly smiling idiot, and a completely interesting companion. There is no plot to talk about, childish humor, mixed with some very poor pace and random music. What else to say, really? <br /> <br /> End of the World? Marginal improvement because we see our first space scenario. Later, it was accompanied by bad modern humor, paper-thin logic, very bad pace and tired SF clich√©s. <br /> <br /> Unquiet Dead ?? The best episode so far that shows what can happen if someone knows how to structure an episode, write an interesting character dialogue, and integrate an intriguing plot. Just let the doctor and the rose. <br /> <br /> Aliens in London / Third World War - A doctor who breaks down into a farce. What more can be said. Penelope Wilton brings little difficulty to the case, trying to deal with it in the most difficult situations. In these two episodes, some ill-written and on-site soap opera elements emerge and return to a bad temple, poor drawing, and worthy humor / satire. <br /> <br /> Songs ?? Not big, but still far beyond the RTD price. Stimulation and scripting are all right (though your doctor and Rose are still irritating). The effects and threats of Dalek are well presented. However, Finale took an interesting assumption that reduced the doctor's most notorious enemy, indirectly confusing, and turning a blind eye to the blue rubber squid that looked like a child's toy. <br /> Long Game - The first RTD script that shows any plot, even if it was in the 80's style. Nonetheless, it somewhat undermined his usual excess dependence on juvenile jokes, placing it too far in the future to be a logical idea and again a bad pace. Not as bad as his previous efforts, but he immediately forgets. <br /> <br /> Father's Day ?? The initial assumption could have been vaguely interesting, but common sense and logic will abandon this episode from the beginning. We are also being treated for the whole soap opera. Before you think about it, it's all about characterization, remember that there is a big difference between the flat Soap Opera and the characterization. On the plus side, it proves that the RTD is still not the worst script writer. <br /> <br /> An empty child / doctor dancing - it started with an average, with some worthwhile moments, and some illogical mistakes that even a primary school student does (a well-lit windows interrupted, no one?). After that, the first part takes more interesting and embarrassing action. Florence Hoath really steals these episodes, showing us what an interesting companion might have been. He can also act. Instead, we get a tedious and politically correct Captain Jack as a new companion. The conclusion was a bit hasty, but enough. Stimulation and script improved with a relatively good style, making the two episodes quite atmospheric and intriguing. <br /> <br /> Boom Town - I have to be honest, except for a few examples, I was so disappointed by the current series that when I saw another Slitheen episode of the trailer, I gave up I was not tortured. <br /> <br /> Bad wolf - reality TV, allegedly the worst side of modern media, is basically used as a prerequisite. There is no fatigue. Do we get interesting social comments such as the show of a current man or drum? No, of course not. It's in the RTD episode, so they're basically cynically trying to pull the audience of these exhibitions. What's more, the logic goes out of the window because we have placed 200,000 in the future. The RTD is trying to catch a somewhat overwhelming story here at the shoe-horn, without any other importance than its own existence, and when the end of the villain is revealed ... They make empty threats and the doctor laughs again like an idiot for the climax! The faster the pace is, to a large extent, other RTD efforts, this is one or two interesting moments. Otherwise, there will be a consistent down payment. <br /> <br /> Division of Opportunities - Great Finale. More wet squid, literally. All of Dalek's threats, created in "Dalek", coincide because they become quite pathetic. So many plot holes understand this episode, which is usually bad. The Daleks want to gather people into songs, but then evaporate the whole continent? Can Dalek evaporate these continents but not destroy Tardos in space? Tardis is now indestructible and can land anywhere, even over people, so that they can be saved? Can't use this ability to easily destroy the Dalek god? The Daleks can evaporate whole continents, but not only bring the satellite to the doctor for destruction, but let him play it? The doctor is a pathetic coward without his actions convincing, destroying his entire species to try and destroy the Daleks? These and many other holes are left behind, that we are ever treated with an ex machina solution of laminates that has been developed before, which is connected to the arc of an almost nonsense story. <br /> <br /> So what can we say about the new series, all-in- Would it have achieved a second series if it were anything other than a doctor behind RTD? Would most episodes have been something other than un-original and forgotten if they were anything other than Doctor Who and had the added RTD name? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> Some people think we can't say anything about RTD because we owe it to bringing Doctor Who back to our screen. But it is at the expense of good signs and stories. Personally, I would not have a badly planned, ill-conceived product that was cut off for that price. I'd rather wait until someone could come and make a real effort. For the most part, this is a delicate garbage that gives SF a bad name, which is otherwise the most creative genre.
