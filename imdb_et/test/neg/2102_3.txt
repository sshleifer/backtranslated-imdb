Snakes a a Train begins with Mexican couple Brujo (A.J. Castro) & Alma (Julia Ruiz) crossing the border to the US, then enter illegally with a seven-hour train to Los Angeles. But Alma's family disagreed with her & Brujo's relationship and put her in an old black magic curse that makes all her inner snakes, no life b * tch? When snakes cast Alma out of their mouth and slip into other parts of the train, they start infecting other passengers with the same unusual disease ... <br /> <br /> Mallachi Brothers edited and staged (though IMDb claims it is just one pseudonym) man, Peter Mervis) must say that I thought the snakes on the train were messy, it's so easy. It seems that the whole film was created and produced in Samuel L. Jackson's culture, where all the fans of fear who specialize in ripping large Hollywood gifts and shelters with large budgets are all horror fans (2006). this style of money and filmmaking is no more obvious than the snakes on the train, making the film just because the title rhymes with a more successful film are not a good starting point. The Eric Forsberg script is rubbish, because at first the gold on the plane is very fun, while the snakes on the train are much more serious and if you really broke it down and look at it, it should have been a lot easier. In fact, it would probably have worked better as a Scary Movie (2000) type spoiled. You know, I am in trouble to find one positive thing about the snakes that is so bad. At first the character is garbage and it is impossible to issue it, the story is absolutely terrible and it makes no sense (when people hit all the little snakes from which they came from? Why did Alma become a giant snake Why had Bujo killed the train driver? How did he finish the train after he Came to Los Angeles? Where did this typhoon end?), It takes itself too seriously, the first seventy few minutes are so boring and uneven I'm surprised that I stayed awake and it's just a very bad movie on almost every level. <br /> <br /> Director Mervis has just a few train carts that all look quite similar to the movie becomes very repetitive and boring. A little blood or gore, some peoples' skin is borrowed by some snakes. Special effects are also garbage, and the giant CGI snake at the end is really terrible and is the least talked about. It's not scary, there's a zero atmosphere and it's a bit drilled from start to finish. True living snakes are also a problem, they are just so obedient and unsafe. When you look at a scene that has a real snake and actor, the snakes never move towards them and do not act aggressively, and in fact you seem to want to slip in the opposite direction. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is probably a low budget and it shows basically it seems cheap because it is. It is not great that the actor is given some material to work with. <br /> <br /> The snakes on the train are garbage, I'm sorry, but I feel so and I don't know how to describe it. I really can't see what anyone looking at on the train from Snakes is really so bad.
