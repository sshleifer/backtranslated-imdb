I give this film a rating of "2" by Vampire Assassins mainly because it had no sex or nudity. Moreover, I'm not sure why it was ever made. It was a workout, how to make a movie with a very limited budget. The best actors were Derek and Slovak characters. They were followed closely by "biker-dude" with Pleather trousers and silver. He was also OK. Most of the film was filmed in a distribution store. If you're tired of watching the kung-fu kick boxing game, you can get acquainted with Scott's tissue, Windex and other cleaning products. You have a lot of time to do this, trust me. I started almost on the list. Dialogue and kung-fu stunts were very slow. They spoke slowly, fought slowly, etc. I do not know why. At least with the over-handing of participants' lines, you could hear everything very clearly. I'm trying to talk about this movie. We looked at it to the end to see if it was better, but it wasn't. We could never decide whether the actors really struggled with martial arts or acted just like they were fighting. You can look and decide. My favorite line was something (vampire talking) "what are you looking at?" another man replies, "your bad dental work."
