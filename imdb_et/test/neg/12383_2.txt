It's almost Ed Wood's territory. Yes, this flying monster ridiculous wreck looks like a cross between a turkey and a bad day in a dentist's office. And this sound effect puts the nails on the board like Mozart. And why a giant claw when the friction critic gobbles his victims with a mechanical jaw. We get big close-ups of an ugly canary, but nothing else. I think the manufacturers thought that a more suitable title for Big Mouth could suggest Jerry Lewis comedy. And speaking of comedies, all that is "anti-matter" is a gobbledy-gook, more fun than anything in a Lewis movie. I think the scripts had adhered to the reason why a normal duck hunter could not take care of the 1950s flights. Yes, this flight from KFC is expected to have flown from another galaxy behind an anti-shield, as explained by a single resident film genius. In such a case, the Jeff Morrow pilot I collect during my working hours will advise Einstein on the secrets of the universe. Unfortunately, this is also Morrow, who keeps a ridiculous procedure on the bad film Hall of Shame, because he actually transmits his lines with a straight face. What's more, he sounds like he believes them. This is the first triumph of the film's victory. To hijack the Oscars, Morrow deserves a fighting ball that fills the call upwards and farther in the most extreme of bad film conditions. Look at the leading woman Corday, so you can judge your strength under fire. She looks like she woke up in a bad dream and maybe when she stood in stock, no one sees her. I barely. Well, the first time I saw this management disaster was a spark that is now in the back of housing development. I would have had to learn my lesson and break it out a second time out of 12 packs.
