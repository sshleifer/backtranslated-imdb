I checked carefully if there is another such a named movie, and it is not! But I really don't think we all saw the same movie! There is no way! How can you vote more than 1 on this movie! The idea of ​​this movie is that it is acceptable. Oh, and Dan Gordon's (Chris) behavior is pretty good. But these are the only two things that are acceptable to this project. Others are ... awfully? It's a very delicate word to describe the behavior, leadership, (so-called) "special" effects of other actors, even as a team in a movie! I don't even like how camera operators moved to record a scene! It can be the most unhappy movie I've ever seen. I don't really remember that smaller movie ... Maybe it is, but ... I don't think so ... Ehh, what's done, it's done ... It's a movie and it's too late for someone to change anything. I voted for "1" but my realistic vote starts with "-" (minus).
