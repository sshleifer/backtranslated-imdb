I have to admit it, I love horror films ... especially about the 80s movies. Hell, I even love cheese like Sleepaway Camp and Demon Night. But I didn't think much about this movie. Death scenes were not very well done, CGI was terrible and the actor was ho-hum. The worst was the story that didn't make sense at all. I would say to save your money, but chances are if you want to see this movie ... you're going anyway. I didn't hate it ... it's not very good. All in all, it is just one strange, inanimate horror film that has no life (it is not surprising that it was on Dimension's shelf over a year after its completion).
