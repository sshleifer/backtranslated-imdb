I bought the thing that was used for the clearance of the video game store. I wanted to feel guilty of looking at something I've warned to watch; I wanted the value of the shock. I wanted to be guilty and watching a "forbidden movie". I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Cannibal Ferox does not work because it is both comb and fake. Most of the time the camera does not show the "shocking" punching, chopping, slicing - you just see the result. (They show in detail the chest engagement). Special effects are just OK. There is nothing here that tells you that no violence is real. "Kannibals" are obviously poor people from Central and South America who were dressed as jungle savages and said they were acting. These people were probably all over the picture to get little money or food or both. Again ... just not convincing. <br /> <br /> But as everyone else has said, there are real animal killings here. This is the scope of realism. For me, it was much more shocking than any gutting, splitting or castration of the scalp, and even then the death of the animals is not at all - maybe just sad.
