Strange things happen to Americans Will (Greg Evigan), Maga (Alexandra Paul) and their young daughter Aubrey (Briana Evigan, Greg's real life daughter) when they move to a big, newly inherited Ireland. In the basement, there are harsh corpses, turkey throws blood, furniture moves and the ghosts of a dead child and the dirty old lady show a little girl scare. Paranormal researchers are finally called to expel evil spirits, but Maura is in any case in possession and pursues all the meat with the cutter. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of clich√©s, but Alexandra Paul's performance is extraordinary. .. too bad it doesn't belong to this movie (nor anything else that I don't think of)! He can barely keep a straight face and his surviving and hysterical screaming dances are a pleasure to see. In any case, it is much more interesting to watch than anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
