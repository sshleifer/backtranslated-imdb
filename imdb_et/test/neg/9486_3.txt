This movie was fine. Mary-Kate and Ashley play a twin sister (sorry for this obvious signing) who is sent to Paris for their will to spend a week with her rich uncle or something like that. <br /> <br /> Immediately the two French boys (who saw some kind of disease) started talking to them and getting interested. Blah blah blah. This is Olsen's twin film - we already know what's going on between them. In any case, the twins meet the FABULOUS French model because they are based in Paris, the fashion capital of the world. They make models and spend fun assembly lights in the city. Yep. <br /> <br /> I can't remember what happened. I think it can say something, but hey, this is Olsen's movie. "Olsen's film" seems to be synonymous with "light entertainment". <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was annoying. I mean, can I really identify with two girls who have been destroyed after they go to Paris? Really? The jokes were also not funny. But I watched the whole movie. So it had to be a little fun. The fact that it was set in Paris was the one that probably watched me.
