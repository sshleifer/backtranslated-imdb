jeez, it was very boring. The leading man (Christian Schoyen) must be the worst actor I've ever seen. and the other thing when the film's character moved to America when he was ten or something and lived here for over 20 years, he spoke of much better English than what he pulls out here. or say it in your language "Skikkelig gebrokkent". But it's cool to see a movie made in Norwegian dudes in Hollywood. it was just a shame when they were cages without talents. The story itself is lower than average. I have a suspicion that Christian Schoyen made this film just to live a dream because he clearly makes one beautiful baby in the film after another.
