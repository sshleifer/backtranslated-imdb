A terrifying and totally ridiculous ghost house with a terrifying ghost, with Anna Paquin's place where she plays a neurotic teenager fighting the dark things that bother her and her family soon after moving to their new home in Spain (?!). Slightly more than the geographically replicated "The Shining" and especially the "The Others" hanging, the weak line "Darkness" is basically your typical grinder B-horror feature with little predictable flat scares, what viewers see a mile away (so to speak)! In retrospect, I think I should not have set my personal expectations so high that this movie would actually be good, given that it had been put on the shelf for three years before the last Christmas of Christmas appeared in a country of the world that Ultimately, it was lukewarm ticket sales and critics were very tough. When can filmmakers ever know that there is more (whether horror or otherwise) in making movies than just having a small financial gain? (Turkish-zero letters)
