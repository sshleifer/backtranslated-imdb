I heard what people say but I ignored them. In a hurry with Blockbuster, I grabbed a copy of this movie and ran out. <br /> <br /> After 45 minutes I fought awake. There is some attempt to keep the movie interesting, but it was just bad. Sometimes the chase happens, but it was long and drawn - an ideal time to prepare a snack. By the time this movie was over, I didn't care how it ended, I just wanted to end it. Checking and leaving my room to see if it is over. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a clich√©, characters and their relationships. Land revolutions are predictable as well as end. The participants really did the best of a terrible role. Everything can be said: their clothes were nice, but the movie, it was just bad.
