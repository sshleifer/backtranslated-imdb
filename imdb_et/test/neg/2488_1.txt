I was waiting for a documentary that covered the Sci-Fi era from 1950 to 1965 and got the work of baby boomers, James Cameron and left-wing political enthusiasts and big commercial rings. Watch the Skies has previously referred to "Giant Bug" and "Space Exploration" films from the 1950s, including favorites such as "Earth vs Flying Saucers", "Thing from other World" and "Forbidden Planet". such as "Them", "Deadly Mantis" and "Tarantula". There are lower budget examples that are rarely mentioned as "Space Monster", "12 Moon", and "Cosmic Man". <br /> <br /> It would have been a much better documentary when some of the other actors, directors, stuntmen and collectors, as well as non-Hollywood boomers, were questioned about the time they were interviewed. I just want to have a 0 rating because "1" is a lot generous.
