I like routine as far as TV movies are going. I believe it is based on a real story, because the plot seems too clumsy to have been written by someone with a narrative skill. <br /> <br /> For example, the good old John Ritter (now a rather bulky and fragile villain) is poisoning his wife enough to make him sick, then accusing him of psychosomatic and immediately leaving for another young woman to marry. Fourteen years pass before the story gets back. Why 14 years? I think that although narrative does not require it, there is no history. <br /> <br /> Some specific scenes, however, are so kinematic that the writer almost certainly dreamed of them. Pawing through his attic, Helgenberger, Ritter's first wife, stumbles across an old electrical appliance and has one of the black-and-white setbacks with shock - maybe he recalls when 14 years ago he discovered Ritter's shaving slice slices rectifier, collecting them carefully and placing them in your shampoo and between your lashes (or whatever it is called). Later he develops his coffee. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I don't believe it. I also don't think he was in this attic in a special suburb, or that Ritter put selenium chips in his shampoo or eyeliner. Selenium is called "toxic metal" in the film, and I think it is in sufficient quantity, but it is also an antioxidant that is sold in drug stores and swallowed. Someone has to show - as no one does this - that it is a poison. Many people have tried the nicotine patch and failed. So how does selenium in shampoo give Marg Helgenberger an immediate and drastic headache? And his eyes become as painful as boiling when his makeup is? I think the anthropologist E.B. Tylor called this simple thinking a "sympathetic magic", but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Mais je divage. Anyway, Ritter tries to try his second wife forty years after the same stunt, although there has never been any evidence of the same symptoms. The spouse's number two is taken to Mexico and is likely to improve, but suddenly it will drop soon after returning. There is important evidence against Ritter, who plays the cable with all the stops - when his first trial is missed by Helgenberg, who has started the investigation. <br /> <br /> You see, Helgenberger was a good friend of Ritter's other husband and was terribly disturbed by his death and way. (I bet.) And he wants to prevent the same thing happening to a rich young woman who looks like Ritter's marital status by third place. (Of course.) The best result is a man playing Detective Mauser - Lawrence Dane? All others act by numbers. They design emotions and thoughts on the level crossing with a warning nuance. But Dane does a little things that are original. "I've said you want to report a murder. (A long pause when he's sitting and waiting), then suddenly pulls his face to Helgeberger and asks with a reasonable and curious voice," So who was murdered? " "The bare bones of historical events, did not prevent anything from being pulled by the characters or their actions other than actually in life, I mean what the hell, Ritter is still being convicted in prison and the character of Helgenberger is dead, so who I would like forensic things to be clearer: Ritter seems to have used so many poisonous and poisonous metals - let me see selenium, cyanide, the enormous amount of chlorine and maybe something else - to confuse me Not that I was Ritter rooting, here's a mathematician with a doctorate who demands people to call him "a doctor." He even corrects people who only deal with him as a "professor." "Jes" calls me Whitey, although I know how to get a standard deviation and you don't. "Average TV price.
