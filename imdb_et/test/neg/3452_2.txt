This is a bad film. Surely this is how not to film a movie. Story, Direction, Drama and Style are all flat pancakes. The story consists of five? yes five? Soccer competitions are divided into the duration of the film, each filming more than the last one because the dysfunctional football team moves strongly. That's it, it's a plot. It's hard to know who this movie is targeting. It is too banal for football fans and nothing for teenagers and adults. There is nothing for women, there is not even a female character. It's harsh, wears you after the game after playing the game. The story, as it is, of dialogue and motives seems to have been eliminated from Ireland, with all participants stabbing the cod stock in Dublin. It doesn't have to be believed. Avoid at all costs. Does anyone give me back their 90 minutes. High point at the end of credit, low point too much to mention. Brendan Gleeson is in this movie.
