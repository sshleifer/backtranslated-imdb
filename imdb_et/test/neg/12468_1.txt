Eghads, which is a bad film. Tart is perhaps the worst film I've seen in a year, and I've been running with some doozies. There is nothing to redeem from this trash, from characterization to graph. Even the traditionally brilliant Dominique Swain couldn't record this movie. None of these characters are a little sympathetic, except for Eloise (a marvelous imagination by Lacey Chabert, the only bright point in this trouble). <br /> <br /> ******* Possible Spoilers ******** <br /> <br /> The main problem with Tartu is that it doesn't speak anything. It strikes a drink instead of guiding us through the story. It also introduces a number of potentially tortuous details (a brother of hypochondria, a constant return of mother's possessions, an anti-Semitic classmate, another classmate's murderer father) without any of them being successfully investigated. And when I finally thought that there might be some sort of resolution for the characters, the film suddenly disappears into a violent ending. <br /> <br /> I left the movie feeling that he was trying to tell me something but a strong impression that the message was forgotten before it was broadcast. This is an obvious first film about a writer / director who actually has to spend much more time working with established filmmakers before he introduces his work to a more unsuspecting public. <br /> <br /> I gave it to movie 1 10 and I'm usually very generous even for bad movies.
