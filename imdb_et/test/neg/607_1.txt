I can't make this sitcom alone. It's like they didn't even bother to try to write good comedy, but to rehearse the third course of fun and hope it sticks. The worst thing is that it is all so unpleasant and inadequate. <br /> <br /> To make things worse, a leading person, Kevin James, has a permanent "I'm so funny" smile on his face to be tolerated if only he ever went to a comedy department that he doesn't, he just is there if not doing something like a big dishonest child. This leads me to Heffernan's relationship, which is easily the most married and poor couple's representation in every TV show, really unpleasantly unpleasant, Remini spends the show as if it was a violent chore even around her own husband. Jerry Stiller, who rejects a little laugh at the show, only plays 100% of his role at Frank Costanzana Seinfeld only when his tips mostly go in the water, because the midfielder is unable to recognize jokes even when he flew them. The episodes move along with nothing, their work does not add anything and their interaction is even worse. <br /> <br /> It's not even a waste of talent, no talent, it's a ridiculous creation in the desert.
