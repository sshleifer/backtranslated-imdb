Everyone can make a movie these days. The budget, the value of the production, or an experienced team does not have to stop the "director" from "realizing dreams" these days. <br /> <br /> Respect for film making or even respect for the aesthetics of every film is no longer a prerequisite for the actual performance of the film. <br /> <br /> Director Bill Cowell has to think he's hit gold when Lion's gate decided to market his original movie as a film he didn't personally find that Lion's gateway is much farther, much more than Cowell in connection with Dark Harvest 2, which is made available to the public. The Lion Gate's fraudulent film should be investigated by the Chief Public Prosecutor, and Lion Gate officers should be sown in sulfuric acid and kerosene to completely ignore them in terms of films, film making, and reason. <br /> <br /> As far as film is concerned, it's not worth it.
