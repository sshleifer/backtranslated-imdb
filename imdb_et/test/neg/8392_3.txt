Paranoid Park is a 16-year-old Alex, who causes death even when he is accidentally a security guard. As the film goes to Alex, he deals with small issues like his parents' divorce and his girlfriend Jennifer's sexual warmth (played by Taylor Momsen, who you can now see at Gossip Girl) when he's guilty. I had only seen one Gus Van Santi movie so far, Elephant, and I can assure you that he kept all his motives doing it once. pictures of people who go ... maybe you like these filming methods, I know I'm not doing it. The piece of land feels unsatisfactory to me ... it's almost easy to study for so long. The feeling I get (with the same Elephant) is that Gus Van Sant is trying too hard to make an "artistic" film that causes the film to open. Gabe Nevins was also pretty bad when Alex, there is a difference between alienated or divorced and robot vision. If you're a fan of Mr.Van Sant, look at it, otherwise skip it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
