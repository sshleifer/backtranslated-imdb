Tomas Milian and Manny Perez Treats? "Washington Heights" is a low budget drama located in NYC's Latino neighborhood. <br /> <br /> A young comic book artist (Manny Perez) wants to escape his Latino neighborhood. When his father kidnaps the predators, the young man is forced to lead the family with the bod. <br /> <br /> The movie was shot in the budget (low-resolution video and bad sound) with low-profile participants. <br /> <br /> The plot flowed well for 85 minutes, but the last 5 minutes were just terrible. We don't know for sure whether Perez and his girlfriend were together and when Angel finished shooting in prison. <br /> <br /> 4/10
