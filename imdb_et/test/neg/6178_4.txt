I saw the movie after checking the IMDb rating. Then it was at 8.0 and I thought it should be good. I thought wrong. In the beginning of the movie, what the plot promises is, but it goes down under the basement. I think that without the essence of Richie Nix, it could have been right - though it is the reason why the story line takes it around. The character is very extreme and difficult for me to tolerate. Also, the journey from the beginning of the main character to the end of this "peak" is partly irrelevant and easily omitted - the alternative is that I just didn't understand the movie. <br /> <br Although I have to admit that it is "easy to look at" and I had no problems with the whole movie, it was a bit impressive at the end. All in all, rather mediocre.
