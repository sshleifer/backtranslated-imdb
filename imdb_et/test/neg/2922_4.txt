This film will generally give me a much larger voice and I will tell you why, but first it gets four stars and should stay at four stars because the directors are ridiculously tasteless due to rape and sexual depiction. Not far from Oyama's sexually attacking woman, whom she previously rescued, and although she shrinks briefly with her actions, this attitude lasts only about five minutes before loving worship is placed and carries her character through the rest of the film. I know many say it's not so important during kung fu racing, and as a family fan I can't say it's all unusual, but it doesn't stop it from being completely tasteless every time I see it. <br /> <br /> The defense of this movie, however, says it is somewhat refreshing to see martial arts or even any feature film that doesn't offer the viewer a real hero. Oyama is depicted as rapist and murderer; a societal challenge that the only student becomes completely spiritually unbalanced before the mental police is in decline. The film's last shots leave one feeling that Oyama himself is ready for a big break, and no longer looks like a caring woman he had previously attacked and loved since then with a dog. > <br /> Was it really a movie message or not, but you feel a little hope that Oyama might be on the verge of suicide by the end of the movie. It is a genre of rare emotional therapy martial arts and interesting to see a movie that leaves you feeling that its violence is not celebrated. If only Karate Bullfighter had dealt better with the topic of sexual violence, creating more emotional depth and recognition between the two involved, or leaving it all together, it would have been a much more interesting film.
