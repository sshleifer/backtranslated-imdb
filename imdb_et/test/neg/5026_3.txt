Let me say right from the start. I don't hate this example. I really like some aspects of it. In fact, when I started to see it for the first time, I started quickly. I started the whole "anime for kids" stereotype and the ripe elements of the show were of interest to me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after seeing the whole series and some movies, I can say that my general behavior has changed and it falls on almost all the sections that break the "bad" anime. Seven or eight friends and I started watching this series on television. Finally, we only looked at one friend and I looked and nobody liked us. <br /> <br /> Let me explain the plot to you. If you don't want to, you can skip this paragraph. Kagome is an average high school student who one day falls into a magical neighborhood at his family shrine. When the southeast goes out again, he has been transported back to the Japanese feudal era. He meets many other characters and forms a group of five or more companions who went on a revenge / justice / groping journey for one character =). In general, they try to restore a piece of sacred jewelery that increases the power of the demons that use it. 167 episodes. The only story that is interesting enough to look is still boring (seven bands). After the semi-mark in the series, or perhaps even before, it becomes painfully clear that the freezing of the plot is taking place, and anyone who did this set decided to place dozens and dozens of stuffing materials instead. <br /> <br /> These episodes have little or no story, and rarely even characters. In some cases, some characters will lose important roles at the same time for tens of episodes. Many episodes follow exactly the same cookies as before. Inuyasha gives the enemy a wind scar. Windshield throws. The characters are horrifying. The enemy has an obstacle. The characters spent three episodes trying to kill the enemy before Kagome finally came with a holy arrow and he became dusty. <br /> <br /> The ** main spoiler: no conclusion, no conclusion, so you seem to endure it for 83 hours. <br /> <br /> ** GENERAL SPOILER OVER ** <br /> <br /> Animation itself is above average and in some cases excellent. Nonetheless, the recycled animation cells interrupt most of the action studios and are very difficult to ignore if it is clear that exactly the same mound has flown with five or six consecutive characters. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the brighter side is well-developed with all the characters and the romance of some characters is truly enchanting. Also, the character's designs (performances) were excellent and at times the best of vision, especially with seven bands. There is definitely no shortage of Cosplay opportunities here. Nonetheless, I found myself in the hope that the character dies just so that there would be some kind of movement there. And some of the humor between the characters is used over and over again. The first five episodes have one special joke (sit by the boy), and you can literally assume that it will be used again and again for the remaining 162 episodes. <br /> <br /> Although the show has some good aspects and it's easy to understand why it's a huge next, the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fan girls casting Sesshomiru and InuYasha. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: definitely worth a look, but it's not worth watching the entire series. The first 30 episodes are very smart, original and enjoyable for everyone. But after that it just gets boring and annoying. When watching TV, you should never feel like cleaning up, but this series somehow does. Don't wait much for "InuYashas" because you only feel off.
