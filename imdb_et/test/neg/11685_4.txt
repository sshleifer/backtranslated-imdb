First, there are some plot holes in this movie. We see from the beginning that the game dies. But who was involved with the mail lift that delivered the game? How did the driver guide the parcel to the mailbox when he was attached to the wheel? It's not like he was Mr. Fantastic. Wow, just in the first 15 minutes ... Actors are on the second level, Patrick Kilpatrick (who?) Play "Bad Guy", which he has shown on all television and some secondary roles in bad movies (like this one). So most of the actors are like TV shows, I can live with it, but graphics or special effects are terrible. The banned "game" voice sounds like a bad clone of "Space Oddessy 2000". What they called zombies seemed to be shadows that popped like monkeys from the "monkey planet". Aliens had transparent bodies like a shadow of zombies. In most cases, this film was simply predictable because it had no hook or hidden agenda. The story was a good idea, but like most good ideas that were discussed at lunch, this good idea was never developed.
