Today's film course was a legend of the Suram Castle, and during this 87-minute ride he managed to jump fast with my five hardest films. It's hard to see; such different movies that see something else you see. A brief summary: a group of Georgians are trying to build a fortress to protect themselves from intruders, but every time they finish, they will not disappear immediately for obvious reasons. So they go and see the fortune teller who advises them that if they want to stay safe, they have to find a young boy with a high blonde blue eye who is buried between the walls during the construction and in his presence ensures that the construction work is completed smoothly. And certainly at these closing moments, it is enough that he rebels in cement and eggs, worshiping when he is buried alive, only his mother to frighten him. <br /> <br /> It's actually a pretty simple story. But in 1984, Sergo Paradjanov, a director of Soviet Georgia, not following the fifteen-year prison sentence, does not follow any film-making rule. There are very few nears. Very often, the action we need to follow is in the lower left corner of the landscape, which is usually easy to stay. There are very few close-ups and sometimes it is difficult to tell who to do, to whom and why. Every time and then the film goes out to the mines, which are not important for the main plot and usually confuse the viewer. The music is completely crazy, the sounds found, the instruments on the screen and the church organ seemingly coincidentally fell. Sometimes, if nothing seems to be, someone goes to the jig, almost playing time until the next scene. But everything is obviously a cinematic voice that is forced to try and understand what it is. One of those times when your eyes are glued to the screen just because you can't believe what you see.
