You just stopped watching it after getting ready for a Michigan bar exam. I wanted something that was meaningless and I could just sit down and say, "What the hell did they think?" I was not disappointed with this duty, but if I had looked at it in a serious mood, I would be angry. The company that did this created the CGI shots of the first octopus and added a small video footage of the fake octopus, which changes the special effect of the "Monster Bride" look on the footage. When do octopus have fangs? The plot is that the NYPD diver explores some murders / disappearances on the Hudson River just before the fourth of July. He and his partner (who will soon go over or soon start to figure out an octopus) will look quite unevenly (all at the same time believe that a huge octopus kills people) and occasionally accompanies the female mayor's office. Of course, one believes that the octopus will be great until it attacks the policeman and the girl in the mayor's office. Surprisingly, the whole hell does not hell and only a few police officers and some civilians are killed. <br /> <br /> Really flat. Don't worry about that.
