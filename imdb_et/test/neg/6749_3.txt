This movie was shot and made in 1987, but it didn't hit the theater until 1990. When I watched this movie, I saw the good intentions he had, but I'm afraid there wasn't much talent or experience behind the camera to make it work. A story in California in the 1890s, and some Italian vineyards have said they have to leave their country to get through the railroad. Dennis Hopper plays William Berrigan, who has offered money for the land but has been rejected. Giancarlo Giannini is Sebastian Collogero and he must leave pride and ask other farmers to keep their land and fight. Berrigan grows impatient and hires bunches to force everyone to release. These criminals are led by a man named Andrews (Burt Young) and he does not hesitate to kill anyone who causes him problems. Andrews and his men kill one night at Collogero and his son Marco (Eric Roberts) promises to seek revenge and get everything back. Marco blows up the bridge that the railway needs, and it also destroys the tunnel, and it puts the project back for several months and Berrigan is now getting heat from other investors. This film was directed by Peter Masterson and, in addition to "The Trip to Bountiful", is at best a casual career in management. She is a beautiful actor, but here she seems to be over head. It was a film that desperately needed more attention to detail and it was easy to see that it didn't happen. Robert's hairstyle is perfect for the 1980s, but it is expected in 1890! The filmmaker is Toyomichi Kurita, who was a good operator, but it was only his fourth film, and he hadn't learned everything at that time. It is not a sharp film to be seen at all, and I noticed several pictures in the daytime that the sun reflects something and the scenes do not have a crisp that would have helped the overall look. The script is just a revenge story, and there are no surprises in the film. We know Giannini gets this and it just seemed like a matter of time. Cast is top-notch and they do their best, but the whole film is gathered like uninspired. It was promoted as a debut by Julia Robert's film, but I'm not sure it's right. Before that, he had appeared on "Firehouse".
