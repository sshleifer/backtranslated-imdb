The cinema enjoyed a lot of movies, but it only made me feel misanthropic. If the cunning "intellectuals" who leave their irritating sex toys sound good, look at it. I felt bored but happy to know such people. The prerequisite for the film was that, like all societies or large civilizations, they were ultimately doomed. According to the character of a female historian who pulls us in, there are signs in America that it is diminishing (indeed she goes deeper than me). The next part of the film is related to the insecure, funny and asinine behavior of his friends and colleagues, and to the various ailments caused by their libido behavior, a vague sense of humor. A lot of people liked this movie where I watched it. I couldn't relate to it.
