Many participants have a great deal of good film roles for their souls. Some, a handful. Others, maybe a couple. <br /> <br /> Then Linda Blair. "The Spirit Giver". That's right. <br /> <br /> When you see "Chiled Heat" and look at Linda Blair in it, you have to think about what, if anything, ran through her mind. <br /> <br /> Definitely not, "Oh boy: Oscar's best actor, here I come!" <br /> <br /> Just one more woman in prison, as they did in the 70s, actually has the names you know. John Vernon plays the Dean ... I mean, the guard (with a jacuzzi in his office; wonder what he told the contractor?), Stella Stevens appears, even Henry Silva and Louisa Moritz show how bad the job is. <br /> <br /> And of course, of course, our heroine Sybil Danning as a bisexual prisoner moving to poor Blair. Paraphrasing is Sybil like Sybil and everything Sybil does is perfect. You forget what you are watching a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Almost. <br /> <br /> Two stars. One for Sybil and the other who tried to let Linda Blair as a sex symbol. What could have got them?
