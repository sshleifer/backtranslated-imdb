The film produced by Nott Entertainment is very good. I sat in the movie for the first 15 minutes before I decided it was bad, the casting was bad, and the camera's work was bad. I hear downloading this movie from the Internet, but it is even worth the bandwidth. <br /> <br /> Until this review was written, the average vote for this movie was 8.5, which prompted me to watch it and there was an average of a large majority of the 10, apparently voters and shots. This movie is unnoticeable for everyone. Or parents, if you want to punish your children with this terrible movie, let them sit down for this Halloween.
