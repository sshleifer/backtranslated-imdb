(Light spoilers only here) <br /> <br /> Stealing Sinatra is a semi-stealth comedy about spammers, bad victims, and some other side story that has been eaten for some time. <br /> In this movie you will see some bad results. Drama is forced and humor makes no sense. Do you look at the victims of threatening a victim who does not shut down, or the victim's father, who reacts to the peril of the offender when "taking care of some road?" It fits quite a "wannabe movie" category. <br /> <br /> You will also hear repeatedly repeating music from the entire movie. It is quite unprofessional and does not add anything. It's really just a sad attempt to make a painlessly failed movie somewhat funny. <br /> <br /> But if you can look at it all and stop many incredible things, you may be entertained. enough story. <br /> <br /> I voted for 4/10.
