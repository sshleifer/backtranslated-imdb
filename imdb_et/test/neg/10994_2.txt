In the 90s it seems normal to play with clichés. Some can do it with great talents. Hervé Hadmar is not. The film seemed interesting to the film: a weak plot could have saved comedy, dark humor and a very décalé style. Unfortunately, Head Hadmar kills his angle with his camera angle and his lack of absolute rhythm. Every joke is embarrassing because no one responds to the theater. The film is incredibly slow and the actors see what the hell they are doing in this ridiculous mascara. What could have been a stylish funny pointless comedy, is the boredom cathedral.
