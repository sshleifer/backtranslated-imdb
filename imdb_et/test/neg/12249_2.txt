There are times when less than half of the movie is going to think about what the creators thought, what made them decide not to record the roll of each material and instead release a movie that has no real merit. And I mean every kind. This movie does not even reflect cable porn. In fact, the tears of heaven are completely and boring, and sometimes a bit disturbing your naivety. A girl who, as you may recall, is eighteen, masturbates thinking of an older Nazi who hit her by car - "stabbing her in the hall as a way to introduce herself" of syndromes and Robert Zemekis films. Then, at your second or third meeting - get it - he's shy, the one who is resistant to the girl's sexual advancement, and yet, all she has to say is, "I'm old enough. M want," and she leads he's asleep. Then, after sleeping with the girl she barely knows, she feels like she could have died with her in bed and she would have lived a full life. It's like "Lolita" without social and personal comments. <br /> <br /> Film is the most boring part of film. There are no interesting angles or originality at all, not even for sex scenes, which should be the main drawing of this type of film. The masturbation scene is just a camera that surrounds the girl's bed (very fake as if on the stage), and it is baptized with her fantasy that the man takes a waterfall in the shower. The scene "I'm ready" is just on the right side of the girl (head with her breasts) with her boyfriend on top of her, and it is the same shot all the time, although there are recurring cuts in the rather unrelated scene of the Nazi older sister with some bleeding (she is ridiculous and stupid, so it's not important). I think the whole thing lasts five to ten minutes, and it's not enlightening or irritating.
