USE A SPOILER For about the last four years I have been Ali G. Sacha's big fan Baron Cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent man and I think his best creation is Borat, who is as funny as hell and quite shameless about what he does and tells people. <br /> <br /> Anyway, film. I didn't bother to pay the money to see it in the cinema; I think because I didn't expect much, but when I recently hired a DVD, I found the whole thing pretty sad. The best part of Ali mickey, who took out of the others, was largely lost and the script plot was quite terrible. Hitching all the car batteries together to blow safely - really! ?? <br /> <br /> This movie is showing. I think some things can work too long and certainly can't translate them on the big screen. The film also had this sweet, sweet ending that I expected from British films. Where have all the good ideas of British films gone? Nonetheless, such funny funny moments as the dog in Ali's bed and Ali's audience with HM Q, with the "Shaven haven - RESPECT" note. <br /> <br /> All in all, I am a fan of Ali G and Borat and I have had many interviews with him (especially with Anita Roddick from the Body Shop), but this movie really fell to me. If you want to be another movie, I hope it's much better than this old old game. <br /> <br /> Canterra, Australia
