Again, I fell for it, in my roots I want a fun and horrible horror film, even a vampire. Even if it is stupid, as long as I get my fun in the mix, I'm a happy tent, it doesn't take much. So I saw the "Bled" cover on Hollywood Video and I was kind of curious about what it was, it seemed interesting, so I decided to rent it. Why? Why do I always fall for it? This film not only met the satisfaction I needed for my mindset and meaningless violence and nudity, but forever. This movie is a crappy to say it's a vampire movie and it's not really! I'm so close to getting back to the store and getting money back because it's one of the rare times I actually turned off the movie. <br /> <br /> The artist meets the vampire, I think I'm still trying to figure out what the hell he was, but his name was Reinfield, so I assume he can be a cockroach who eats people who want to think people ? I think I know. Anyway, he thinks the artist has a burning of some darkness, so he gives him the medicine to go to another fantasy where the vampire is there and needs blood to live? I think I know. So her friends are excited and decide to try the drug, I think I can't. So after they decide to try the drug, things are weird, I think the fantasies are real, and the vampire is now a joyfully cheerful girl with joyfully dressed joy. I think I know. But a couple of girls really vampire? I don't think I like it. <br /> <br /> Sorry for all the "I", this is probably one of the worst comments I write, but it's because this movie was just terrible, boring and confusing. I just love to see them want to be the actors you can say, there are waiters who are looking for this "big break". Not too clever that they fell into horror music cliches, sometimes it works and sometimes it hasn't read the script in this case. Because film, appearance, feeling, acting, everything about this movie was just bad, I suggest you just pass on the movie when you see it in your video store. It could have been an interesting movie with a different concept, but why did they choose this director to show their "creativity" when it was even? It was a bad movie, just miss it. <br /> <br /> 1/10
