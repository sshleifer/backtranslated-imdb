(Spoilers) "Cash Crop" goes something like this. Luck-on-your-luck farmers grow pot to make ends meet. DEA agent blows in the city. Farmers hide the pot. DEA agent leaves the city. End of story. <br /> <br /> This flick includes some second-level actors, a mediocre direction and so-so scenario ... but it has no story. And since this story is the basis of every drama, "Monetary Culture" has been completely unsuccessful. Too boring to recommend.
