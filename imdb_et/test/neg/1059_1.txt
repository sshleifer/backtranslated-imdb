Well, this movie shows us that Mark Griffiths and the manufacturers think we are all idiots. If not, how should we understand it: <br /> <br /> American pilots take off from Mig-29. All the planes suddenly turn to F-16. Ha, magic! After action ... Migs land. Magic again! <br /> <br /> Did I mention that F-16 had Israeli labels? <br /> <br /> Second Magic: Obviously unarmed L-39 trainers are bombing enemies. <br /> <br /> And more magic: although all the movies are in Europe, we see almost every flight in the desert. Maybe the director wastes all his ores on the above things, because the action scenes are incredibly chaotic, and the explosions also look terrible as the pilots bombard with molotov. <br /> <br /> OK, OK, it's a movie. I should write this story ... wait. Story? Yes, this movie has a story of SOME. And its terrible too.
