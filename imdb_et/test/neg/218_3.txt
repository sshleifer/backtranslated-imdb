Incredibly disappointed. This pace was slow. The characters are incredible and the whole movie as a whole allows me to get bored and unfulfilled. There was no real plot of land that could turn you around and interest you. He himself never offered any excitement and didn't look very good. <br /> <br /> No character was deep enough or in the background, and Laurance Fishbourne's character was the one I expected. an idea of ​​how to play a terrible gross and is preferably a pleasant character. Columbus' short one of my favorite actresses (in the yard outdoors) allowed me to drop off with her presentation, her character was blind and you could hardly see what led her thinking. <br /> <br /> The only sign I thought I was proposing something movie was Milo Ventimiglia (Peter Petrelli heroes). Although his character is rather small and irrelevant, I think his touch is added to every film. <br /> <br /> All in all, buy a DVD to find a new way to waste your time.
