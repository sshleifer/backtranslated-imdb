I remember all the leaps in this movie when Aaliyah was killed. As a fan of Mrs Rice's novels, my first thought was "How can they make the king of the corpse without doing Vampire Lestat?" <br /> <br /> After seeing the movie, I see how they did it now. When you read these books, imagine that you took the Vampire Letted nice parts, peeling Marcus and Marius into one symbol and removing everything from Lestat (huntimets, his violin, Vampire theater and also Louis, Claudia and Gabrielle), then cramming in the last 15 minutes Queen The Damned. <br /> <br /> What we lose is a very important part of Lestat's character. His inner torture to live kill, that he carefully tries to choose his victim killers and his love-hate relationship with Louis, Armand, Gabriel, and all other vampires. <br /> <br /> For the story, it is also important that we lose the "twin work", which is the genesis of Mrs Rice's vampires. And while I am sure that cannibalism was intense to show the screen, they could have done something closer and showed us more ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> Even worse, we have this love interest that has missed Jessie and Lesta. The Vampire Chronicle is essentially an American Yoni story. For those who don't know, Yoni is the second Hentai (Japanese Porno Comic). Yon, however, is a male-to-female relationship between a woman and a woman. Although I am sure many men will challenge the "gaynes" of the characters, they went to the far extreme in this film. For Lesta, she kills killers after young female groups. <br /> <br /> Other logic and story flaws are great. In the beginning, Lesta rises from a century-long dream, then Marius asks how he made red velvet during the 1950s. Marius has no idea who Elvis is, and says he was sleeping during this period. Thinking about how Lestat knows about the 50's fashion and music because he grew up in the same period himself. And nothing has ever been mentioned about Louis, Claudia, or Gabriel. I think it's a shame. It's like seeing "Snow White and 3 Dwarfs". <br /> <br /> Overall, my supposed film was very bad. The only good thing about this was the soundtrack. Most of the actors were bad, the accents pulled me to the wall and all the really thorough parts of the book were removed, leaving us only with a hollow shell like Enk when he was dry. /> <br /> If you want to see a good modern vampire movie, take Lost Boys, an initial vampire interview, or even some old Dark Shadows episodes. Let it rest on the piece, put it through the heart, the garlic clove around the neck, and a bottle of Holy Water in the mouth. <br /> <br /> Finally, remember that it was planned to go straight to the video before killing Aaliyah, no news release was planned. Now it is clear why it was. It is only sad that someone is talented because he is remembered for the dog of this movie, rather than something he could really do. <br /> <br /> I appreciate it on a 2 on a scale of 1-10.
