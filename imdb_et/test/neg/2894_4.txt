This is a very boring film with badly developed characters, subplots that don't go anywhere and hardly tolerate. This is a weak pretext for "2001". The only thing that makes it worth is the kits and costumes and the visual effects. But even that wasn't enough for me to break down. I would like to get a soundtrack, especially music during space flight, at night when I have trouble sleeping.
