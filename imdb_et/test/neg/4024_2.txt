I've always had this sick curiosity when it comes to notorious and unpopular movies. I've always been so bad, it's a good flicks; <br /> <br /> So I looked at it and found that all the critics are right about it. It's a MAJOR flop, but unlike many flops, it's not even enjoyable on some levels, not just jokes. It's just another boring tring-fest after another all the time. <br /> <br /> I was warned. I didn't listen. I am stupid. <br /> <br /> Don't be stupid, don't waste time and money on this trash.
