Riccardo Fred may have a good reputation; but since we now that many of his best films were actually late for great Mario Bava; it is clear that he was not one of Italy's most talented filmmakers in the 1970s. This film proves it quite a lot, despite the simplified plot; it is a sprawling confusion and general, I have to go so far as to say that the tragic ceremony is EFFICIENT as Fred's delightful Giallo effort, Iguana with the tongue. Freda apparently ignored this movie and I certainly don't blame her! The plot is just followed by a bunch of kids who don't use gasoline. They take place at the house in search of fuel; but it has turned out to be a bad choice because the owner is almost ready for a satanic ceremony ... ho hum. The film plays a leading role in Camille Keaton, who celebrates a class of suppression in the classroom a few years later, but is unable to impress her, even though you are acting with the talents of talented performers. The film has one dignified gore scene to the end, but it's not really enough given that it takes eighty minutes. I have a great deal of tolerance for garbage in Italian films that don't make sense - but I couldn't even hold it. Miss it, don't miss anything!
