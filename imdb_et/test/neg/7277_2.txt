Mountains are the eyes are not a great movie for any imagination. One of the villains sees almost normal, not what you would expect from seeing dirty ransomers. Secondly, it is from time to time very slow and there are many scenes of characters that repeat itself. This means that there is a lot of filler in the film, the purposeful being many rounds. the film had no clear direction. The film's line is barely original, even at this time. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre appeared a few years earlier and is a much more effective film as far as horror goes. the film has little intimidation and the pounding soundtrack was just grabbing and all disturbing. I think the music was used to cover the fact that a lot of the movie does not happen, even though it didn't work for its intended purpose. Basically I looked at the time every few seconds, hoping something would happen or end. when something finally happened The movie was only destroyed by chaos and loud noise. I sat through it because I like to give the film the benefits of suspicion. I have some false screams, and yes people die, but who care about being too slow to get some reward if you can call it my friend enjoyed it so at least one of us got it out. Mountains are the eyes are not the worst film we could have seen, but I doubt I look at it again. this movie was rebuilt in 2006 and I have a review of this version. This film was painfully slow from time to time, while other times were chaotic and repetitive. someone who runs around his block screams their head away from this movie. A better bet would be the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1973) 1.5 * 10 *, which is generous
