On a friend's recommendation and admiring Philip Baker Hall, I borrowed Loop's first season album. This is a typical telescope with all the clich√©s that the genre works with the "mad" brother (Sully), the "ditzy" blonde (Lizzy), the symbolic interest in love (Piper), the sarcastic Asian helper (Darcy, which reminded me of Arliss, as if ANY had to be reminded to show). The plot deals with various bad accidents (usually by Sully) that hit Sam, which puts his work at risk, but that he would save a day in the middle of having "fun hijinks". I didn't describe a particular episode. I described them all to Tks. There is a problem here because it seems that it may even be acceptable entertainment first just becomes useless when you look at the episodes sequentially and grow dull as incredible is endless repetition. Sully does something "mad", Mimi Rogers says something publicly sexual, Russ talks about her gay son, Darcy makes his impersonalization Sandra Oh on Arliss blah blah blah blah blah. The only positive thing is the lack of a disturbing laugh. But don't let this fool think about it. See much better comedy. Arrested development, always sunny in Phillips, two names over two heads. Surprisingly, it's still in the air. Oh what's right Fox cancels only good exhibitions, forgot. Needless to say, I no longer trust my friend's taste at exhibitions. <br /> <br /> My class: D +
