Carole Lombard and James Stewart are trying quite a bit of life and meaning for this controversial film about the misery of the newborn couple. Scenes play as if they were parceled between different directors, each with a different purpose. Some are Capra-cute, some with screws, some melodramatic and some surprisingly noir. There is even an extended adventure sequence when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a snow storm. It is difficult to say which scenes are the most unreasonable when the film as a whole is so unusual and the tone is not exactly plausible. Just watching fans of film students or actors - some smaller parts, such as Judge Doolittle and eye-catcher, are also very well played.
