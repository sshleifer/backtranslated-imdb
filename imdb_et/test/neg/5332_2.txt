This movie is bad, as we all knew it would be. Most of the times I usually love bad 80s / early 90s trash-comedy (haha no pun intended). During this time, I read a ski school, career opportunities, hot pictures, summer school and more. It's even a classic yet forgotten comedy by Dean Cameron (aka .. ski school 8th part instructor and Party Maniac for Summer School). But this movie is just slow. It takes almost 30 minutes to approach, and we have to sit between meaningless dialogue to miss the Sheen Boys (E&C). And yes, I hear bloggers who die with the trash, "probably you don't look 2 and 1/2 men." Well, Charlie was not at the level he is currently in during this flick ... not that he's worth it now watching Charlie only appears when his co-stars support him and Emilio is no longer a superfluous miracle bra offers little support. In fact, this movie is written by Emilio and it shows that it has no real ending (come to Emilio, even Ski School 2 writers ended up. No idea how any problem raised is solved, no hot babes, no bad to worsen a bad plot, characters, acting ... I'm tired of this tirade now, and see the films above.
