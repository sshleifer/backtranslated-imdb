Bad / bad way ... this movie has officially become the worst "TV movie" in my book, except for what this camp's value offers, I give it a value for 1 and 10 for a camp. Recommendation: Watch with your friends, champagne and lots of popcorn ... you want to throw some on the screen! Preferably friends who like Chris Noth's "Sex in the city days" ... this movie is terribly funny. This is definitely the lowest point in the career of all the members ... frankly, I don't know how they laughed when the lines were delivered! Daniel J. Travanti is completely pathetic. EVERYONE participated in a surge school; and poor Joan Van Ark, I believe he was the only one to take this absurd theater seriously ... he's a producer. Her "mother" jeans and bad plastic surgery are a scene stealer. This film also undergoes safe social inaccuracy when introducing the spiritually challenged character of the plot. This is a hidden movie that shows that life is listed {With Harmful Intent} .... Is anyone happy?
