I agree that Mary Woronov (Murdoc's secretary) is one of the only good films on this film. He is never my favorite actor, every game he plays is always so well done. His character is clever, sarcastic, clever, light-hearted, funny and clever. He really pulls that role well and you get a good feeling about what his character is. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is bad. Music is the most interesting thing. One character has this really strange circular radio that it brings when it carries the upper of its dense zebra striped tank. <br /> <br /> One thing that was a little bit interesting about the story was the idea that someone hires these three college-older children, who are an old parent's abandoned theater spruce. He gives them the keys and says - go for it. It would be really fun and I wish someone would give me this opportunity! Imagine going to the old abandoned theater with two other people and you can decide how to decorate it and fix it. You have complete control over the entire building. That would be so fun! Unfortunately, the characters don't think of it as an exciting adventure, but think it is a great chore. They are walking long faces and fighting with each other all the time. It's kind of a buzzer. But it is fun to think about the possibilities that these people are not even excited about. <br /> <br /> The film does a good job of feeling helpless or little what the theater looks like. But acting (after Woronov .. and maybe Murdoch, boss - just because he makes really good money a hungry smiley businessman who never luck) is really terrible and you just stop dissatisfaction. Plus, the casual slapstick is a bit sticky and sort of ruins the reality that the film tries to create. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the electronic strikes of Mary Woronov's funky 80's Casio keyboard style and if you think you have a gigantic spooky abandoned theater yourself.
