From an artistic point of view, the film does not offer a film or a moral solution. The plot is hard to follow if it is at all. It works hard. Dialogue is a clich√© and is clearly written by someone who does not know English. Only cinematography was watching this movie, although there are still flaws in the picture. <br /> <br /> As an Asian-American woman, the film was angry with me because it proved how narrowly minded people might be. Politically, the return of Asian women to such shameful roles should be prohibited. The persistence of stereotypes of Asian prostitutes not only undermines the self-esteem of Asian women, but also the whole country. I know the leading actor who played Maya and its exploitation to play such a role. <br /> <br /> Like Americans, don't ask for this movie. Art should be used to develop our tolerance and respect for each other, not to keep it back.
