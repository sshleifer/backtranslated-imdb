This movie is absolutely incredible. The only way a girl can do this act is if she has serious mental health problems, or if she has a long-term sexual abuse or a serious problem. However, we are asked to believe that otherwise a "normal" healthy woman got a bit bored and "made a small mistake" and the oops had a sexual encounter with the dog. He had never ever had any adverse effect, except when he says. <br /> <br /> He did not rape the dog or the dog did not do anything he could not resist - he actively started oral sex and finished this activity with his own pet dog. He was not a drug or something he just felt. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is trying to "do it well for anyone who is just honest". But to really believe it, we have to believe that it is a woman who is able to do something completely if she "just feels like that". Think about it - should he have considered the rights and lies of this action before doing it? If he had stopped him in his stories. People have instinctive boundaries for reasons. If we start to deal with the inevitable "cute" little aberration that is next? Child Harassment? But the "heroine" is a nice girl who was one aberration moment. Had he been forced to force this act by the abuser, that story might have been more meaningful and I would have been able to accept the story. But there is no chance that someone will take the required longer action and even take it once - if there is no deep disorder that requires a lot of psychiatric help. It is NOT that otherwise in perfect life would happen once. <br /> <br /> I know it's just a movie, but it's going through the media through normalizing behaviors like the media that it becomes unrecognizable and more and more amazing reality becomes possible. <br /> <br /> I could imagine that the offender shows it to the child to convince them that this is not such a big deal and then on its agenda. It can also be used by the offender to emphasize the child that he or she is not talking about abuse because see how people react to you. <br /> <br /> It's not true. The director wants people to think this is true. It concerns degradation and how to easily manipulate people (viewing the public) to accept the most terrible concepts when they are correctly placed. The watching public is manipulative, degraded and laughed. <br /> <br /> This is a movie in which participants and viewers are humiliated and joked by a clever, but extremely disturbed movie writer in a very complicated way. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to me to be used as a vehicle creator to get the excitement of playing out your mind. I don't know if it's conscious - but it's the most classic example of the Mind F *** k I've ever met. <br /> <br /> I hope it won't break anyone too much. But if you watched this movie - I don't think there's anything offensive.
