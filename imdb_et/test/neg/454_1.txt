For weeks and weeks, ABC "The One" was supposed to be "The Real World", which corresponds to "American Idol". We had to watch these singers perform, compete and see how they lived together in the house. Drama! Stress! <br /> <br /> Where does this cruelty begin? Let's start with the "judges" who were the music experts of this program. "Experts" means they have the knowledge. Andre Harrell had at least a family tree. He was responsible for Motown Records for some time. The other two ... Kate Hudson's Uncle, who could have called Mr Weird Beard. She painted her face hair in three distinct colors. I don't know how scary it would have been with black light! And Paula Abdul wannabe, who did something I didn't think of, could happen: he was even more fascinating and fascinated than Paula! He then corrected and became tough after the first episode. The "critique" farce that these three offered was a real joke and insult, not only to the process of finding the best singer, but to the audience, who is now quite skilled and who has done it several times. /> <br /> There was a host. George Stroumboulopoulos was not Ryan Seacrest. In fact, he was as weak as possible. He wondered what little energy there was in the program, dry. How he got this job was the second largest mystery in the exhibition. The first was how did they choose 11 contestants for this program? It was literally a talent show. OKAY. Maybe it's an exaggeration. And all, the performers must be relatively close, because, if not, then there would be no "contest". If only one person was "good", there would be no "intercourse". So, I get them all to be comparable. But they should all have * some * furs! In addition, the judges attended the "Singing Academy", so the program was part of "Celebrity". It is clear that these performers need these lessons urgently. But you need some very talented people to teach those with little talent for talent. And that was certainly not the case here. <br /> <br /> The exhibition seemed to be a priority for "homelife" elements, because all players were very attractive to watch, equally, how badly they sounded. But the filmed segments in his house were so cut and sliced ​​that you couldn't get to the northwest that started to happen, so the show didn't hit the events there. <br /> <br /> Like bad "It" was an incredible, incredible, deadly design that contained results that made it completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Audiences called with their voice, who liked the best, like "AI". But when the listeners were announced, the three remaining contestants were forced to sing the last song. Based on this result, "music experts" chose one person from three who recorded the following week. And then the safe rivals took the vote on who they wanted to keep from the other two by sending the remaining competitor home. <br /> <br /> The "design mistake" was that the contestants got the final word. I mean, if you were in a music competition and you wanted to get as far as you could, would you vote for a better singer, or would you try to get rid of your hardest rival? CBS Survivor's first season viewer could answer it! And that's what happened to the program. The man with the better potential lost, and the contestants voted against "one" who had no talent at all! In addition, the competitor, who was "under the" experts, was also allowed to vote against the other two! It was a complete farce! Perhaps, if they let the contestants first vote, at least "experts" would save the two end of the evil. But it just confirms how this example is not ready to be communicated, how the whole process was not satisfied and how the manufacturers tried it.
