Apart from the beautiful images thanks to Alun Bollinger, a New Zealand operator, this movie is not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The story is so fragmented and lost that it's hard to know what's happening at any time, and just when you think you're following this trend again, like a lost bi-polar puppy dog. <br /> <br /> The music point is terrible, relying too heavily on very sensitive pieces that try to force the audience to feel in a way that the tools have acted in the order of emotions? "I feel sad here"; "Feeling here shocked"; "Fear here". Moreover, the repetitive samples again and again leave a laugh. <br /> <br /> Past has been a quiet movie days where musical instruments were the only voice imagination? But you don't think so, looking at the river queen. <br /> <br /> Voting was so overwhelmed that you need to think about whether this film needs an accompanying picture. It could have been easy to play the radio, though even then it would follow the story. <br /> <br /> And Jane Campion's Piano stolen ideas are too obvious to be forgotten. Not only the beach and the forest are almost the same as the piano? maybe this is the last part of Alun Bollinger's camera work? but the feeling of the voices and also the levels are surprisingly close. And who could forget when Holly Hunter's character has cut their wings, Sam's face is cut off from her. Does it remind you when Wiremu has drawn his "release finger" and surprisingly the ax? I thought so. <br /> <br /> All in all, I can't recommend this movie unless you wear some headphones and just go to the landscape.
