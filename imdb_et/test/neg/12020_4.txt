None of my friends bought the Problem-Child Tantric Kit (contains the first two "Problem Sites" in one disc) and we decided to follow the sequel because it was "funny" <br /> <br /> what i have to say.), Nippy dog ​​after eating CHOW DOWN and many others. Film is something other than a toilet, but it's fun. Other than funny moments, this movie has little to offer. <br /> <br /> John Ritter is irritating my mess because it sounds like reading a book. The man cannot act in such a situation, sorry. <br /> <br /> Although I can't tell if I find the movie now funny ... (we were blown when we watched it), it's the perfect movie for a rainy day ... but nothing else. Don't wait for the Oscar material on it, guys.
