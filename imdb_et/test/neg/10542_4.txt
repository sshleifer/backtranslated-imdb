Heldeke! What can I say about Half Past Dead? I was disappointed with it. I was thinking .... Steven Seagal movie! Cool! We can see him hit people and hit people and bones. We can even see that he has a fight with someone! Great! <br /> <br /> However, I was a rude awakening. This movie can be summarized as follows: <br /> <br /> Take the A-team episode, remove beloved and robbing characters like Murdoch, Hannibal, Mr. T and Face. Then get a writer / director to write on the plot even Ed Wood would be ashamed and too big for The Matrix and John Woo movie fan himself. Throw in a number of people who really have poor ability to act and have no real names. Finally, add the main character who starts to strike around the Middle Ages and no longer seems to be able to do their tricks. <br /> <br /> Result? Half Past Dead. The action film is so ridiculous that it at least made me smile right away. The holes in the plot are amazingly, conspicuously large - for example, prisoners who are fighting against intruders during the invasion of the prison, not trying to escape. Or how the prison itself, with armaments with heavy machinery and rocket launcher rockets? You also have a helicopter (with a striking resemblance to Huey) that has a video game machine installed in your nose. <br /> <br /> Then Seagal himself is. I like this man. He can fight. He's even witty so that Jean-Claude Van Damme never gets. But through the whole movie, I was hoping for one big, decisive fight against the scene. Never happened. Instead, we got people who shot a lot of weapons and didn't hit much hell. I mean, if someone runs in a narrow corridor and lets them down, there are not many places that the balls can go to below the corridor and to the target. But are they anyway? Even the A-Team would be against this stupidity. And when it reaches any single physical stuff, the burst of the split Matrix is ​​treated with no bullet time. Twenty-footed people and other ridiculous acrobatic nonsense. <br /> <br /> C'mon Steven, you're better than that. Your career cannot end. Say it is not so! <br /> <br /> This is instantly forgotten (unless I force myself to remember this review) and if you look at it, try this amusing A-Team type. But I doubt it is high on someone's "traceable" list. It's like that. More than lunch.
