I think I have a good sense of humor, but this "film" left me stunned in my chair. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that it just wouldn't have been worse. Never smiled this movie sadly. I've been watching and enjoying a number of great movie parodies, but unfortunately, this is what I remember best - my nightmares. <br /> <br /> The only reason someone should look at it is if they want to see it for a short while. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie.
