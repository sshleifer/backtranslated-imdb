I should have realized that any two-video set sold for only $ 6 would be bad. I even read the comments before watching this movie and it still hasn't impressed me. I loved this book and I knew it couldn't be as bad as people said. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's it. <br /> <br /> A movie, video, and appearing in Stock Footage will be combined with one chapter of James A. Michener's epic novel. The covered period was one chapter, but I don't remember many of the situations that actually occur in the book. The package of my movie copy gives Maria Conchita Alonso the best deal - although it turns out that he is only speaking. On the second tape. <br /> <br /> Actresses must be praised for playing their roles well despite the smarmy, over-burned script. However, they must be offended to accept their roles.
