I'm not saying that the show is all bad because there are some funny parts like Spencer, and some casual occasions. But besides, let's face it, it's just another dry sitcom that kids buy. <br /> <br /> Miranda Cosgrove was cute and funny like Megan Drake and Josh. Frankly, he is mediocre in ICarlis and not just as funny as he is trying to be. The actor who plays Sami seems to be half asleep at most of the time, and his antics are so clich√©s that I think about them. They're not funny, just annoying. And Freddie's okay, but not that interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, these situations are unrealistic, but it's not all bad. However, some are annoying. Here are some: <br /> <br /> 1. Girls are 14 years old and have a web show that gives too much personal information, with a weekly audience of 27,000 people (WTF), a lack of advertising, and they can still go on their lives that hasn't been crazy. br /> <br /> 2.Your web exhibition gets too much praise ($ 100,000 a year to advertise sneakers, a free trip to Japan, Plain White Ts, etc.). Frankly, someone over the age of 6 will not find their "comedy" entertaining. <br /> <br /> 3. How are they so "middle", but they have a three-storey attic, Spencer hardly does anything and can afford many basic luxury items and all the web design equipment? 4. All adults are idiots. All of them. <br /> <br /> 5. No 5-foot high girl, no matter how unpleasant and tough, can take in trained policemen if she is not muscular. Sam is skinny and petite. <br /> <br /> 6. No one in the elevator can live 9 stories and live. <br /> <br /> 7. Children can handle criminals better than police officers. <br /> <br /> The show is stupid. In fact, it seems harmless, but children's thinking that they may be reluctant to their parents live alone in Seattle when they are only 14 years old with irresponsible morals, and personal information is just wrong. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed to say that my cousin, 3 years old, enjoys the exhibition. What happened to cartoons when I was his age?
