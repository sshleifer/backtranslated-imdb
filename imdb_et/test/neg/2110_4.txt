So I was energized during the weekend of my snakes, after some movie we still had some. Why not snakes on the train? How bad it could be, his snakes are likely to kill people on trains. The snakes had to be riders. First and foremost for me and my mates thought the snakes were harmless garden snakes and pet snakes with the same cheeky bleak soundtrack. We were all ready to turn it off (we are too lazy to walk and kick off). The next thing we knew did not know what the hell happened, but at the end there is something amazingly funny. It is one of those endings that you would roll back a few times to squeeze smiles because you suffered so long. <br /> <br /> The last 10 mins "8", the rest of the movie is 2.
