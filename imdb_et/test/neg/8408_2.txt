The first movie is a bit good for me, I mostly enjoyed it, but I thought it wasn't really special. However, compared to this confusion, it is much better. Why did they feel that making the film was farther away from me, but they should have known that it was not suitable for the first film when they got back to Ruth Gordon again. The story of this follows Rosemary's baby around and things, but in fact it is a sort of confusion, it doesn't help that the movie is on television film and television looks very good. It also has more comedy tones that greatly hinder it if they really felt the need to continue to have made this film called R, which had some nudity and gore in it. I'm sure it would have been pretty bad, but at least it would have been more traceable and fun than this movie, despite trying to be funny. I saw it in Monstervision, and Joe Bobil wasn't in the intro to say anything about it and I don't have to say that much. I have to say that this was a sequel that should not have been seen in daylight.
