I had been waiting for a long time to watch this movie. As far as I know it has never been released in Australia, I finally found a copy on the Internet and ordered it there. After weeks of receiving the order confirmation, I finally arrived and I was very happy to finally sit in front of my TV, ready to watch a movie that was so interesting and controversial and filmed in a world with so many good films. What a disappointment. In the first few minutes I realized that I ordered B Grader, but I was still expecting. I am convinced that my son (18) will look at it with me because I love sharing when I find a valuable film with good statements and / or story. About half way he rose and said he couldn't look any more, it was so predictable and amateur. I agreed, but I looked to the end. Action was even cruel to Class B standards. Stereotypes also predict themselves and I feel that the good people of Lake Arthur, Louisianna, have to have seen a film that depicts them in such a way. There is no doubt that in many parts of the world there are still racial prejudices, not just countries, but indeed, on this day and age, I doubt that they will be abandoned by all the ridiculous alibi that it contains. I had to check the date the film was made, because their attempts to trim the scenes in tough scenes were something I would expect from a high school student's first attempt to make a movie "indy". I would like to see this film come into the hands of experienced scriptwriters and filmmakers, its old story, but what could be professionally packed would still be packed. So disappointed after such a long wait and so high expectations. Soundtrack was probably the only thing I enjoyed.
