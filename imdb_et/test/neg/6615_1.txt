His obvious ESPN drives when Knight is in the news, but were they supposed to be a fan of him? It was the worst attempt at a serious dramatic movie I've ever seen. It was all: terrible action, terrible dialogue, ridiculous casting, cheap kits, etc. It seemed that it was shot from a $ 10 budget. Kummon, what are the game scenes? Were they in high school gym? And lighting, let me say it was ridiculous. And Brian Denehy as Bob Knight? Leave me alone. Denehey looked like ... Denehy in a red sweater, nothing more. ESPN lost a lot of credibility with this flop. They poured millions of dollars into ads, then the premier was a huge break. Bob Knight is not a subject that can be covered with a 2-hour movie. ESPN blew it. Even Knight thought it was more stupid than anything else.
