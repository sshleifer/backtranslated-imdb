"Maximum Risk" is a step sideways for Van Damme and even more unspired B movie action stuff that we expect from films that include a Belgian warrior. Flick has plots, fears, a dirty conglomerate plot, and a great Henstridge who spends most of his time as he waits. The "maximum risk" does not distinguish itself in any way, and it is unlikely to be high among conventional young men. (C-)
