This year, I participated in screening the Toronto Film Festival "Cooler". While other readings seem to be generally (and mysteriously) positive, I have to tell you that this film is unimaginably, messagelessly bad. The very brave and sincere presentations of William H. Macy and Maria Bello have been terribly wrong, which is probably the least polished, most clich√© script that has been green for years. I don't know how bad Brown Bunny was, but I'm sure it wouldn't have achieved the Dante-style depth that it did. As courageous as their performances, perhaps the bolder thing these otherwise great actors did was to entrust themselves to such a terrible director and exhausting scenario. <br /> <br /> He must walk quite well in the Chamber, because he should never be allowed to be one hundred meters from the camera. The dialogue is so embarrassing and uncomfortable that I actually discovered a skew during the screening. I'm moral, that Macy's talents are completely destroyed by someone whose direction is incompetent in writing. <br /> <br /> Looking at talented actors like Alec Baldwin's workforce towards Kramer's terrible script and ham-fisted, it was similar to looking at child seals to make the club dead - I felt angry, helpless, and ill at the same time. Although I am always glad that investors and industry people are willing to take interesting spaces with the risk of peculiar scripts, this picture was a complete, perfect fiasco. Kramer could not be cruel to these actors if he himself was a steel pipe for his generations. I hope they can avoid similar reductions in the future. Macy moved wisely to the side door and didn't even want to sift. Unfortunately, it seems that the bad thing in the picture was rubbed in the worst way. Anyone who is accustomed to quality independent is likely to find it completely unbearable.
