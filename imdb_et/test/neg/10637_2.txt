When I first saw this movie in the theater, I was so angry. That, in my opinion, was completely inspiring. I didn't see it for ten years, then I decided what the hell was going to look like. I watch all the hellraiser films to see where it went wrong. I think it was a sequel 5 which was the first to implement the whole "I am the dream omg, which I see strange things, oh noes, what's going on, oh its a dream, oh, it's not a dream, wait, i I see something horrible, oh never mind "- a happy storyline. These queues do not even require opening the box or keeping the first 4 film rules when you saw the pinhead that you are pretty much screwed and dead. The first 3 hellraisers confirmed this story, which made it so scary. Something fantasy, something strange, the box got boomed when they came. Kirstey was the only one who could get out of it, first because of Uncle Frank. Then because he had information about centobytes. This film tries to at least keep it, though it was a bad story, but it was a bit hellraiser. No, I'm pretty sure the 5th part was the first part that completely and completely destroyed the hellraiser series. Now they have rewritten 1 and I don't even think I look at it. Oh, who I'm kidding, I'm probably going to start and probably be disappointed.
