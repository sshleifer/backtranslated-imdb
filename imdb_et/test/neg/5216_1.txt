This is one of those fundamentalist Christian films that hit you with the head of religion. You know you're in trouble when the story is completely ridiculous. Three men fly to Mexico for editing the Bible. It makes no sense, because the church is Protestant and most Mexicans are Catholics. Protestant and Catholic Bibles are not the same. There is a book in the Catholic Bible that is not in the Protestant Bible. I also find it hard to believe that the Mexican churches do not share the Bible with them. I understand if they go to a place where Christianity is a minority. But Mexico is far removed. If you can't believe setting up a story, you won't be the rest of the story. The film's religion can be fun, but not the movie.
