No director would happen to David O. Selznick. So, "Goodbye to Arms" (1957), do we get two? Charles Vidor and John Huston. Although both men had achieved their own right, they could not make the head or tail of Hemmingway's magnificent resurrection. Hemmingway has generally not translated the book into the screen. But because of Selznick's enthusiasm, turn it into his next "Gone With The Wind", which is both punitive and exhaustive. At the time of Selzzelick's career he was no longer a titan who could take the "office poison" and turn it into a wind. Tired, weak, minus your studio and the impending sense that his second marriage to Jennifer Jones could have been a mistake, Selznick gave this flick creativity to Fox Studios? but he kept himself enough to get the hell out of the kit. <br /> <br /> Now this is one or should be a familiar hungry tragic love story sister, Catharine Barkley (Jennifer Jones) and her soldier hero, Mrs Frederick Henry (Rock Hudson). Their passion should act as a stabilizing force for what is essentially the story of a warrior, where romance was thrown into good measure. But chemistry between Hudson and Jones is both marketable and dull. In the last roll, the birth control of the Jones child is so bad that I am surprised that neither director decided to cut them out of the overall release. Part of the problem with Jones is that, for thirty-eight years, he's too clever to play an optimistic Catharine with great conviction. But older actors have often been able to forget the differences in age. Not so with Jones. One is painfully aware that he does not fit the bill either on the stones in operation or on the years invested on that planet. Hudson's laconic charm is hopelessly untouched by a military soldier, whose heart is broken, but the head remains strong. Supporting casts include luminaires like Vittorio De Sica and Mercedes McCambridge, but they are wasted meaningless bits that in no way reflect the amazing talents of either actor and are best seen elsewhere in filmmaking channels. <Br /> <br /> An anamorphic image element "A Farewell to Arms" looks good enough, although in some scenes, for the pleasure of this reviewer, there is just a bit too much movie. In general, the colors are fine and silent, although they are balanced according to DeLuxe's ​​color treatment. Certain fading is obvious. Meat tones don't look very natural. Contrast levels are weak. Black is generally solid. White is almost pure. It is not recommended to recommend this movie to Sonical. This is essentially a picture with weapon frames. No extras.
