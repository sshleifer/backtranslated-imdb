You have to give this writer-director John Hughes. Behind her tremendous success she had in her lap-teenage / high school wine, she managed to practice comedy in other areas by finding John All's comedian actor John Candy. Here, the adult Candy becomes a better person if she agrees to have her child taken up by a child; it is a solid form that is meant to appeal to both the cynical and their parents, and it is no wonder that the film was the winner of the theater conference. Meanwhile, Hughes basically relies on Candy's charm to put the scenario over and one can eventually grow into tired repetitive gags, marked with a star and in the middle. Children are sitcom-smart, other adult shaping blemishes, and Amy Madigan is too intense, too hypothetical, playing Uncle Buck's girlfriend. Later on, the TV series was a good fit because the material was already perfect on television. * 1/2 from ****
