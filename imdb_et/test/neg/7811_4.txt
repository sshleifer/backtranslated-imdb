It was stupid. Sounds like Adam Sandler's film. <br /> <br /> There were some funny parts, but not so funny. <br /> <br /> I liked some of the participants. <br /> <br /> There was a Saturday. People living in the night movie. But I wouldn't recommend it if there is nothing better. And it was even better than any of Jennifer Lopez's films.
