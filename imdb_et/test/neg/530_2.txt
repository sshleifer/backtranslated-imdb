Two things are always a sign that you watch a bad movie: Time is Death Immediately After the Title Queue <br /> <br /> This is actually the third warning sign, and this title shows a lazy exposure that warns the poor unknown naive audience of the dangers of company greed. Guess ? CYBORG 2 begins with a title that warns us about future greed in the company, followed by a title that reminded me of TERMINATOR, HARDWARE and BLADE RUNNER, followed by death during sex! Hey, you don't think I'm looking at a bad movie in any way? <br /> <br /> As you may think, this is a bad movie. Basically, it is a set of action scenes written around a helmet-shaped plot of land from a greedy corporate company. It is poorly written, directed and acted, and most ill-illuminated, which means it is very difficult to see what is happening on the screen, although I am not sure that it is really bad. The only interest was that this is the debut of the film from Angelina Jolie, who plays the cyber on the run and who says the prophetic line "They're cute, I don't know if they're real?" myself when I see one of his films
