Yes, what did I expect? I thought it would be a movie about young adults at their turning point in life, like "Sonnenallee" or "American Pie", which I really liked. I wanted to see a funny movie, perhaps with an ironic appearance in Würzburg. And what did I get? <br /> <br /> Attention, front spoilers! <br /> <br /> This movie begins with a long dialogue that gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow: longer dialogues. Sometimes I thought that Moritz Bleibtreu could have forgotten his text and tried to hide this fact by improvising and simply repeating what he said earlier. But if I think Bleibtreu is one of the best German actors, I believe that this effect was actually meant. I think the author wanted to show how nice it is to talk to close friends - especially when they are stoned. But, really, I don't need a cinema to rock with friends. This film is made up of boring dialogues. <br /> <br /> But okay, that's one thing. I can do it, I've seen movies with nice eligible dialogues, just think about Schwarzenegger's life's work. The next thing is that the characters are cheap and flat and that the storyline is as predictable as anything. Just one example (SPOILER !!): Why, do you think anyone takes their hose deep into the forest in their cannabis plants? Water them? Of course not, you don't usually find the wood pipes, isn't it? The only reason that this hose exists is that the hunter who happens when two main characters are cleaned can be treated, treated and finally filled with three bottles of Jaegerm. I hated this scene because it's really violent. Usually I don't mind violence in movies - slapst-comedies are full. But in such a comedy, there is a silent agreement between the film and you that people will not hurt if they fall on their face or beat with chairs. But if this happens in a movie that is otherwise realistic, the slapst scenes also seem real. In this particular "Lammbock" scene, I thought this hunter had to be badly injured, if not dead - the last scene really made me think he was left to die there, full of a cafe anyone could handle. And the main characters just walk away. It would have been different if the author had consistently followed one style; the scene could have been quite funny. <br /> <br /> Talking about being consistently - what I forgot about this movie. The whole movie seems to be a list of small episodes that came to the mind of the author. Things happen simply without obvious reason - yes, I know it's life, but it's not a cinema, because the cinema is meant to tell the story, not to show eternal episodes that have no meaning. I found myself asking, "Where's the point?" all the time. In addition to the two main characters, no characters have been developed, you never know why the main character's sister wants to sleep with her best friend, she tells you, but I couldn't buy it, not at all. I think he was just trying to give Kai a chance to operate with this childish AIDS test scheme, which you've certainly seen a thousand times before and mostly better. The winner's girlfriend will meet once, she will leave Germany (which you don't even see and the boy doesn't look caring), and finally, in one sentence, she has met someone with America and is divided into the main character. It seemed to me that the author wanted to tie some loose ends. He did not really know that you never know what is so bad about learning law as a father's son (father fixes everything at the end and serves coffee in the middle of the night, which I think made him one of the most beautiful characters in the film) and live in beautiful Wuerzburg. Even dinner with a daddy's friend who might have been trying to show how terrible it is to live up to his father's expectations seemed flat, just one nice dinner with family members' friends (except for the trip that the boy is later, but I think if you show, that before eating with the parents is not healthy, it was not the scene if it had been). I have experienced much worse dinners in my life than this and I still finished the exams. I didn't realize that there was no sign in the movie, they just seemed flat and unlikely. <br /> <br /> All of this changed this not-so-good movie, but no one I didn't watch on TV again. It was really a couple of good scenes (most of them were not new, though like beautiful and sensible policemen), some were really funny, some of the dialogues were nice and I like the Bleibtreu game, although he repeated his well-known stereotypes again. Not good, not terrible, I thought after the movie was over half. <br /> <br /> But then it came to the incest stage and it really proved to be repulsive. Incest is not just funny. I don't even know if it was meant to be funny, some people laughed at the public, so it could have understood it. This scene violated me the whole movie, I could not express my condolences any more - I do not feel sympathy for anyone who f **** is a helpless person, that is rape and rape is not funny. So it could have been a drama or so, but the incest is never mentioned (although we thought it might have been one reason why the protagonist finally leaves Germany, but as it is no longer mentioned, we are not t) even totally unnecessary. I was almost expecting the nurse to get pregnant, which would have just added to the completion of this tasteless story, but even this last cliché is not fulfilled, just as nothing has really been solved or thought through to the end of the movie. It's not really funny, it's not really a drama, it's not at all a movie, a la Tarantino, despite the desperate endeavor of violence, it's certainly not enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Skip this movie. Look at "Final Fantasy", it is also bad, but at least with beautiful pictures and not tasteless.
