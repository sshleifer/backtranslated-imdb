The film is powerful as a political statement on the policy of extraordinary rendition, torture and war on terrorism. Others have already commented on these and other aspects of the film. My review may include a spoiler, so if you haven't seen the movie, you may not read it. <br /> <br /> This film is raised by several questions. First, was the protagonist guilty or not? There is no satisfactory explanation as to why the NSA first decided to get it and change it. Is there an innocent explanation of why he received phone calls about what the NSA thinks of as a terrorist? If it does, the movie doesn't look like one and it made the whole film dissatisfied with me. Everything is good and good to make statements about whether torture is right or wrong, but first prove to me that they tortured the wrong person, then go to the next step. <br /> <br /> When the main character was guilty, what was his release? Perhaps we were well-trained to respond to a certain point in time and then pretend to break down and give the answers that could be scarcely explored so that the bully could believe they were tortured to torture to confess without guilt. But there is nothing in the film that proves that he is also guilty. <br /> <br /> Different other loose ends exist: 1. So the fraudulent CIA agent has released her and returned home. What prevents the NSA from picking it up again? Little publicity in Washington Post? Please give me a break ... If the senator does not want to put his neck on his behalf, what should Corinne Whitman be afraid of? 2. If the NSA has been monitoring what phone numbers are called, why couldn't they listen to a call to find out if there is anything down for discussion? 3. Anyway, the plot is even more stupid. Any criminal who has more than a dozen brain cells would carry out his criminal business on an anonymously prepaid mobile phone line, not on what he and his house can follow. <br /> <br /> The entire movie rotates by dragging the viewers' heart strings, showing graphical and free events of torture. But if you think deeper about it, there is no content in this movie, but many unanswered questions and the feeling "what, is it? at the end of the movie.
