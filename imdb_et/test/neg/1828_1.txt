The anatomy was in German with a movie and subtitles. It was also long and boring. If it was to be a horror film, it couldn't make me happy. the movie was ok, but more attention should have been paid to the terrible banal script. I didn't pay for seeing the video and I still feel scammed. Read the book and save your money.
