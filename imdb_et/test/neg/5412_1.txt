I thank God for the DVR and its fast speed. Even with the fact that I could no longer sit through this travesty. When they went through old India, asking for beans, I gave up and deleted. Is it the best SciF channel to get out on Saturday night? How about some old classics? The idea of ​​a joint force unit was bad enough. It seems they wanted to save money when all was filmed in the woods. What else to say? It was so terrible that I didn't think I could get enough lines to get the room to review it. But it seems that another line is doing it. Save your time, not to mention your movie with this movie.
