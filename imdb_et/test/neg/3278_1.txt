1 Bolo Yeung has a total of ten minutes in the film, including when he serves his boss for ice-cream. 2 many street defenders who look like junkyard keepers will instantly get over the Asian superhero, who talks like an illegal alien just behind a manure truck. 3 (thug) let it get me a shirt off, gay model like muscles - heee-haaw! hee-heeew! shout! He's dead on the floor with his neck, elbow, chin or ball - 4 cheap half-sex scenes where white broads come out of the Asian miner. 5 Norton (a former C-movie star) does nothing more than an eccentric trendy weapon smuggler who trades white slutty girls with a hand selected at a nightclub, where they are happily following an idiot who is a millionaire attacking them. 6 yes, the local police captain is involved and yes, the first polished policeman is a former patrol crew crew member (yaawn!). 7 Action scenes are fake like A) hee-haw! The Chinese are catching a little spinning stroke B) skinny Chinese leg to the throat of a negative thug C. Ending death moves too much with his head, as the Walker Texas ranger fake action with the end of end 8 <br /> <br /> garbage. These people are good enough only to be in the stand or the body doubles in other C-movies and credited to AT MOST jointly to the "stunt team offered by the county prison".
