The legendary Cameron Mitchell turkey is about an actor / makeup man who is burned with a head studio when the drink is throwing his face when he is igniting a cigarette. Reduced to the beloved mess and wearing the Mitchell eye clip in Movieland Wax Museum. He kidnaps and kills people using a solution that paralyzes them so he can display them. Really weird bad movie that doesn't describe the description. See how the different wax images do not move, see how all the southern tobacco is consumed? It's a terrible wreck of a movie and you can't take your eyes off the screen. A classic bad film that amazes you even if it leaves permanent scars on the psyche.
