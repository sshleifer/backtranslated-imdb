I don't want to find social value. Regardless of which book or movie people want to suppress, Huck Finn / Heart of Darkness, I don't know, Deep Throat or the last hostage interception, I sincerely want them not to. I am not a lover of porn or violence entertainment, but what I randomly get from them, I see camera cams, cuts, pansies, lighting, rhythm, almost fear or titration, sometimes even the intention of missing filmmakers or actors. Even the images that reasonable people might claim would never have been, I always imagine there is something to learn. I wonder more about how the film does, not what it does. Maybe it's wrong about me. Smarter, but more difficult than deconstructing an unpleasant cinema, can be seeing the cuts, pans, and the like in one and integral way, no matter what the content. I ask myself what the horror filmmakers and church architects are. Add to political filmmakers, fascists and not. Everyone manipulates light, space and sound to change perception and mood. How different are their goals? How different are the goals of the goals of filming true atrocities used as propaganda? <br /> <br /> When the original All Night Long (ANL) trilogy appeared on my shelf, I missed it for almost a year. Curiosity made me buy it. I chose a few minutes "1" from the day it arrived until the corner of the uncomfortable sound of the street, which really seems like an attack on the sensitivity of the film's viewers, it was wrong, but effective. I must definitely come back to this, but I did not rejoice in this prospect. It was obviously not Cairo, Cure, Angel Dust, Lain, raw, but traditionally Kodi Wakamatsu openly political work or even the early Cronenberg brilliant shepherd. br /> <br /> Perhaps this is the key word for attack. Matsumura attacks not his characters but his spectators. I can't look at them historically without thinking of both Abu Garib (some of whom I think I remember the video) as well as hostage videos, but also Godard's tormentors (Le Petit soldier?), To whom cruelty is just work, a fraction of a man's workday. And then there's the long-lasting news of North California, the details of which I can hardly remember but cannot be completely forgotten, because it also means "cinema", a serial number duo that is infamous if the recommendation doesn't play games with memory to record the video of torture. <br /> <br /> All three ANL records are a revenge cinema, vigilant exercises, but I add these comments to ANL3 because it is the most ambitious and can be a turning point for director Matsumura. (I haven't seen any post-ANL3 records.) Through the first two bids, I imagined that the camera fell from one middle or high school child who obsessed with war scenes or other cruelty. (Or, if one of Matsumura's vengeance from screaming characters had become a writer-director. Anyone who watches them, who has not seen Michael Powell's Peeping Tom, would see it well.) But ANL3 seems to strive for the mainstream. The main character of Matsumura grows carnivorous plants, allowing some typical Japanese cool close-ups. For the first time, Matsumura's film, traditionally an erotic series: Kikuo's female boss slips and begins to love her when she loves hotel customers. Kikou finds herself unhappy. He's a mediator voyeur. Short excitement comes from the layers of voyeurism. There's even a philosophical / poetic trash bin, a garbage voyeur who makes me think of Wakamatsu's non-at-all-what-it-sound-eligible poem, Go, Go, Secondtime Virgin. <br /> <br /> I can't get it anywhere and it's going to be commenting on my movies. I can't escape the suspicion that a few years after Matsumura retrospectively went to the local film archives, maybe some of the trained character who had been missing something I was missing was hosted. <br /> <br /> How much does it matter whether the director is or just "gets" his deadly messy protagonists? Does he even have to understand them? Perhaps the director's task is simply to crowd out, then let the critics, sociologists and the rest of us get things out. Perhaps conductor or artistic responsibility is a fake term. <br /> <br /> My last struggle with this thing was to think of what a woman thinks of being overwhelmingly looking at male exercises. We put the women over and over again, from Star Wars to cetera and et cetera, and on and on, but there is something that is both male and all night long?
