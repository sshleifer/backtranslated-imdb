The Variety Reviewer said it was "overwritten and long-lasting" and I agree. There are some events that seem to be forced and unlikely, such as when Cal (Crudup again as a "lost, free and annoying" man) and Julianne Moore find the US map in an incredible place. The story is one of those 1970s "boy has to find meaning in his life" and I found myself imagining Jack Nicholson in his main game. The whole "journey to find the meaning of life" is still interesting. Does it really bring back the family? I was not so sure. Action is okay, especially I liked Karen Allen and James LeGross, who unfortunately have only supporting roles. I'd give her a "five".
