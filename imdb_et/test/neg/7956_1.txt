Deepa Mehta, Arundhati Roy, and many other so-called intellectuals receive the title of intellectuals because they love to portray India and Hinduism in a bad light ... and Deepa Mehta makes it anyway. In any case, the Hindus are too fragile or scared to protest how Muslims protest, so that someone can be free with Hinduism. And it is true that, in the 1930s, widows' wives had also worked without widows ... just that no one wants anything wrong in the West or anything other than India and prices. He paints the right image of India and the situation of widows there. It has not been mentioned anywhere that the marriage of children is illegal. He finished the movie saying that there are 34 million widows in India. Of course, there are so many widows among a billion people. But how much is alive in life, what has he shown in the film? Finally, Deepa Mehta sells India and poverty to make dollars. How pathetic.
