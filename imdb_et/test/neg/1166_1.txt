When "Deranged" was made, the filmmakers saw that Ed Gein became Ezra Cobbi, although the film he received was actually near the facts of the case. I assume that it was fancy enough to think they should change names and such. <br /> <br /> "Ed Gein - Plainfield Butcher" masks like the real story of the Gein case, but in fact he has very little similar history. It's a travesty as a biological film. If ever the names of a movie were to be needed, it would be much more than "Deranged". This is the true story of a crime like "Dirty Harry" was a real story of Zodiac killings. <br /> <br /> OK, so this annoyance aside from how it is a horror movie? Well, as a horror movie, it is quite terrible as a film. One of the worst films I've been sitting on for months. Problems therefore go: 1) Kane Hodder is quite puzzling when Ed Gein. Partially inappropriate, Hodder just lumbers through glowinging intimidatingly. Very bad. <br /> <br /> 2) Kane Hodder is the best actor in the movie! The rest of the majority is "amateur statistics" and totally open. It is painful to witness some line delivery. <br /> <br /> 3) It seems that the effort to make a stylish film from time to time comes from the "Great Moody Movie Letter". You've seen it before, the better. In addition to the efforts made in style, making the rest of the movies is largely unfair: the cameras shake, framing is bad, there are surpluses of meaningless shots that keep the pace ... which leads me ... <br /> continues forever. It's less than 90 minutes long, but it's going to be a challenge. You would swear that it ran for two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> 5) Ed Gein seems almost secondary. In most cases, the film concerns the family affairs of the newly promoted Sheriff. This deputy is played by a grueling actor, whose shoulders should not rest on the film. <br /> <br /> Is it good? Well, Gore FX is very good. Some convincing wounds are shown and make-up is generally great. None of this reflects the massive shortcomings of the film. <br /> <br /> It's not even chip value, it's just bad; is not pleasantly bad, not "so bad it is good", just really bad. A film that avoids and despises.
