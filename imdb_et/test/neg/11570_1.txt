I like JAG. It has a charm, but lately it has a lot of propaganda. For an external (non-American), the patriotic feeling may be a bit. <br /> <br /> I don't like Rabb and MacKenzie as lawyers (as they were in previous parts of the TV) to become a super hero that stops wars and rescues the continent. It's almost like watching a US military recruitment video. <br /> <br /> I'm still looking at the show so it's not so bad. But I prefer more episodes when Rabb and MacKenzie investigate military accidents and don't save the world in the future.
