Really, I also love Lucy ... comedy genius yes ..... MAME ... NOT ... she was as ridiculous as Mame ... as well as the cinematic adaptation of the divine secrets of the Ya Ya sister. Both just missed the point. Roslind Russell was, is and always is the first and only Mame. Perhaps as a young star, Ball could have pulled out such a role where his natural beauty and young people could have taken him ... but it seemed like a desperate attempt to show that he was still viable in this area. The reason is that there are a lot more supporters of the Russell version (besides the fact that you can't fix it in the first place), that Russell had a presence, he swallowed every scene, while Lucille Ball could also be a wallpaper for Mame. all the attention he draws in this role.
