The most famous thing about this movie is that it was the first time Garbo was talking on the film. In addition to this "milestone" (if you want to name it), this is a film that does not go beyond the maddening melodrama. Garbo is trying his best to not fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Greta Garbo has returned to the plot after 15 years abroad. His father, the captain of the ferry, sees him with joy, though he is a bit harsh. Soon he will fall in love with a beloved sailor who also notices that something, as an obstacle, keeps him back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, these two companions do not like each other very much, and soon they will be blowing over Garbo if it dispels the situation, revealing its great secret that is not surprising when you read the video box (damn MGM !! ). Garbo is nothing more than a weapon in this movie, he acts and acts to loot his hand and quickly get grabbed. Two male cases are fine. Probably the best performance by the classical silent actress Marie Dressler, who plays the drunken captain even drunk girlfriend. What a show! It's too bad if the tagline couldn't read, "Dressler Talks!"
