When they drive home on the beach, four young people seek refuge at Lord's and Lady Alexander's home after their car runs out. They do not know it, but the house they are in is a place of satanic ritual. Jane (Camille Keaton), the only group woman, has to be sacrificed. When her male companions help, one of them accidentally kills Lady Alexander. Things are really out of hand and everyone else involved in the black mass is also killed. These four are trying to escape, but soon discover that there is no escape from what they have seen. They meet their fates one by one. <br /> <br /> I was a tragic ceremony, I was positive when I enjoyed it. Slow burning gothic horror is just my alley. I'm also quite fond of some of Riccardo Freda's other films such as The Horrible Dr Hichcock, The Ghost and I Vampire. The tragic ceremony seemed a sure thing. Unfortunately, things do not always work as they should. The biggest tragedy with the tragic ceremony is the time I look at this movie. With some few exceptions, I didn't give me anything about the film or worked for me. The characters are unlikely, the plot is inconsistent and schizophrenic, and the pace is terrible. There's a sub-block of some cursed pearls that go somewhere further and just mix things up. In addition, most movies do not feature anything interesting. By the time the four leaders realized they were in danger, I was out of the place of care. And I do not understand the stories I have read to praise Camille Keaton's activities. I think this is a terrible performance if you think you are unfamiliar. Three male cases are a non-descriptive definition. They do nothing to stand out. Supportive casting includes some genre favorites like Luigi Pistilli, Luciana Paluzzi, and Paul Muller, but none of them do anything. In fact, Muller's main contribution at the end of the film is a two-minute monologue that tries to explain what happened in the last 80 minutes. It is a weak attempt to provide very weak film packaging.
