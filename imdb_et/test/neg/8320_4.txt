Brave One shows that the main character is of course bold. I disagree. What's more daring to do in a situation like what happens to his brutally beaten with his fiancé who does not live the second day of it is to go to the criminals without using the full distorted view of society. The character of Jodie Foster, Erica, is a radio personality who is a niche in the streets and saves what's going on. We do not give any real depth to it because he was someone he loved, he died, the police did not continue, he gets a weapon, yada-yada-yada, he gets somewhat, but not in reality with a leading detective. character, and so were left with nothing left in the past movies: vigilante justice code, where power in their own hands is all there. But we are never sure if Erica is reasonable or not, when filmmakers take their position in one way or another (that is to the end, which is such a stupid message to be taken anyway, a dog with the accompanying metaphor). Today's New York City, which has become significantly safer than, say, 20 years ago, looks like you get a cord or beaten when you go to the right alley or just sit alone on a subway ride. <br /> There may even be a somewhat better movie in the middle of it - maybe in a malnourished subheading with a Terence Howard detective who is involved with child care, who is not her and a woman who is not affiliated and a father-father who I don't know What is next to the parking spaces and what is a bad guy, but we are left with a script that is scattered and logical. For example, it will be ridiculous if you see that Erica's logical side cannot really shoot properly, as can be seen in her first shooting in a nearby shop, when her husband's robbery is expedient and then giving way to his illogical blow when he shot a pimp who drives the car and killed she and just sucked in at the right time to not go over. It doesn't help that the Jordan style of the camera gets a little more effortless: it's called sted-cam *, not because it can knit in and out. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the script and the direction become very good, or rather work in the best possible way under the desired conditions: when you look at the actual beating scene under the bridge, which remains at a pace between one criminal video footage and a totally inconsistent one. And when Erica returns to her radio show for the first time and freezes in an attempt to make her old shtick and talks “heartily” about how she fears she is - this scene from Foster's results until the clear direction and script is the best scene in the movie. But besides, there is only a lot of posting in psychology that is thin: is he a De Niro taxi driver or Bronson died? We have stories about scenes, some of them do not have to do at all in their radio broadcasts, watching how they are walking around at night, doing nothing, but their own task of cleaning the streets. But unlike the Death Wish, a film that found more vagueness and never held a response to the revenge scenario, endless violence is only a message that is not news for anyone who has seen another lifetime of melodrama. <br /> <br /> Participants will do what is given, and eventually it will become much more depressing, trying to stay awaited, hackneyed plots and the usual old inexplicable (plus inadvertently fun, like some couples called Howard called after one scene) and the temptation to step out is growing stronger and stronger. This is a very problematic picture with only a few moments of real interests and explicit meetings.
