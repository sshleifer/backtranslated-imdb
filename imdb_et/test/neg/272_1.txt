Just like most people, I couldn't wait to see this ocean sequel, but it's really smelly, I have to say. It stinks because there is not just a good scenario, it was just cheap. I hope that the producers will donate all the money that this film has made (or is doing) to Asian Asian tsunami victims for at least one good reason. It's so bad that I can't even write a proper comment on it, but .... I suggest that the creators of this thing make "ocean 13". Ocean 13 is about the same thieves trying to steal a hidden scenario somewhere in Hollywood. A 13th member is a writer of a foreign (perhaps, Russian) scenario who knows all the tricks to write a copy of this well-hidden scenario so they can replace the original. Or they have to find at least 13 people to write a proper scenario about a movie in which not only Julia Roberts plays herself, but also all other stars in the ocean. 13 People, because it is the happy number of Andy Garcia's character.
