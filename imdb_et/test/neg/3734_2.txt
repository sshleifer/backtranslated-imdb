For the first time I saw this movie with this cute girl. we had fun laughing and generally fun. So my impression was that it was terrible but traceable to the value of the cheese. Then we watched the video together again during our anniversary. As it turns out, the film is just terrible and invisible. It's amazing how cute girls can change the look of the world.
