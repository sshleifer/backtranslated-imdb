This movie is a bit more than ersatz Verhoeven. Filming should be tele-realistic, but just sick. The parody disappears after about 15 minutes to replace the story that seems to have taken a serious look. A brutal break in non-existent advertising brakes is annoying and even painful; undoubtedly there was no real intention to change Brechtian, but it was an accident. If you want to see a parody of reality TV, see Celebrity DeathMatch - it's funny and wittier and most importantly, it's shorter. I've rarely felt so much pain when watching a movie. Avoid rabies like rabies.
