I want to say that I like this movie, I really do, but when it comes down, it was just too boring. It starts to look promising, and even when they enter the mines, the creepy atmosphere and mood are great. The problem is the monster or its absence. Because people have said it is a stop-motion monster, but it's not a problem (stop-motion can be properly reviewed). The problem is that we don't see enough of it and we don't see death. It is meant to be a horror film, so the absence of a monster and the lack of death equals boredom. I liked some scenes, such as when one girl uses her camera in the dark and the monster is at her. There are also some other horrible scenes, but they are too few to keep their interest and certainly not the movie. It is a shame, because I see that if it had been properly handled, it would have been very scary. The saddest thing is that such movies are never done anymore because filmmakers are moving their films over these days and relying on CGI.
