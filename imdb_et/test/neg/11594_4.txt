It is like a zoology textbook, given that the depiction of the animals is so precise. However, here are some details that have changed a bit during the transition to the film: <br /> <br /> - The gun hours never hit the giant Komodo dragon. It doesn't matter how many times you comode you shoot, the balls just don't. <br /> <br /> - The best way to avoid eating a giant Cobra or giant Komodo dragon is to stand there. The exception to this rule is when you are told to stay very long, in which case you should go away until Komodo is next to you and then you should stand there waiting for a defeat. <br /> <br /> - Blind slow footage protocols behind credits make for a truly enjoyable viewing experience. <br /> <br /> - $ 5,000 is a memory enhancement tool and a great substitute to lose your boat ride / get detained. > <br /> - The members of the Elite Army units do not see the gigantic Komodo dragon until they are one meter away from excess creatures. Perhaps the computer-based nature of these dragons is related to it. <br /> <br /> - When filming a newsletter for illegal animal testing, one camera reporter and operator has all the equipment and staff you need; sound gear, second camera, microphones, etc. are all superfluous. <br /> <br /> - If you hear a white animal victim and one person with a gun, he should take it out and direct it to the nearest person. <br /> <br /> - If you take out a weapon, the sound of safe safety will be taken down, even if your finger is not close to safety. <br /> <br /> - The rapporteurs agree to go to the side to uncover something - without the slight idea of ​​what they are revealing. Background research and vague knowledge are out of fashion in today's press. <br /> <br /> - Handguns hold at least 52 stars with a single clip and then more than the next clip. Nonetheless, they claim that people with weapons need more AMMO. <br /> <br /> - Precious cameras (also remember that the reporter has only one camera). These cameras are capable of amazingly returning to their reporter. <br /> <br /> - The blonde girl is really stupid. <br /> <br /> - The same girl who doesn't say Go to the house because the Komodo dragon can easily pass through, making it a dangerous one, taking the same material to protect the crew - and nobody is talking about it. <br /> <br /> - High-tech facilities look like simple offices with high school chemistry kits. <br /> <br /> - Genetically modified snakes grow up to 100 feet in normal size over a long period of time, but don't grow at all on either side for weeks. <br /> <br /> - The army is destroying the entire island as usual when people don't meet the deadlines for contacts. <br /> <br /> - Arms men may not necessarily change their direction to shoot if their target is no longer right in front of them. Instead, they just stay in the air. <br /> <br /> - The better you are, the greater your chance of living giant creatures. <br /> <br /> - Women's intuition is reliable enough to make even the most stubborn minds. <br /> <br /> - Every time giant creatures hunt it, it's a great time to hit the girls half of their age. <br /> <br /> - Animal noise is appropriate to "rub" the same volume of masking noise. <br /> <br /> - US military regularly uses old Israeli and Russian aircraft.
