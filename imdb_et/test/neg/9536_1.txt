Wow! After the first five minutes of watching this "movie", I was tempted to put a bullet in my brain and finish my life. It's really hard to describe what this movie is about. I really don't know what a person would even be to finance stools. The film looks like a video or 16mm. I usually have no problems with SOV movies, 16 times, but it was just so terrible. And where did they find these "actors"? I've seen some bad behavior, but it takes a cake. See the first 5 minutes and see what I mean. BCI entertainment should be boycotted to spread this godly spread. It must be the worst film I've ever seen. I want my 74 minutes ago! If you can sit in the first 5 minutes without taking a picture of the TV or doing massive killing, then give the picture. After all, what do you have to lose?
