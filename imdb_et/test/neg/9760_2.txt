The writer-director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless theme - friendship - and makes it a flat and meaningless farce, despite the A-list actors, fine cinematography and elegant production design. It's all on the plot and the plot is ridiculous. "Teach me how to be pleasant," says François Coste, an art salesman (Daniel Auteuil), at a random stranger (Dany Boon) and this is a summary. We do not learn anything about friendship, and Daniel Auteuil may be a good actor, but not one minute he thinks he could be a fucking egoist that the script depends on him. Just as we hope that comfort has come to an end, Leconte pulls the third act of one of his usual collars, moving fast from the accident. Like François's valuable Greek vase, everything and everything in this movie is fake. Leconte's only asset is Julie Gayet's part of Coste's business partner, Catherine, looking at beating and sex, despite a big discount.
