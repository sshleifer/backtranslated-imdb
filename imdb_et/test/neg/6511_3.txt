Imagine if you see an alternative universe where someone has made SEVEN, where they have led a politically aware environmentalist and a comedian instead of a talented cast and team. If your imagination doesn't go so far, look at GLIMMER MAN because it's the next worse thing. <br /> <br /> !!!! Jack Cole is a policeman who has a hidden past and it is very ironic that he is played by Steven Seagal, because he is also someone who hides a hidden past, but doesn't tell anyone because it is secret. Perhaps the biggest secret is how someone, like Seagal, became the first filmmaker since GLIMMER MAN continues in the vein of all other Seagal films because it is completely obedient. See how he introduced when his partner walks to his office "Yoi love beads man. You're in the wrong office" Steven responds to something that is sideways funny, or he would be if someone could understand the bloody word he said mumbles. In fact, the only time I was able to put my dialogue out was the school scene where he shattered the classroom hostage. <br /> <br /> "Don't kill me" <br /> <br /> Does the policeman say to a suicide gunman? I just mean, in another movie, where Steven is not a hero (ie a good movie), the policeman says, "Don't kill me, I have a wife and a couple of kids waiting for" at home. So head off the suicide head, but Steven saves his life by shrinking them with both windows. It goes without saying that you shouldn't try it at home. <br /> <br /> When the story goes to Steven (I've given up calling him to Jack, though credit to the screen writer to give Steven a reasonable name) , the involved case becomes a plagiarism where someone has stolen the bits from other higher films that have sequential killers. As Steven finds more victims, you see him thinking, "What was that movie that played Morgan Freeman as a policeman?" oh and the action goes back to the hero's home life so we know this guy is a good family member, this guy is a very good family member because he's so bad he's a movie star
