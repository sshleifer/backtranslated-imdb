Jeff Speakman has never done it from the lowest levels of martial arts-artists-actors (such as Don "The Dragon" Wilson) and vehicles like "Expert", so you can see why. There are three main problems with this movie: 1) The plot - or should I say plots - is all over the place, there are some characters that get a lot of screen time, but they serve little purpose; 2) There are only 4 fighting scenes, some of them are not fully connected to the main plot and some are dark, 3) The music score is overflowing and overflowing. Oddly enough, it may seem like it's really the most annoying thing in this movie: the score is trying to persuade you convincingly that you're looking at some great epic, rather than watching a low-budget movie. All that is said is at least James Brolin to give credibility. * 1/2 of 4.
