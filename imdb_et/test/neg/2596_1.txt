It's a shame that so many people love a family man because it's just one of the worst TV shows, there are lots of points. Returns: Seasons 1 and 2, which I thought were extraordinary, the setbacks were quite frequent and actually somewhat related to what the plot was and was even funny. Now in season 4 and beyond, kickback s is even more common and have nothing to do with the plot, not funny and really long, boring and pointless. Family Guy thinks that a long drag scene that doesn't go anywhere is funny when in fact it's poor writing. How funny can it be? This is not. His character is so unstable that it is incredible. Remember, at first, when Stewie was in control of the whole world and killing Lois. Now he just has a scene that is clumsy with Brian. From the desire for the world to dominate as gay = bad writing. <br /> <br /> Links: How can they make 80's TV shows or events bad? Well they just use the same old garbage. You know, in 20 years, hopefully, the family member will be canceled when they still make jokes in the 80s, more important than before. Because it's forgotten. It still keeps me interested in why they can't just write good episodes with quality jokes. Seth McFarlene should just concentrate on writing his dirty episodes and ending voting. All the already bad additions to Family Guy episodes sound the same. Simpsons get 6 or 7 people to make all the votes. Some of them are about 15-20 characters ... everything sounds very different. But why can't Family Guy do that? Oh right, it's a messy show. get a cheap laugh. I can't believe that Family Guy can't even talk normally so people laugh at their jokes. but they really fall every time. Go watch South Park ... <br /> <br /> Terrible plots: Plots and story are just the perfect trash. Simpsons has started their 20th anniversary when they have better plots than Family Guy. Approximately 8 or 9 minutes have setbacks and scenes that are irrelevant. Popularity Many young children have Stewie shirts and I think he's so funny when they don't even get terribly written sex jokes. They just say, "oh, ha ha, stewie!" if they don't even get it. The Family Guy has been canceled twice and brought back by DVD sales when it's sad. The first time I think after the 2nd or 3rd season, and I honestly believe they should cancel it. then these episodes were great, they should remain high notes. <br /> <br /> Drag and drop scenes Here are scenes that move too long. One that spoke just last Sunday went to Peter's board, where about 2 minutes was spent on the introductory miracle of the Jurassic Park, and the plot of this episode was also stolen from the Seinfeld episode. There is also a scene where Chris works in the shop and talks to the employee about a movie that has been beaten for about 5 minutes. CHICKEN FIGHTS IS SOUP, of which 3, each of them longer than the last. meaningless writing, thinking that people enjoy a long scene of repetition, between chicken, and chicken. Now, every time someone falls off, and by the way, NO FAMILY GUY FAN can't say that every time they fall, it's shared within seconds and they always let their hands over their back to make them funny. I think it has been used at least 30 times. <br /> <br /> Herman Oh jeez, everyone thinks that the old pedophile is so funny if it's just a really bad running gag. they have even passed the length, giving him song scenes (which are very poor) and relying on ENTIRE episodes around him, they have done the same thing with other characters, like a doctor I know around his episode <br /> > Simpsons Well, there are not many explanations here. There is so much evidence that the Family man steals the Simpson jokes. How a family man is just a poor man in the Simpsons. <br /> <br /> So I'm sure I've forgotten some key points somewhere, but I'm sure it's enough to prove that a family man is really a terrible, terribly written TV show that everyone seems to be love if they really should look at Simpson, Seinfeld and Frasier.
