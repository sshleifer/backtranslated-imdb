It's really nervous. The honor of firefighters is that it contains "my goodness, which can be very dangerous" in parts, "just a lot of crazy guys say". For the most part, it's just plain. You couldn't believe for one minute that the real firefighters were doing that. It's so terrible that I couldn't look at it at times. If my daughter hadn't leased it, and then demanded it to finish, I would have had no choice but to turn it off. The thing is, I'm a fan of John Travolta. Each of his interviews I have seen raises my opinion. I think it was just for money. I'm sure he'll be happy when he's forgotten.
