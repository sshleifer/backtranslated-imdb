I'm sorry. This whole movie didn't make any sense. It was like watching a Soderburg movie for football. Camera cutting, pace, everything so copied. I thought this topic wasn't too serious for them to treat this kind of thing. Yes, we all know that southern like football and beauty competitions. Do we have to flood this audience? I looked at Lee and Jay. I had been waiting for young talents to be gathered in the style of the Dead Poet's Society or like Titans. I finished the movie completely. You didn't get any signs. It was a character, but you didn't usually understand someone's motivation or their actions. One child who is a mother is obsessed with being a football player. Why is he so quiet? What is his thing? Did we really need a heterosexual scene with him? Why should we care? The film gave us an overview of these children and does not take care of the reward. It's not just a point. <br /> <br /> And why show a movie from a lost team? I know it's a real life, but who makes movies of losers? Give us some paid amounts for the boys who work as hard as all their "imaginable" problems, darnit. We have nothing. At the end of the movie, we got a little bit of a hit saying Mojo won 3rd string (Lee) next year. Why didn't you follow that story? What did we get out of it? The film drove you along but didn't take you anywhere. I just felt like something was missing. It seemed like a bad genetic cross between Varsity Blues and Remember Titans. At least these two films took you somewhere. Friday Night Lights was about a losing team who lost his movie at the start of his stadium. The actor who played her was great. He was completely annoyed by him, which was the idea, but at least you realized why. They made sure you understood him, but he couldn't play, so why do we make sure we get his problems? <br /> <br /> And another team on the playground ... do we believe they are high school teens? These men saw college seniors or professional players in their 30s. Who did they catch the boy? I know the other team had to threaten, but it was just over the line. I liked the sharp element with these black teams, but again how it fit into the overall theme of the movie. Nothing is different. The characters knew each other more than we did, and that lives with me strangely. Jay's characters had nothing to add, but he was shown. It was just a mess. Not worth a movie ticket or rental fee.
