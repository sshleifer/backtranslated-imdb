I absolutely hated this movie! I was 9 years old when I saw it. This is the only movie I've ever been to the theater. My mother, father and I were watching each other during the movie and we knew we were wasting our time. This movie stole about 45 minutes of my life. All of this was ridiculous. The whole assumption was too twisted. Being 9 years old, I was always easy to entertain. This movie proved that I couldn't do anything about myself and still attract it.
