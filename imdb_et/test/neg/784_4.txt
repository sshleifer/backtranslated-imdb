First of all. Will Cameron Diaz ever be allowed to act again? To say that poor performance would be offensive to bad performance. It was a historically terrible force. Any little probability that Diazil was a serious actor is completely ready after that. Cheerfully terrible. <br /> <br /> Two movies were very boring and not at all thought. I can sit back and think about the human nature without terrible actors, playing a terrible story. Third, there was no pleasant character, and worse, it seemed to be the design. You didn't have to like anyone or feel compassion for any character. It was quite effective. I wanted everyone to die honestly. Foreigners are involved. Kid comes with. Everyone in this movie was one big mope. Anyone who literally just moped and called it a movie. You could hardly distinguish zombie "workers" from ordinary people because they all seemed like zombies. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is really no point. From character reactions and emotions to a straight line of words, it's all just random. It's just a really bad film that is hidden and hidden as a "thinker movie" that is meant to be confusing. Leave me alone. A bad movie is a bad movie. And this movie was bad.
