it could have been better, but it was okay ... it helped me go away. I didn't even want to see it, the only reason I wanted to rent it was because Jamie Martz is in this ... is an unknown actor, but she looks and is highlighting the movie ... the end was so terrible and the actress was good for the film. .. I'll give him 4 out of 10
