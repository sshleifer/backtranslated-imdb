Honestly, the only reason I pulled this movie out of Blockbuster was because Aaron Carter was in it. Be the first thing. Do you notice how ugly Aaron Carter has changed? I thought he was so cute, but now ... with that hard body and brown skin - EW. I think he should sing and the film's leaders would have found a much better looking boy who could sync his lips. There is no offense. I thought that this teenage movie was to a large extent flat - and it has come from me, making myself. "Girls' average" is oh-so predictable, acting so amateurish that it often drives you (especially Aaron) and I just didn't enjoy it at all. Although I give points to the story, it was fine, but not at all realistic. Anyway, stay away from this movie with everything you can do if you don't have the money of your hands and you don't have anything better with 94 minutes. It's not worth $ 6.50 !! <br /> <br /> (P.S; this review may not be applicable to younger children under the age of 13!)
