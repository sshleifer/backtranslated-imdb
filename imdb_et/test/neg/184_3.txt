This movie is not like God's city, you could get the same feeling, but it is not, there is no intense shooting or intense drug scenes, you get that idea. If you ask me to think that this movie was a waste of time, there are many other films that give you 100 times better meaning and lessons than the "Wooden Camera". Yes, I can be the only one who gives a negative comment on this movie, but that's just my opinion. This is one of those movies where I get the feeling that I am bouncing, but when the credit goes to my friends and we all gave each other, and we all laughed when that movie was ridiculous. So to end this question I suggest not to look at it. <br /> <br /> Personal note - It was a big mistake to speak English to Africans. In the city of God, they used their mother tongue, which gave the film much more power and reality.
