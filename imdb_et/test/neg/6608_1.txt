Brodzki's creation is a great example of how not to film. First of all, there was a book written with great humor. A book that has many fans who would be happy to help if manufacturers for some reason decided to hire people who barely heard about the book. Then the script came as humorous as possible and complete. At the same time, the script was written in a way that allowed only those who actually read the books to understand something about the plot. Not to make any sense in this film (eg "I'm like a glacier. You can burn yourself", Yennefer said as a warning word - warns that logic is something that this film is seriously touching). To add that we have to mention that no matter how much money that was supposed to be spent on the film, it seems to be an amateur production with two (2) computer effects, one of which is a penetrating dragon. Even costumes look like they were borrowed from a really poor theater. It's so better. And add that we have only a few "naked scenes" that are only placed to be in the movie because they have no explanation of what can graciously call the plot. The film has only one strength that can hardly be compensated - music is not bad. Although I'd like to choose, I'd prefer it separately. It sounds better if you don't have to look at this super production failure.
