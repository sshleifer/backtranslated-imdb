Ealing's comedies form a specific sub-genre in the film's history. They were tough, fine reflections of British life in the late forties and early fifties. They are always amusing, but I think it is misleading to characterize them as comedies. They are windy and good-natured, not ridiculous funny. Best of all, they are gently sewn with satire and through a random dark stripe (especially Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Ladykillers). <br /> <br /> I have a fondness for all of them, but Lavender Hill Mob is probably the hardest. Compared to others, it seems somewhat uncomfortable. For me, this is a sketch of the film, but what had to be done before the cameras were ready was a lot more time to develop. <br /> <br /> All of this is a little malnourished. For example, no one gives the actual context or background. Henry is just a conscientious drudge whose secret dreams and hidden ambitions do not recognize, while Albert is a frustrated artist who is forced to give his talent to a prostitute, making life of gift bags. It causes their crime motive, but something that happens later is not the result of their characters or plan. <br /> <br /> Other characters are introduced, but there is no real part in the game. The elderly in the Henry guesthouse could (in their love of detective stories) be an involuntary thorn on their side, but it is only used as a background color. Likewise, the various police officers who come in and out of the event are just to keep the plot labeled. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film is completely guided by its drawn schematic devices, which I find both depressing and weakly irritating. Non-very brilliant robbery is achieved with minimal problems, despite the fact that Albert was unable to fulfill his role in the plan (Sidney Tafler Clayton). Gold is then smuggled into France without an accident. Everything would have gone smoothly, if it were not gradual, flatly based on the French-speaking pronunciation of the R-letter, resulting in the sale of six gold from the Eiffel Tower to some English schoolgirls. <br /> <br /> This leads to a number of tricky references, as Henry and Albert try to download them. These scenes are well executed, but at every point, the conspirators are disappointed when they deal with schoolgirls with a series of factual accidents. Just as God has deliberately intervened to give them a difficult time. Such drawing is always grinding my teeth. <br /> <br /> When they finally observe the last Eiffel Tower at the police academy exhibition and grab this nose from John Gregson's police inspector (why is he there anyway?) all the logic of the parcels has been abandoned. The final cars then simply fill the screen until we return to the framing device with which the image started. <br /> <br /> The film doesn't even bother to say Albert's fate (Stanley Holloway), Lackery (Sid James) and Shorty (Alfie Bass). <br /> <br /> This brilliant little caper is the professionalism behind Ealing's team, so it's not a bad movie. I suspect that most viewers find it much more enjoyable than I do (and why not?), But I can't think that a much better film is expected than the characters and the story have spent more time and effort. <br /> <br /> According to the standards set by Ealing, Lavender Hill Mob is a forgotten opportunity. <br /> <br /> PS: One curious footnote is that Audrey Hepburn gets credit for one line early on, but Archie Duncan remains anonymous, despite her much bigger contribution. I think he just had a better agent.
