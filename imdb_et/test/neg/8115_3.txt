Although it is dreadfully dated, I have to insist ... PLEASE DO NOT! Frankly, it just doesn't help, because something that could be added or changed would be better in history. <br /> <br /> The novel on which it was based was an atmospheric, well-written, truly spooky work, but it did not translate on the film. Most King's masterpieces cannot translate a movie. I'm not sure why this is so, but when you look at this work, you will probably see what I mean. <br /> <br /> The Book? It's wonderful. It's not a masterpiece, but it's more than just fun. <br /> <br /> Film? Do something else. Later you can thank me. <br /> <br /> This price is 3.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
