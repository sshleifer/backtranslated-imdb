Six months after high school sprinter Laura dies on race, the killer starts murdering the rest of the team using different sports equipment as a weapon: this is the beginning of the 80s, an insecure addition to the genre that offers very few styles, originality or proper gore. <br /> <br /> But what it does is some amazingly horrifying musical differences, some familiar faces (including the early appearance of laughs) Linnea Quigley) and nudity (any prerequisite for a slaher movie). <br /> <br /> So forget about death scenes, they're flat and pretty bloodless ?? and instead the captivating elements of the film are more memorable: fast editing that can cause migraine and epileptic seizures; a roller-disco, accompanied by a long hard rock song "Gangster Rock" by unforgettably horrific Felony; expressive mixing session for school students; Christopher George grabs Michaels, the coach of this major red herring; and a cheesy music teacher who, after his female students (who for some reason consider him quite irresistible?!?!). <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, the action will rise slightly, with the discovery of killed bodies under bleaches, and a rather twisted scene that includes Laura's body in her hat and dress, but all this is that this movie is recorded from mediocrity.
