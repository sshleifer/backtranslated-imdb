After seeing the film in my classroom and talking to the filmmaker, I learned why the film was bombarded the way it did. The film's creators did not intend to call "8MM 2". Originally named "Hell Velvet Side", Sony Pictures changed the last minute to 8MM without having to say anything about the film. In doing so, she spun out of theatrical publications and executed this minimal advertising directly into a video publication. <br /> <br /> Again, this is the filmmaker's mouth, not mine, so I really can't say what the truth is and what is a leap. <br /> <br /> If you watch a movie like "Velvet Side of Hell", it's not bad. It's not great, but it's not godly terrible. This would be basically just a B movie that likes to show your breasts. However, if the extension to 8MM, the film will not be scary.
