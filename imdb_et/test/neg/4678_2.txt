Bad Company's biggest hit album name is "10 From 6". You could have just shown this album and cut the sound of this movie. Most of the songs played in the movie were from this album. I think the parents of the 1970s were tired of all the 1930s and 1940s. That's how I feel about films from the 1970s. The film's characters saw that they were listening to Danny Terrio. Why is it that films have been overstepping since the 1970s. The only good time I liked was "Freaks and Geeks". They cut this TV show. It was exactly the same thing as in high school when I was back in 1980. I was old enough to remember the 70s and no small town was like that. It was entirely dominated by young people. No reagent talked about hippies or the inner city of Philli. It was more than the 70s I remember as a baby. This movie was very boring and cheesy. Sometimes I slept. I don't know why an actor in the 70s appeared in it. He probably tried to give it credibility. Walken didn't even show in the second half. I think the only real thing about the movie was the "baby boom generation" that was a corrupted batch. All the children on the film were a broken brats. I don't know what they had for their father.
