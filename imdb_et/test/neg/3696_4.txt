I was interested in seeing it, because it was called the worst film featuring British periodicals dedicated to sci-fi cinema from the early 1980s, entitled "The Movie" (also the unique BOMB rating). When a DVD was released last year, I had to buy the Cult Camp Classics box where it was added (with OUTER SPACE queen (1958) and THE GIANT BEHEMOTH (1959); having recently acquired the QUEEN DVD Rl, I had paid for this idea. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I have just turned on a DivX movie, but printing wasn't killed by the Warners DVD (which says a surprisingly pleasant look), but rather a muddy TV editionâ€¦ though not so much that the detail is gone (in other words, it was like watching a movie in sepia, not black and white!) anyway, in order to get to the point: I have to admit that in some ways I was disappointed that the movie didn't turn out to be a laughing competition I was always waiting (Maltin calls it "awful"), in fact, I found it quite interesting - and fortunately a little over an hour. Some undoubtedly entertaining bits remain - like when the old sister starts her head in the eyes of a 50-meter woman yelling, and k The sheriff's deputy almost runs over his commander and leading wife butler to help his enthusiasm in such an unusual case. Also, the special effects didn't hit me between the "funeral" (Maltin) movie - though they're definitely embarrassing! <br /> <br /> OK, so the idea that an alien (in a gigantic human form knitted with cave-man rags and radioactive starts!) arrives with a large spherical (!) spacecraft on Earth and probably after the heroine's precious necklaces is completely pointless - and its almost transparent appearance does not make any difference at all ... but in fact it is a human story that keeps our attention (relatively). The nature of the film owner's spouse is not very interesting, but her two women are: rich but harsh spirits Allison Hayes and an ambitious, sexy girlfriend, Yvette Vickers. The narrative is also involved in Hayes' faithful servant (already mentioned), a few police officers (one of them, as noted elsewhere, being quite funny) and so many doctors (one of whom is called Dr. Cushing [!] And another specialist who is invited Hayes begins to grow after exposure to radiation.) <br /> <br /> Of course, the film can be seen as the opposite female version of the POSSIBLE FINISHING MAN (1957) - although it would not be fair to compare these two because Jack Arnold / Richard Matheson's classic approach is much more psychological / intellectual; in fact, Hayes does not seem to be bothered by his "state" and actually uses it to teach his wife a lesson! But his rash - an age-over-the-movie poster - is quite odd (especially given that it only takes place in the last ten minutes); if he did not show the damage caused by his enormous but very convincing hand (especially if it is a doll that should be his wife!), he will usually see that he is walking long and almost back (his size is even proportional to the buildings) ) she passes !! !! However, death caused by the power failure of Hayes (if it falls into an electric cable) is competently made. <br /> <br /> Finally, I followed it with my 1993 TV remake with Daryl Hannah as a title creator - which I specifically leased for this purpose.
