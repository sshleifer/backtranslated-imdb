I'm sorry, but it's the worst film I've ever seen in my life. I can't believe that, after the first series, they sent a budget to get another budget. Not that the budget could have been a lot - this is the most frightening film I've ever watched and laughed to the end (actually I can't believe we looked it up), but I think it's because we couldn't I do not believe it.
