When I was young, I brought up early every Saturday morning not to see cartoons, but to turn on the local channel for Kung Fu theater. It would not be like these films are works of art. It would not be like these films come from China, Japan, Korea or some other country; when the story was about fighting? be it a sword fight? and if the struggle does not resemble most of what is happening in any American sports class, it was good enough. It was not as if they were really very good. They were just superb glowing with amazingly superfluous music, where the hero got revenge against a whole host of bad guys and then credit. <br /> <br /> "Sword in the Moon" is very similar to those of my young movies, allegedly a bit of a thematic setback, giving a welcome twist, wrapping up these signs enough that bad guys are getting harder to say. <br /> <br /> Yun (Cho Jae Hyun) is known throughout the kingdom as a "human butcher". He kills fast and mercilessly on behalf of the Chun Dynasty, the Emperor's winner, who saved his life and his men's life from his service. Similarly, a ruthless rebel and his cute sidekick appear in the country and begin to kill the imperial ministers and Yun agrees to find and kill those rebels. His task will be personal discovery when he learns that two rebels are Choi (his past) and his former love, Shi Yeong. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "sword" is not much different from other movies. Some stunning cinematic works have almost completely disappeared with editing with movie parts that have been put together so loudly that it is hard to believe that what inevitably did for the film was what anyone intended. Although the atmosphere and story tend to be in a dark mood, the tone is almost sacrificed to the endless rebound parade, as every major character has received a whole story. What should have been a quick and simple action film that is weighed too much on personal luggage, and this film will suffer. the world of art-house operations along a pleasant tiger, a hidden dragon. Next time, I would strongly urge manufacturers to be a little "martial arts" and a little less "art".
