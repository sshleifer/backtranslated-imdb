Three businessmen are tied to a bar to fight with three mysterious men. Three businessmen are taking revenge that extends after the murder. It is said that there is a story of violence that can happen to ordinary people. <br /> <br /> The plot has too many holes. The details were ignored to advance the story. Operation was uneven. The color balance was terrible, even though I watched this movie on DVD. The small budget and the short schedule were obvious. The whole thing seems to be an excuse for the final change of arms, and the end was just incredible.
