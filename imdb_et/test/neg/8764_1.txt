I looked at the first show in each series to see and waste time. Emmerdale's girl was fat, so she should be a fat friend, but no one would lose her weight. <br /> <br /> Like itv, it made a big mistake. <br /> <br /> Bad Girls is I feel the whole show was almost big people who tried to lose weight, but never did when they tried love story oh my god, a waste of time and also air time. This exhibition has not been repeated in ITV2 / 3/4, yes, this is how good it is. <br /> <br /> I'd say the box doesn't just waste money. <br /> <br /> WARNING
