I participated in the review of this film. After the movie ended, Travolta came to Q&A. It was a small screen room at Tribeca. I didn't look at her politely, what I wanted to do. This is the worst thing about making a movie. The script was poorly written to run. The writer writes with one voice. The dialogue was clever and clich√©. How did this writer / director get the entertainment of Scarlet Johansen, John Travolta and Lions Gate that he was the only brilliant thing he achieved in this fiasco. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to all the scriptwriters who want the movie. directors and filmmakers. Because if you are told that you are wasting your time and you cannot achieve your goals. Hey ... just look at this crap and tell yourself ... if they can do it, it's poosible. freely and was a nice guy. The director / writer stood aside. When John tried to engage him in the conversation, he stood back like a wooden piece and never joined. I watched him and thought ... how this person can successfully "pitch" the agents, studio transfers, top technicians ... if he can't open his movie to screen his movie. The conclusion from some of us was that he had to have strong family ties in business. <br /> <br /> After you watch it, you should follow it with Guy Ritchie's "Swept Away" with the most inadvertently funny and worst result of Madonna. She is so bad and looks so bad in this movie that I think it was her way to get her back from her home abuse.
