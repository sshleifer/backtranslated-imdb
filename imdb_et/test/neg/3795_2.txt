I was completely uncomfortable with this unnecessary continuation of "Poseidon's adventure", which I gave with a very big comment. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredible about GO! I agree, why didn't other rescue boats and helicopters save? The one who saved the original survivors had just flown over the boat that Michael Caine & Sally Field is. HOW IS BACK ON THE USE ONLY? Hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Operation is generally poor and the exhibition is cheap. I hated the waste of some good players. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie unless you consider Sally & Michael to be lovers. <br /> <br />
