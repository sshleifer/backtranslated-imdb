After going through the first Dark Harvest movie, I couldn't leave it alone alone. After there was a sequel (or rather what I believed in the sequel), I had to increase my pain. Seeing that it had nothing to do with Dark Harvest, it should have been good. We didn't get any killer scarecrows on it, but we got the jackass around the cornfield, screaming out small things like "Girls!" and "Can you hear me?" every so often. In addition, we have two (four, if you add the two girls whose director wanted the same effect as the twins The Shining), uncomfortable little girls who couldn't work. And this nonsense cherry should be Corn Cop. I should have known that this movie was terrible when the dog got the opening credit. How did I stay awake for this movie, I never know.
