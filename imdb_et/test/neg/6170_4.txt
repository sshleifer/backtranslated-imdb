Mickey Rourke heats Diane Lane's Elmore Leonard at Killshot. Mickey Rourke has never disappeared. He has been constantly appearing before the scene burst. He was memorable: Domino, Sin City, Man on Fire, Once in Mexico and Get Carter. But in our powerful dramatic performance The Wrestler (2008), we see that a full-blown performance is just a hint of Get Carter. When we get to know him, Rourke still remains a cool but buttery, muscle-binding thin ball. <br /> <br /> This is Elmore's Leonard story and production. Leonard wrote such remarkable films as 3: 10 for Yuma, Be Cool, Jackie Brown, Get Shorty, 52 Pick-Up and Joe Kidd. That means we get tough guys, some good, some not so good. <br /> <br /> It also means that we get tough, realistic parcels with the best characters in every situation, making complications for violent conclusions. Killshot is no different. Harsh, thin Rurke stallion stalks unhappy with married Lane. I think the history of violence corresponds to old men. It's not as intense, bloody, or nervous as the two, but it's almost as good. If you like these two, including David Croneberg's equally wonderful Eastern promises, you will also like Killshot. <br /> <br /> Director John Madden hasn't made a lot of movies. His last few were enjoyable, if not successful: proof, Captain Corell's Mandolin and Shakespeare in love. <br /> <br /> Diana Lane has not been able to play the role of a movie because she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in dishonesty. Recently, he has been charming and appealing in romantic stories, such as Nights in Rodanthe, Black Love Dogs and Tuscan Sun. Here he has the right to note, balancing his sexy complaint with the reserved tension. <br /> <br /> It's a small part of Rosario Dawson. Yet Dawson does a good job with it. You'll see a lot more from Lane, including the underwear scene, to compete with Sigurney Weaver among foreigners, and in a big attempt by Nicole Kidman's eyes. <br /> <br /> If you're in a drama section of a crime, take the Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang and Gone Baby Gone and before the devil knows your death. The latter has excellent performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tome and Albert Finney. <br /> <br /> Killshot flopped at the cashier. More is our happiness. Definitely worth a $ 3-4 rent if you like this genre. 6/20/2009
