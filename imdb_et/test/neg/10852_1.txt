Hi! I am Sheena, Africa (still white!) Jungle Tribe Princess, who has the incredible ability to become the world's cheapest, most unpleasant monster (think 60s Star Trek aliens) by rolling sedatively mud! When I first found this terrible position, I took the only logical action: I made myself a broken jungle bikini where I could do my badly behaved antique. I like novel novels and break up between a casual unimpressive African warlord. And I would have failed if I did not mention my (white, of course) sidekicki Mr. Cutter, a former American soldier who seems to have escaped from the US after divorce. Can you say "breastfeeding alimony"? Anyway, he ignores his difficult life by accident. I mean, how much idiot blonde do you know who is also a meaty monster of endangered meat? Despite many difficulties (action is so hard! *), I have not given up, and after a lot of brain casting, I have finally discovered my role in life: to terrorize the inconvenience of late night television viewers who are so bad about the lack of cable or satellite.
