Wicked Little Things has a great summary: an empty house next to an abandoned mine with a tragic past in the forest; the family is moving home and strange things are going to happen; little creepy kids are getting up here and doing terrible kids things. But that is where wisdom and potential fun ends. This group of children was shut down in the mine decades earlier and now it seems that (bad make-up) weapons are in the woods looking for meat. Oh, I get it, it's a ghost-zombie movie. Hmmm .... although I appreciate someone trying something new with this genre, it just doesn't work. What was the motivation of children to eat meat? Why did they need weapons? Did anyone think that the filmmakers gathered around the film every day because they thought it was a cool / scary movie? I found that after thirty minutes I felt a familiar resignation that I had just wasted another modern crap-fest. Although the operation was a good / good quality setting / cinematography, the script itself suffered what seems to be a lack of knowledge of the supernatural horror genre. A lot of children who go by the mall are thinner than what is badly hidden from rodents. <br /> <br /> This movie is not scary, and although I can understand this story, you may even have enjoyed it if I had read it instead of watching it, I have to say that Wicked Little Things Wicked Little Turd.
