This season, there was no real omf, but the sixth season was created without highlighting and spontaneity to revive the months. Throughout this season's garbage, you would probably have had the value of 6 real stories. <br /> <br /> Beside stories like Pauly's mother, is she? was bored and had no other purpose than to further investigate his character. I would like to see Bobby express his anger more at this carnival episode in Pauly, but without results. <br /> <br /> And that's just it! These sides had no real purpose and had no finish. If they intend to stop these stories during the next 6 episodes, I wouldn't want to watch it because it's not really worth it. <br /> <br /> It is a nice word to say about this season and its finale.
