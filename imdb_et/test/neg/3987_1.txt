It was supposed to be set in the "Bible Zone" of Northern Ireland. Well, if somebody who grew up there and was a child depicted in the film in the era, it just wasn't true! Emphasis was everywhere - something other than Antrim / Derry. The church is not like what I have ever seen. "The Church of God" is the name of Pentecost, but it wasn't a Pentecost in the movie! In the beginning, the senior minister was dressed in the clothes of the Church of Ireland (in English) and no C.of I called himself "the Church of God". The Minister was often referred to as "respect" - they can do it in some parts of the world, but I never heard it when I lived in this area. The Minister was "Mr. ......" <br /> <br /> This movie was very poorly researched and cast - quite typical of the Irish cinema - annoying! The film may have a large plot, but if it is not authentic, it is a garbage.
