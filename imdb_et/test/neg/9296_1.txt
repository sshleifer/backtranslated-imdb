This is probably one of the worst films I've ever had in life. The plot is ridiculous and the characters are terrible people. I watched this movie with 3 friends and we all agreed to turn it off 30 minutes before the end. Ben Kingsley's character is just stupid, but not at all funny. It is a wonder why his talent actor would be involved in such drills. Tea Leon makes a subtle impression on Hillary Clinton to portray a very cold and uninteresting female lead who has all the bellowing qualities of the bone. Throw a pointless and inexplicable subset and terribly dignified assemblies and you will be wasting 93 minutes (60 in my case). Avoid this movie at all costs!
