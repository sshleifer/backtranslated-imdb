Jack Frost 2 is not a question, I'm really surprised that people are allowed to make such films. <br /> <br /> Sam and his wife take Tropicana for a relaxing Christmas, Jack returns to kill to have fun and pick up the inbreeding ... <br /> <br /> Don't take this movie at all, most people say laugh with their associates, but to be honest, it is a waste of time. If the people who made this movie get a job by doing what they do, they will get at least some time and effort to write a better story, especially cheeses.
