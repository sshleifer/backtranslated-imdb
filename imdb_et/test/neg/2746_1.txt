I love basketball and it seemed an interesting movie. But in the first ten minutes of the movie, I knew it would be trivial. It was badly done and too slow. In addition, it was very, very racist, sexist, anti-Semitic and homophobic. Sometimes, racial, ethnic, and other sluggish failures are an idea that illustrates the existing bigotia. There was no point in this movie with a terrible storyline and no one said what was said. The problem is that it was an adaptation of the 1982 film, which concerned the basketball team of the 1950s. It would have been a little more sensible to have this movie in the past. It didn't change well today and writing was terrible. I don't know how the game was originally written, but I can't believe that any movie is so bad and disgusting when it came to television and video in 1999. It was disgusting. Don't waste your precious time on it.
