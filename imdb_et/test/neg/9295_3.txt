**** Includes spoiler **** <br /> <br /> As a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook, I looked at this exhibition to finally see it. I recorded it so that I could watch it several times and there is something about that exhibition that really disturbs me. <br /> <br /> I know it was a TV movie. Not only that, but it was made for Lifetime, a channel that I despise. Since it was made on the TV, I can ignore the huge plot holes. I can ignore the immense lack of characteristic development of Ally Sheedy's character. I can't forget that George C. Scott and Rachael Leigh Cook, both of whom are very talented participants, were certainly unable to achieve their abilities. I can see that Don Damon's character was so clich√© that you knew that when he saw him, he was a villain. I can even overcome the obvious mistake in the timeline (she is raped during the winter holiday and then over a year later she has a child.) <br /> <br /> The biggest thing I can't overpower is: child custody has two attempts. In the first trial, the child's father is given custody because he is "better educated, holds a degree from a community college and has a full-time job." In the second trial, the judgment is annulled because the judge finds that there is no evidence that Emma (character of RLC) is inappropriate for the mother and that custody should not be taken from the primary caregiver and given to someone who does not have prior communication with the Child. <br /> <br /> The problem is: Somewhere in these trials, the fact that a thirty-year-old man raped a 15-year-old girl and got her pregnant! Whether it was rape or not, he had sex with a minor! Wouldn't this be taken into account if the judge chooses him in custody because he is an "adult adult"? Adult adults are not sexually minors! <br /> <br /> This is not the worst cable film you will ever see, but it is not an excellent show. ** end ****
