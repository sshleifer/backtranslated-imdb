I know most of the other comments say this movie was great, but I don't have to agree. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a good book! It was actually one of my favorites when I was little. But it's not just for theaters. Maybe a little half an hour short, but I don't see how they get a short child's book as a complete movie. <br /> <br /> This is a lovely movie, but I would only recommend it to really small children. Older children don't care about it. Adults may have a little more interest in looking at their youth. But anyone aged 7 adults has snoring-fest. <br /> <br /> Sorry if you do not agree with me, but this is my opinion. :)
