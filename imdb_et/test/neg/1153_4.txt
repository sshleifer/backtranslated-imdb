If good movies were enough to produce a good movie, I would have appreciated the markets, the embarrassing, obvious "focus" that would be a little higher than 4. Macy is doing her best, but Miller's little parable commented us too often to stop infidelity. Perhaps the novel will give us a little more background about Newman, so we understand how someone who is obviously not intelligent can be so dense to perceive the attitudes of the people around him. I agree with another reviewer that if nobody knows how big the average citizens were in America during this time, this film could be an eye-opener. I grew up in the fifties, and the "good" pastors of my Lutheran Church found nothing wrong when the church picnic was on a commercial beach whose sign clearly showed that no Jews or black people were allowed. Nowadays it is hard for young people to understand that it was a norm, not just in the south. Later in 1964, when I graduated from a somewhat racially integrated (but sexually isolated) high school in Baltimore, my black classmates could not participate in the traditional "father and son banquet" because it was held in a facility that did not acknowledge the blacks. Unfortunately, it was a company belonging to the Jewish family. The "focus" theme is important and we should never forget, despite the signs of today's American racism, how truly reluctant the attitudes of this previous generation were (indeed "the biggest generation"). So, perhaps this film is somewhat valuable in the struggle of the recent sentimental wave of waves in the forties, such as Steven Spielberg and Tom Brokow. Finally, as "far from heaven", the good intentions of filmmakers are undermined when the protagonist is so ridiculously neglected in the social conventions of his time.
