This movie is one of the worst leap examples. People who read IMDb comments may be tempted to watch this waste of time, as I was, with the wrong tags, such as "Returning to 80's Horror" and what not. This movie sucks, from action to casting the story. Terrible, everywhere. And I really like good horror movies, I'm not a snob at all. It sucked. Referring, I Loved Grudge 1 and 2, Black Sheep, Planet Terror, Texas Chaisaw Massacre The Beginning, Others, Ring, Jason X, Slither, Planet Terror and Really Hated Ring Ring 2, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Again) Wolf) Creek, The Hills Have Eyes (do again) Hostel 1 and 2 and this movie. Gore does not have fun or originality.
