You may be interested to know that BARRICADE was seen as a studio failure and was left a year ago before ALICE FAYE became so popular that the studio decided to release the film, even though it was never completely finished. Faye referred to the OK at some point. <br /> <br /> Faye refers to a murder in New York during a nightclub - and this scene was actually a script and it was the way the movie started. Instead, it's completely gone and what might have been an exciting sequence (including Faye's full song number) has never been filmed. But the rest of the story is pretty much untouched and made it possible to release the movie for 71 minutes. <br /> <br /> Tired looking WARNER BAXTER is too old to be credible for Faye's romantic interest and is just insecure as a cracked reporter. Today's audience is offended by describing Chinese using a cracked English phrase, such as "Me likey make notisy". Key Luke is one of China's loyalists, but plays its role in a de minimis and simple way. Arthur Treacher is all but invisible and still on the fourth billing screen as the story has changed. Originally, Joseph Schildkraut played a role in the film, but his part was finally changed. <br /> <br /> Mishmash from the movie, which is entertainment only for the toughest Alice Faye fans who will be able to see her in a dramatic role - albeit weak. Charles Winninger is completely wasted as a kind man who works for an American consulate. <br /> <br /> Despite all the weaknesses, there are a couple of scenes related to the narrow escape that is actually being played and Karl Freund's black photography is top-notch.
