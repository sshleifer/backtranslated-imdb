In 1990, I personally saw Kathy Ireland - in DT at UNT during filming "Necessary hardness". Strangely enough, the film he uses in this movie is not too far from his actual voice. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot goes like this: Kathy gets a letter telling her that her father has fallen to the northern hole in Africa. He goes on and explores his father's death site to suck only into the underground world that is part of a dystopian nightmare, a partially despicable fantasy, and where Plasmatics is rejected. This movie really destroys Linda Kerridge's talent, who I think could have been someone who would have had the great role that was right for her. Anyway, create the main hero, Gus, is a very flat Mark "Jacko" Jackson rip-off. The original is tedious enough to get started, but this man is tortured to watch. Finally, Nebong Wanda comes out of his shell and ends up wearing a bikini head and a sarong. If you are in Kathy Ireland's movie, which is dirty clothing, it would be better to have bikini. Anyway, the movie was just bad and MST3K was right skewered. <br /> <br /> Avoid this as much as possible.
