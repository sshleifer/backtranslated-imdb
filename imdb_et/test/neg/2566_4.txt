I discovered the "Patriot" in the DVD shop and thought it might be a real action glass. No, it's a low budget movie with a ridiculous story. This is undoubtedly a cable movie and not a theater. Luckily, the film will finish 90 minutes later if the audience had to receive the anti-virus sleep. One thing came: it was a nice land where the film was filmed. You can really feel the American air, but that's all. I hope for Steven Seagal that he will ultimately succeed. This is not necessary because I and my wife voted on average 4/10.
