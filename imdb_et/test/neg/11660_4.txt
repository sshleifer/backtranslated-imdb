Like most of the music in the era, reality needs to be checked at the door. Broadway MELODY of 1938 is not far from believable or credible, but sort of fun. This movie is really just an excuse to fill a star with talents. Some scenes happen just as if they were in a review, not a plot-centered movie. <br /> <br /> Judy Garland looks and regrets that she has so little to do with the amount of room left on the cutting room. br /> <br /> One of the most adventurous events is the way Eleanor Powell takes the lead in Broadway and Robert Taylor says it will be the dawn of work, work and work. Several scenes go and no work, no ... NO. He needs money to win the horse at the auction. He has no money. Does he pay when he tries? Taylor has to help with the money. He should be a big manufacturer. He has no money ??? Anyway, it's this strange story with just two elements. <br /> <br /> Musical numbers are quite wonderful, saving you from total loss. Broadway MELODY OF 1940 is far better than Broadway MELODY OF 1936.
