Let me see ... I've seen every movie Lou Ferrigno. I've seen Batman and Robin twice. I remember dancing in Breakin '2: Electric Boogaloo ... I've been watching an unfinished student film of Blade Runner ... but this movie is the most painful thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It was the first film "directly to the video market". So you can thank Blood Cult for all these mysterious Michael Dudikoff films in your local Blockbuster. You should know that it is not even a high quality video. This is a consumer grade. This is your father's camcorder he never uses. You have to look at it in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I did not give you the details of the plots because I get dreaming, but I mean, but I tell you that watching this movie is a form of torture. I'm only watching this movie when I'm angry with myself. So I recommend this movie if you are suicidal or if you are able to challenge. <br /> <br /> If you rent this movie (God is merciful), you know what you're in for the first 10 minutes. This is when you hit the usual horror movie tour. You know the exercise. Before a girl dies, there is a lot of tension and build up. Yes, you have seen it before, but not so. It's the most boring intro I've ever seen. I honestly believe that you can turn off the camera for ten dollars on eBay, grab what's most like gin and candy, and tell him to film his mother's dinner and it would be more interesting than this intro. It missed me tears. I cried like a child. <br /> <br /> Another thing that makes this movie so incredibly painful is its actors. Yes, I've seen bad action. TRUST ME. I've seen Oliver Twist's fourth-class productions with a more realistic dialogue. The leading person makes me sick. "Supportive" actor is a human train-wreck. <br /> <br /> I don't even comment on the boy. Real horror. <br /> <br /> So, rent this movie if it's possible. You are never more depressed to spend $ 3 on something else.
