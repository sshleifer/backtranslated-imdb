The man kills the bear. Man wears. A man / bear is a bear. The man / bear remains a man / bear after wearing a bear. End. Seriously, it's the whole plot of this movie. Yes, I made it simpler, but you get the picture. I just wish I had never seen it. <br /> <br /> The "Man / Bear" referred to is an Indian Indian who kills his mother's mother. And while this may be true, it is certainly not possible to rely on potential conflicts between the two parties. In addition, the film had two misuse of elk. But it's out of point. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is very small. Definitely needed a lot more to be fun. Maybe he laughs at the drama between the secondary characters and the two main bears. That separates bad movies from good ones. "D"
