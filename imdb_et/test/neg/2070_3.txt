The plot of such a movie is giveaway. How can you go wrong with the lines of homosexual lines and all Indian colors and music - such a story as it does. I look most at something, but it was unnoticeable. The sad thing is that white people are the most colorful in the film. Vanessa was a riot that was like a sailor, and Jack was a big blind eye, but everyone else was so boring. Saeed Jeffrey, who was exceptional at My Beautiful Landrette, did what he did, but the story was so boring. Sustainable grace was really a background music that made the film laugh, not a movie or at all. There are many other better gay movies, ethnic movies, just ordinary movies. I give a lot of low budget movies, but it shouldn't have been done or should have been done by someone else.
