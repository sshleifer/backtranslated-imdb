The child's death and horror films always remain a sensitive and contradictory combination, and therefore my personal opinion is that every film that shows the courage to switch to this subject should take care of the horror. Of course, as in "Wicked Little Things", controversial topics do not always guarantee a good movie. Despite the potentially interesting plot, atmosphere and video-disgusting director J.S. Cardone ("The Slayer"), an undiscovered and cliché movie that could not offer any fear or shock. After losing her husband and father, the rest of Tunny's women (mother Karen and her daughters Sarah and Emma) move to a small and distant mountainous Pennsylvania where they inherited the old, dirty mansion. Their new home is dangerously close to the shadow of an old mine, where dozens of innocent children died tragically in 1913. Strange things are going to happen like a young Emma who interacts (imaginary?) With a girl who lived in her house, and the terrifying locals seem to have secrets from Karen and her daughters. It quickly turns out that the Undead children are still leaving their tombs in search of revenge for the descendants of the mine owner Carlton who were responsible for their deaths. "Wicked Little Things" is quite annoying and highly predictable. The manuscript consistently serves one terrible cliché, such as car wheels colliding with mud at extremely important times, malfunctioning torches and terribly broken dolls. There is very little tension, even less gore and make-up effects are disappointingly weak. Infected children do not look at the threat at all. In fact, they all look like Marilyn Manson's miniature versions, with black outfits, pale faces and dark eyes. The excitement of the final is a stupid and the same derivative as the rest of this futile production. Lori Heuring is deeply unimpressive in his leadership role, but Scout Taylor-Compton (currently "Halloween remake" due to the big star) and young Chloe Moretz are enough daughters.
