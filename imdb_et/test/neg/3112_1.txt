The overall story, though quite graphic, is actually decent and interesting for readers. But the movie was totally terrible. The story was good, but the action was terrible. I cried all the time because I knew I could never take my time back. Don't look at this movie. When you do, bring a pistol with a bullet and some balls when you go with friends. I'm sorry for anyone who did something with this movie. I'm also sorry for anyone who had to watch the movie. Avoid this movie at all costs and if your mother forces you to look at it, kill her. Hahahahaha! Look! I'm now a psycho! IKWTCBS changed my psycho !!!!
