Young woman, nicknamed "T.N.T." is a virtual dynamite in the struggle and dropout suddenly to go to the most legitimate part of Hong Kong, looking for his lost brother Stag Jackson. When he learns to be murdered, he decides that he will bring the killer to justice only in the way he gets. <br /> <br /> Sounds good, isn't it? Well, there is really nothing wrong with starting a martial arts / blaxploitation-action thriller, which is the purpose. The wires actually turn out to be quite good with Jeanne Bell, who fits nicely with "T.N.T." role. and Stan Shaw is doing well as an ambitious and vigorous hungry Charlie. If it fails, it is the fighting action it offers. The struggle scenes are completely and completely convincing and / or sometimes so upright when it reaches a point of ridicule that does not help at all when the main focus of the film is Kung Fu heroin. Also bad lighting, accents that sport accents that make them harder to understand, the confusing work of the camera, and sometimes the bad sound does not help this obviously small budget effort. It provides one area that can delight some fans, it offers a lot of T's in "T&A". In fact, there is practically every film fighting scene with a certain type of naked scene and Jeanne Bell has actually one of the extended fighting scenes where she is completely topless. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is not something you want to look at again, because fighting scenes are so pathetic, ridiculous, bad.
