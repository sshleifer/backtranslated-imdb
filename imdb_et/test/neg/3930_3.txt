A cheap and cheerful hysterical film with bad character, lots of underbite style stoic emotions (think of Chow Yun Fat right tomorrow) and some succulent clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for some ill-executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo . Even squibs look awful. At some point it doesn't look far as America. Three quiet old cars do not make the country. Mustang has even a better front wheel, even puzzled. Such a scheme, as it is, is so derived and predictable that the end is like blasphemy killing. It didn't come fast enough. Even jewelry from robbers looks like the cheapest junkies. Amazing dialogue and hopeless exaggeration by everyone who has shot is a waste of real space and time. It is worth checking out if you want to know how not to make clichés with a low budget movie.
