The most worrying thing about this movie is that it is a hogwash load (CPUSA has never been so much a span of film as a movie). The worrying aspect is how it sprays the uncomfortable tactics of the FBI and the US Action Committee. The secret informant, the rumor became accusations, unacceptable searches - these are the things the secret police like the KGB did, and probably what good patriotic Americans fought for. But the FBI did them and didn't hit the eye. This is the only realistic part of this movie and they do it without any shame. Add to it, to undermine the Constitution itself, because only the Communists rely on the Bill of Rights. The film also has thin accusations that the black movement of civil rights was a communist-inspired, another wrong package. It is extremely difficult on this day to apologize for such outrageous propaganda, even to understand the paranoia of times when it is understood how serious it really was to humans.
