This film has somehow shown 6.2 stars, it seems inconceivable that the director has so many relationships. I'm sorry to lose it. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. There are only a few hours on earth, don't waste 1 & 1/2 of those in Guano !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (and I think it's blunt orange pastel) on the day of the next day's script. The "story" is called gracefully, is not a goal, there may be enough "story" to fill a commercial. Don't you hate ads? <br /> <br /> Now that both leaders can act, they probably decided not to be here. Likewise, the writer / director may also write and explicitly, as his next work "Love of Toys" proves. <br /> <br /> So even if you get this movie for free, even if you've paid a look at it to avoid it. <br /> <br /> Paraphrasing the Search for the Holy Grail of Monty Python: "Run away!"
