As a parent of two girls (14 and 11), I have serious doubts about this exhibition and all the exhibitions aimed at the little ones. First of all, I am always surprised that the living conditions of Drake / Joshi, Zaci / Cody, Hanna, Carli, Derek, sunny etc. make most of the houses small and narrow. Most people work hard all day to pay for dwellings that are less than half the size, but nobody goes to work or come to work, pay for utility, rent, mortgage or insurance bills, mopping, sweeping, lamp replacement, fixed toilets, etc. Just walking in and out (and downstairs wide stairs that only exist on TVs), splitting jokes (most of which are related to lying and fun results) and buggy work. I think the children who watch them have unrealistic expectations of how hard they work and how luxurious their lives are. Secondly, there is never an intact family, always a mother or a father, but never both who are always on sexual dates, but never seem to have the negative sides of divorce (alimony, support, arguments). Again, children may get the impression that when a mother / father divorces, fun is fun fun (in fact, the mother or father is often not around when it helps on the plot). Needless to say, spirituality is not mentioned (forget a particular religion). Finally, there is a topic that disturbs me. At school there are "nerds", "athletic", "good two shoes". The main characters are not good at school, sport or charity, but do for those who are. The message is nothing good, just be one of the "nothings" that mix in cracking jokes. Needless to say, I give all of these shows to zero and turn them off all the time and I'm just banned from my home.
