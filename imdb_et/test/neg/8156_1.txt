Rarely does the film find it so bad that it often reaches a paradigm that has so little redemption value that it alone is worth looking at. "Cyclone," I'm happy to announce this is a movie. <br /> <br /> I knew I was good as soon as I found a video tape. I am at least the fourth owner of the label: "The Sale of Used Movie! $ 9.95" and a $ 1 for a $ 1 Sale. I chose this fifty cent at a sustainable store. <br /> <br /> Sale of Used Movie! The sticker covers a large part of the front panel work, which means that what I see is a really strange mixed type in front of the Cyclone super bike, a car coming from the car, and Heather Thomas, who carries Flouncy's eighty's hair, whose mouth opened in his mouth. an expression that says, "I am" waiting for pain. "I saw it and thought," Everything is right. "Frankly enough," (where nobody turned and nobody trusts, Teri has got into the maze of danger and fraud), but I was surprised to see you. I always make the time for very bad movies. This "Fight Club" tape can be expected. <br /> <br /> Teri. Teri has an amazingly well-designed character that can be said about her introduction, where she and her friend are doing exercises that highlight her breasts and later her soldiers. Then Teri goes out to grab her boyfriend for the evening, which is terribly wrong. Before he knows it, Teri "drives directly to CYCLONE a deadly network of double crosses". The VHS box says it is. <br /> <br /> Excluded from the box summary - perhaps with some weak hope that the real copies of this movie will be sold - is how terrible it is. It could have been just me, but I thought I could read the thoughts of the characters through these eyes. "It's stupid," Heather Thomas thinks. "I know," thinks Bad Guy has too much mouth. <br /> <br /> On the other side of this epic image, drivers are the driving force. They were actually pretty good, although I tend to say that petrol does not require explosion guidance. What impressed me very much is that the streets were pretty empty at all times. It's like just twenty people in this huge city. <br /> <br /> I know what you mean. You mean, "Gee Wilikers! I have to see this movie!" The sad thing is, you can't find it. Oh no. "Cyclone" is a movie that finds you. Just wait. One day - maybe at lunch, maybe late in the evening - maybe "when hired assassins kill the military scientist Jeffery Combs (" Re-Animator ") - you'll hear the legwarmers' momentum and you know it's time.
