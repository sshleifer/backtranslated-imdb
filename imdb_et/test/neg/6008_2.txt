Being a big fan of Laura Gemser, I chose it for rent to see another Emanuelle movie. Boy, did I make a mistake! <br /> <br /> EMANUELLE EGYPT is nothing like Emmanuel. Laura Gemser, along with her husband, is Gabriele Tint, but this is the only connection with Emmanuel. Here Laura "Laura" (original, ah?) Is a beautiful supermodel who is going to visit her wealthy friend Pia (Annie Belle) in Egypt. In tow there is her ** hole photographer Carlo (haggard-looking Gabriele Ink) and some blonde women who have never been mentioned. Also, Pia lives in the manor Horatio (sexy but stupid Al Cliver), a mystic who speaks not only of meaninglessness. At the weekend, Pia's two daughters arrive, one short-haired lesbian and another brunette. Many sexes are indirect, but hardly shown. One good-looking actress plays Egyptian servant Ali, who will be happy with three women in the mansion. Laura is having sex with lesbian, lesbian sex with Horatio, Pia and blonde having sex with Horatio with an orgy from Egypt, Laura drinking goat's blood and being at an Egyptian ceremony, Carlo rape Laura. Everything happens with so little affection that EMANUELLE EGYPT is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Far from the erotic point of view, even the actors themselves look at their sexual scenes forever. <br /> <br /> Given that this movie had two famous pairs (Laura and Gabriele & Al and Annie), the number of available sexual scenes is innumerable. Instead, each viewer gives out a film that offers the most outstanding Eurocult and does not deliver the goods, except for the hardcore Laura Gemser graduate. Otherwise, guide EMANUEL to EGYPT!
