Rob Lowe must have eaten the whole budget, but I can't eat him with money. Even if he had to agree, there was nothing good about this movie. Filming, editing, directing, dialogue, kits, makeup, writing, casting (especially the young girl and the prosecutor of the child psychiatrist) and the story were all the worst. I've never seen such a terrible movie. Submit it for any other rental option or find yourself crying out of uncertain comments on the TV. Dead Silent should be silenced all the time.
