Well, I was watching this movie waiting for it to run to the trains ... when I was wrong. The film was moderately amusing, at best, and irritating at worst (cunning comedy that shaped a ship with archaic tools, laughing ... no, I didn't). I'm very disappointed because Steve Carrel was in the lead. I look at the Office in the US being religious, breaking me enormously, I thought the 40-year-old virgin was good ... but Evan tells us why he received this script on earth. And like Morgan Freeman - he's old enough to feel better. <br /> <br /> So the idea seemed reasonable, the actors I had any confidence in, but the execution was nothing to write home and finish, it seemed that they would run out of money or ideas. It was one of the most influential ends I could imagine. They took a biblical story and dragged it into a deterrent story of localized environmental issues, not even global issues, but a local bill - a spider! <br /> <br /> All in all, a reasonable start, gradually deteriorating and for me, it was all washed out by the time the credit rolled.
