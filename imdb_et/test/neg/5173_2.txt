Having been with more than a couple of companions, I recommend checking if Footsoldier goes out, finally got it last night. Undoubtedly, Colton Leach's story (and did it in his autobiography), which is a convincing story of a man who comes up to the cable of the underworld connected to Terrace boot boy. Unfortunately, this movie is poorly quality, terrible accents and frightening behavior. Ricci Harnett in Leach's leading role makes reasonable efforts to pass the overweight to a serious criminal, but his accent is all over the place. Because her voice tells stories, it takes me ten minutes to drive nuts. Terry Stone as Tony Tucker gave an inadvertent comedy with a wig (or worst Barnett) dialogue that was so explosive that it restricted the minors and the upper fingerline that reduced Tucker's parody. this film was that the events that had come to Rettenden, Essex and Leach's years of development are really interesting for fans of criminals and football gossip that this story would sabotage because of the credible accents and freedom of action. Roland Manookian and Frank Harper only provide the source of authenticity for films. On the positive side, some films flourished and attracted attention. Violence was well choreographed and, in addition to the use of red syrups for blood, it was realistic at all. When you enjoyed the movie, it is worth looking at Essex Boys who speak a similar story from a fictional perspective and Billy Murray.
