This movie determines the word "confused". All participants remain against the script. There is more damage, because the action is good, but the script is a mixed paste of pseudo-psychoanalytic random ideas. Stimulation is sensibly slow, and soft-focus lens cinematography can quickly become nervous. I'll give him 4 out of 10.
