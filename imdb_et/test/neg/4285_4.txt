4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> A somewhat incredible story about some haunting house-type shocks that really don't fit. Gary Oldham's performance is very unusual ... not so much performance, but consistency. His character does not behave consistently. Sometimes it is peaceful / relaxed / methodical / thoughtful, sometimes violent / loud / almost crazy. It's not just plausible. <br /> <br /> Are many 80's movies dated badly? Are they now 20 years more enjoyable? <br /> <br />
