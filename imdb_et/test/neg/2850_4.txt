Well, it wasn't a complete waste. Armand was usually very good in the movie, the whole turkey vs the German thing was strange because I remember at the beginning of the movie I saw Bulgaria ... barely go back and watch ... the central topic is that there are successive killings at the end of the whole gang war. Never saw a movie where characters saw Italian as being German, taking English (American accent and euphemism). The climax was the most intriguing part and there are parts that don't make sense to me yet. If you have nothing better to do, you can watch this movie.
