It sounded like it was like the sheep's or Zodiac's silence or something, but it wasn't. It was really one of Halloween movies without all the jump scenes. It was a bit like the plan of space 9 in the sense that the main bad boy was talking to a man who made me want snacks without breaking the break. The idea that a person who is so bad that he robs people and tortures them in the form of spiritual enlightenment is actually an interesting idea, but the exercise was too TV-sensitive. I have to say that it was better than I expected to write a movie and starring Dee Snider. Good first effort. Maybe he learns some lessons and his next effort is less clumsy.
