First of all, this movie is extremely bad and I want to avoid it at any cost if you ever want to eat ice cream again. I tried to look at it because it seemed funny, but soon it would have disturbed ice cream made from body parts and surprisingly graphic effects. It opens up with a son named Greg, who witnesses the assassin murderer of an ice-cream man (Greg then goes crazy and grows into the title character) that seems to be the assassins of the mob. There's no explanation for this murder, so it's the biggest WTF moment of the movie. Other, less WTF moments include surreal shelter, Greg goes (with bad clowns), a woman who speaks languages ​​because she is in the possession of the Holy Ghost (what it does not know) and the fact that Olivia's holy career is it bad "Hussey is in it. <br /> <br /> None of them are good enough to watch it. The only reason is the character of Tuna, who is a skinny boy whose pads are stuffed so he looks like a fat boy. For some reason it hit me so much. I stayed much longer for a night if I had to watch this movie to see if there was any reason why they couldn't use the real fat boy for the role. Although I slept before the end, I have gathered from other reviews that Tuna loses "weight". Okay, so they didn't have to budget it realistically. Recommendation to the Director: How to Make a Character ... Not Overweight? <br /> <br /> This is so; there is no other reason to admit the existence of this film if the tuna outlook is not enough for you. If the favorite source of entertainment is icy scary movies of ice cream, look at the much higher "Stuff" instead.
