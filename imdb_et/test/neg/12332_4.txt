"Love Life" examines a very culturally relevant scenario related to marriage to a lesbian and gay man. I found the subject convincing, even if the conflict was a little forced and too easy to solve. For example, Thomas Joe gets a little too quickly and comfortably on the plot. Many Continuity Errors: Another user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses ... what I liked most was that Joe's face hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene. Finally I found this movie more turned on than I moved. Stephan D. Gill has a pretty nice body and it shows it a couple of times with the skills and overflows of a porn star, and all the quarries that are too frequent. How many times does it seem that the movie goes full of porn. Stephanie Kirchen did not have a good day today, often losing his footing on the muddy pitch.
