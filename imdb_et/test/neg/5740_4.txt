I suggest that in the future, every film made by the Sci fi channel and later published on a DVD should say that it has indeed been made through a channel that I would not have known. Not that it was all bad, but if you have lost your ads in the middle of your movie, it will destroy the stream of that movie. This, in turn, makes the movie quite boring. It had an interesting story, but the light-hearted and extremely generic soundtrack disturbed the movie as most bad actors except Dien and Linda Carter. The story of vampires attacking South America, of course, is not the rule of vampire films, which is usually not the case with any vampire movie I recently saw, except for the Blade trilogy. A group of soldiers are being sent to battle so that the other team is sent to meet the crew and watch the ex-husband of one soldier ... why is he not just his wife, who knows that part of the plot doesn't really go. However, with some interesting jungle landscapes and lots of blood we can get an interesting boat ride. This fact, however, does not save the film so that it is nervous in its presentation and occasionally boring. I don't know, maybe it was blood blood and smoke and whatever they need to do, though the old effects are better and don't cost much more. I mean, cheap Italian zombie movies could make a bullet hole without cgi, why don't we now?
