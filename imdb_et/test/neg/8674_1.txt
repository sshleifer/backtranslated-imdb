I'm not Jane Austen's sister, but why make such a movie if you have nothing to say. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper was so wrong for the part that is hard to know where to start - wrong personality, modern make-up, totally wrong hair (a young lady from her age would not have been in public in any way if she did not loose her hair and without it), she didn't seem particularly gentle or family appealed, and I didn't understand why everyone seemed to think of her as especially holy or friendly. <br /> <br /> A picnic (replaced by a ball) was such a low budget that it was embarrassing to destroy the part of Portsmouth when it was fully viewed and lost (as well as the loss of scenes that could have added a cozy counterpoint to this oh-so-claustrophobic pink sitting. ) <br /> <br /> Responsible: -If you have not imagined it (even the budget doesn't mean as much as imagination) to adjust something, please don't pretend it was about 10% Mansfield Park and 90 % nothing at all <br /> <br /> PS Edmund was very good
