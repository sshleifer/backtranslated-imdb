Generally, my practice is not to watch movies that I don't want. But once or twice a year I leave my rule temporarily to comment only on the things I want to warn. I find it more pleasant to comment on something I like and raise than bad movies. But some "movies" call the razor. <br /> <br /> Bilitis is one of them. Cinema is not the only aspect that is purposeful and purposeful. Almost indifferent plot (undoubtedly inconsistent, even if it is one) bad behavior, cheesy script and terrible pace. These are its main problems. <br /> <br /> Understand, I firmly believe that not all movies are considered equal and movies have to be rated according to their category. It's not wise to decide, say, Beach Blanket Bingo against Gone with Wind. I'll meet Bilit against other films in my weight class. Measured against films such as Emmanuelle or the secrets of the Chamber, it rises very badly. Even eye candies must be fun and certainly not Bilitis.
