** Possible Spoilers Ahead ** <br /> <br /> If fans of bad movies gather for more than a few minutes, the name that always appears is the name of Larry Buchanan. This amazing director has given us other turkeys (ZONTAR THEN OF VENUS), cheap jack crimes, such as A BULLET FOR PRETTY BOY, repairs and recessions of conspiracy strikes like DOWN ON US and GOODBYE NORMA JEAN. LOCH NESS HORROR is a minor humor. In spite of the fact that Loch Ness is extremely long and narrow, Larry filmed this dragon on the wide and circular California Lake. Early on, the film has some dazzling (for budget) underwater photography and nevertheless creates an atmosphere. It then degenerates into a windy dialogue, expressed by the names of non-close actors who have lost Scottish accents, not to mention a sound track that does nothing much to hurt the bagpipe. At one point, the camps sing "You take the High Road, I'll take a low road" to throw another Scottish clich√©. When the Scottish people ever decide to jump into a political correctness attack, they turn to Larry Buchanan after that, despite his family name. The monster looks like a giant papier-mache doll and it makes Beanie & Cecil a dragon scary. In an unforgettable scene, Nessie takes to the land, and in order to avoid some patrol soldiers, a fifty-foot critic tries to hide behind the trees - and the soldiers can't see it! LOCH NESS HORROR is a real thinker that has to be seen many times - to believe.
