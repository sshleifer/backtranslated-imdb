This movie is dated in so many ways, it's sensational. You can laugh at it or ruin your fists. <br /> <br /> This film deals with many American history problems, but with typical white-man-Christian-American paternalism. those I get-this-it-all-and-you-loved-me-for-it-type-dude. He is so pompous and never serious. What a terrible creature! Her husband is a weak little woman for the first part of the film and still a very keen but stronger character. Too bad he still forgives his confusion after he has left the second time. It's just sad that the sign didn't change at all. Even if he finally had to show a strong and independent woman, he would be worried about his adventurous man. So 2 of our 10 points feminists (and they are just for good intentions ...)! The problem of the repression of India is dealt with quite nicely, but there is also this patronizing story. And the fact that all African Americans are typical stereotypes makes the film even more hypocritical. I was so brave about most of the time! So one point (try) about the movement of civil rights. <br /> <br /> I know the movie was made at another time. I love old movies and I have some patience with some of these views. But it was just nasty! <br /> <br /> This movie captures parts that do not have a key player. Mr Dix's behavior is all over and secret. Maybe his character is so unpleasant ... I liked the presentation by Mrs Dunne, although her character was terrible to me at times. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that the famous earthquake scene was incredibly done. And the way the city of Oklahoma was depicted made the film useful. It's just amazing how civilization rose from the dirt and dust of the 19th century. And I do not understand the problem that some have this church scene. I thought it was pretty funny and fun. Maybe it shouldn't have been, but I liked it. So 9 points about these scenes and the impressive storytelling of the state of Oklahoma. It makes a total of about 4 points!
