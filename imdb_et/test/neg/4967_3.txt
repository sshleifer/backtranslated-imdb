All the guys seem to have sexually attracted by Mandy Lane. All the girls seem jealous of Mandy Lane. But something doesn't seem like that, and this viewer is wondering why? Mandy is a beautiful and magnet for every boy he meets, but we'll never know Mandy or any of the characters in the movie. Mandy accepts invitations to her lonely ranch with her student friends. Three boys and three girls drink and treat. In the movie, teenagers drink water, and take drugs to enjoy a psychedelic journey. And sex is not absolutely. Meanwhile, teenagers disappear one by one. But others are drunk and high. Someone, including those watching the film, cares or is worried at all. Someone, including the audience, doesn't look damn. Emmet, a fellow student, is the initiator of the whole event. There's a security guard, Garth, who plays and protects the ranch (Anson Mount). In the middle of the movie, a killer is discovered, the tension is released unexpectedly, like the air out of the balloon. Events are completely predictable and the film just tends to get out. Mandy answers his game, but we never know why - and there is still no sex at the end of the movie. Did Mandy hypnotize the boys or did she just carry all the boys and girls to death? This totally confused viewer can only conclude that Mandy wants to get rid of a female and male contest - killing off manipulative girls and nasty boys. The director (Jonathan Levine) seems to think, but this viewer does not. Possible operator (Darren Genet) offers some stunning images, but in fact his attention seems to be on Garth, who is quite back. Not all guys love Mandy or not? If you want to be bored enough to find out how this movie comes up, it is my recommendation to sleep in the meantime through the movie until you see Mandy and Garth swarming feet. But don't wait for something to happen. Yes, you thought. Mandy remains virgin, and there is no sex yet. I'm making this movie out of three, but not because of Mandy. Why? Because all girls love Garth and all the voyeurist eyes seem to be in danger at Garth. But, unfortunately, girls and boys do not seem to feel that this film goes beyond disappointment and lack of sexual fantasy. Mandy goes on a lonely ranch and nothing happens. There is a horror in front of the audience - and it can't help but don't know why?
