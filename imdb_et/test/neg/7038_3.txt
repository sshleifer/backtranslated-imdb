You have to watch this movie! It's so bad that it's really great. <br /> <br /> You have your own crazy, but gutsy master, who of course has the thing that wear has used before. And, of course, the air crashes in the middle, when the captain's enemy and rival run along the ride that you have your former Vietnamese Water, unable to cope with the collision of another medium air and a crash landing. Then there is your old army, flying on the plane and trying well that I can't tell you what he's trying to do. The plane goes up, up and down, and then you have your greedy and immoral business engineer and then you have your Zebra ice station and then Lucky saves the bad boy from driving so they can land the plane! AND NOT END --- IT IS AND POSSIBLE! You have to look at it. It's great! CREATE YOUR WAYS! THEIR CURRENTLY TRADE IN TELEVISION AND HOW THE CABLE IS USED.
