Although the embryo might have been a potential idea of ​​bioethics research, it degenerates into a stereotypical Frankenian parable, now putting a monotonous lesson that some areas did not have to enter or study. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson, a scientist, is testing ways to prevent the death of poor children. After success with the dog, he immediately jumps into human-violating medical ethics and any credibility - with the help of the same disease administrator. His experiment works too well for some decisively unpleasant side effects. <br /> <br /> Although Barbara Carrera is quite good in her role and some animal training is remarkable, the film is too fantastic. Although the message from the prologue confirms to the viewers that it is a modern technology, the research depicted has been far removed even in the 21st century, not to mention the mid-1970s. Additionally, there is a ridiculous scene where Carrera is able to find the problem for treating side effects of biological production by simply typing a question on a computer.
