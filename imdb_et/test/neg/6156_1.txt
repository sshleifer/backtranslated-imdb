The above quotation says it all for "Slipstream". I should have rescued this movie after the first half hour, but I decided I should be fair and give him a chance. I'm not looking at it again, so if someone who can do that gets back to me with a number of lines in the movie, I'm sure it will set a record. <br /> <br /> Some otherwise fine and talented actors were blending with this clunker; Mark Hamill represents a futuristic bounty hunter and Bill Paxton is his career. Paxton's character has hijacked Hamill, an android who named him poet Byron (Bob Peck). Tasker (Hamill) makes Owens (Paxton) with a tracking device arrow so that he and his companion Belitsk (Kitty Aldridge) can skip a couple. The real question, however, is why he did not shoot the Byron device, thereby reducing the mediators. Here I find something interesting. But you can't convince me that the film is meaningful at some level. Futuristic Stone Age scenes make way for the chewing of a big society, but the peak of the bad taste has been achieved when Paxton's character is displayed all night after the dance night after the dance night. If somebody thinks there is some hidden meaning, you really stretch. When beauty is in the eyes of the viewer, it is also understanding; this movie was not. Yet there was one redemption function because the closing credits began to run - a fantastic view of half a dozen hot air balloons. Apparently, the film will hold on.
