Wrestlemania 2 is the only Wrestleman | took place in three different places and, although it was an interesting idea, it didn't really work. There are really only two games that really hit, the rest are decent or most of them are terrible. There are some entertaining celebrities like Susan Saint James, Ray Charles and Cathy Crosby, but the experience was a waste of time. The British Bulldog Vs Dream Team is perfect for admission, but you can honestly see it everywhere. <br /> <br /> Games. <br /> <br /> Nassau Coliseum. <br /> <br /> Paul Orndorff Vs Excellent Muraco / W Mr.Fuji. By the time it was, and despite the dirty finish, it was a surprisingly tolerable stuff where the crowd was really in it. Folk songs "Bullsh * t" at the end. That means he didn't do anything for his career. The race ends twice with those fighting outside the ring <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Intercontinental Championship Match. Randy Savage | C | Vs George "The Animal" Steele. Not as big wrestling as smart, but very fun because it's tied, and some of the great Steele comedies, in addition to the wild, can wrestle the potatoes and make it interesting. Savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes, to amplify. <br /> <br /> Jake "The Snake" Robert V George Wells. If this is right, it was better than it should have been, but it is too short to do anything ever. Roberts wins with DDT, pulling out a snake that is angry with Saint James. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Boxing Game. Mr.T / W son of Hat & Joe Frazier Vs Roddy Piper / W Lou Duva and Bob Orton. I think there is a big failure. I was boring nonsense throughout this time, and although it may be a marketing success, I certainly couldn't attract it. Many Rowdy songs are also noticeable. D won T when Piper slamb T. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Rosemont Horizon <br /> <br /> Women's title. Fabulous Moolah | C | Vs Velvet Mcintyre. Quits too soon before you even have the chance to get started, making a quick record as far as Women's Matches are concerned. Moolah wins when he takes advantage of Velvet's remaining splash from the top rope <br /> <br /> <br /> Capal Kirchner Vs Nikolai Volkoff / W Classy Freddie Blassie. Great popper for the caper. Stupid matching, bored offense by both parties, yet too short. Corporal wins when he threw Volkoff's Blassie rose. <br /> <br /> Battle Royal. William Perry and Andre get the biggest jumps. This is a really fun thing, despite all the NFL talents. Also noteworthy is Bret Hart's first Wrestleman appearance. Andre wins when he wins the Hart Foundation. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Tick team titles. British Bulldogs / W. Lou Albano & Ozzy Osbourne Vs Dream Team / W Johnny Valiant | An absolutely huge game that is one of the best wrestleman matches. You don't have time to catch your breath, all the maneuvers in hand and great psychology. This is pure wrestling at its finest, you can't call yourself a wrestling fan if you don't like that kind of game. Bulldogs win when Dynamite Kid collides with Valentine. <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ricky Steamboat Vs Hercules Hernandez. A pretty good meeting here where both men make solid performances. Hercules is a nasty brute whose skills are higher than average, and it is in stark contrast to Steamboat's great airplane style. The steamer wins the upper rope with a high volatility body. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Adrian Adonis Vs Uncle Elmer. Terrible game with annoying comedy. Fans love Uncle Elmer, but I don't. Adonis wins the top rope with maneuver. <br /> <br /> Funk Brothers Vs Tito Santana and JYD. A pretty confident meeting here with lots of memorable attacks from Terry Funk, something else in the table. I have to rate it as my 2nd favorite. Funks wins Jimmy Hart with a megaphone. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. Hulk Hogan | C | Vs King Kong Bundy. Hogan decent pop. One of the most redundant games in Wrestleman's history. Hogan can't fight jokes and Bundy is not that big. Violence was brutal at that time, but Hogan's superhero act is tedious and too boring. Hogan wins when he flees before Bundy. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> The bottom line. Wrestlemania 2 is the failure of most aspects. Die hard wrestling fans should see it once, but you don't have it either. It's not enough to satisfy a real wrestling fan here. Vince blew it. Don't be fooled by the main event hype, it's really a boring thing like most of the card. Not recommended and one of the worst of Wrestlemania, except for the brilliant label title match. <br /> <br /> 4/10
