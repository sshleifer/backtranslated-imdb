A blind person could have filmed this movie better ... seriously! The director is clearly a beginner. He must be a Dennis Hopper coke dealer or something to persuade him to participate in this movie. I felt so embarrassed to Dennis. <br /> <br /> John, Director ... PLEASE Leave Out of Control. Your contribution is neither needed nor wanted. The film is stronger without you. You're terrible in leadership. Keep food packing or something like that. <br /> <br /> This movie should be "straight from the video" passed and gone to the trash. I've seen a man in this movie. DO NOT ATTENTION THIS GAME IF YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU AND RECOGNIZE THE FILM BACKGROUND!
