There seems to have been money behind this film, but it would be impossible to imagine a film that was poorly planned and executed if I hadn't actually looked at it. <br /> <br /> First of all, when we are in a cave with symbols (the usual young adult stereotypes we've had in terrible movies at the beginning of the 1980s), they are almost filmed in the neighborhood. As actors carry helmet lighting, this means that everything we see is dazzling alternating lights - we can never see what the characters look like; so when they scream "Look there!" we have been asking "What?! Where?!" Ultimately, the film is a nasty, confusing strobe-light effect that doesn't make any sense until we get to the end. Admit it if you've ever seen the old 60's Arch Hall laugh fest "Eegah!" But with Richard Kiel. <br /> <br /> But what a crazy person would like to do about "Eegah!" which is remembered as one of the worst films ever made?! But we have it here, people. Except that, unlike "Eegah!", "Cavern" is not anybody's idea of ​​fun fun. It's invisible. (I ran it at x2 at normal speed, just to get over it, hoping I could see something at the end of the movie, but when I did, it was just stupid.) This film gave me one satisfactory moment; because it only cost a few bucks after I got out of this DVD player, I could break it with my hands - what a relief!
