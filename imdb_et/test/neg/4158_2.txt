Nothing is worse than the fiction created by people who don't know it. A scenario that is not so terrible in itself (the future where cloning is widespread enough to be fired by a person who is genetically too close to you) promised the scenario unacceptably If the character of Tim Robbins was able to include the security guard's password just when he wanted to tell him one thing, I knew I was in trouble. This ability later revealed that Robbins had taken an "empathy virus", viruses being used to complement their immediate (or almost immediate) skills. Robbins' interest in love was complained about by his experience with such a virus - a Chinese virus that allowed him to speak Chinese, but as he complained, "he didn't understand what he said." Okay, first out, empathy, no matter how intense, is not ESP. Without any aspect of true mind-reading (such as an empathy virus that is actively released near virion, infects close people, picks up its memory, then leaves the original host - which you will probably say on the impractical side of the smidgeon) - cannot be justified to be able to identify Set a specific detail, such as someone's password, simply by listening to the things you did not say. Nor can you acquire the ability to speak the language without understanding what you are talking about - the virus cannot infect your vocal leaders and translate to you because the virus doesn't think *. To give you the power to speak Chinese, such a learning virus should change your brain. It should encode the knowledge between the neurons and if it is there, it is your * - you understand what you say because you have to. To use your brain to complete a task, you must understand this exercise (mostly). If, of course, they do not suggest to the film that the virus has been deliberately created to create some bizarre mental schism where some of your sub-personae functions as a built-in one-way translator. The characters spoken by the characters are decent enough, though not far enough noticeable, to justify all the love that other reviewers have given. Moreover, all the multicultural inputs in the world cannot compensate for a simple, depressing circumstance. Dialogue stinks! It's slow, it's bad and it's unnatural. Again, I am sure that admirers are convinced that the boring ghost is just an inspired genius that creates a form of truly futuristic (and therefore linguistic drift) speech. I disagree. Good dialogue is a good dialogue in any age - and the same is true of momentum. <br /> <br /> Finally, I look again at the central concept of the film - with sexual banning itself. Widespread cloning is a nice, classic sci-fi theme. So is global warming, which causes ecological destruction (which also includes code 46). Unfortunately, these two don't go together! If you have an ecological disaster that severely reduces your existing living space, you will not drive with human cloning! You have enough population problems as it is. Regular, old-fashioned gender and birth provide all the necessary population, and any cloning is ruthlessly suppressed. <br /> <br /> To be fair, it wasn't all bad. He had nice cinematography. Perhaps, if I had silenced it, I would have enjoyed it.
