TDY is probably one of the worst trash ever hit directly on video. They take the scene from The Order, starring Jean Claude Van Damme, and it frustrates me because Van Damme is personally a favorite for B-com comedy. Segal has done some fine work in the past, but she has fallen very little in her books, and she will probably never pull a second undersize or death unless she sits down and has a very good brainstorming session with herself. It also disturbs me how he didn't do much of his tricks as he did in previous films. Ultimately, if you're ready to watch a movie that fits in the trash or wood chip, rent it today for you.
