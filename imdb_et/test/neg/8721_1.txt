The Dune miniseries will open with "turn off" sequences. Understanding quickly brings out the * best * scenes of 265-minute driving times and they're not good. Not good at all. Heldeke. <br /> <br /> But let's not rate the book with this cover (although this is exactly what we call to do). Give Dune the chance to redeem yourself. <br /> <br /> Well, here's an awful opening in Caladan. But who is this petulant, strange ugly man? Paul Atreides? * This is Paul Atreides? This general plastic flower? And why is he so old? What is this? Actor only 25? Well, he doesn't look *, and it is too old anyway. <br /> <br /> But at least he has charisma, right? Wrong. Alec Newman is a stumbling block, mumbling. I see him being discovered in a dark-seated remedial class because nobody liked him enough to tell him the class was over, and he's just too stupid to realize it. If your Paul Atreides has all soggy toast display and the range of "petulant" to "empty", Dune's output is doomed from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The other players are badly alec, and provide equally meaningless and incomprehensible performances, so he doesn't look too bad. At least I assume that this is what they do. Because I see I'm charitable. <br /> <br /> To be fair, they have no direction at all. Random gestures, empty or inconsistent supplies, the lack of these characters is all here. It's like a master class, how not to do it. <br /> <br /> And certainly there are more elements in this mining book than in the 1984 movie, but not more than twice as much as everything. Stops. Complete. Time. <br /> <br /> But we can forgive everyone because it's a little $ 20 million, or just $ 5 million an hour. No one could expect that high-quality scientific literature would be in this kind of budget. <br /> <br /> Except "Stargate SG-1", which makes $ 1.4 million for a 50 minute episode or "Farscape" for $ 2 million. And to be honest, I would look at the four episodes of sitting in the kidneys when I need to sit again, which is the Dune miniseries.
