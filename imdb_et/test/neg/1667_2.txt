Tommy Lee Jones was the best Woodroe and no one could Woodroe F. call better than he did. He was not only the first and best, but the only person who could portray his grief and confusion. It was a bad throw and I'm surprised that I even watched it myself. I can even start how sad they made Woodroe. I understand that he would be old by that time, but everyone knows he would never let him down. The first film was the best and the only one I ever watch. I hope God is no longer going to drive the continuation or transformation of a wonderful classic without Tommy or Duval. Without them, movies are for everyone, including a director, a waste of time and money. If you are planning to do another LONESOME EVERYTHING MOVE MOVI, take me and billions of others, don't waste time. Continuing movies just grinds the first one. Thank you.
