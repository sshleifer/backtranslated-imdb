I can't tell if the "cave" is a "cave" because I haven't seen it. I've seen "going down" and it's not terrible, but it's very hard to see and that's it. It's hard to look, as it is, there is very little light and a lot of quick movement, so it's hard to tell you what you're looking at. There are times when I think you should be scared when deciding on music, but I'm afraid what? Bad Camera Works? Bad lighting? If that is the case, it should be the most frightening film. The story is that a bunch of cavers are staying in a cave in Kazakhstan (home of Borat) and let them down, but there's something there, of course. And what is it? One man says it's a wolf / bear hybrid, that is, just before he hangs, but whatever it is, you can't see it. And just when you think (or hope) that the movie will end because the screen goes dark a bit, you'll see two other caves (two women) waking up somewhere in Betty and Wilma's clothing and trying to find a way out wherever they are. They drink some water and start eating SOMETHING until they understand what it is and start puking ... and then the number of mysteries in the cave will appear, and you're just surprised. Maybe not. Dark dick stupid .... I think I'm pretty well made of cave films out of 10 out of 10.
