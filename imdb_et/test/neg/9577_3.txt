This Spanish-Italian co-production speaks of an interesting and strange story about Dr. Bannister, a woman who has not only the best years behind her, but also the graceful face that makes her look. However, in Madrid, his conscious professor has conducted some experiments on animals that produce cells. The tests were successful but the animals became aggressive. As the professor does not allow Dr. Bannister to be the first human guinea pig, he kills him and consumes the substance. She becomes a beautiful young woman, but also a sorcerer when she keeps the secret secret. <br /> <br /> The plot is a lot of fun, but Piero Vivarelli didn't have enough skills and money to make a cool movie out of it. Also, the film becomes boring after a good start and is unable to recover quickly even though the film's driving time does not exceed 83 minutes. And when the last third of the movie turns into a Swiss city in Geneva, it sometimes even looks like a holiday movie when we see how beautiful Geneva is (what it really is - but it doesn't help to postpone the plot ...). So, in the case of a talented director, better actors, and a bigger budget, "Satanik" would have become a hidden Italian classic. But as it is, it's just a poor and boring criminal movie that's not really worth looking for. Rating: 3 out of 10.
