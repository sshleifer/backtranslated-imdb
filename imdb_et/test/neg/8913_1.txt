I love watching movies with steven, not because of the big hole in the plot, but just because it makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> Oh this makes me laugh so hard that this movie didn't make any sense and is ridiculous compared to the movie Pearl Harbor Rocks !!! and Ben affleck does not need to act at all, but give the impression how bad it is to take away all the fears and bad behavior that just worsens as steven tries to get out of prison chopper first fires the security notice and they take them to the ground when they suddenly flew when the guard started shooting. I can't see that there is oil right behind him, if you notice that the oil is not even easy for spectators to look at, and the car is blowing <br /> <br /> and there is a lot more drops, Steven uses his core business if someone refers to him with a gun, he grabs it and lets him beat it !!! like some gangsters would ever let it happen. <br /> <br /> It also works in a battlefield outdoor setting where you can see steven clearly waiting for them to take action. you notice that this is a bad thing because it just makes me laugh, i hope that one day it will come to the cinema in the Netherlands, then I'll go there as many friends as possible, just laugh at my own death
