It's hard to comment on this movie. It is one of the few films that Dimension has not really violated (it is difficult to justify) and it penetrated the unimpressive 500 theater, which is its opening day. Maybe Dimension was afraid of how people would respond to the sex creature using their tow truck to pull the house apart. <br /> <br /> Ray Sawyer is the only truck driver until he rescues the Voodoo Priest's bad car accident and vice versa, he can attack the bag full of snakes and drownings. Morgue lives Ray's life and occupies a group of teenagers who saw a terrible accident. <br /> <br /> What brings this movie down is a paper-thin character. I didn't care about any of them at one point. The dialogue was less than ho-hum. It was also very predictable. The characters did the usual stupid horror movie character things, like watching the colorful noise, calling people's names and traveling the stone during the chase. I can pick out who would be the final girl right now. And why was the camera flashing these highlights when someone died or when the killer was shown? <br /> <br /> What's Good? Well, there is an impressive temporary scene where the killer drives under the sex waters to get to his victims and a tight sequence where the last girl has to show off with other bodies while the killer sees it. But besides, it's another August / September disappointment. I was expecting it, but I didn't get what I expected.
