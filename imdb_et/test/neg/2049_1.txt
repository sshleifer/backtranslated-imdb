worst. Movie. ever done. EVER. I have nothing to say about it ... otherwise it didn't make any sense, no plot, no ... nothing. thin mess !!! I don't know how all the people in the movie had been watching them after .... .... .... ... .. I love the vampire flaps and mysteries and the alternative abstract outside the box movies and ... it wasn't of them. I mean what mess !!! I can't even say what the movie was cuz I still don't know, and I just waste an hour and a half of my life watching it ... the bottom line .. I think this film maker wants everyone to do the drugs. this is the only thing I've got with this movie. please don't look at it ... I mean "a delicate sensual vampire strike" that didn't even have the nudity you would expect from a vamp flick. in any case return my point .... this film blows. go yourself instead of fire ... .. ..
