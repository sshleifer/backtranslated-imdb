Sometimes, when I hear that List A is poured together for 2 hours in a hopeful movie, I pray that it will be good, not for my $ 10 or 2 hours, but for the benefit of these actors. career. In the "Be Cool", everything went to waste. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, John Travolta (aka Chili Palmer) and James Woods Music Director will travel. movie sequels and how most are not good. If you look at this scene being shot in the same way, Quentin Tarrantino filmed "Pulp Fiction" in his car scene and listen to a dialogue you can't help but ponder whether it is (1) a public refusal to suck a movie, or (2) ) an attempt to get the audience to laugh at the 2 foolish people who talk about the sequel. Oh irony! (If you thought the option 1 was right.) Cold and slippery Chili Palmer from the first and good movie "Get Shorty" has been revived to play the mobile music business. He steals a young hot singer (Christina Milian) from her ghetto who captured the Jewish leader (Vince Vaughn) and made her a singing power. Of course, a movie from the former mobstress can never be complete without the creation of new mobiles. This time, the contestants are Russian, which is played by American actors who cannot speak Russian if my whole family with their head in Russia hits their bare hands. <br /> <br /> In Russian I was not so much attacked by how this film depicted the Russians, but instead of being a writer, I was insulted by a terrible dialogue. This movie tried to laugh at the audience. This changed potentially good features for redundancy. Russian, black, and gay jokes were the same as just a few hundred times around. After calling Rock's character af ***** (he plays gay bodyguard Vince Vaughn) and the character of Cedric's entertainer ***** (he played a black rapper with an escort who threatens those who don't play his tracks with weapons) I wanted cinema step out because it was painful to sit down. If it was "Get Shorty", none of this would even be a drama to make a movie or really laugh. <br /> <br /> What's missing in this movie that wasn't "Get Shorty" was Chili's hot spicy attitude. He is a completely different person in this sequence. First, the old Chil would have had more dialogue. John Travolt has no more than 20 lines to talk about in "Be Cool" because he has been performing recurring lines and hundreds of two fire performances by the most casual celebrities. I'm not destroying the shock, exposing all those movies that actually see this movie (please don't !!!), but I say I'm forever surprised that these people agree to be the Inanite movie. <br /> <br /> Even more foolish was Travolta and Uma Thurman's very flat dance series (he plays James Woods widow who can kill LUCKILY in the first 10 minutes of the movie). Tarrantino has never made the Pulp Fiction an idiot like the "Be Cool" manager. This dance number was boring, long and just stabbing. Black Eyed Peas, who play 10 people in the club, didn't make the scene memorable. <br /> <br /> There were so many holes in the plot that I left the theater asking myself why?! All this movie was a big question. I just didn't think about it. I couldn't even explain to you why the Russians were after each or why this movie was ever made because I'm confused. All I took out of this movie was that everyone in LA has a sidekick, and the only way this movie was likely to be funded was all Diet Coke, Yahoo !, Honda Insight Hybrid, T-Mobile, Trimspa ads (even the film also includes a spokesperson) and a Bad Screenwriters Guild. Draw holes, stupid dialogue, too many random fires, terrible actions (even pluses) and not-so-fun attempts to imitate "Pulp Fiction" this film makes 2005 the worst movie and it's only the third month of the year.
