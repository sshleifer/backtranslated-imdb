What a terrible movie. Perfect clich√©s, amazing scenes, very bad behavior and an attractive script. It is hard to believe the same men who wrote People vs. Larry Flint and Man on the Moon wrote this garbage. Man, it changes my watch list of the 10 worst films. Wasn't that man, the director, able to call him, to understand that the first problem child was bad enough? Not to mention a sequel to this !! ?? Amazingly, this kind of movie like this can be shown to the kids, not to mention it's released! 1 out of 10 *
