This movie hit easily. I know some people say that anyone who thinks it's not good just can't get it. I like Wenders American Friend and Wings of Desire. But it is absolutely bright. The protagonist is so annoying that I don't care what he does. He is, as stated in another review, like a slightly annoying monkey. I just couldn't tolerate him or force me to take care. This is the case for most characters who just seem to have tried to be cunning or weird. I liked the character of Mel Gibson and the characters of Milla Jovovich, and I would like them to be more focused on them. Of course, Milla is beautiful, bad and you know her and what she's been through and why she's the way she is. I see Gibson's character as almost Frankenstien. I just wish she had saved Milla and hit the hotel with all the valuable boring characters who lived in it. Mile rating 10 Movie rating 0
