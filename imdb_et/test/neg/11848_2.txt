Oy vey ... Jurrasic Park got Corman out. As usual, the plot is thin, from 1 ft long dinosaurs weighing 150 pounds and leaving traces larger than they are, for inexplicable science using lasers to control dinosaurs and poultry vehicles with large enough chickens large enough for large in cage cages. dogs (I have seen chicken trucks that they all have in cage shoe boxes). And all this is the first 15 minutes of the movie disaster. All of the male actors are miraculous (I thought grizzly might be in the desert, constantly dropping objects so the raptor could easily kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from Fredrick's Hollywood modeling fiery. The rapper is the worst thing because Hobgoblins (from the same name movie) seems to have had a handheld version and a "motion" frame plastic model. If you want a good movie and a MST3K style, it's gold. If you want competent filmmaking and good action ... don't look at Roger Corman's movie. Acting can get 4 out of 10, some players at this stage have tried. The story comes from 2 to 10, it's like a drunk story. Special effects from 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not much.
