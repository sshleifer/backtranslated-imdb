From the underworld, we have by far the worst werewolf movie I've ever seen. Basically, it is a reconstructed version of the underworld, but it lacks vampires (not big deals), cool effects (BIG transaction) and generally almost everything that may be right to produce a decent movie with lycanthropy (the biggest deal) of them all!). Twenty Something Lycanthrope Chocolate Maker Vivian is now living in Romania because his family was hunting and executed for years in America for werewolves. There he belongs to a small werewolf society (or parcels) who has apparently picked up the pack leader Gabriel, whose son - some British accent toads - is hunting for himself. They have apparently been discovered in other countries before and want to settle in Romania, avoiding negative attention, so naturally this kind of activity is considered forbidden. Vivian falls in love with an American artist who is not attentive to his involvement with a group of blood cancer predators. When they discover a secret relationship, things get dirty when someone is killed and a person is forced to take part in a deadly tradition in which he is unleashed in the woods and hunted - packing the opportunity to change his "wolfy himself. It all really consists of a big leap before they flames and earth as a wolf, very exciting effect, the whole movie is like a hidden Underworld, with some dirty, romantic assemblies, and very little action - when I looked at the theater, I couldn't wait until it ended.
