Bad movie, but with one roll that is worth enjoying. For most movies, jokes are bad, songs are bad, even W.C. The fields are bad. Then there is one sequence of Bob Hope and his movie-ex; Dialogue is witty and song (version "Thanks to Memories") light, cynical and delightful. Who fell for this pair? But it makes the whole thing worth a 25-cent entry.
