Anyone who appreciates this movie over 3 is a very distorted film view, anyone who appreciated it! T 7 or higher pieces, I have no respect for their taste in movies and doubt they have ever seen good. I've always given up any movie and I did one, tried to pay attention, tried not to let my money go to waste 2, but 15 minutes in my friends smiled at me because I listened to my 2 iPods, 25 minutes later I couldn't even get watch the movie's superfluous action, so I'll never go out of the movie until it's garbage, Anyone who says he enjoys it is a liar, or they should be banned from this site. I get so angry when I see that a person appreciates it from 8 when Godfathers's overall rating is 9.1, saying that this movie was close to what it was not.
