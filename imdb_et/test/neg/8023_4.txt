Half of the mysterious thriller and half of the frustrated fantasy of the frenzied spirit, "Border Guard" is an interesting journey that will soon fall. A strong image and compelling assumptions will soon overshadow inconsistent drawing, attacked dialogue, amateur action, and the most memorable and extraordinary phalic image in recent memories (definitely not just fish!). Probably this is the first Slovenian feature film directed by a woman - Mrs Weiss must have decided to prove she could be as harsh and free as any person.
