Wesley Snipes is a complicated confusion in the last video that resembles the latest work by Steven Seagal. The script is terribly written and does not take into account the low budget and tries to be too good for your own. Unfortunately, Snipes has fallen into double the trap of ADR, doing a lot of their dialogue, and the whole story that comes every time and again through movie points. It is sad to see Wesley Snipes' talent make a movie like garbage and create tired and clearly boredom, barely bothering to create their own dialogue. It's a bit of a joke with Steven Seagal, he's not doing his dialogue, but that's not what I expected from Snipes. Perhaps this is due to the producer, Andrew Stevens, who has previously worked at Seagal, or director Po-Chi Leong, who is responsible for Seagale's epic Out Of Reach. <br /> <br /> The plot includes shady civil servants, terrorists who train football teams, blame-proof discs, and lost money for a buck. Oh and biological weapons. Now that they're connected, I don't know, but what I'm telling you is this fucking script that's pretty hard to comprehend, and like many of these DTV movies, it's a lot of fun. The plot is also interesting, playing cards with people with shady offices and dark alleys, etc. It's all "lets sit and put some plot points for watching this movie!" This pace of the film suffers because the film has some nice scenes despite the mood of the performances and the story. As an example of how the DTV film has successfully turned around a revolutionary character, I will give you the debut, protector of Dolph Lundgren's director. The proportion of this film was complicated and complicated, but the film has almost the last hour of action, Dolph is the siege of terrorists. Plot points are spoken in action, moving, avoiding death. The film does not stop us from saying what is happening, it does not break the pace. As an example, although the plot was a bit complicated, it was more forgiving because the action never went down. A detonator, like too many of these films, stops everything to give us bad walking and who is not, before it is inevitably shifted out of the twist of the rear end of the circle. These films can often suffer from solid problems. At first he puts him in the camp because he is secretly with some gun dealer. Initially, he seemed to enjoy himself, but unfortunately the rest of the film sees him and his random voice double-blinding through the role. Snipes will only be alive when invited to hit. There are, however, some nice activities, some quick and dirty martial arts and some nice strokes. The film also has a decent car chase. Silvia Colloca celebrates and she's not a lot of actresses, but she's proud of the costume that shouts "look at my cracking!" The remaining cast rolls come in and out so that they have clich√©s and uninteresting roles. <br /> <br /> Snipes is luckily for better projects that are now built. He has another team with Mario Van Peebles, called Hard Luck, then he's Chasing The Dragon, directed by Chris Nahon, who made Jet Li's The Dragon Of The Dragon. Finally, Snipes will probably make a biographical drama Toussaint led by Danny Glover. The future will suddenly look brighter for Snipes, but it will keep in mind that it received a very well-paid, about $ 7 million movie for its DTV movies, perhaps more. It is also funny to think that all of these DTV gods, Dolph Lundgren, have better films, directing themselves, enjoyable Defender and a highly violent and nicely done Russian specialist, and what he still does a fraction of the budget. Wesley and Steven Seagal are producing these devilish offers. * 1/2
