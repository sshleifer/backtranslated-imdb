Black BLACK comedy about a woman (Mia Farrow) who escapes her house on Christmas Eve, when she discovers her husband (Tony Goldwyn), has hired a hit to kill her. She comes with her husband (Scott Glenn and Mary-Louise Parker) and then things go wrong. Basically, Farrow continues to run and is constantly meeting very strange people and getting sick. <br /> <br /> It was advertised as a good movie when I saw it during a very short time during the Christmas Cinema. I found it sick, sleepless and just frustrating. I like black humor, but it was too dark for me. Especially Parker's character was terrible. Worse still, Eileen Brennan will be thrown later than the nun (!!!) and will continue to chew the landscape. <br /> <br /> The only rescuing grace was Farrow's actor - it is much better than this picture deserves. It was also a relief to see the very talented end of Stephen Dorff. The end itself was such a nice one, but it couldn't delete it before. <br /> <br /> Sick, sick, pitch black comedy. A 1
