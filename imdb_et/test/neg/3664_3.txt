I have to start by saying that the actors and the actor did a good job of what they worked together. The Dark Reality problem is you a poor director who tried so hard to be innovative and recognizable when he finally made the film exhausting. From the beginning to the end, you can say that the quality of the film reels is low, but the bad flash and the shaky camera further damage it, reflecting what is happening. Sound is muted and often not understandable. I'm sure Huston (director) claims it was a public panic, but he had more than enough material to do. As a result of the camera and lighting it did, it was a sign of upper syndrome. <br /> <br /> The story is good. The main sadistic female kidnapping story that avoids clich√©s, keeping the girl on the ground for the most important reason. Billy Bob's sheep's silence treated their victims better than Netwon. The biggest problem with the story is that dead people are constantly harassing their leading character and the second time they showed that I was fast forwarding because it tried to destroy the only proper part of the movie. <br /> <After all, this movie destroyed the way the director came together, showing random blurry things and constantly scarring scenes (not because of horror, light, angles and camera). Huston was obviously trying too hard and when something was reminded of a bad film school project. If you want to see a decent story, it's all right, but be warned that movie quality is enough to turn most of them off.
