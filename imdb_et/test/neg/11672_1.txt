Every time I saw this movie, I have the same impression: some of its parts are so stupid / bad that they break me, they are not deliberate and there are many; the rest is just bad, stupid and / or irrelevant. A movie like Evil Dead gets credit for being bad at its expense because it's intended to be a result - it's stupid and cheesy because Sam Raimi managed to achieve what he was trying to do. There's no excuse for this movie, it's stupid and cheesy because filmmakers failed. The result of the jump goes to the writing of the devil and the ways of the mess that it would be a disgrace that the film's lowest rating is one "terrible". Watching this movie has the same effect as listening to Billy Madison's essay - "Everything in this room is now hard for listening." I should be able to give this movie to about -5.
