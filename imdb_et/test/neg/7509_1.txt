Once a month, I invite some friends over "slow motion". We look for movies that are so bad they're funny, or movies that know they don't have a plot and they just show up a lot of boxes. Last night we were so bad that Zombie Planet is one of our films. Cinematography is parallel to what we are used to, but acting was another story. Johnny Depp / Rob Zombie plays a leading role, who can't participate in high school, not to mention the LOW-BUDGET horror film. Our indecisive hero, who couldn't say whether he wanted this scene or a whore to be a coward, was one of the reasons why it was the first 30-year-old film I had to finish prematurely. Movie Evening. It was a chance for a big twist in a common zombie infection, but they took it in a completely different direction based on Johnny Zombie. Personally, I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends. However, it is regrettable that I invited some 80% of this film to go through some of the films last night.
