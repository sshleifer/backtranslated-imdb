None of the Monograms is better (don't want to be entertained here either). Shanghai Cobra is a lot to do, but in the end it is too confused and confused to be too happy. The movie opens with a murderer named Shanghai Cobra, having already hit twice and now in some ways in the dining area. We have a boy, a girl and another guy who has an indirect connection when one man dies in the streets. Yes, I am going to simplify it here for the sake of brevity, because it is really at the heart of the problems with this film - it goes too far without real and perfect explanation. I have not even eaten in a canteen who has some involvement and a juke box that speaks to you and has a screen and everyone doesn't seem to be having trouble with it! All this is within the first five minutes. Then Chan enters the government and drives a friend. He also has the right to check the bank's racket and look for a man in ties that helped him arrest in Shanghai several years earlier. I found the plot very involved, as I said earlier. Toler is back in Chan. He's never satisfied. Also Benson Fong and Mantan Moreland are back. Both make good jobs and are quite fun. But the complicated plot just didn't convince me, and a large part of the movie was looked at in a strange, questionable look. This is not a bad movie not only very interesting, except for the most dedicated Chani fans.
