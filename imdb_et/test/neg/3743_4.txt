The fact that this film is a good basement quality is a real shame, but already in the 1940s, it was the only type of film that was intended for black target groups to be fed for segregation. So, while MGM, Warner and all the other big studios made extremely polished movies, the small studios with budding budgets were confused with what they had. Seeing this movie, it is obvious that it took a lot of energy to make a movie, even if it is an aesthetically speaking pretty tough film. Some of the actors were not very good (especially the French guy), the sets were minimal and the plot was totally foolish, but the film also had good music - from classical to classic jazz to rhythm and blues. This is thanks to many talented but pretty much unknown black performers. <br /> <br /> Now, as for the plot, it was completely stupid and stupid, but still observable in a kitschy way. I loved seeing Tim Moore ("Kingfish" in AMOS 's ANDY TV show) when he made an absolute ugly woman in cinema history (this includes Frankens' bride and many others) - this is probably due to the fact that when NOT pulled he was a pretty ugly but funny guy. When a man pretends to be a woman, he looked far away as a woman, I doubt that this film would have worked well. Seeing this ugly and rubber-coated man with three cheerfully inevitable witches was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie, but from a historical point of view, it is an exciting and wonderful viewing for young adults to find out what was in America in this era of black. Very interesting and funny time capsule.
