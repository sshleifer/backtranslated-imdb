Let me start by saying that you know that the movie is badly run when the attachments make the cover. That being said, anyone who says it is the worst movie is dramatic and anyone who says the movie is big is totally wrong. "It's what it is." And what it is ... a modest budget ($ 4 million, I appreciate) studio sequel. The film is not terrible, but it is disappointing for Road House fans. And this brings me to the problem, as Dirty Dancing wouldn't have been without Swayzeta, the Road House is not the same without him. Lead is not deep, characteristic and likely to wear the film. I feel the lead was badly cast and the manufacturers would have to bend backwards so that Patrick could do it when they started to follow. Another pain was uneven with prominent actors such as Will Patton, side-day players who couldn't get out of the paper bag. Busey, whom I saw, are great characters, it seemed like he was just posting it. Ellen was well played except that she wasn't at all religious when the boy grew up. Sherri, DEA's agent on the first bar was a hot and good actor, but his part was cumbersome and advanced. The writer completely abandoned all the possibilities to add a story and signs to the depth and interest. Instead, the base selects one-dimensional film. What leads me to the biggest problem, the script ... I have a bad feeling when the credits were rolled out and there were three script writers that were separated by "and" and "&". It seemed very amateur. And that was what writing was. I heard that the original script was better and then it was rewritten and hard core sucking started. Some of the fun parts of the movie to watch are ... At the first secret meeting, there was a drug deal under the table. "Hey, you can meet in a crowded naked bar, pull my cock off the cockpit and pull out the cash, then we slip them under the cocktail table" Wait! "Make sure you look cool when you look left and right to make sure no one looks!" Secondly, I love it when someone gets off the chest and then sees him happy in 10 minutes. At the end of the movie, there are some nasty edits, especially during combat scenes, and when the main character travels through the doors and runs to the patron. What brings me to the realism of DEA training, I'm not so technical ... But jumping through doors is not an ordinary workout. oriented in the field act like weak characters ... boring! Thank you for the chauvinistic view. There are other things I could teach at school ... Sped up fight, cheezy dialogue, recycled story ... etc. Applegate, he has no completely modest zen coolness, which made Mr. Patrick Swayze so bad a ass. She just strikes me as one of those 5 legs that are not participants who think they are a bad ass, but like Van Damn, she gets into a real bad ass (Chuck Zito Van Do) and she gives her a lesson. bad spirit. "So that I feel this is the main feature of the movie, if you're a bad ass, you're a bad ass, you don't have to try. Example: Swayze! If you're a pretty boy trying hard to prove you're among others bad ass ... Then well ... You are why your audience, the average Joe ... does not rent this movie and when they do it they write such comments.
