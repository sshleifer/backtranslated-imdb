Zombie Planet seems to be an example of good ideas and commendable ambitions that go beyond the budget. I thought the explanation of the zombies was a genuine original and gnarly and loved the dog's showroom. The rest of the gore was effective at low budget, but too far across the film. The problem was that it was too long and anti-climate. Of course, they were intriguing, as the line of derivative lines and similarly familiar, but cool device, but the low-budget zombie film must be goretical to express the impression and there were not enough red moments here. I think there were also cheap looking and bloodless scenes of fighting scenes, especially considering the generally minimal sound. In addition, there is very little closing at the end of a two-hour movie, and although it makes me want to hit Zombie Planet 2, I felt like I was deceived. So probably the most worthy of these two.
