Today Die Die starts an honorable criminal Harlan bank (manufactured by Steven Seagal), hired by an unhappy businessman, Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe), to drive a safety vehicle with $ 20,000,000 in cash back from 'A' to Las Vegas at 'B' , sounds easy? Well, what Max forgot to tell Harlan that the money has been stolen and that he has just gotten into an armed robbery. Bummer. Things get worse for Harlan when local police officers seize him for a long time, but Harlan managed to hide his money before he was caught and a nice $ 20 million stake and Harlan does not need to look back at scammers, so government representatives. Harlan competes with Ice School (!) (Anthony 'Teach' Criss) in prison and they both can escape, where Harlan is looking for some revenge ... <br /> <br /> Don & FauntLeRoy, director of photography & director The films made in Europe that Steven Seagal is filming directly these days will not get better and are a good example today. It's a terrible movie that's so simple. The manuscript by Danny Lerner, Kevin Moore & Les Weldon gives Seagale a new character so that it cannot act by its nature, rather than a criminal case, but a few government agent / policeman / soldier / one man army clich√© he usually plays. In fact, if you were a charity, you might say that Today you died, blasting Mel Gibson's excellent thriller Payback (1998), where he also played a very disgusting job to achieve such a good result. Although repayment was excellent, uncompromising hard-blade film noir type action thriller today you die is not quite irrelevant. Unfortunately, Seagal is terrible, has no screen presence or threat, and the audience is never quite sure if it is meant to be bad, we hate or not. For example, at first his character was created like today's Robin Hood when he steals rich drug dealers to give the poor (also keeps himself clean), which is ridiculous in itself, but then Seagal turns around and murders many people who are in violation of moral crimes, what the film set up to create it. The story is full of holes, for example, Harlan is contacted by Agent Knowles, who he punishes the boss to meet him and turns out to find his phone. In this case, why didn't his boss use the information he needed to get to Harlan? The story is the usual boring predictable stupid fight a lot of money over the surprise surprise investigative government agent is actually a bad guy! Wow, I didn't see that I came to have to say ... <br /> <br /> Director FauntLeRoy slows everything down at snails and Today you feel like it's going forever, scenes and sets of action are also seriously lacking in entertainment value. Rare fighting scenes are not big, most of them are hidden, very quickly cut and edited, or with a camera that is played behind Seagale's character to try and hide the fact that most of the stunt work done here is double. Again, Seagal sees grease and shape and uses long bags to try it out. At the beginning, it's pretty cool to drive on the streets of Las Vegas, and I thought you might be dying today, but it seems that the whole series was stolen from another action film called The World of Las Vegas (1997), but also about this movie Recording nowadays is also making Charlie Sheen's feature film No Code of Conduct (1998) scenes, Jean-Claude Van Damme's The Order (2001) & Wesley Snipes prison-based feature film Undisputed (2002), so much of what modern movies are original texts , is anyone's guess. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is decent, given that it has been edited from four separate films, and its film material is simply competent and consistent enough. All film footage in the United States is obviously raised from the films already mentioned, and all original films are made in cheap Bulgaria. The rap-style music you die today is awful. Action is bad & Seagal mumbles his way along the usual way. <br /> <br /> Today you are a very bad movie made up of other bad movies, Seagal looks old and fat. on average the best and most of the story is quite random and it doesn't come together at all well. One to avoid, unless your hard fan, if such an animal even exists ...
