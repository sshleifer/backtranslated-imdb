Imagine: high school. Except that it is a boarding house, and children have no parents. Oh, and that's Malibus. And children are all thin, white and proud, with an extraordinary symbolic minority or greasy child who plays "strange" outside. And there are no reasonable rules like how they have cohabitation, nuclear weapons in their dormitories, coffee packs, sushi bars, and a free laptop for the student. <br /> <br /> Here's a story: A girl, Zoey Brooks, is participating in PCA, which was still a school for all boys. Absolutely perfect in every sense, he is smart, beautiful, thin, sporty, creative and everything he wants to be a perfectionist. Almost all school boys want her and every girl wants to be her friend. He is the one who has advice, who saves the day with a simplified plan and is just wonderful. Too bad that no one likes it. <br /> <br /> Should we believe that if we do not even go to Zoey's perfection, are we bad people? There's nothing wrong with her at the show, and if someone contradicts her, they're portrayed as a bad guy (Logan). He may be a jerk, but at least he has a brain that thinks of himself, not just every time he agrees with the princess. <br /> <br /> His loyal group of blind followers is: Chase, the average dumb ass with his secret drunk, Michael, the symbolic black boy (and the only decent actor in the set), Lola, wannabe actress and anorexic, snobby airhead, Quinn, a smart but helpless girl when it comes to servants and Logan, a rich jerk with a soft side. Yes, this exhibition basically brings out stereotypes. <br /> <br /> But what strikes me is that they all try to pretend they're normal children. They complain that Logan has too much money when they work themselves, even though they are already going to a fairly good boarding school and they have relatively nice things that many teenagers can't afford. They drink coffee and eat sushi regularly, hardly homework and sunbathing almost every day. Oh, they're hard! Other problems? I'm too beautiful, rich and stress free! I think Zoey 101 (which is 101, what is it?) Is Nick's attempt to try to imagine teenagers realistically. If they didn't look at reality, they didn't like it, and decided to give their children life like asses on the mountains. <br /> <br /> But hey, at least a beautiful set.
