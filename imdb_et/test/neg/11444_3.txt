This movie has it all: it's a thriller, a chase, a romantic story, a mobile, a comedy, a movie ... it's actually not at all. <br /> <br /> All the time you are looking for something interesting but no, you're still watching the same twilight, uninspirit and superficial movie with a very bad sound. Even star-star actors are not reliable. Hitting a guy, a girl who plays hard, harsh and powerless policemen, waking up ... <br /> <br /> I wouldn't want to see Backtrack. If you want to see a good movie directed by famous actors, go and see Tommy Lee Jones' Melquiades Estrada's three funerals. Now I call it worth watching.
