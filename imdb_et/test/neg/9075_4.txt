I chose this movie because I was looking for a triangle friendship between my daughter and two boys. When I lived and lost this situation, I hope a similar story inspires me. My main concerns are: - Why (a) and how (b) a triangle is formed? - Why (c) and how (d) does the triangle degenerate? <br /> <br /> (a) The film offers a simple answer: "because it's better!" <br /> <br /> (b) There is an open triangle here: three share things together. The mine was closed: everyone knows others, but never three are together or talk about missing: <br /> <br /> (c) The film does not offer oral explanations but rather prefers visual and emotional assumption Finally, sensuality, sexuality in the triangle or more precisely if one member has deep feelings associated with intimacy, and as with the last and the former, they can be shared. I agree with that. <br /> <br /> (d) Silence is in the movie & my story as proof that something is not right .. And ironically and painfully, this sad time is always a phone: I lived in this terrible planned phone call: "Call me back: I'm waiting for you? and when the time comes, is the phone quiet? A variation is also displayed when the line is connected but no one refuses to speak? All these scenes were very difficult for me to see. <br /> <br /> When the movie was so great, he got a lot of mistakes: <br /> <br /> - I zapped the boy's family problems <br /> <br /> scene is cut? <br /> <br /> How does Mickael finally get into the hotel? <br /> <br /> - Does Cl√©ment always see Salome? he says no, but he has his own address; and who is her girlfriend, her girlfriend? how does he get to know ??? <br /> <br /> - What will happen to Vanessa in the end: the last shooting ring is proof? with who ?????
