It's about one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's not the worst - the hands of Manos command keep that glory. <br /> <br /> This film has many problems. First of all, this movie is cheap from Conan's movies. The child is a dirty dress with a hubcap, a quiet Asian warrior, a bad boy boy, almost frenzied soloists, and so on. There are a lot of consistency mistakes in this movie. Some of the more stupid mistakes I've ever seen are in this movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, when I watched this movie, I saw the MST3K version. Joel and the bots make the movie traceable, otherwise I'd turn off the movie after five minutes.
