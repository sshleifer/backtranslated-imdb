The few scenes that are actually trying to portray a revolutionary struggle resemble hobbies of scout troops that are temporarily slipping between swimming pools. If Sharif or, please, God, Palance tries his hand in a shooting orator, Kurtz seems to be swallowing. The Strategic Shine exhibits include a Cuban map full of oceanic fish, and a positive Vaudevillia hypothesis about how the Gulf of Pigs went. What does it leave to us? One comic dental scene; Hollywood peasants who turn to the camera as if they were a moving train; and in the case of beatings, a homoerotic passport that is not limited to Castro's manic and incessant cigar disease. Never trust Medved, but even a dashed clock is right twice a day: this is a historically terrible movie.
