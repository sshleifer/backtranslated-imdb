Is it really possible that so many people in this movie believe the girl is a witch? Just because he is dark hair and carries dark make up, should he be a witch? And I had the impression that the movie was trying to present her as "different", nobody could understand ... She's just a teenager and some dark girl in her high school says she's a witch and everyone believes in her. Besides, Brandi is portrayed very badly or the character himself is ... Fake. He didn't convince me that he was not a witch, not that I believe it first. Everyone accuses her of being a witch and acting like she's not sure if she is a witch. And how they dressed up - I see old women every day who don't wear it even when it was the last dress in the world! Brand's brother was also not very convincing ... But you see that it is important that "he put this bad, bad girl back at the end of the movie". "He has won the fight, proved to everyone that he is different". <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the worst movies I saw in life, too low. I only looked at it because there was nothing else on the TV at the moment, so I was condemned to this trash. Please don't waste your time watching this movie. When I saw a 7-star rating, I almost fainted ... It's not worth it compared to other movies that are also rated 7-star.
