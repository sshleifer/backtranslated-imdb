I really despair when they talk about the program joking as if it were intellectually linked and promoting the liberation and independence of women. This exhibition is the biggest offense for women with all their libidinous hip-hop videos. When talking about a number of careless teenage boys over $ 100 lunch in alternating restaurants, buying indiscriminately and jumping into bed to the nearest male on the spot, the fate of the Western nations, as we speak, is considered authority. <Br / After <br /> the deviations it makes from a female sex are not sex and the city IS NOT RESPONSIBLE. It has never been funny, exciting, exciting or original. Episodes play monotonously. Each character is a factory-made dummy that behaves the same way for every episode. None of these low, unpleasant women have ever developed. Maybe the worst driver is Carrie Bradshaw. In addition to frightening viewing, his desire to force an analysis of relationships is a must. In addition, the exhibition shows men as a slip of empty head, unable to live a healthy relationship. Even if there is a decent man, he is somehow painted as a cable. The complete absence of male empathy is obviously the work of some "progressive" pseudo-feminist. <br /> <br /> The most sad part of the show is that these women live an unhappy unhappy life. Every intelligent woman will never disappear. This is a banal exhibition with even more banal signs. The NYC Tourism Office must hate how this rubbish shows its otherwise good city! Fortunately, this train wreck is over! Desperate housewives are seen as a suitable substitute for SATC. While DH may be a long way off, she is studying at least women more versatile. Plus it treats men more respectfully and it's actually fun!
