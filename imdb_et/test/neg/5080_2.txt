Seeing the names of the main actors (Statham, Snipes and Phillippe), I thought the film should be at least very funny or interesting. Instead, I got everything I got, not just boring 92 minutes, but disappointing knowing everything that was supposed to happen and hearing tons of flies and sloppy "bad police". <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the movie doesn't have a good story at first. And if you have it, if no one can help you, not Statham, not Wesley Snipes ... even John McClane couldn't save this movie :-) It may be cool for kids if they are not over 12 years old because they not telling the story so much and there are some big explosions in the movie.
