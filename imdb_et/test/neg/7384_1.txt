This movie was the worst film I've ever seen. No story, no point, it wasn't funny at all, not sure why people say this movie is fun because it sucks so much! Felix Bean's main character sucked. Susanna wonders. This film was made in 1996 and it really was in the 80s. What's more, I never let my friend ever choose movies again. Hmm, the film's cover said it was from the super-men who robbed them and stole their identities. Wow, what a waste of time. The only minute that was funny was Freaky Ricky, she was funny, especially when she and Emily joined. It was funny. Everything and everything, it's a miracle, a waste of time and sleep. Oh, never thought that such a movie could be done, so stupid to look at it all the way to the end.
