***** Spoiler or two, not such things ****** <br /> <br /> There are two things about this movie. First of all, it's called "Bruno" and "Dress code", and once you've seen this movie, you can handle it with irony. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this is a complete solution to the problems of the wall. The adventures of a classic school crucifix are not such as to require the necessary film or theme of fear, which I think most people would be interested in. Wear clothing for a religion that is likely to open up without a lot of worms - what did he think? Yes, there is some humor and it is not directly offensive, but the uneasy feeling from the beginning continues to grow. It does not do much to repeat the liberal mantra that "different" people should be accepted (or perhaps excluded). <br /> <br /> What's Good ---- But for people to live in society, everyone has to give a little. Bruno does not just want to wear a dress, he wants to show up as a miniature Gladys Knight on the prize night and his last costume makes him remember the Cowgirl Doll. But all other children dress and behave like ordinary children. So what does it give? If it comes down, we can all declare ourselves to be special or different and behave in any way we felt, and the result would be total chaos. <br /> <br /> The fact that people are "different" is also quite narrowly defined, I doubt we will ever see a movie about a child who found his true self and wants to wear a overalls, hunt geese and go on a tractor pulls and demands that all others accept him as he is. "Bruno" is one stupid movie and a complete waste of time.
