Peter Yates's film from Steve Tesich's pencil is a relatively low key thriller that can't really get out of the ground. The story is related to the mysterious murder of the influential Asian businessmen and the consequent consequences of the pathetic Vietnamese veteran (James Woods) who, in the opinion of the police, may have vengeance on their former employer. As a "witness", William Hurt never believes that his friend is capable of doing so. <br /> <br /> The Greyhound is much lower than his usual strength and is hard to understand with him or meaningless Sigourney Weaver. James Woods and Christopher Plummer are doing a bit better in their support roles. It is worth noting that Morgan Freeman has a look of detective black. <br /> <br /> In hindsight, Steve Tesich's story is just an unlikely romance dressed as a mystery. The plot is too natural.
