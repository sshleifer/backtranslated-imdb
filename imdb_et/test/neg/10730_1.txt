There are no fun jokes for disadvantaged illegal immigrants! Or we have the desperate situation of shop owners on this issue! The fact that richer than God Brian Glazer did not see the irony of "heroes" embracing, does exactly what the villain is doing - robbing honest, hardworking people of the savings of their lives - not surprising me!

But the main problem (besides the rebellious big band) is the premise: if the ex-leader of the notorious company is now, Dick would be a big scalp for the management of every business! There's no kitchen for him! And if I think he didn't rob a Gore / Lieberman poster, in the high months of the drawings.
