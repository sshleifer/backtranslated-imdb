I would like to comment on the selection of girls. why is that they are always more white women who are elected then their black women. Every episode is always more white, then black. like to say that white women are better than black women. I'd like to see more black women once, then white. And it's not just your show it's like that much always shows more whites. but I would have thought you would see it as the main jump of the show, so you could see it yourself and you would have more black women. but you are like the rest who are trying to act like you are so fair and nice. you're just big scammers.
