Historically terrible. Slightly accurate moment of 4 hours of ridicule. Contradictions cannot be monitored while viewing. Like all the tracks and films, no one doubts any rail consultant. Shows events and techniques that were not created even before the next century. 400 meters of running runners' shots for a highly overweight actor who shows a jump in height and a long jump winner, nothing should be known in any way. Probably in 1984, he was thrown with prizes just before the LA Olympics.
