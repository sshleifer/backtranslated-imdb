I watched this movie to see the direction one of the most promising talent in films was. Unfortunately, with this film Leelee Sobieski has chosen a path that is not only well-worn but completely free of any meaningful destination. This movie used every excited trick in the book to leave the screen, knock you on the shoulders, and politely ask if it has its own heartbeat so it can give them a good tug. Romance can be done well, and if it does, the viewer will feel that love is displayed on screen. During the emotional climax of this film, I laughed. Cordially. I would recommend saving time and money instead of seeing this movie from Karo syrup and Velveeta. It's about the same.
