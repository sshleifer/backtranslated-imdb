This movie may be in o.k. if not all the language it contains. I think the story itself is not bad, but I would be too embarrassed to see my wife or children watching the movie. I know that children will eventually learn about a journey that is true, but parents should not help them in this process by letting them see and hear things in the shadow of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I used to be like Robert Loggia; he has a peculiar quality that is his loud voice, but in recent years, all I have seen him has roles with a lot of language. If we had a prize for overuse of the F word, he must be a candidate. Unfortunately, I think he has lost me now as a fan. When I see my name in the movie in the future, I think twice about picking up that title. <br /> <br /> Look, I'm not a bride. I sometimes use language in extreme situations, but if we look at the film, it is something that I hope will bring us joy and escapism. I don't want to remind you of what is happening today in any big city on the streets, and it's a hassle to think about whether the movie is right for my family. <br /> <br /> I also like Matt Modine, but I'm sorry he's tied up with a picture that's letting go of his picture. He probably did o.k. work in the film, but I finished about 1/4 of the way after others were too often attacked by my ears. Why can't these actors say no if these scripts ask them to continue this silicon language? If there are enough participants (especially big names) to hit it, the writers will stop it in the movies! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this picture. It is also a pity, because I think it would have been a good thing if it was good enough for decent families to look! Thank God, I wasted it for just $ 2.00!
