Oh, there are many worse Wayne movies. This movie is poorly edited, but it has a campy element that makes viewing it enjoyable. The offender is an Anglo actress who sports sporty ridiculous Mexican clothes and influences the masterful domination that is fun. The girl is dressed like Jean Harlow wannabe, it's 1934. At least, the shots are beautiful and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Look and laugh. Do not expect serious westernity, but rather a light and superficial story of badly acting, but occasionally camping humor. Wayne is almost ridiculously young and beautiful, and we see her acting for years after this regrettable attempt.
