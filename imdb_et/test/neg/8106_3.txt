MGM hodgepodge from Jimmy Durante, who throws a big party for everyone in Hollywood. Larger letters are not shown - we get Three Stooges, Laurel & Hardy, Durante and Lupe Velez. I didn't know anyone else - they were probably unknown (for good reasons). The film has annoying jokes and some really horrible songs and choreography. The only thing that is to prevent this complete catastrophe is Laurel & Hardy's "battle" with Lupe Velez and the wonderful color of Disney's comic "The Hot Chocolate Soldier". This is a beautiful, very colorful comic that gives the film a tremendous boost. Otherwise, the film is a colossal cage. The director has not been credited - what does it say to you?
