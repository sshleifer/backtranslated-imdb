Yes, it may not be for adults and for some adults it may be stupid, but if you don't think it is not that bad. <br /> <br /> The story is Alvin and his gang who are moving around the world. looking for jewelry for a bad person and the inaccuracies they face. <br /> <br /> So the animation is good and the story is lovely and the songs are forgotten, but it's forgotten, but it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> I give him 6 out of 10 or *** out of 4.
