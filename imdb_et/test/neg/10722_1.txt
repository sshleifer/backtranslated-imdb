Part of the low rating of the film is the emphasis on unemployment and suffering. While this is good for drama, we know in comedy that pain is not to be emphasized. As a result, Fun Dick and Jane don't have the proper title, and I was just disappointed when I didn't see any fun with Dick and Jane. It is true that this is a copy of the movie with the same name, but it does not perform and the title did not fit the storyline. <br /> <br /> But when the movie was sent back to "The Steal Art" and the emphasis on the comedy of bomb art takes more robbery and plans to steal (foolishly) it would have made the movie a big boost. While at the same time the film should show to the Director General at least in the beginning, it should be easier for the pains to have been brought to justice early on and simply left behind. The film suffers from a point of view, and with this in mind, comedy cannot work if the view is not done properly. The stylish character of her husband, who is on the road to Wile E. Coyote's Runner, would be more funny, including comedy. But in this case, it would be very difficult to steal instead of defeating the birds with complex contradictions. I mean, you can do a lot of them and put them in a movie. But because the viewpoint was wrong, the part of the robbery had to be limited. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy this movie in the first 15 minutes (during Jim Carrey's high rise), but in order to solve the problems they had to face comic because it's a comedy great review. It may be funny if the problems were more related to John Travolta's civil action during the crisis. This film was serious, but the problems they faced were somewhat comic.
