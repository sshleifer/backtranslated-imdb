I don't remember this movie too much, except that the lights (bulbs) were clearly destroyed. Almost every fight scene included the unnecessary and unwanted destruction of useful lights, even if it was equipped with cheesy, 70s-style cylindrical tones to adhere to the timing of the story. Once upon a time, at home, in the living and dining halls of their mother's house, the brutal destruction of the bulbs takes place, with the luminaires in both spaces removed. However, the most malicious destruction occurs later in the bookmarking office and includes, but is not limited to, a ceramic horse head with a strong bite of a base that is therefore broken down and a cylindrical tone. The boy falls back in another fisticuffs fight. Later this lamp is also covered when the boy is photographed, causing additional damage to the plastic-coated shade. <br /> <br /> Although this film encourages a particularly wasteful attitude to lamps, it should be remembered that lamps, regardless of their low cost design or gas, are extremely valuable for their illumination. However, if you ever feel the need to break the light, I would highly recommend this movie.
