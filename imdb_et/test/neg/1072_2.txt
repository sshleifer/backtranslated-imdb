Frankly, Mr Thalluri .... if you make a drama film in a high school environment after a school day of teenagers and when you run a schedule and jump back and forth ... if you do that you can't use exactly the same "Elephant" visual story device , which uses a camera that moves from one label to another and has scenes shown 3 times from different angles. You just can't do that because it's such a dull hanging that is hard to believe that someone gave it more than 5 ratings. <br /> <br /> Where "Elephant" (which appeared 3 years before this movie) uses school shooting (or exactly Columbine shooting) because the centerpiece of this script 2:37 is teen teenicide and we see an overview of the shock value of this topic . It is the same slow story, many dramatic piano music that all lead to the finals you know from the beginning. At least the characters look like they tried somewhat differently in this department. So you have an atypical gay boy who looks like a stoner / skater, a hunky lover-boy who can't deal with his rich family of geek, brother and sister who both got their own problems and here the nose dives. <br /> <br /> You will also get a corrupted bulimic chick and one of the most ridiculous characters ... who is a medical person who moisturizes pants because of "2 urethral syndrome" who has never heard of the invention. diapers, but squeeze your pants in the classroom and then become new clothes and do it every day! WOW, as hard as this movie is trying to be realistic, is the most absurd thing I've ever heard. She steals the toilet and is obviously ashamed, but does not wipe her nose blood through the whole school with wet pants and bleeding. This is the realism of a new era that leads directly to "twisting" and to the final character who turns out to be the victim of suicide ... <br /> <br /> After looking at the "very realistic" life of teenagers (one day, including incest) - teens pregnancy, bulimia, parents' emphasis on class and appearance and gay theme you mentioned earlier, like your "very realistic" soap ... trying to be) we look at the girl we met at the beginning of this movie and who has no reason but the guy whom he had shattered left the room when he spoke to him (BTW saw it somewhere before in a well-thought-out piano sequence?). And it gets even better ... before his wrist breaks down in the "Yes" and "No" long scenes, he asks if he is OK, constantly smiling and then cuts his wrist at the school with scissors. <br /> <br /> Now that you have a movie that is full of Elephant rapping, a really sloppy story will fail (the whole rumor of the rape was quite incredible) and people call it a shocker. <br /> <br /> What the hell is going on? Is everything needed to make pseudo-dramatic music, a boring story that speaks and adds a surprise to the shock, and people think there is a great deep message here? I think Elephant is already overestimated, but this movie was original, but it is an obvious burst that is not on many levels. I've never seen the coarser stealing of the whole film concept in my life ... and believe me that I was watching hundreds of horror films so I know how low you go there. It is pushed down in all departments ... it's not realistic, its stolen, sluggish slow, and in any way I don't know what is still meaningless ... the second romantic suicide (many give this a movie that makes me think whether they watch Romeo + Juliet throughout the day because there are dozens of movies that deal with the subject in a clear non-romantic and MORE REALISTIC way) or it's ridiculous created ... Come on! I still try to work out whether a 2-ureter boy or suicide himself is unrealistic and ridiculous.
