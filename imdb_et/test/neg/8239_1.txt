While watching this episode, I looked at the clock, waiting for something to happen. As it seemed like an hour, I thought they would give us a big pop and then nothing. The whole family is wrapped around a Christmas tree like something in the Hallmark Channel, then fading black. <br /> <br /> Maybe one of the poorest season finals I've ever seen. Nothing throws any excitement next season. The only thing that was thrown out as any incentive to see the next season was the vague nugget offered by agent Harris as he paired the base coat that the men in New York were looking for from New Jersey men. Wow, really? I would never have waited for something that a mobsters would have, I'm at my place. <br /> <br /> They almost seem to be trying to lose interest. They start with more plot features that eventually disappear than any exhibition I've ever seen. They tease and tips, but rarely offer more. <br /> <br /> What are the Arabs who hang on Bing? They hold them in front of us and magically, nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Paulie kills some guys when Tony promised his mother that nothing was going on his son and wind. /> <br /> And how much more prone to addiction with Christopher? Please, let him arrest or overdose or something interesting. <br /> <br /> It was one of the few examples I watched before, but now, forget-bout.
