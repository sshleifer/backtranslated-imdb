You think the film that celebrated the post-World War II with the three biggest male characters would have become a classic. The three, who are also my three favorites, are walking in the enthusiasm, watching them be any place, but there is sad. can be classic. These days, political correctness has nothing to do with the pioneers of American Americans and the traces of their western migration. It should have done better. Being a former politician, he appreciates a higher depositary. The script requires that it not only has a covered wagon, but also a train for running a train. <br /> <br /> You think it's ridiculous, you should see a whipping scene where Douglas orders his black servant, played by Roy Glenn whipping him. I'm not breaking it by saying what causes Douglas to demand this from Glenn, but trust me, it's bad. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum is the trajectory and the three stars he sees as the most boring. There had to be considerable friction between Widmark and Douglas, but Mitchum just bathed it all over the film. <br /> <br /> The friction might have contributed somewhat, as the film requires the widow Douglas to see Mrs Widmark, Lola Albright played. Now she's the best look in the movie. <br /> <br /> Film billing says introducing Sally Field. It was done between his Gidget and his Flying Nun days. He plays a piece of white lunch with Mercy McBee's music comedy. First we see her in a movie sitting at the back of her parents, legs akimbo and inviting. Of course he gets his invitation. <br /> <br /> His character is something that has been found in all American trailer parks, and then again, a wagon train, but one big trailer park. <br /> <br /> Despite the film, Sally Field went to two Oscar career. That woman had to overcome. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen's son Andrew drew this item and, together with the sad script, made it a difficult mess. Shame on Andrew McLaglen, he's definitely better during his career. <br /> <br /> And so, if you're not a stargazer.
