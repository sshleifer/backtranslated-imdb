This is probably the worst of the movies that made themselves seriously. And not as an actor, as an actor, I have to say that Rickman and Stowe were supposed to be the best, just after electro-convulsive treatment was needed after packing the basics. Being one of the 57 people who saw this movie in theater, I have to say that I've never experienced a movie where the movie ended, credit rolled, house lights and no one moved out of their seats. About five minutes after the house lights came out, people started to come out of their candy, and I think most of us thought we could get it, it was a joke, right? Finally, after the secret artists were hiding, and we swore the oath of mystery that we never admitted that we were there, we felt that leaving was safe, praying that we could not see leaving the auditorium. I've seen some pretty bad movies in my days (I'm happy with Cinemax), but I'm still bitter that I can never get these two or more hours back in life that I watched Closet Land.
