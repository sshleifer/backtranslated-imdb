If you decide to watch Wild Rebels, don't expect anything deep and meaningful. If you are looking for a movie that explores motorcycle gang relationships and structures, there is a Wild Rebels wrong film. If you are looking for a problem with the disintegration of the American education system and juvenile delinquency, then Wild Rebels is the wrong film. If you are looking for a film about how juvenile police departments are well-funded, well-organized gangs, Wild Rebels is the wrong film. But if you are looking for an absurd movie full of scene after inadvertent humor, horrible action, paper-thin plot and community theater-style production values, Wild Rebels is the right film. <br /> <br /> Wild Rebels is the story of Rod Tillman (Steve Alaimo), the lucky driver of the accident car. After a fierce crash (which Rod goes completely unharmed, despite having only cotton pants and a London Fog-type jacket for protection), Rod decides to give up. He does not intend to bother his future other than on the southern roads, then he gets into the motorcycle gang of the angels of Satan (the gang is the three foolest men who ever pulls the leather jacket and the woman). This hoodlum group spends its time in a rural rural area of ​​Florida, making such atrocities as stealing a newspaper from a neighbor's mailbox. These worshiping idiots need someone who acts as their leader in some of the larger crimes they have planned. Obviously, these three Einstein can only drive with two tires, not four. So they recruit Rod to bold that only an experienced driver can keep cars in the middle of a gravel road at low speed. Finally, they hold the bank, enter the above-mentioned low-speed chase and have a flat weapon battle with the police that has ever been put on the film. I could continue forever, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> I hate the term "so bad it is good" but it seems to describe the rebels naturally.
