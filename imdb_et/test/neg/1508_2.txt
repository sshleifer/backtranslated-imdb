Grandmother, directed by Boris Pavlovsky (who?), Sees eight friends who are experiencing anxiety when the old psycho-killer of a rubber mask and a nightgown interrupts his party. <br /> <br /> They say you can't understand the book with the cover, but it doesn't seem to be the case with DVDs: last night I was in a really bad horror movie mood, and because Granny's cover had a dimly sneaky picture, who turned the ax, terrible typography (they even use the system font, no-no-no!), and the credit that doesn't have anyone I heard, it was pretty bad. <br /> It was! <br /> <br /> If the movie clocks are just under an hour, it should not waste too much time before starting the action; Granny, however, spends the first 20 minutes with a group of unlikely friends who enjoy meaningless games and an extremely banal conversation. Anyone staying with a movie that is long enough to start killing (and I doubt most of the sensible people are bothering) is treated with a number of terrible death scenes with an amateur gore, a terribly acting load and a surprise that is not surprising (if you are Seeing April's Funny Day, you think about twisting before it appears). <br /> <br /> Granny is uninspired, unexciting and almost invisible. Avoid.
