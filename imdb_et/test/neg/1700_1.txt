Jason Connery is not an actor; he is the son of an actor. His Macbeth is the worst I've ever seen. Oh yes, he kills King Duncan, but he also kills William Shakespeare. His wife is even worse. Please give me the Polanski version of the DVD so I can forget about this monster. Jon Finch, Orson Welles, Laurence Olivier, There's ACTORS!
