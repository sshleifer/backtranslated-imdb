The only thing I expected was this movie was a smart, spoken motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This movie is just terrible. I gave her 1 star, which of course means I enjoyed it enormously. Bad action, bad writing, bad leadership, bad choreography. The only true actor in this film is Martin Landau, who of course does a good job when playing the offender, although the character is your usual cardboard dropping evil chief / villain. Even at the end of the so-called "plot twist" there was no shock. <br /> <br /> There was so much fun in this movie that I enjoyed it a lot. And it had some impressive car wrecks. <br /> <br /> Like bad movies? Check it out. Want a good movie? Not here.
