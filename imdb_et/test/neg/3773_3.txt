What waste. John Travolta and Scarlett Johansen deserved it better. To get started, the UN started out terribly. Someone who could persuade someone to break the anti-hero, someone who could look at the haunting and defeated role. Billy Bob Thornton would have matched the bill or even Al Pacino, but JT is just too alive and seems to be too much fun. Surely someone who has been in the mill through the nature of JT has suffered physically? The character presented to the audience looked like he could become so tight on Oakland Raiders. Scarlett helped a slightly better role. Where was the pain and the conflict, which would certainly have been a worrying development? And like the "plot", none of this makes sense. Characters jump from one mood to another with no apparent reason - and certainly without explanation. The tempo of the film also leaves something unwanted, namely the tempo. This is a very slow movie, not that I have something against a slow movie as long as they are somewhere. Speed ​​rises only to the end when it slowly shifts to extreme competition to pack as many tired clichés as possible. It succeeds - the only thing missing is a small dog. Of these 10, only Gabriel Macht performed - he was the only cast member who was a) well cast and b) managed to convince his role. All in all, it is a terrible disappointment and a real waste of a couple of hours.
