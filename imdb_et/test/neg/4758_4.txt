This foaming romantic comedy is based on the story I loved as a teenager, but now it's quite unpleasant. The May-September additions are undoubtedly what the parent has in mind, whether lust or inability to deal with the reality of aging or both. And the younger one is most likely looking for a parent he had no child. These underlying action plans now seem pathetic to me as romantic; there is something more predatory. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell also seemed embarrassed - as he should - in his old love. For fifty years he had been striving for the role of a thirty-eight-year-old man who romanticizes a teenager. But the young Debbie Reynolds were pretty and cheerful and full of vinegar - uneven to the age of seventeen, who had been morally erected and assigned to the honest scriptwriter as a "gift" that was his research. His spirited force drew me a better judgment than the film would otherwise have deserved. Anne Francis was chosen as Powell's beautiful but brilliant groom and treated her little role foolishly. <br /> <br /> Some of the dialogues were also amusing, so it's not a complete outflow. <br /> <br /> 5/10
