It doesn't really happen in this movie. Here are some important moments and everything else is about the important moment that happens before the movie begins. The main mechanism of the story is a setback. Feedback can be used very well, but they are not here. Going back or forth is close to zero and only weeks are separating events, so the context as the scene develops is the only way to know when something will happen. Maybe it was meant to add some sense of reason, but it was very annoying. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in following the 100-minute screen discussion, why do things and the flat questioning for good and evil enjoy. If you look at Ryan Gosling's face from most of the vacated views, you have a lot of luck. Unfortunately, I have no reason to recommend this movie. Oh, and as another review showed, Spacey is just playing a playful role here and playing with an irrelevant separation that you've probably already seen. <br /> <br /> *** The rest includes a spoiler, although some big points will be left back *** <br /> <br /> First of all, there will be a slower boy killing before the movie is opened and we will never know exactly what happened. That means he was killed to stop the deep sadness that was passed through the boy's eyes. There are not many other unanswered questions, because boys and leaders are very one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> What is leading ... The second review showed he was crazy. I agree that he is not right, but he does not know that I would call it crazy. The film seems to be trying hard to convey that he was somehow autistic or slowed down because he seemed slow and could not understand. So when they went to the marginalized youngsters who had some sort of disorder and / or were severely curable. As always, Ryan Gosling is good at communicating to the public, but it seems exactly what he deliberately missed in this case. This film does not provide answers but questions, but it was a bad film that I really didn't care about.
