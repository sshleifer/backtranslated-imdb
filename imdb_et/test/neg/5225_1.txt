I gave this film a rating of 1 because it is by far the worst film I've ever seen in my life. This film was made in 2003 and I have seen films made in the 60s with a better special effect. I wish I could go into detail, but the words can't describe how that movie was. I could have done better with a home video camera and $ 20! I pray that Chuck Norris will never make a movie. Now that you think I'm down in this movie because it has a Christian theme, you're wrong. I like that IL 'Chuck decided to make a movie that at least tried to make God look good, but why should he as poor viewers like me suffer such a dirty movie? The whole movie can be summarized with 3 words: RE DAMN DICULOUS.
