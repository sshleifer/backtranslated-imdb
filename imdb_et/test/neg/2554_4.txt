If it hadn't been for Christopher Gues, I would have finished watching this movie in 20 minutes. The jokes were flat, the potty and slow pace of the film, some characters were unpleasant and painful to look at, but the character of the guests keeps me laughing so I stuck with it. <br /> <br /> I feel there are many better choices out there!
