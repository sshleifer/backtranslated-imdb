It's just one of the worst films I've seen in many years. I started watching the movie despite the wait and that's exactly what he gave .... not much! In fact, it was even less than expected. My first reaction, when I saw the opening parts of the movie, was that I probably got it "4". I thought it seemed good enough with photography and a haunting atmosphere. being just silly and tasteless at the beginning so foolish and reluctant to end. By the time the movie was over, I was ready to evaluate it no more than "1". <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money on it.
