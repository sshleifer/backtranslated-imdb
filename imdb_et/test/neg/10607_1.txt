Pure crap, decent cinematography ... I liked some colors. Moreover, it was one of the worst films I ever saw. Bored, inanimate, never once found myself interested in any symbol. I was looking for a real plot and movie speed. Nothing happened! I think they spent too much time working with hair and wardrobe to forget that the movie was about to be.
