Less than a redeeming junk junk, which is mercifully free from the destruction of competence. Some of the northern idiots come to the deep south, looking for some of the legendary whiskey rifles placed on the legendary Whiskey Hill. They are threatened by frightening mountain lamps, extensively shifting 'liberation'; But it turns out that the hicks are headed by the North Marijuana Trafficking Traffick.

Women are locked and raped in catatonia; Instead of saving them, the boys run into the city to get a sheriff who is lazy and doesn't believe them. I think if my girlfriend is raped, I'd take the shortest route to hiding. But it is good, because as soon as they appear to be funny jokes, girls get all the joy and hope when only trauma was in real life. It also has a backside that have a lot of foam. The stitches didn't work with ideas.
