Burt Reynolds plays Gator McKluski, who has still been released from prison, still a convicted prisoner who helps the Feds reset the corrupt small town sheriff. Critics often blamed the return to Reynolds for simply calling them "good" for boys' performances; true, he's an automatic pilot. But in his days, Reynolds knew how to make his key effort a key. Reynolds is as close as hearing and nice as the audience stands out as if he can break through; it seems that he knows these backs and movie stars, while the director Joesph Sargent offers a simple pace and sweaty atmosphere that brings life to life. Unfortunately, this story is not much and is supported by actors Ned Beatty and Bo Hopkins (as usual). Diane Ladd is a good part of a little and the real daughter of Laura Dernit can be seen in the background. Reynolds returned to this sign for the 1976 Gator. * 1/2 from ****
