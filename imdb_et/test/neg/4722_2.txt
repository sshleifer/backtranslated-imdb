Emilio Vierya, director of recognized Argentine horror, runs the script from Jack Curtis and Antonio Ross. Pleasant and ridiculous is the method's confusion with madness. The doctor's son approaches his early death until his desperate father transmits the monkey to the chest. As expected, things are strange; when this young man becomes a monster-wearing mask and travels to the beaches, looking at nice looking girls to make his slaves. When heroin is injected, her beauty becomes zombies. The monster calls his tortured minions to strange organ music. So bad ... well ... it's just bad. Cast: Jose E. Moreno, Alberto Caneau, Mauricio De Ferraris, Gloria Prat and Gina Moret.
