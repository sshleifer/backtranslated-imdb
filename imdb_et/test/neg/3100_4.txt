It has been said that some directors make low-budget images with similar blockers. Albert Pyun makes small-budget photos similar to high school A / V project films. This film was quite inadequate in all departments. Practically every scene moves too much, "experimental" lighting and camera work are terrible, Rob Lowe apparently equating that it is buggy, and poor drab Euro-pop numbers stop the movie to a dead stop. On the plus side, Burt Reynolds does a good job he has given (which is not much), Mario Van Peebles is surprisingly decent and Ice-T puts another B-movie gangster on. Not Pyun's worst job (Urban Menace), but certainly not his best (average weapons).
