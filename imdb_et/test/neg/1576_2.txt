I saw this movie surfing through infomercials and in the evening of the 80's on television one night in the morning. I have to say that I didn't expect much and I didn't get much. Although Rose McGowan is hot, her performance and the rest of the show were at least Oscar-worthy. This movie has its ups and downs, and at the end there are a couple of twists, but frankly it was terrible. Not even an ordinary movie. No gore, no sex, no nudity, no real violence. Just bad behavior. I'd give 3 out of 10.
