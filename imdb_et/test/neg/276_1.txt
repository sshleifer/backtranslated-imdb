The man I loved in the ocean 11. <br /> <br /> Smart movie. All eleven characters were extremely important because everyone had the professional skills needed to draw the finals. <br /> <br /> What were the oceans on earth? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I assume it should be Zeta-Jones, but he wasn't really part of 11 because he tried to catch them and work on them all over the film? It was the character of Brad and Zeta-Jones, which is a dull relationship with some of the original movie bits to get couples to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> O-11, the gang was always a step ahead of Benedict (Garcia). They were always able to overcome him. What happened here? He comes with them after dropping and suddenly they are all prisoners? The whole movie is so that they get the money they stole, and the interest to pay Benedict for the throws he had thrown back three years ago. So the next film will once again develop courage and brains and send them back to pay him the first hail? The phone rental ... <br /> <br /> This movie could only have been achieved with Brad Pitt, Zeta-Jones and 5 minutes by Matt Damon to change the scene. <br /> <br /> Slow motion film is not the first energy. I tried it very much and I am usually very easy but I am really disappointed. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! Slightly, the whole movie didn't need to be a real attack before you saw it in the last 2 hours. <br /> <br /> END THE SPOILER. <br /> <br /> Wait until it appears on your TV or if you are a fan of the original since 2001, don't look at it.
