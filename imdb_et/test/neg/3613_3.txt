I do not vote for this movie terribly, mainly because I like it, I was one of those summer days that I was so lame to do something and decided to rent a movie in the stupid part of the videotore. Besides, I did not sleep in the near future and the film got me awake ... Let's just start autopsy, OK, the film worships a strange plot, first the isolation, the expedition, they are separated on the island because the boat has no gas, nothing, there is no convincing performance for the participants (so far), the main problem begins after the idea of ​​isolation, the snake POV, then the other, then the second, the snakes that change, the wrong horrors, a lot of them, and if we believe the film goes in good condition, that ab flick keeps failing because after ten or eleven spooks we don't get away, one scene that fluctuates all is a scene when we know drunk lesbian shows, followed by snakes that seem to be dancing, after that it doesn't turn into horror but a comedy movie, the adventure part is also thrown away. /> <br /> For me, the problem is the third act in the movie, this is one part that just drives a snapshot of a movie, or if it succeeds, we didn't notice it like ninja smoke in our eyes, well. The snake on the island is a bad conclusion, it all ends up in the "book" The termination with the confrontation, persecution, and escape order was predictable when I was wrong in the copy of the patent. Another real problem is the concept, the concept is very important, that is why you believe in the dinosaurs who live, or the body that is full of seams that just wants to live, the main concept of snakes that want decades of revenge after torture after decades. civilization, well ... hmmm, just don't stick on the wall. One thing you enjoy (if you look at it openly) is more bz sequences, naked lesbian girls, some amateur camera corners, braindead-respect lawn-cutter, black guy doesn't die first and that's all ... if you want to see the snakes, black glasses and comedy and prefer larger budgets, see and see "snakes on the plane". <br /> <br /> Hasta Cinemas
