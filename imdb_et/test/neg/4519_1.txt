It's not like WWF and WWF 'Attitude Era'. I have always been a dedicated WWF fan and I have never glimpsed. Now I'm the day I wanted WWF to take responsibility. At least WCW would try something new and radical constantly, instead of adhering to the actual intentions of the show, and this also applies to ECW. WWF has always been for Hulk Hogan, Andrei Gianni, and other old wrestlers, and Attitude Era happened only for the radical ideas of competition. WWE is the same trash that was before the attitude of the era was only dumbed and demoralized. Wrestlers are terrible, brand splitting is scrambling the mind, and the story and conditions are non-existent. WWE is so bad that it stops being even a former shell, pushing characters and wrestlers to the main tournament suddenly and retaining creativity barriers. Of course, this exhibition shakes the brains of the sweet, innocent and easily temporarily washed children and weak, bad, pariahs, internet wrestling communities who in reality think the company is something good. Anyone who even shades and relies on the fact that this show and product is good can go straight to hell.
