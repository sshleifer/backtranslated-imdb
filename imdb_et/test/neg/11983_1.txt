Not too good a movie. Of course, it includes action, but the effects aren't all as good as the '08 movie. Impact effects are even terrible. It is "meh" <br /> <br /> It is nothing other than Far Cry, except for the names and basics of the story (genetically advanced superheroes). Super soldiers are very different, mercenaries are different, the device is completely different (tropical island in the Pacific region, in the North of the island in America in the movie). <br /> <br /> I loved Far shout. I loved this story and setup. I hated the movie.
