"Hellraiser: Bloodline" must give some recognition. It's actually a full-time month. Does it carry all of its "Demonic Toys" or "Puppet Master" characters without shining? A full month can get a stupid product because they know it's silly. These Hellraiser things, man, will never take them seriously. This increasingly foolish franchise (though not nearly as stupid as I was watching) repeated its low-budget style. Now it's just ish.
