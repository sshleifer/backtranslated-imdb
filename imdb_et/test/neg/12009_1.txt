If someone tries to tell me that they think the film is the worst (and it's usually a movie that is angry hates like "Manos, Fate" or "Avengers"), then I ask them, "The comedy of the movie, who is is trying to kill adults? Does anyone talk in this movie line "I'd rather eat a sweat?" <br /> <br /> This movie is too small and moral for adults and WAY is too violent and irresponsible for children. so much money to make such movies? There is a problem with child 3 but i haven't seen it .I prefer to eat.
