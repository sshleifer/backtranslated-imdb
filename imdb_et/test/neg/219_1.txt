This movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen! The cast was fantastic, but the film itself was terrible. It was so terrible that I had to register to say how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie and wanted to break it every minute. It could have been great. There was a big assumption. If you plan to rob an armored car and there is a homeless person who sees you, you have to do what you have to do. That the protagonist decides to kill the policeman and kill his friends and associates after the homeless man has already died is just ridiculous. And yes, I'm sure it will respond to how his consciousness reached him, but come on. The main player pulled the bottom of the armored truck out, no one saw him. He blew a pocket and grabbed and pulled the policeman behind other defenders and no one saw him. He was able to get back into the armored car and no one saw him ... This film was potential but blew it. <br /> <br /> You could never watch this movie for me! NEVER look at it! Aggravating ...
