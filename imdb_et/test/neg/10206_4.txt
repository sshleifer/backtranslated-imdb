No Holds Barred is the film that, if you were nine or ten, was the coolest film on this side of Arnold Schwarzenegger. But when you grow up and look at it, you feel embarrassed that you were so light that you like it. You feel cheated, embarrassed and stupid. If you have a little brother and you show it to him and he tells you it's gay, give him five highs and bring him to the 11th birthday on the strip.
