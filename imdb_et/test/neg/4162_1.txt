If you are a stranger who thinks it is "romantic" and wonderful to have sex with a woman who is your mother's genetic equivalent, then she will become pregnant and then have sex with her once she has an abortion and tells her she is associated with you, you would like this movie. <br /> <br /> Not to say that a man is married and has a son at home - it makes it even more disgusting and regrettable that he has no conscience he does. She doesn't get her job, family, OR Maria. He's a loser. There's nothing romantic or positive about this movie - it's a whistle and bleeding. <br /> <br /> It moves slowly and it will not let the movie in the first half. I couldn't even finish this pathetic apology for "romance". I'm glad we don't waste our money on this movie theater. 0/10
