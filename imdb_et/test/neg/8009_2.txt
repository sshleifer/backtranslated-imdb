they (dueringer, dorfer) are good stand-up comedians, young, not ugly, they have money, girls love them, the audience appreciates everything they do <br /> <br /> and then they made this movie ... <br /> <br /> No story at all, some jokes were old in the fifties, the actress is terrible. Save your money on something useful, like a gift to your girlfriend.
