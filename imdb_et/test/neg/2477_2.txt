This is a comedy / romance film directed by Andy Tennant, starring Will Smith, Eva Mendes and Kevin James. <br /> <br /> This is a professional dating doctor -Will Smith, known as Hitch, who helps men in Maandan May with their interests. He is currently helping a formal, clumsy Albert who is obsessed with a very powerful, famous and rich woman, Allegra. At the same time, Hitch has been interested in the rumor of columnist Sara, - Eva Mendes, who has been appointed to write about Allegra. When Sara's best friend is in love with a disappointing man who thinks Sara is a Hitch customer, she draws revenge against Hitch and misunderstands two pairs of conflict situations. This movie is not what men should see on it, there are many men and both fine and coarse men. There are also double standards that you have to remain blind to not see. Hitch and Sara are both very opposite sex, Hitch still loves women despite burns in the past and teaches men to make them happy. But of course Sara is a sexist bigot who makes frequent sexist comments, like "men want to have sex with everything that walks." He has become obsessed with himself and knows that he looks like a goddess and knows that there are no "real men." Most of all, I was disturbed by this "bad" man who wanted to quickly confuse Sara's best friend, who is a classic example of an unprotected "victim", and even after Hitch has physically taken off, Sara is struck by pills, after which he says: "Now I'm happy." Add that "women are still oppressed" from Allegra when people are not allowed to ask for their money after their husband's permission. Despite all the preconditions and generalizations of the garbage - Women can always say when you are not with them? - This film has the right point that love does not exist in America. This movie has some funny parts like Albert and his dance habits, but this film generally wins the terrible movie Honey marginally.
