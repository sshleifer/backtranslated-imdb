The Italian robbery of Mandingo and The Drum is poorly dubbed on the plantation of Italian life. Many people who do not feel like they are in the south of America are wearing poorly adapted costumes and walking around places that don't see anything to the south of America. The plot has something romantic, jealous, and a tragedy between a rich and a certain young woman. The film promises hot, evaporating sex and a lot of twisted violence, but none of it ever comes, it's all. All of this is likely to be racially insensitive because it was not bankrupt by an artist. The last twist is the best ridiculous. Great turkey.
