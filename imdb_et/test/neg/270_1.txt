I didn't expect much when I saw it, but my god is disappointing. The original was fun in such a genre, but it was so bad when I felt abused when I left the theater. There's no plot, it's not funny, it's not enjoyable to look at, it's just embarrassing. After a few hours, I was hoping that patience would be rewarded, but now I will not lose the theater. Do yourself a favor and ignore it, see if it's a small screen. Or check out this budget on a DVD, whatever you do, to waste that money. Don't tell me I didn't warn you.
