I'm Mike Sedlak. I wrote the score for this movie. And proud of it. <br /> <br /> And I love all the comments. Some have not gone far enough. <br /> <br /> Premiere of the movie in San Francisco in the summer of 1973. The theater was full of friends and family. We all killed. <br /> <br /> Five days later, it was pulled out of the Bay Area screens. <br /> <br /> If anyone is interested, you will hear the details of the scene that can make the movie even more enjoyable, please let me know. <br /> <br /> We could start taking a picture where Gideon Blake throws a toilet plunger to crush one of the evil henchmen who watch the radio on Budi's house. <br /> <br /> Or how did Gideon disperse the bomb in its original version. <br /> <br /> Didn't help. It was still bombarded. <br /> <br /> Bring it in.
