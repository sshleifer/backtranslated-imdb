I didn't want to write this movie's western comments and critics, I mean, how wrong have they been about Asian cinema, which has now become a Hollywood remake monster? Plus Jet L is pretty hell and she made interesting movies from Asia. So openly I thought of this movie surprisingly. <br /> <br /> There are good points. The story is very clever, using the M theory as a base to bring a plot that has multiple universes with its own world variations and probably yours. Each time one of you is destroyed, the rest of the energy and power are shared between them. The idea that somebody could try and deliberately become the only version in all universes to find out if they would become God. <br /> <br /> There is also Jet Li and he is not a bad actress and a pretty nimble martial artist and Jason Statham, who is all around the good actor. As far as special effects are concerned, some of them are really cool, mixing the time of the ball and slow motion at the usual speed, very cool viewing in places. Well Statham's accent is terrible and some effects are not as comparable as others, so it's quite obvious that the money was spent on some of the main shots, not on others that were probably too short on the screen or just a budget shortage. <br /> <br /> For me, it is a painful point that Hollywood has long passed the camera that Jackie Chan has often talked about. Closing the scenes associated with filming has two purposes. This puts more emphasis on one stroke or movement, making it more sensitive and realistic than it really is and hiding what is happening around the camera lens. For example, people with fake hands or stunt-double, etc. <br /> <br /> What Chan always said was that he was trying to open the camera and show the audience what's going on, let them see people who fight right, not face and fist, don't let them shut in the frame. Displaying the whole picture is more effective and impressive. <br /> <br /> So close cropped pictures were just more annoying than anything, you didn't see the impression of Li's fighting skills and you found it hard to see some action. Slowly cut and bring the camera to Hollywood leaders! The biggest problem, however, was the story, although despite this strong foundation, it seemed that they were losing ground and focused on action scenes. There are some serious plot buildings and explanatory moments that are simply overlooked and covered in a few sentences, but they could have formed an excellent and complex character. <br /> <br /> It all happened together with the weak and it is not enough. All in all, the big film and its potential were not badly violated.
