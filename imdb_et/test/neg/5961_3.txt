On the back of his DVD, the "El Chucabra" plot is described: after his capture in the desert, the legendary bloodthirsty creature escapes from the town of Chupacabra, creating chaos and panic. Because they are trying to kill a dead beast, Dr. Starlina Davide, an animal control officer and scientist, understands that his own suspicious plan is being followed also a mysterious research center led by the devilish Dr Goodspeed, a hard-hit murder. This scary horror is somewhat fun when you look at it under the influence of alcohol. The script is completely silly, the actor is out of wood with faith and the direction is amateurish. The two rubber Chupacabra suits are the best for this movie. 10 and it is extremely kind.
