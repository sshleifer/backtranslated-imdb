I have a friend who is bursting and gets 5 free movies a week, so one day, when we were interested in washing the corridor, I stumbled upon 18 Kung Fu weapons and decided to box alone, this movie seemed pretty funny, but we still tempted and we rented it - after that it was free ..... and thanks to the god it was ... this is a movie of the IMPORTANT WORK I have ever seen. The budget must be a pickle and a piece of string ... the plot was ridiculous, the only remark for "18 weapons" is that there is a book that teaches the way of 18 weapons, what a bad man is after - and that's it! there are not even any weapons to fight in this movie ... that and the action sequences are just flat, BAD .... 9 times out of 10 out of 10 other man's strokes and shocks come away from the other guy, and there are many times when the movie skipping frames (the result of ridiculously poor editing) .... duplication is also ridiculous and it is hardly understandable .... and we can't even work. ..the end will definitely say "wtf ??", but I just have to mention that the methods used by the actors were somewhat decent and the old boy is the mad chump .... but that is ... fortunately I didn't have to pay for this movie, but i think at least now I know exactly how bad the movie really is.
