Corny and terrible, I wasn't surprised that this short-term exhibition didn't do it. I remember gently when Tales From The Crypt tried to reuse these corny episodes, as they really were scary. Together with bad and bad music, I was surprised that this ghost showed it was ever created. It has never been revealed and can only be grateful for this.
