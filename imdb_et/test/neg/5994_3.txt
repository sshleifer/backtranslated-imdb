I like most of the full moon pictures that I ordered this movie from the United States because in Germany it can't be anywhere. I thought it would be as nice and fun as the subspecies or the Puppetmaster series because they were full of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was glad the movie finally arrived. <br /> <br /> But after watching this cheesy movie, I was very disappointed. Actors (I don't think you can even tell actors) are boring and unyielding. The story was bad and even the set and the monster were very cheap and bad. <br /> <br /> I hope no one will do this terrible aftermath or reprocessing. :-)
