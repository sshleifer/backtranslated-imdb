OK, you get one thing straight, I love dinosaur movies, even bad. With this in mind, you can continue. "Raptor" is a truly terrible movie that really isn't even a movie because it is clustered with "Carnosaur", "Carnosaur 2" and "Primary Species - Carnosaur 3" bits. Eric Roberts is a sheriff and his busty sidekick that runs around confused, scared or whatever is trying to pass (badly) on an emotional scale, but how can they react to something that was filmed several years earlier. Manufacturers (yes, Roger Corman are talking about you!) Even 2 people from Carnosaur went to play some parts, so there is a chance of repeated use of deaths! So this movie is cheaper cheap. See 3 original movies, there are no Oscar winners, but they have some value and entertainment, but avoid "Raptor". Oh, it also has the most pointless sex that lasts nearly 10 minutes! Do you think they were trying to pull the time out?
