If someone thinks it's a great sports movie, it's probably the only sport they've ever seen. Different aspects of a sports film can be taken. Whether it is a professional or college or high school. Examples of sports movies that I liked (and I haven't seen much) are Jim Thorpe: All America, all the right moves, any given Sunday, eight men and Rocky. All these films had a little more than normal sport. Whether it was a man's rise and then a descent into a size or a person who loses the effect of a vindictive coach or money on dreams for professional sports. There is not much content in the deposit box. It didn't even look like the film had a start or an end. There was no character formation, everyone was forced to us. I can sum up this movie by quoting a very bad trainer: "Go out and try to get more points than another man."
