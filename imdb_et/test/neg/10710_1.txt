Warning: This may damage your movie. Look at it, see if you agree. <br /> <br /> Think we can't learn from the past. The futuristic society represented the glamor that Hitler believed in destroying people (in this case men) for the benefit of race society. It made me sick on the stomach. The credibility of the Y bomb is also crazy. Even in the war, our self-defense instinct prevents the extinction of mankind. We made mistakes in the past, namely: Japan, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki in 45, but that is why we kept 63 major mistakes during the Cuba missile crisis
