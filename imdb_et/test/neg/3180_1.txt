I'm shocked and amazed to find an overview of this terrible movie that is unhappy. I rented this "movie" or stool, no matter what you want to call it, with several friends and after thirty minutes we had to look. Listening to the dialogue left me in the mouth of a terrible sour milk. This movie was about as smart as the ass pimple. I hope I never see the bra, dirty Anne again look the same (Julianne Nicholson). but instead of being quick but painful for 30 minutes (all I can uncover) was 90 minutes.
