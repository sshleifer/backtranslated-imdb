After reading this story some time ago, I was very excited to see the movie. I read the book again. This is one of my favorite Nicholas Sparks books. I think what makes the story is relationships. It was a point for me in the film because I think the relationships were badly expressed in the film. I have no idea what the idea of ​​changing the roles of the main characters (Tim and Alan characters). The film did not hit John and Savannah at all. Maybe if you haven't liked this movie, but I thought it was so boring compared to the book. I thought Channing was a great choice for John, but I had the feeling that he was going to watch all the young adults, so I think it was for them. The end cuts the whole point of the book so I was pleased with it. I was hoping that the film was a laptop or a memorial, and the way they collected books. I feel like I'm wasting the Friday night and the story of 10 bucks of happy love, not the story I was expecting.
