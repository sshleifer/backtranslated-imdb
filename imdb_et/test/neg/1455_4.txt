Take over mobi comedy. Director Demme pauses the actors after some funny lines to let the audience laugh and not be left out. It seems strange - this director made "The Silence of Lambs" - it is now possible to use the stops! Casting looks like. Mathew Modine too young for the FBI agent and Pfeiffer's love of interest! Dean Stockwell makes Jack Nicholson a joke, and he gets the name! In addition, do we have to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians? Charles Napier is a hairdresser and Al Lewis as a lawyer who is just one line - each of them should be bumble bee. Chris Isaak's song score is totally inappropriate - better than a flick like "Pretty In Pink". Make this movie again, it's worth it, but through the right casting and director and satire, ... even often repeated "Forgedabout".
