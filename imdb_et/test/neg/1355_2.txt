As a Spanish tourist in Los Angeles and as a fan of fanatical film, I made a terrible mistake. I went to look at "Women." I've seen the original many times, I actually do it myself. My hurry to see how the remake was made was based on Diane, the woman responsible for Murphy Brown. I was, how bad is it? He must know what he is doing. Well, I don't know what to say. I don't understand what happened. Botoxed women are a pretty frustrating thing. Meg Ryan or who played Mary - he saw a bit like Meg Ryan's grotesque version ... another actor who wore Meg Ryan's mask - he doesn't produce what Norma Shearer did in 1939. is a tired, convincing prototype of what has become a farce during a farce. "Friends" Annette Bening, Debra Messing, Jada Pinket Smith is as loose as I have ever seen and if it was not enough: Eva Mendes as a crystal, Joan Crawford created the character in one of her best and funest performances. Eva Mende's casting is really a poster sign, how wrong this bad commercial test was. I didn't give it to 1 tribute to Candice Bergen and Cloris Leachman
