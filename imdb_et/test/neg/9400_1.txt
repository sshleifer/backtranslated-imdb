Yes, I really found this movie terribly. <br /> <br /> I didn't like Sandra Oh's character; It is unlikely that he will be accepted for the life of rural Italy because he is not white. it was a bit of a computer crap. <br /> <br /> The film is also offensive to Italian men. For example, one man he (Diane Lane) owns is a caddish cheat. But don't guess what: at the end of your normal plastic American brick, all the cheesy white smile and sunbathing, and finally finds what he wants all the time: a true American man, and now he has colonized another part of the world. In fact, this film is quite racist in the portrayal of Italians, and how he is subjected to either smarmy lotharios or modest peasants. <br /> <br /> Photography was good, but the film and its attitude were trash.
