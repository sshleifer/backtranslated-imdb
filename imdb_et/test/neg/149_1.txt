I just watched this "movie" and it made me write my first comment on IMDb.com, even though I've been a user for more than 9 years. because I watched it, I like splatter movies and sometimes I want to test my limits and see what really strikes me. First, the gore of this film did not shock me, not even the idea that someone came to it and made it a movie - what really shocked is that there seems to be a market of this type of mess. . don't get me wrong - I'm all against censorship, but this movie seems to me to have been made for a fetish crowd that seems like this kind of sh * t.it won't let the same nasty and guilty look after movies like " August underground watching. this movie is terrible, but at least you feel that filmmakers want to show you how nasty the violence is. In the case of "nickel daruma", it seems to have been done to awaken people. I prefer movies that are shocking because they are well-made and well thought out, like Gaspar Noe films or Takashi Miike or Funny Games or Man Bites Dog - these films will stay with you for some time. the movie I forget tomorrow, and the only thing that sticks to me is the idea that there are people out there threatening to watch it. If you read it, check yourself in the next hospital or let yourself be down - it doesn't apply naturally to gore hounds who just love the splatter. you are cool! peace
