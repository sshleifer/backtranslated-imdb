"Closing Day" - <br /> <br /> I bought this movie last week and waited for some time to get back and relax and watch some "good" 80s gems, got it and "Xtro" look, didn't see never. I looked at it easily and realized that my external speakers were also on. I just imagine what my neighbors thought when "Felony" came to sing their 10-minute stroke? I'm sure it was loud and I'm sure they think I'm strange, this and the chainsaw sound and screaming from other movies. <br /> <br /> it was a real sub-right movie, not a relationship, no story, some cool deaths, almost seemed on the amateur side, I usually like such movies, but it just didn't click with me, now I watch for the first time "Xtro "and I have margarita! <br /> <br /> DJ Eric Austin TX
