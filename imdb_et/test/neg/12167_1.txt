I really hated this movie and this is the first movie written by Stephen King that I didn't finish. I was really disappointed, it was the worst crap I've ever seen. What did you mean by three hours? It may have a pretty good story, but the actors? Excitement? No. Romance? No. Horror? It was nothing like that. <br /> <br /> This is a strange, crazy scientific man, Einstein's hair, a classic thing. Not at all real. And the man keeps getting younger all the time. They just seemed to use the name of Stephen King to make a filthy, too long movie that wasn't exciting at all. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie "1 (terrible)". If they had -5, it would probably be instead. It was a waste of time.
