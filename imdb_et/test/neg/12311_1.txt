Holy cow, what a piece of this movie is. I didn't know how these filmmakers took a 250-word book and made it a movie. I think they didn't know! I don't remember any nose or belching in the book, did you do that? <br /> <br /> They took it all the time as a classic for kids, added some nose, belching, and sexual inuind, and they prostituted KAKA jokes. This should give you a good idea of ​​what these Hollywood manufacturers think. I have to say that visually it was interesting, but the brilliant visual story has destroyed the toilet humor (if you even think it is funny), I don't want the kids I know to have. <Br /> <br /> Don't take your children to watch, don't rent a DVD. I hope that Dr. Suez's ghost will come and haunt the people who made this film.
