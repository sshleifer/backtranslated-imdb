Right where do I start? I can't even imagine that this predictive pathetic idea of ​​the exhibition is understandable. This is the picture of a boarding house, where the kids whose parents run in the money just get them there, so they're riding around the world. It didn't get that dynamic anymore. <br /> <br /> If you taught these children, they should not even be upgraded to some teenagers because they hardly act like a sensible homosexual, were self-centered, think again. About 23 minutes full of your so-called problems, boy's troubles and more. <br /> <br /> The heroine of the show, of course, Mademoiselle Zoey, played by Britney Polly Pocket Little Miss I'm All This sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, is obviously learning a lot of action. But I give her some face because her superficial, one-dimensional character doesn't allow much room for depth. He plays the sun, moon and stars of the Pacific Coast Academy, the Crusade, which fights for the situation of all women, for all the equal opportunities of the sexes. <br /> <br /> Perfect everywhere, always with your two loyal communications clubs, Nicole, a beautiful bimbo, who probably has too much cash for his father and a tough chick, Dana, who proves it's a hard nut. Both left the show in Season 2 and Season 1 respectively, rather than blaming it. But the horrors of the horrors, comes Lola, who considers himself the biggest actor from Natalie Wood, green feathers to her hair and fake tan. He's even more rude than Zoey himself, if it's even possible, and even more than Nicole, and hell, we know it's not possible. <br /> <br /> This exhibition, like all television excuses, the Nickelodeon programs, has grown since the 2000s, the main victim of stereotypes. Get a girl in the neighborhood and close to her best friend feelings about her Zoey, great, though inarticulate at times the best boy friend, chase, cool, arrogant lady man, Logan, boy and clothes crazy girl who is not very bright, Nicole who anyone thinks it's just strange because he's extremely smart, joking, quinn, too dramatic, annoying yet super thin, Malibu's picture perfect model, lola and tough yet soft inside woman, Dana. Now that I've heard these characters before? I'm sorry, but what's wrong with the person? Just because Quinn is passionate about science and really cares about his future and does well in the academic aspect where others should worry, is he "weird" and "joking"? At the beginning of the Lola series, a potential big character, where she had her dirty ways and different perspectives on life, was just going to go out, go out of her suitcases, burn her with a bet, go back to a weird city and all that jazz. So many women's rights. Unfortunately, Lola just got something else as an OC clone, all anorexic. Probably so that his mistress will not cross. <br /> <br /> But the 2000 MySpace whores' generation seems to love it with Chase / Zoey's typical fairy-tale romance, tense, "hot" Logan and "tension". kick-ass "Zoey or Dana, whatever you want and real people. Please show us to remind us that people don't like realism, they prefer a different, low and steamy lifestyle. Sorry to break it darlings, it won't happen if you don't have a bigger trust fund and parents to soften you.
