This movie was a big bait and a switch. I rented it because of the popular Christian singer Rebecca St James. I've met her and thought about what she's doing in a UFO movie. Well ....... <br /> <br /> I think he played in this movie to help a friend or friend. My first clue that this movie wasn't what it was supposed to be was when I saw the special effects of UFO meetings. Cheesy! As the film progressed, I noticed that the actors were plastic. It was funny how almost everyone in the film wore solid colors. (There are some exceptions). <br /> <br /> Rebecca was disappointing. She is always in the house and does not show the real facial expressions of her husband who has returned to the valve. Has he ever left the house? <br /> <br /> I had to turn off the movie several times to finish the movie. I hope Rebecca does not believe in the message of this film - the faith we believe or suffer and go to hell. Jesus spread the message of love and hope. His message inspired others to change from love to fear.
