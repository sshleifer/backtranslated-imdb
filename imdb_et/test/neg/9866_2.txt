Sometimes football was thought about, thinking of the legend of the city comic book, the first FF movie is pretty bad as everyone is afraid. I think Marvel Comics pretends that it doesn't exist by 2005. But it's there, a reminder and the last wave of bad, low-budget Marvel super-hero adaptations (Captain America, Punisher, most TV movies). "Low Budget" is a simple description of this FF image. In principle, because of lack of money, showing the powers of super quads was limited to very fast frames (Mr.Fantastic), quasi-animation (Torch) and disappear (invisible girl - the easiest to do). Thing suit was not bad and probably half the budget; the facial part was especially almost convincing. Acting? Alex Hyde-White as Reed is pretty good; the other 3 are okay, Jay, when Johnny sometimes acts as a spa to show off his "hot" mood. The dialogue is a comic book style and it is a supportive cast that can slip, trying to do it. Dr. Doom is over melodramatic and inadvertently comic, and his two main revenge is a case study of how to not act or write a dialogue. <br /> <br /> Plot? Not too good. It was a fairly faithful story of FF origin (more than a later major budget version), and although the non-budget, which was again limited, showing, for example, the actual landing of the crash, it kept important ingredients, how they discovered their powers in an isolated region - this is the best picture part, you have to wait half an hour for it. I found the music odd odd; When these four have swim in these cosmic speeds, the church choir will be heard as if it were a religious experience. The rest, however, is hopeless. Even without a budget, this story could have been done without a jeweler (similar to the Mole Man criminal of books); it spends too much time with him and his underground gang, as well as blind Alicia. These sections are cellulose waste and very boring. The climatic struggle with Doom and his men begins well, but degenerates into a terrible confusion when the torch travels with a laser beam (cool animation but part of a comic book). Fans can laugh at the bad FF FX and the uncomfortable scene if they don't get depressed and outraged first.
