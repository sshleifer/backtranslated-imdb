George Zucco was like Boris Karloff, because no matter how bad the film he appeared was, he would always retain dignity and turn fine. "Mad Monster" is no exception to this rule. All standards have a poor (as fun) movie. The filmmakers probably did not know how to use their small budget, and the script seems to have come out within one or two days. However, Zucco is a good and credible scientist. <br /> <br /> The film itself is enjoyable at camp level. The usual fans of horror movies mostly don't like Chinese movies. However, these Poverty Row products have a small but loyal cult. Sometimes they would go beyond their limits if Detour is the best example of this. They usually seemed like that. For all its technically bad features, The Mad Monster is fun and enough to kill the rainy afternoon. It is recommended to use the Retromedia DVD as it pairs with another PRC production "The Black Raven", the original theater trailer, and best interview with Glenn Strange, who talks about his role in this film. (4/10)
