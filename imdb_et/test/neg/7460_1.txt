No, I'm not a radical feminist who talks to the hentai and yaoi genres, I find it really boring and meaningless. My God, I was MADE that I was looking at it from some foolish punk and my, even MST3K movie, is a story, not to mention that this HENTAI mess is what gives Anime a bad name around the world (watch Sailor Moon!) Understand the people that not all Anime (or any other Asian style) is not buggy. stereotype !!! <br /> <br /> * Starts Ultima Casting *
