The Queen's River is trying to pack a complex, swept, historic narrative in just under two hours. There are some breathtaking battle scenes and the Wanganui landscape is beautifully covered. But the film didn't suffer for some bad drivers - Samantha Morton (Sarah) was particularly inappropriate as convincing. It seems indecisive how the role should be played - as a helpless waif, which is destined to fate, or as a strong, decisive character with a clear view of his fate. The character of Kiefer Sutherland - Private Doyle - seemed pointless and mostly - incomprehensible. Keifer's Irish Broog needs some polishing. On the other hand, Cliff Curtis, Temuera Morrison, and Rawiri Pene (like Sarah's son "Boy") were well rounded and incredible. <br /> <br /> Over the last 20 minutes of the Queen's River came both compressed and hurried. They seemed to decide that they had to tie all open ends before 120 minutes. For example, How on earth Wiremu knew how to find Sarah and Doyle? There is no explanation and no great dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> I went to this movie openly. I had not read or heard anything other than this worrying production. What I experienced was the mish mash of New Zealand's history, beautifully photographed, but ultimately disappointing.
