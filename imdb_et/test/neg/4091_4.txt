I was very pleased with Bruce Almighty, but I found out for a minute that Jim Carey had a sequel, I knew it was bad. Although Steve Carell was hysterical in the first film (one of my favorites), and I think he deserves Emmy for his post, he is rather weak in this boring comedy. I'm curious about how much work script writers put on, because we could do just as well without a story. But even if we destroy large plot holes (why elephants and lions came to Evan when the flood affected only this particular Washington area), the film is just ... not funny. I didn't laugh once and as far as I can remember, comedy should make you laugh. Or at least strangle. Not so. <br /> <br /> However, there is little hope. Evan Almighty has a "family" written all over it and maybe watching the family can be enjoyable (kids can be fun with animals and stupid jokes), but for me, Evan Almighty won't cut it. br /> <br /> I give him 4/10 and hope Carell is more cautious in his role.
