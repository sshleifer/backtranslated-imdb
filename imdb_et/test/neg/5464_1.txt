Well, it definitely stunned me - I can't believe anyone made another Australian movie that's even more boring than Somersault. The story is unlikely, the characters, except Friels and Mailman's characters, are unlikely and wooden, Tom Long has VAST's facial expressions: happy and not happy, and "sexual scenes" that could have been very confusing and erotic would have been small at home with budget porn flick. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I've seen during a 30-year-old cinema that has been sitting on my side .... ready to get up and leave. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is a poster.
