Hollywood has captured yet another garbage that has overheated for the first time. Hannibal is bad, terrible, unfair, flat, droll, idiot, viable, ridiculous and totally cruel. Small spoilers follow ... <br /> <br /> This movie has great logical holes - more than any Bruckheimer / Bay movie - or on that matter - any movie that illustrates Hollywood's exaggeration. This is a fine Hollywood production that aims to cash in on the Hannibal Lector mania, directed by Ridley Scott, director of the "so-somber-he-takes-this-way-too-seriously" hack, and produced by the Hack Italian manufacturer with a pumped ego whose credo is "it doesn't matter if the movie is **, money is good". <br /> <br /> I can't overcome the fact that the acclaimed scriptwriter David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote this fool game, which is a conceptual book of the flat and staircase writer Thomas Harris. David and Steven - well-known and enormously talented scriptwriters - wasted their effort on the poor scenario in exchange for fat deposits. Another factor in the disappointment of this movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many ridiculous scenes to count, which are ridiculous in a terrible implementation and bad logic, eg. Starling / Pazzi mobile phone in the middle of Lecter's action, which is the victim of Inspector Pazzi. Not to mention the ridiculously bad dialogues Tony Hopkins gave to smile and Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta and others who are unable to act in a straight face. Hopkins gives a true meaning to the "chewing of the landscape" with Gary Oldman's bite as a deformed psychopath that is curved against resistance by Lecter. <br /> <br /> The gore effect is good, but only reverses if not. to offer a relationship that is not particularly relevant to Hannibal. The predecessor - the silence of lambs - is more plausible with tension and tension. The thrill is what made the great combination of psychological horror and thriller in the spirit of Lamb Traffic, not to mention perfectly written and tense. The "brain dinner" is so ridiculously fake that it is limited to a parody. <br /> <br /> The end is sure and idiotic - should we believe that Lecter continues to be a dangerous blow to society Because his glittering eye in your eyes? Ooh, scary ... <br /> <br />
