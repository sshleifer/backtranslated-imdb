I'm a dance teacher and I'm looking forward to some good dance in this movie. When sad has been such a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I had a big problem with Jennifer Beals and her character. I found Alex very repulsive. The face of Beals is so young, sweet and innocent, and it is very contrary to Alex's very disturbing embarrassment, especially in this nasty restaurant. She also has a toddler mood. It is very hard to believe that Nick will continue to return to the ridiculous teenager after he has often spoken and abducted, especially after he opens the mobile car door and pulls him with his daughter, choosing to go home - in the middle of the road - with just one foot! !! And after his idiotic behavior after the night ballet. In fact, the whole romance was very disturbing - a 30-year-old man who goes after a girl who looks around at 16th Yuck. <br /> <br /> As far as dancing is concerned, I am afraid that this style of the 80s is completely dated. What on earth was this TV-dance event in the club? Who was supposed to dance? I wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man who's drawn! And even this famous final sequence is quite disappointing, especially considering the ballet company's listening context. The camera shots of his jump actually ruin its effect because you don't see what he does. And what on earth was it when he went to each of the panels facing them? And, as many other remarks have said, he never gets into the ballet company because of its incidence - although they do not say ultimately whether he was successful or not, closing is that he finally won his fear. From "Flashdancers" I thought that the best sequence was Cynthia Rhodes (Penny Dirty Dancing). You saw that he was a real dancer and his acrobatics were very impressive. This is, of course, when you get your terrible costume and makeup. <br /> <br /> There were two good pictures in this movie - ballet dancers who stretched out when Alex was first asking for a hearing - they look so beautiful and stylish, and at least it helps to highlight the difference between his current dance career and what he wants . Another good scene was street dancing. I also liked the skater's parents, they were funny. <br /> <br /> Some other random points - who was Hannah and how did Alex know her? What was 18 years old who lived alone in a rebuilt warehouse? How did he promise that this lovely barre and all the furniture? Was this nude club scene really necessary? The man who wrote in his commentary that this is something of a Disney movie needs to be investigated. And still what happened to the ice skater? Many people said the film was poor, but they liked the message - don't give up hope, continue trying and your dreams come true. See "Little Mermaid".
