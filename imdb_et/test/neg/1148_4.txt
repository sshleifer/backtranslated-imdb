Arthur Miller is always known as one of America's great playwrights for works such as "Seller's Death" and "Crucible". "Focus" is one of his lesser-known games brought to silver. But knowing what a great playwright Arthur Miller is, I doubt that his original game was very similar to a movie. The film is both empty and formal, William H. Macy, a non-Jew who has lost his Jewish anti-Semitic neighbors during World War II in Brooklyn. Don't do me the wrong thing: the actor is OK, and I assume that the people behind this movie probably tried to point out racism, but the film just doesn't work. Macy, Laura Dern and David Paymer are unable to create an effective story here.
