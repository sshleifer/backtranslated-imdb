The opening of the MORTE A VENEZIA is similar to the classical music of Duran Duran's music video and it is the highlighting of the movie <br /> <br /> "What is Theo?" <br /> <br /> Everything but excitement. I doubt whether there has ever been a slower slower moving film than that. Yes, it is a European art house film, so I did not expect the mass murder of Charles Bronson's massacres, but even then I waited for some substance, if not the real plot. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Professor Gustav Voni Aschenbach visits Venice. Gustav visits Venice and goes to the gondola, Gustav eats in an expensive restaurant, Gustav looks out of his hotel window and if it is exciting, Gustav has a setback <br /> <br /> Bad when it was the whole movie, but it gets worse because Gustav announces a beautiful boy teenager. So you have middle-aged academic lusting after some teenage boy whom he has seen, some old queens are becoming stranger. Good movie idea? I don't think so, and thank you for being a homosexual predecessor instead of finding gay porn. <br /> <br /> I notice that many people who praise this movie have tried to understand it. I think I can only be single and non-realistic and say that the only subtext I could associate with was Gustav's physical and emotional decay, but it was not due to the beautiful beauty of teenage boys. boring and proud movie
