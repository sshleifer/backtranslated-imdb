This low-budget movie from a writer who goes to work at the London casino is a terrible script, wood shows and not much to recommend. Of course, this is a call for the "mainstream" to be a curse, and who will automatically add 20 IQ points (excuse Jeff Foxworthy) for listening to the British accent. <br /> <br /> The script is full of holes (whether it has written a book or not?), clichés (communication difficulties: it works days, works nights) and gives so little insight into the basics as the motivation of character that it needs a voice task just move along the story. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to keep the audience from slipping, it includes a street fight scene that is almost as realistic as Julius Caesar's high school production. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​reflective dialogue is "I see your ten and raise you twenty", then RUN will watch this movie. Otherwise, save your money. <br /> <br />
