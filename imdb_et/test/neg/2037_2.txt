I had nothing to do before leaving one night, so I didn't want to see anything too hard, I chose the perfect movie. It must be Barrymore's gift from someone with whom he's sleeping, director Raja Gosnell did nothing but stupid mess, and writing it is just cruel. Which high school can you enroll without a parent or an age or a lack of former training? They promised the kids all without shirts, skin tight tricks, ass shorts and one girl was dressed like Eve, wearing only fig trees? He says he's 25 and his brother is 23, but there is no reluctance to school, parents, or any judgments of the newspaper for fraud or spying? The newspaper boss wants a teacher to catch a minor with a scandal, but doesn't understand that a teacher is 25 years old, so in any case, it would be a retention? Do they allow the camera to record and record private conversations with minors? I don't know if I hired my younger sister to go to HS with my camera and filmed for my underage girls for my staff that I'm not using? NAHHHH No problem. Didn't he have to take a gym at some point or go to the bathroom? Its secondary characters were like cardboard clippings about what high school students think and all were stereotypes. Jessica Alba is just shamefully bad when the camera lootes whenever possible. In what world do parents doubt the school nurse asks his uber-geeky daughter? And they don't ask the man inside to meet him like every other parent. If any of my boys in my school or some other school would have forced my sister and eggs in her spectacles, she would have been in the body that was for her rest. This film is so artificial and predictable that it is nausea, and why eventually all (Alpo girls) rejoice for this chick when they hated him two days before ???? <br /> <br /> DUMB, DUMB AND DUMB.
