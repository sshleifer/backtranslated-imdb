Oh f * cking affection, where should I start ... First; this exhibition is just another stupid American non-funny so-called comedy with a pathetic actor and very bad humor. America's way to ridiculous businesses makes things worse. How do I hear laughter, but nothing happens? Pretty stupid, right? This exhibition is only for those American people who have never heard of being much more fun, better and wittier comedy - not only in Britain but also in America (such as the Simpsons). I just don't understand what "Reba" is so good that it has lasted a long time on television. It has nothing new to offer, it underestimates (possibly) viewers in so many ways, and it just isn't funny at all. I could have lived with such bad examples as "Reba", but why they had to go to hell here in Finland. When I see a few seconds of this terrible show, the rest of the day is destroyed for me. Take my word and believe me - this exhibition sucks the ass even more than these American comedies usually. It's just terrible. Do yourself a favor; never look at this sh * t peace. <br /> <br /> Well, I leave a comment on those who are doing better in this language now. Thank you for your (potential) interest.
