We really don't know where to start talking about this movie. But we start with the plot. We sincerely suspect that someone who wrote / compiled / directed this film never read this book. Because they left the whole point. SATIRICAL, not horror. Just a hint. Second, the bath scene. That's enough. Third, added characters. A gothic gothic lady from France and her black sheet who enjoys hands and joy. We don't understand where that came from. And then there was casting. All these were really unlikely. We were very upset that Catherine and Tilney came together because they were so unlikely that anyone would ever want to see them happy. And ... music. We think the BBC manufacturers ran the money so they attacked their grandmother's attic. And they found some old records. Saxophone, female voices and casual electric guitar. * shaking * <br /> <br /> Plus, the best line ever: "Since you left, the white rose in the bush is dead." If anyone has any explanation, we would be happy to hear it. Because it makes no sense. <br /> <br /> We still do not know what everyone on earth is thinking when they brutally freed the public from this pious apology. We think it should be considered a federal crime. Torture is illegal. <br /> <br /> This movie is still the worst. And I've seen many movies. <br /> <br /> Our recommendation: Give this movie every hatred. They look at it and want to kill. And we agree with the previous post, we would give it 0 if at all possible. DO NOT SEE! And we firmly suspect that everyone who has commented on this movie so far participated in its production. Or they were mentally crazy. These are the only reasons why we have been able to offer what inspires a positive view.
