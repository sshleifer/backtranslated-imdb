That's not exactly what I would call Mad Max movie, having seen Road Warrior and experienced the excellence of this movie, I felt it afterwards. Supposedly, it started as a kind of child in the desert and was merged with the Mad Max franchise (bad idea). Pouring wasn't exactly the best, I mean coming to Tina Turner? One of the main problems with this movie is that there are no good crooks. No Wez, no Humung, not even a good trainer! Nothing will even happen if you plan to see a plan for seeing this minimum parameter (can it even be called?), Make sure you see Mad Max 2 or Mad Max or better. Another problem with this movie is that there are too many people, even the Thunderdome battle series is boring, Max doesn't even kill anyone! The music is bad, the characters are bad (not in good ways), and after the movie, my taste was very bad.
