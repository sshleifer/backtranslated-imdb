Ditzy girl (yes, ditzy is about as complex as her character gets) does not accept the answer and makes exotic things to get her husband back. It is too far-fetched to be credible with such thin characters that move through the movements. But not drawn far enough to be exciting as they say, "Being John Malkovich". So it ends up boring. <br /> <br /> sv
