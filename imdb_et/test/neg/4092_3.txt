The biggest problem with this movie is that it is nothing like Bruce Allmighty. The first film played the fantasy of every day folk that she could control her surroundings. However, Evan's experience is completely different. He has no control over Jim Carrey's fool, and the story focuses on the power of faith. Now it would have been good, because the first film announced the same message. The problem is that the sequel preaches at the expense of comic relief. And to add an insult, it also puts the plot on politics. You have a clear feeling that this movie has a clear message, and its main purpose is not to make you laugh. All in all, this film has failed in the mix of "The Distinguished Gentleman" by Eddie Murhphy and "Ten Commandments" by Charlton Heston. I'm not sure if Steve Carrell is guilty here, you feel his character is limiting his abilities as a comedian, the former news anchor Evan Baxter shouldn't be funny, he's basically the main character. which then only adds confusion about what these films should be.
