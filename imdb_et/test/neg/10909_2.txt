As a great fan of the Conte d'ete (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115940/), I waited for her to be admired by another French beach romance with a lot of honesty, realism and humor. The same manager, the same actor - what could go wrong? Unfortunately, Pauline a la plange is a big disappointment. It is very slow and conversational, which would be good if the dialogue would convey symbols, it was meaningful or original. But it is a typical soap opera that alternates between insignificant pillow talk and jealous accusations. The only thing that captures the complete catastrophe of this movie is the small amount of character formation or at least "character change" with Pauline. The source material is the usual price (sexual awakening during the beach holiday), but it could have been a decent film if some characters were interesting enough. Unfortunately, this is not the case. If there are other shortcomings in the Rohmer season cycle, most of his later films are definitely higher than his leagues.
