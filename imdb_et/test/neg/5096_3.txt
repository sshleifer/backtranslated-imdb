With an interesting assumption (in conflicts between Europeans and indigenous peoples, sometimes the battle lines have not been so clear), it should have been a good film. But the story is sabotaged by the overwhelming self-esteem of the director, which is a very bad script in its own way. <br /> <br /> Yes, the natural setting is beautiful and yes, this film is authentic in a 19th century historical setting. But the filmmaker will lily lily over and over, adding a layer after the top musical accompaniment, not to mention a completely unnecessary voice command that will ultimately amaze the viewer and take the story off with attention. <br /> <br /> It was clear to me that the director was with his microscopic neighbors, and the endless repetition of the "Danny Boy" (all!) musical motif attempted to make a New Zealand version of the epic Sergio Leone movie, once after the West. But given the seriousness of this story (most of Leone's westerns had a cheeky tongue), not to mention that it was no longer in 1968, he managed to make a parody. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
