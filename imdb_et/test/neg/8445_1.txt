WARNING: I recommend that anyone who has not seen the movie yet read this comment. <br /> <br /> If you plan to watch this movie, DON'T! I'm warning you ... this movie is TERRIBLY boring and basically frightening, not Horror movie to watch. I missed this Piranha movie for another Piranha movie and when I noticed that I made a mistake, I decided to watch it. I wish I hadn't. This film is so terrible and so intolerable in every material I could not let anyone say that the film was half-decent. First of all, this movie should be called "The Eternal Call of Wilderness" instead of Piranha. They only show the pirans ONCE! While this movie sounded so badly heard, I only got 20 minutes to sleep. Finally my mouth was hung and I looked quietly on the blank TV screen. This is a very poorly managed and poorly filmed junk that I was afraid of having brain dysfunction after brain tracking ...
