Apparently, many people really enjoyed this movie and it is great. This is definitely a very well-intentioned film and I appreciate it in the era of heartless or emotionally damaging films. Unfortunately, the film has a lot of problems and it was not something I was watching. <br /> <br /> The primary problem is writing. It's not just that funny. If something tries to be gentle or witty and fails, it is much worse than trying it at all. This film is largely "perfect", but among the gentle setbacks of adult family members, none of them seem imaginative or apt. There are also some central spaces in the film that seem to be too much of a random or characteristic motivation to be credible or really working. Part of the back story seemed more intriguing and served to decorate the story around the edges quite well, but it wasn't able to compensate for the momentary smoothness that passed through almost the entire film. <br /> <br /> Leadership / editing does not support the movie even though I don't know how to do it. Sometimes I always seemed to be fake, and the actors mostly forced me through unnatural material. They tried and I don't blame anyone here. There were too many small and charming roles outside of a close family. <br /> <br /> However, I don't like a good rental, although probably many people found it very charming (I'm 38; I suspect people over 60 could enjoy this movie more?).
