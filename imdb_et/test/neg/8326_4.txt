"Black Vengeance" is the alternative title of "Ying hung ho hon" AKA "Tragic Hero" (1987). I've just seen it in VHS with the first part of the story, "Gong woo ching" ("Rich and Famous"), also in 1987. (The poster and 2 photos on the page are for 4-DVD) films starring Rod Perry (The Black Gestapo), Fred Williamson (Black Cobra 2), Richard Lawson (Black Fist), the fourth movie is "The Black Six"). Oddly enough, while characters retain their original names "Rich and Famous", "Black Vengeance" Chow Yun-Fat character is called Eddie Shawiks, Alex Man (male Tze Leung) is Harry and Andy Lau of Johnny. It is also confusing that 1994 is the copyright date for both films. Perhaps it was the year they were duplicating America. According to the release dates published in IMDb, "Tragic Hero" appeared before "Rich and Famous". Was there a first order? Despite comments from some users, I enjoyed these movies, although they are not among the best in CYF, such as "The Killer" and "Hard-Boiled", which are truly amazing. However, if one day I meet the "Rich and Famous" and "Tragic Hero" 2-DVD set, I don't want to buy it. Hopefully, these remarks about "Black Vengeance" will come out, which was also a mystery to me about where he belonged to Chow's Yun-Fat filmography.
