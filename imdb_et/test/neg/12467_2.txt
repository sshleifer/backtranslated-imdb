TART is the worst film I saw this year and includes both Affleck / J.Lo bomb GIGLI and Rob Zombie borefest HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. I do not know if this is a fair comparison if you see that the TART has been made two years earlier and is likely to have a budget lower than even a low budget of 1000 CORPSES. Regardless of the fact that all three films suffer from the same drawbacks: terrible script, terrible action, terrible direction. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** (although I honestly don't think anything is corrupted) <br /> <br /> TART is a group of super-spoiled private school students. Most of them live in super-sized apartments with the New York Hyper-High Park Avenue, thanks to their neglected parents' finances. The film introduces the purposeful life of one student (Cat) as he casts his only true friend (so frivolous as he was) toward the "good life" of the crowd. This naturally brings about sex, drugs and music, which is significantly worse than rock & roll. Everything is too dramatic, so really bad movies are usually. The first sexual experience of cats leads to its military brand and its newly acquired fellowship; his first meeting with drugs leads to almost all of his landfill being dumped when his cohorts believe he is dead due to overdose. There were no tough orders, he said sarcastically. <br /> <br /> Mainly it has "seen 100 times" the graph. Other minor and even less interesting plot detail includes one friend who steals jewelery and trinkets from everyone else, the wild child who lives on the edge (and eventually falls to EAST in Hamptons for one night), the anti-Semitic British chick who finishes his close friendship with Cat at the moment when she finds the cat has a Jewish father, and Cat's tight relationship with her only mother who is trying to successfully get Cat to assess her privileged life. Early on, it turns out to be an irreversible lifetime. "Wild Child" is played as a tinted version of one Hilton sister. The British girl disappears after the break. The mother / daughter relationship is considered to be the ultimate skeletal scene of the film, unlikely to have reconciliation between her and her mother. * awake * <br /> <br /> *** CLOSED *** <br /> <br /> Cast and crew ... Dominique Swain came to a scene where he was a minor seducer in 1997 is very observable LOLITA and FACE / OFF. His performances were strong enough to land on quite a few lists at that time. He was 17 years old and I hope they are not the best roles in his career. If he takes on a few more roles as he does in TART, it can be very good. <br /> <br /> I have seen Bijou Phillips in only one other film (BULLY) and I swear that he will fill this one was almost identical with him. I am not sure if he is unable to perform different performances, or if it was just a coincidence, his roles were very similar in two. I think the first is true. I feel that this woman has very little talent in acting. Here he is an actress to throw a Hilton sister. To give him such a weak result, he is amazing, as he grew up and remains with his friends in the actual Hilton's sisters. He's basically playing his own version of this movie and doing the fucking job of that fucking guy. <br /> <br /> About writer / director Christina Wayne ... I don't know anything about her except TART was her first, and only a film project. With such a first effort, it is no wonder that his career in the exhibition project was short-lived.
