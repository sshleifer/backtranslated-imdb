Genre: Cartoon short, without dialogue, African girl and lion. <br /> <br /> The main characters: Inca, Lion and Minah bird. <br /> <br /> What happens: The lion wants to eat an African girl named Inki. It is also quite confusing for Minah bird. Is he on the side of Inca or Lion ..? <br /> <br /> Message: Erm ?? <br /> <br /> My Thoughts: I agree with Lee Eisenberg, it means poor African people !! :-( I like how the main character, Inki (who is an African girl) is pretty nice main character, but they still depict her insecure and make the younger audience not very pleasing to her just because she is HUNTING !! GRRR CHARLES M JONES! I don't like the lion very much, and I think Minah bird is ALL RIGHT (I think). I prefer Charles M. Jones' Looney Tunes cartoons in the future. <br /> <br /> You still want to watch it then I recommend YouTube. Just enter "Inki" on the main page and you are there. <br /> <br /> I wish Charles M. Jones had been the most beautiful Inki in this short time. So. <br /> <br /> Recommended: People who are interested in old cartoons and / or people who just go around on You Tube.
