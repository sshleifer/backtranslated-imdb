First of all, let me say that I love God's terrible movies. Especially horror movies. I watched hundreds of movies from the Mystery Science Theater 3000 without pain. But this is the absolute worst film on the planet! I had to turn it off, it was so bad. It was unusual and just plain. Give me 3 back views of Manos's fate or Monster A-go-go any day. Avoid this movie like plauge !! Now, excuse me, when I go out of my eyes, to clean up the mess I had to look to get a good rating for this movie. Only one dignified gag in what I looked at was now the destruction pair of Hitmen Exterminators. Even that wasn't great.
