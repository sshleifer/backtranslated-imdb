In most cases, the biblical mumbo-jumbo, which pulls over two hours, is not included. The only thing that records this movie from God's Word (and there is only one God, remember) is inadvertently a funny dialogue and a good battle scene that's too late in the movie. Most of the two hours until the action scenes are spoken too much; the dialogue is so wrong that the movie just comes up to make MST3K corrupt. <br /> <br /> George Sanders is absolutely terrible; one of the most animated, too dramatic performances I've ever seen. Brynner is not much better; his rigid, wood-working combination with the words of the fearsome game of wisdom is quite boring and stupid for Solomon. Every time Brynner opens his mouth, there seems to be something safe and ridiculously high and powerful. To some extent, this is not the fault of Sanders and Brynner, because it is a dirty, comic dialogue and a typical biblical one-dimensional characterization, but they did little else. Brynner's accent even reminiscent of Schwarzenegger; this is not a plus. Only Lollobrigida can avoid embarrassment by playing a role with more convictions and in a suitable way that fits in such a silly movie. Describing these biblical letters as one-dimensional would be too inadequate credit; the characterization is half-dimensional.
