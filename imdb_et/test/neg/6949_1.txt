Awful, waste of time. There is no camp or trash value in it. Better amateur movies have been made for children from 10 to 12 years old in film clubs. <br /> <br /> How can anyone shoot video about vampires and lesbians? <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that would bring together a couple of vampire / sadochism enthusiasts in one room and just shoot it. <br /> <br /> There was nothing good about the movie. There were no plots, real actors, real special effects, humor. Some overweight Goths who touch each other cannot be called a sex scene. Nothing at all. <br /> <br /> Well, the cemetery was great, but the dark vampire movie had to be shot in the dark. <br /> <br /> The goal was probably good: make Ed Wood's spirit trash. The problem is that a bad movie cannot be intentionally done. It takes talent and effort to make a "real" movie. Ed Wood might have had the money, but he was definitely struggling. These men didn't have everything. Ed Wood was a genius compared to these men.
