It is quite typical for the Sci-Fi channel: one-dimensional characters, a ridiculous plot and terrible special effects. We have some alien socks dolls on the train and Lou Diamond Phillips does his best to give a little presentation. And save the day. All others in it are completely free; a former husband who goes through a timed clich√©, the first one who doesn't like Lou, of course, has to love him again. A disgusting state senator, who starts to munched early, and strangle the murderous guards who run around a lot. Then there is an eco-terrorist who has been in this film for some reason, except to give us a 3% more run. He spends the entire middle of the movie hiding in the box. <br /> <br /> Special effects really deserve your cut. Let's start with the meteorite that flies through the air, behind the lights, about 100 miles per hour. According to the physics of this film, if you exceed the speed limit allowed in your car, atmospheric friction can cause a fire. Then it lands on the hood of a car coming horizontally. Like a velcro ball, which I think will land on the velcro floor. It doesn't harm the car much, just worships the hood a bit. Later Lou goes to the helicopter and drives after the train. Even if the train had only a two-minute start, it takes half an hour. The CGI is so bad that the helicopter looks like it's as big as the mountains it drives. Then it flies to the hill - this effect must be seen in faith. They seemed to take a can of gasoline and threw it against the wall, then placed a flame effect over the helicopter. About 10 times too big. No wonder the helicopter was unable to get up in time, carrying five tons of nitro-glycerin. Then the eco-terrorist blows up eventually, but in all directions, like most explosions, it explodes, exploding upwards like a cannon that is directed into the air. Then there is the whole thing that does not allow the train to stop because it would allow small aliens to come off, but it seems that foreigners can actually travel faster with the train, so why does it keep them on the train I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Generally, if you have a couple of hours to absolutely be killed, and that is only due to this movie or the food network switching, think about some of their chefs being kind of cute. Typically, these films have at least one or two of them that allow them to sit; maybe there is a sexy girl, some R&D or a character that actually has some personality or some relationship or something. I really didn't see it here.
