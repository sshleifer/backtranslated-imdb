First of all I have to say that I love Udo Kier and I have always respected Armand Assante, but nothing saves this train wreck from the movie. Udo doesn't even appear much later in the movie, and the actor "Everyone" is just terrible. The script is all over the place, the dialogue is wooden, the "action" is ridiculous and the plot can be summed up with a dirty cocktail sage. I really wanted to find something that redeemed in this movie, but I found myself holding my hands, shaking my head and repeating time and again, "Oh Udo ..... why? ???". If you're a fan of Udo or Armand, don't look at this movie. It only makes you sad.
