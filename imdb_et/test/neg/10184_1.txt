Movies about U.F.O. are always a nice way to kill for a while, so I rushed to hope for rain on Sunday evening, waiting for what to expect from the live DVD U.F.O. mystery. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong? Approximately half the film shows that U.F.O. the topic is just a deceptive way to attract uninvited viewers into this Christian propaganda. And this is not just the average Christian of a Christian film. No, it is Christianity of extreme fundamentalist Christianity. A terrifying nature. <br /> <br /> At the end of this movie, their colleagues will not find the incredible practical jokes, thinking that Rapture has begun (what Christians believe it will be) at the end of time, when true believers go to heaven and non-believers will be left behind) . <br /> <br /> When jokes are explained, it is advisable to always be a true believer, ‚Äùjust as we Christians are right. Now, when I am asked, is Christian when you ask me! <br /> <br /> This movie is still trying to convert non-believers into intimidation tactics. "Believe in God or go to hell!" is the message here. Simple but quite offensive. Especially because this movie is sold something completely different. Let's say you're a Christian fundamentalist yourself and you're probably not offended by the themes of this movie, is it a good movie? I'm afraid it's not. Actually, I'm not lying: I'm nice, it's not! The action is terrible, the pace is terrible, the plot is terrible, especially the end is ridiculously bad. As soon as the movie begins, you will immediately feel it is worse than you expected, and you are right. <br /> <br /> In the first half of the year, it seems to be trying to at least create a satisfying mystery of the UFO, but then they suddenly bring a look similar to that of Dracula, which begins to blow around the devil. First of all, you think this guy is just a crazy maniac, but as it turns out, he actually represents the actual views of the filmmakers. As soon as you begin to understand it, you know how it will end. But actually it gets worse. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
