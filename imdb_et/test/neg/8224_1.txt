OK, so I have to start this review, saying I'm really looking forward to this valve for several months, I use it to look at my trailer and I think it looked really cool. The leading turf was his trailer. <br /> <br /> In the cinema I watched the first three shots of this movie and, although it wasn't that bad for me, don't be an idiot, give him a chance! You saw only 3 minutes "when I broke my eyes. All of these shots showed .... I get this guy with a poker face (because he doesn't know something that is deep), looking directly at the center of the camera in the middle of the frame. in the third he is awake in his perfect bed (because he sleeps like a dead man ... because he doesn't know anything) and his father is calling and says "John Garden State, me, your dad" .... Ah now! I've seen a little more than a few flicks to hate clichés like "it's me, you (insert parent)", how the hell should I react ?: "Oh, she's a hard relationship with her" .... uh ... yes, that's just as I should respond .... <br /> <br /> Man, this is a dirty movie ... <br /> <br /> Every time we flick, we learn things about his friends, Everyone is an ALTERNATIVE EMO WALKING INDIE MOVIE CLICHÉ, for example, one of his acquaintances is a man who works in a medieval themed restaurant that talks about Klingon (Bizarre characters + Po culture = your usual American indie flick). Then we know the nature of Natalie Portman, who is a copy of Alissa Jones (a movie that captures GS's ass, Chasing Amy), Amelie, and Eternal Sunshine's chick ... you know, smart, original (not actually), cultured, beautiful and ... with your sexuality (!). He listens to the 70s band The Shins and gives ... what? are they the tenth of this fucking? Then why do they sound so? Oh, they have no personality, OK ..... so he tells his CD player John Garden State and he looks at him with a fool (you know, love). As the song was playing, I heard the words saying: "You love this soundtrack, it's so alternative and cool, you love this movie, it defines you and your generation, even if it's a breakfast club's ideological light, Ghost World and all the other 20's. annual smart movies drink coffee and read books that you don't understand "... <br /> <br /> There is now an unoriginal beginning. ... he doesn't care if he dies in an airplane crash (because he's already dead ... and he doesn't know anything) and he'll let us know about the scene that was taken directly from the unknown film FIGHT CLUB! !!, this is a cool scene, but, did I mention that it appeared in the trailer? ....... then in some party, and just when you think this guy is really deep and unusual, bimbo .... so oh, he's not as emotional zombie after ... clever character formation or just sh! tty movie? ...... well, lets analyze this scene, he has his sitting motionless a cou ch all others who are moving at a really fast speed ...... scene idea taken directly from an unknown movie namely REQUIEM FROM A DREAM! ...... so it's just sh! tty, sh! tty movie ... <br /> <br /> Then they meet the more eccentric (cliché) characters and finally the big hole on the ground. John Garden State says some nonsense like "happiness to explore his infinite abyss" and the man says .... and now I wanted to really stifle myself, "You too" ............. and then we are gently told that Neo is Jesus .... oh no, wait, this is another piece of fool, obvious, repetitive, overpriced and cliché. <br /> <br /> Finally (Finally !!!!), a little more nonsense happens and he enters the big warehouse display for breaking bombs: he has to talk to his father whom he has not seen in the last zillion year because he killed his mother . .. (you see, she killed her mother so she is dead ....... and feels something ..... it's deep). Now, I was really wise and moving Magnolia's similar dialogue between father and son ...... but it's a garden, so it's pretty much: -John Garden State: Dad, I forgive you, you didn't give you I don't know what did you do when you stunned me in the zillion years, but i know you love me - dirty director's father: no !!! No !!!! I say some simple things, because I'm not as deep as a character as this whole movie, so it's not !!!! -John Garden State: There is no father, we have to miss, because we are equal persons ..... I mean different people - dirty director's father: No !!! No !!!! ............ OK, you convinced me. <br /> <br /> And she gets a girl (because she is no longer dead, you know) and the movie ends and I'm going to eat a piece of chicken that makes my day .... <br /> <br /> It's done a movie with a trailer sucks
