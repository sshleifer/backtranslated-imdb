I don't like more than a smiling kung-fu movie. This is the main reason I can't stand Jackie Chan (or his appearance). He was not always a clown, I have to add. "My Young Aunt" is the worst type of martial arts. This is a perfect example of how the subtype with infinite foolishness and childish behavior was taken to the mud. If you are not 5 years old, I really do not understand how someone could find such a movie funny. But humor is indeed a very subjective thing. Personally, I think such an approach has permanently damaged a beloved subgroup. I thought the leading lady Kara Hui was great here. But I had such a hard time sitting through that I couldn't enjoy my fine performance. If you don't mind all the stupidities, you can enjoy it. I know I didn't.
