you know, I'm always a fictional or strange movie, especially when they show at the Hamburg Fantasy Film Festival in Germany. but unconscious cruelty was probably the worst film of this year. does this comment include a spoiler? <br /> <br /> No, because I just didn't understand this movie. but well what can you expect from the festival crowd, "we (festival boys) know that not all of you will see it until the end" ... <br /> <br /> I like spraying and I also like a strong graphic language movies. but it? there are many bloody scenes, but why? what director has told us? Does he say we lost all morals and all religious feelings? or does he say that incest is always a disaster? who knows - i don't. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that keeps you thinking for a while - look at it. but don't think i think "wow, i got the message" - i didn't get it ...
