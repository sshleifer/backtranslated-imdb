I must admit that I am disappointed after seeing this movie. I had been waiting so much for trailers. The film was absolutely terrible. It lacked a real story and the action was not exactly the best. Don't waste your time. The film is not what the trailers think you think. I have to say that I usually don't write anything about an IMDb movie (actually it is my first one), but this movie was so disappointing that I registered people not knowing their time or money wasting. The story is what should happen, and it seems to have the potential to be good, but things in the film are a bit far removed to be credible. Instead, watch another movie, maybe an inner man?
