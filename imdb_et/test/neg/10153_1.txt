I got this "Scream Theater" with a double DVD and it is undoubtedly one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen. And I've seen some very bad ones. The school is out and three of the girls (who would be teenagers who would eat a hat) speak of a "non-stop party", so of course they all go to this girl whose parents are the toughest sleepy. Meanwhile, the psychotic has escaped from a local prison, where one girl's father works and is loose with sharp objects and carries green peeling and eyes wide-eyed sports ... I think it's a show that she's buggy. Of course, because he has the bone he chooses with that particular doctor, he goes to his house, which is probably well known. In the meantime, some dark types of jocke are scaring beers and girls, and naturally loony appears and begins to cut the throat. And this is because heavy metal music chugs along the background. Or maybe this is not the case, but it is all you need to know. If you don't spend your time permanently hardened or drunk, you'll find little interest here, and even if you mostly waste time, you'll probably find your intelligence. 1 out of 10.
