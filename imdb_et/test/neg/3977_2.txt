I've never seen this movie, but like many others who have already commented, I saw it as an MST3K episode. Really terrible 70s TV. But no one saw their potential because it just turned into a $ 125 million flop called the island. <br /> <br /> And for this person who asked if there were any good movies in the 70s, I would like to remind him that this was the golden time of American film with leaders like Robert Altman and Martin Scorcese. Not to mention the small things like Star Wars (1977). Just a reminder that the 70s were much more creative than the 21st century.
