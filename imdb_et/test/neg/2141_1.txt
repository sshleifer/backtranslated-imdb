I can't get over how terrible this movie was. My eyes want to jump out of my head and my ears bleed from a terribly terrible soundtrack. There are four kids and dogs and they run out of the hospital and get away with stealing two cars and buses. No one gives them any punishment or anything to fix them. The actor is just so terrible that it sounds like a video tutorial for a social learning class. I can't think of one thing I like about this movie. Something. Even a child who loses his dog made me vomit. He gets his dog back without even the lady seeing the dog run out of the door. Maybe the dog tried to get out of this movie. Then the whole mixture is horse meat. Watching this movie was torture. Finally, the eldest boy says that something that stays together is not a crime and they hug him and love him. Stealing gas is a crime. Stealing two cars and buses is a crime and should have gone to a juvenile hall or something. Avoid this movie at all costs and especially if you want to keep your family together.
