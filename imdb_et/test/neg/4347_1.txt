I had no idea what these films were, it jumps from the plot line to draw a line that unites inconsistent ideas. it just doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Also, cut timeline doesn't help. we start today to get flash back to the past and then return to the future to go back to the past. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of terrible happy lines and cliché themes like princess and pauper, "you don't even get my death" lines, "you don't love me enough" line. cliché max! <br /> <br /> The fighting scene was terribly brilliant, the lighting was constantly placed wrong, which compensated CG with the actors (meaning that you could say that some backgrounds were clearly CG). <br /> <br /> Although the community di moonis was quite interesting. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone, avoiding if possible. <br /> <br /> If you found this comment difficult to follow, the film would be equally bad.
