If I like it, you enjoyed the first film "Bruce Almighty", my advice is not too high on your hopes; In fact, we ignore any hope you have for this movie if you are over 12 years old and have no idea at all. <br /> <br /> Without giving it too much, the story of Evan (the first anchor in Bruce's nemesis) moves with his family home to Virginia's suburbs to transform the world into a new political path. The following is a fairly far-fetched and rather silly story that is obviously aimed at the target group of young children. Unlike its predecessor, Evan Almighty is a family film that has a "comedy" ambiguous genre marked with a misleading "sequel", some of which find a modern comedy with a classic that can be enjoyed a bit more mature, expensive. In general, Evan means Almighty's own terrible cinematic values. Functional; Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman remained stiff, and many characters were seemingly thrown to use unnecessarily high output. In addition, the legend of John Goodman has been cast, which makes it look like a bow and is seen only a few times as a film; I didn't buy this character enough and thought that the story he was involved with was not even for family comedy. The movie's every other character (especially the woman and the kids!) Deserve the reputation of their acting so cheesy that it could fill a king-size Kiev. Be warned, however; this is a typical American cheddarfest that is associated with many traditional family movies, so I would recommend protecting myself with the closest latch. <br /> <br /> It may seem like a movie is worthless so far, but it has some promising aspects. CGI was remarkable and it was clear that a lot of time Arki went on modeling and creating water effects and computer animation. Used particles, forms, and textures were aesthetically accurate. Although some of them were unable to help, but I think they were unreliable for a movie with such bad ideals and, in my opinion, were too good for this cinema and wore the movie all the time. <br /> <br /> In general, I see this movie as a disaster in view of what was a great potential franchise, but unfortunately it was bad for the omnipotent series and at the end of the film I approached the epic for a high and somewhat meaningful finale to make up for mediocre content what I had seen so far. That was not the case and I was deeply disappointed and confused to get a closing credit. When I sat down for dissatisfaction, I couldn't help but I think this movie was not as close as I expected. In many ways, the film reminded me of the "night in the museum", because it showed similar style and qualities, but unfortunately it was even below the leagues. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie out of 10 out of 10 because it is traceable, but it must be avoided! If you have to see this movie, be prepared for disappointment, because 'lightly entertaining' is the best thing you could expect to see in this production.
