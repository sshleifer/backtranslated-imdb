It's just the same old crap that comes from amateur idiots who have no idea how to make a movie - maybe it's just a video-movie! <br /> <br /> I think it's my fault to actually spend money (one of the worst decisions I've ever made). What waste. I usually like B-movies, some of them are really good - but it's just too ridiculous and stupid to even be funny. <br /> <br /> The losers who made this junk are desperate for wasting time and money on doing business by making a movie that obviously doesn't deserve the film! These so-called filmmakers have absolutely no talent! <br /> <br /> Stupid bog, terrible action (especially queens queens - what sick people actually find that sexy?!), lame writing (if there was even a script - it looks like a little bull **** someone just made on the spot ) <br /> <br /> What is stunning about this movie is its complete drawback at all. <br /> <br /> How much attention to detail would be needed to make sure that each movie's frame would be so far below reasonable standards? I do not believe that such a bad film can be deliberately done, and it is inconceivable that bad luck alone can produce such consistently terrible results. <br /> <br /> Anyway, avoid this stink bomb! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
