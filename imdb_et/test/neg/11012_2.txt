The anchors are shown as caricatures because they can take away chicken legs, watermelons, people, etc. This can be a marvelous feature, because the ants carry the film in Phase IV. It is not because they want, but because they have to do it. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a narrator explaining that a cosmic event is above the earth and that a fellow has worked to influence this disorder with the antenna population. The film is in cut segments; the first part after the cosmic event is Phase I and so on until the end of the movie, which is Phase IV. <br /> <br /> What is Phase IV? Who knows? We can't see this part; he probably has something to do with a researcher and an girl living in the area. A girl who looks like a cross between Alicia Silverstone and Liv Tyler is angry at the ants because they killed her horse, but except for one angry outbreak, the biometric blanket ("Clueless") goes around. /> <br /> These ants are pretty smart; or scientists are pretty stupid. I give credit to the ants. Why? Something that usually destroys my picnics, which can then build reflective towers, blow up trucks, and adapt to the poison most easily, becomes my voice for being a smarter species, at least in this movie. <br /> <br /> Sterno says stomp in this anthill. <br /> <br />
