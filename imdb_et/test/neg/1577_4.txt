After being blocked by snowstorms, Jason (Adam Beach), a road patrolman, arrives at the canteen of his friend Fritz (Jurgen Prochnow) and advises his clients that they can only follow their trip the next day. Among strange strangers, Jason meets his former gold with Nancy (Rose McGowan) who just left his man in Los Angeles. At night, without any communication with his base, Jason faces customers with distress and suspicious situations, and finds some corpses that show that there is a killer among them. <br /> <br /> The "last stop" can be an average thriller, but the scenario is just terrible. Most of the characters are despicable, and the surprising motives of the serum killer are not made public and the viewers no longer have an explanation of why the killer decided to kill the guests. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Encurralados" ("Trapped")
