The digital effects were made inexpensive and the activity sequences have no relation. It was mostly TV and it shows. David Suchet seems boring and Nigel Planer provides embarrassing! and like Robert Carlyle's Dick Van Dyke London Accent, don't comment! If you want to go away in an hour or two, you will do so. If your DVD is buying, wait a few weeks and take it down in the Asda's affordable container, cos it is where its title is! If the budget were bigger and Richard Doyle's book followed closely, there could have been something special, but because it is a bit bad. Look instead at the trailer! Or read the book and see what might have been.
