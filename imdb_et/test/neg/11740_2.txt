* SPOILERS INCLUDED * <br /> <br /> The brilliant and innovative adaptation of Alfred Hitchcock's Robert Bloch novel was an amazing film, unlike anything from the previous one. Each shot, the angle of each camera, each nuance was PERFECT. He did not violate the rules but formed a whole new set. <br /> <br /> Here is a spoiler: there is nothing new, different or original in this movie. Gus Van Sant does not respect Hitch, he rejects every idea and does it less in an original, more usual way. Before that movie, I didn't see anything against Gus Van Santi. I liked the Cowboy pharmacy and I thought my own private Idaho was a very interesting movie. The question that burns in my mind when it comes to Psycho's remake is, "Why did you do that, Gus?" <br /> <br /> In my opinion, there are only two reasons to make a remake: 1) The original was a good story, but the film was sucked. 2) The original was a good movie, but no one has thought of a fresh new approach to the material. None of these factors exist at all in the Gus Van Sant Psycho version. Apart from being a color and there is one scene where there is a disruption of disturbing images associated with a possible inner core of the title core (which I found unnecessary), there's nothing new here. Moreover, I found that casting was something unwanted. Anne Heche was like Marion, but she didn't have a certain vulnerability, which Janet Leigh originally portrayed. I did not feel sympathy for my character, because the choices she faced seemed much less restricted to a woman in today's society, unlike the choices she would have seen for a woman living in the early 1960s. Vince Vaughn got a few laughs when he gave the very naive Norman Bates, but I feel that Anthony Perkins' timing and nervous, haunting look was much more crappy. The only performance I enjoyed better than the original was Lila Crane, played by Jullianne Moore. He was traditionally superb and brought a new strength and intelligence to the character. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there is also a beautiful camera work, especially during the famous "bathroom scene" where Van Sant uses his color to show murder in dark colors. But during the whole movie I had this irritating dance vu feeling. Haven't I seen it before? Wait, I've seen it before! Almost every scene is considered as an original test. You almost feel that the director made this film a school project. "Look, I can make a Hitchcock movie!" <br /> <br /> If you haven't already, look, check out the original. It has grown over the years and wins this mediocrity, hands down. You don't have to be disappointed.
