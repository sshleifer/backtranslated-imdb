I never want to see this movie again! <br /> <br /> Not only is this terribly bad, but I can't stand my hero Stan Laurel looking so old and sick. <br /> <br /> Mostly I can't watch this terrible movie! <br /> <br /> Frankly, there's no reason to watch this terrible movie. The plot is just stupid. The actors around Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are really bad and Laurel and Hardy have been more fun with their earlier films! <br /> <br /> I warn you not to see it, the images haunt you for a long time!
