This terrible piece was (comfortably) loosely true to the story of two of my family members (played by Jack Thompson and Jacqueline Mackenzie). <br /> <br /> This film is offensive; besides being not a particularly good movie anyway, it in no way loses such a close family member and completely excludes those who were really affected by the real tragedy of life. > <br /> President; he managed to fail the money for the family for the Porsche price. <br /> <br /> If I could have given it to zero, I would have it. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
