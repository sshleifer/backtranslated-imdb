Considering that they wanted to make a vampire movie in space, I thought, "Well, it's probably pretty funny, but at least interesting enough to see the whole genre differently." Silver. I don't care what kind of movies you want; even if you are the world's greatest vampire, horror, thriller or fan, or if you have never seen a horror movie and expect your first to be impressive in some way ... you are wrong. I don't think I've ever seen it being "made for a TV movie" or after school. I've never seen a TV pilot with this bad thing. I've never seen materials that are as bad as sleeping or shining. This is by far the biggest waste of hours you might otherwise spend considering the importance of a cup towel and their impact on your life. I'd rather have a bath trap for weeks not to consume anything but my own urine and stools, even looking at one movie again. Looking at it made me want the characters to fall instead of knowing that I was paying the money to watch it. But it was like a train wreck: so bad you just couldn't look any way, hoping something might happen. It wasn't. Please, for God's love, if you or your friends - even if you use illegal substances - even consider watching this movie, then choose instead to see who can shoot the missile rocket further. It brings you much more enjoyment and entertainment.
