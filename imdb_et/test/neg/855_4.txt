Spike Milligan was one of the funniest men I've ever seen and a huge impact on my life. <br /> <br /> This movie is stupid and terrible and doesn't remember your memory. The script is full and retains too many lines from the book that are intact (feet jokes here are incomprehensible). The performers' performances are equally ineffective, the big garbage is wasted and the leader, Sean Hughes, gives Milligan's militant hostile booms that miss the point completely. <br /> <br /> Gentle stimulation is the killer as well. Farce should speed up the end. The Goon often shows, the novel "Puckoon" certainly did, but this film, if any, slows down just when you want the various elements to be able to get together. <br /> <br /> Milligan narrated the shortened "Puckoon" sound recording in 1980 with McKenna, Dermot Kelly, Norma Ronald and Jack Hobbs. It's funny now. Ten minutes of it is more fun than this whole movie. I believe that LP was handed over to the CD, but I don't know if it's still printed. <br /> <br /> Jim Dale and Arthur Lowe have the film "Adolf Hitler: My Part of His Fall". This is also a godawful confusion, but it is more fun than this thing. <br /> <br /> It's possible that Milligan's spirit is too rambled for the screen. Other reviewers are here with courtesy and wishful thinking. This film virtually collides with every opportunity and never misses the chance.
