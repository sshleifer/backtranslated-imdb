Zzzzzzzzzzzz. It came directly from the "jaws" cookie-cutter, some other bizarre clich√©s were thrown for a good measure. I was interested in seeing it after finding it in a book on Italian horror films, and ... I think I got what I do! <br /> <br /> Very slow movement and conversation about what this killer movie is about in the country, which is not really that surprising. It seems that the only method was to show sharks through the sharks of the aquarium. Shark is never in the same frame as any actor, and it's too bad ... most of the signs are so annoying that you really want them to eat. <br /> <br /> "Plot" concerns a group of four children who meet on the beach during one day during mysterious India roasting. For some reason, India gives them an ancient artifact that allows them to trace the ancient evil that won the shark of fear in order to attack their tribe ... allegedly because they were too good for the ocean and ocean god fishing to worry that they would take all the fish. Or something like that. <br /> <br /> It's also good, because you don't know it ... years later, a colleague will appear and dream of people in the seaside community. If one of the four men has to eat, the other three have decided to kill it ... especially since (here's a big shock) the authorities are dead and they think the danger is over. Compulsory death scenes are incredibly annoying and you can see them miles away (my favorite was a girl who fights with her boyfriend when they are old, then jumps out and says, "I'm going to swim," gobbled immediately to the expected shark. a lot of nerve, calling it the movie "Deep Blood" because you barely saw, just cloudy water.Players handle their cliched roles as they do all the thumbs, and there's even a fun sub-platform involving a fatty rock-type bad boy who threatens our good-goody heroes, the good ends up helping to kill the shark. /> <br /> It really took a long time to find this movie, it's pretty unclear, so I don't think there is a risk that too many people will be wasting this time. you should seduce her ... don't say you didn't warn!
