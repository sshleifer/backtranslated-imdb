It starts pretty good, but after a while you start to wait more for this movie than you actually get. Everything becomes unclear and unclear. Czech filmmakers were good 20 or more years ago. But after they went to a capitalist country, here is the Czech unofficial but well-known mentality ... COPYING ... COPYING ... COPYING everything they see as good when they see it in another movie or countries or elsewhere. I think it is a good example of "art" and "politics" and "horror" and "humor" and "movie" and money making. And it will stay with me and / or fly over the cuckoo nest / which cannot be compared to this film ART and ACTORS and STORY and POLITICS. I think this movie is boring. This could be done better. At least they tried. Sorry, guys. :-( Not recommended
