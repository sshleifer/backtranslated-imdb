This man is a real job. An angry, immature boy who grew up in a man's body, packing all the stone charms, goes around, most people just want to visit and do their best to be as unhappy. <br /> <br /> Give this job to someone who really appreciates it. <br /> <br /> I can finish an endless list of all the foolish things this man does in his "episodes", although I just stress the worst: Crete. If local people have their "picnic" picnics in their "glory", this clown has a fire like a deceptive, corrupted child. He complains about everything, including the sense of fashion of the people who live there. What imbecile is. <br /> <br /> When he went to Sweden, he spent at least five minutes incredulous at cooks (who were probably better off than some American, like work). they didn't think Abba was terrible. Everywhere he went, he brought Abba up. This is a conversation you would hear from 13-year-olds who watch too much MTV. <br /> <br /> When he was in New Orleans, he irritated that a certain restaurant had a better tasty french fries than his, so he "accidentally" poured wine on them to destroy them. What a strange, emotionally unstable person. <br /> <br /> The worst of all is his clumsy voice commands, where he tries to unnecessarily add a situation where he was too thick and unaware to judge. He tries to use all these "great" words to call the author, but he is really just a pretentious cage whose lack of ignorance has convinced him to have something to say. That, by the way, is probably one of the good things about this TV show. It will show you, regardless of if you are unfair, if you take yourself seriously enough, then the world. <br /> <br /> He then speaks with local guides, whose English is probably just rudimentary. He uses vocabulary that every writer - as he believes it is - instinctively knows what these people are unlikely to understand. Does he care? No. Characteristic schmucks like this Bourdain clown do not use language to communicate; they use it to look like themselves. <br /> <br /> The Mcg13jthm Review on the Same Page is a great example of what Bourdain attracts - the low IQ social malformation. Make sure the reviewer tries to justify the nature of the Bourdain sociopath with simple-minded childish excuses that barely make sense. "Bourdain may be sued, but he goes through" a lot "and not just that he was" forced "to do this exhibition, but tries to redeem himself." Dolt attracts dollars and reading Mcg13jthm's review should give you an excellent idea of ​​whether you are a person who would enjoy this totally useless, pointless example. <br /> <br /> Finally, to add a little "justice" to my diatribe, I confess Bourdain would have been a moment of fun when I met her at the bar. But Bourdain is a travel show TV show that aims to show the beauty of other places and cultures to the viewer, Bourdain is an unhappy, absurd, hopeless, gloomy and frustrating failure. <br /> <br /> Fault.
