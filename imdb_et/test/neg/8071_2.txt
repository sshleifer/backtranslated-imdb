I live in Rome, where the Turkish director of this film lives and works. From my Italian friends, I've heard a lot of good things about my movies ... so after seeing the preview I really wanted to see "Cuore Sacro." I'm deeply disappointed with one of the most breathtaking, pseudo-religious, very unlikely and naive movies. I love the movie, but it's really hard and bad. The main character is really crazy and should be locked in the madhouse ... put me in a sympathy with aunt's negative character who runs a dirty company who just wants to make money ... and I have to be anti-capitalist ... it's bad!
