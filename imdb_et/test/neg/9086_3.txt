Originally, the spiders were planned to be four-parted and it shows. I don't like serials; they are usually ridiculous, twisted and banal. This is no exception. In the first part of the spiders, "Golden Lake", the rich adventurer enriches the plans of the criminals - spiders - to steal the gold from Inca. It looks like a silly love triangle with some Cowboys and Indians. Its sensationality and exoticism did not entertain me. <br /> <br /> This two-part series can be legitimately tracked for Lang's much better work. And making a movie is better than the other series I've seen since then, including Les Vampires (1915). In Spiders, the camera is not static and this movie is fortunately fast paced. Toning and lighting are also sufficient. None of this is remarkable. However, it is almost inconvenient to see how closely this series resembles the Louis Feuillade series; Criminal gang dresses and behave like Les Vampires - only names and, to a lesser extent, situations have changed. <br /> <br /> For more information on the Spiders series, see the web pages.
