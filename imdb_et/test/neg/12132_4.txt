View 1 of 4/30/2009 - 4 of 10 (Dir-John Waters): Comedy like Corny Waters, with some funny scenes and good parts, but it didn't bring any value. John Waters headed the 50s scene with music full of fraud with Johnny Depp, who played the role of title. This film is very similar to what he did with the 60s spoof "Hairspray", but it is not so effective. Some stories are memorable, some characters are interesting in their peculiar Waters-like ways, and the images are fine though sometimes moving. The story is similar to "Grease", where there is a good group and a bad group. Boy from the bad group, Cry Baby, is a good group girl. Then a good girl joins a bad group, but when Cry Baby hurts her, she goes back to a good group. It just sets the end where Cry Baby tries to get her back. Now, one difference that is expected in Water Films is that a bad group doesn't look so bad all the time and a good group works like they're up. I certainly saw it in hair spray. Wacky and goofiness aren't really all this fun in this movie, and it just leaves us feeling like the film might have been much better. The main complaint of Johnny Depp's character is that he can roll one tear on his cheek (hence his namesake) at different times and put the women to fall over him. This is a surplus and the main bottom line is that the movie is OK, but not so big.
