Where to start, where to start .... hmmm ... well how do you imagine some of the toughest, most unnatural, incredible and camping shows? How are stereotypical "characters", situations and locations? Or what is a manipulative, amazing, completely sad script? I can't think of one element of this movie that was original, worth seeing or interesting. <br /> <br /> Note to all the fans of Josh Hartnett / Chris Klein / LeeLee Sobieski - enjoy your collective 15 minutes, people because they're not going to be famous anymore ...
