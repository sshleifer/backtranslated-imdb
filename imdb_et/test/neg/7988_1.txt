This sorceress movie is terrible. My low rating for this is two main reasons. The first is that the animal is a snappy movie and I think the whole concept is so weak that my belly is changing. Filmed over a hundred years ago, I can only hope that we have become somewhat more humane and compassionate. This film is a complete and complete exploitation of the film and the sensational aspects of the film. Aside from historical interest, it's just a look at something when a person finds himself in the grip of a fascinated charm. <br /> <br /> Cause Number 2? See how the camera is set up. It is positioned at the best possible location to fully capture the full effect: the long route of elephants, the perfect view of the electric shock platform and the elephant who comes out of the cold and clinically insecure perspective with the smoke before it finally collapses. Sickening. <br /> <br /> Thomas Edison did a lot of great things for civilization, and his talents and intelligence are not in doubt. No one is perfect, but if you realize that this film gave A the chance to win an early cinematic contestant with the sensational film of the elephants and B), he filmed an embodiment to show that DC is more effective than AC, you can't help but not know if his scientist was little TOO dissonant and cold. No number of Peter Cushing's mad scientists would be proud. The rest of us should be ashamed and rebellious.
