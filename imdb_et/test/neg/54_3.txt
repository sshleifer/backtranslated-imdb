In 1983, "terrifying" is a strange little film. It seems that the director is trying to combine the atmosphere of the classic 30's 40's horror film, which is now the explosive shock factor of the 80's slaher genre. It is not entirely successful (mainly due to the very obvious budget constraints and the less professional level of young actors), but it still has moments, mainly due to the stylish functioning (film worth) of the late German actor Ferdinand Mayne, who is playing an aging-age horror movie star (Vincent Price) called "Conrad Ratzoff". At the beginning of the movie, we meet the van-horror star when he takes a commercial purpose of dentures and we quickly find out that "Conrad is a bit daunting, prima donna jerk-off. Just when you think he's no longer unlikely, the commercial director will put Conrad in front of him, blowing dozens of times, and the old goat pushes him out of the balcony to death. Nice, what? Conrad then visits some of the fans at the college campus club, unfortunately he is suffering from a heart attack in the middle of his speech, and eventually comes back to his mansion who is waiting to die. Even at the deadly door, she has managed to lose her desperate business companion, stifling her with a pillow before she finally hitting the bucket. Then, Conrad will be resting on a true Hollywood-style high-tech neon tomb, featuring video games above the upper body, playing personal video messages from Conrad to visitors entering to pay their tributes. <br /> <br /> At this point, the kids in the College Horror Movie Society decide to pay Conrad for a visit after hours, breaking the grave and taking their body back home all night. (Not exactly my idea of ​​fun, but hey, these are characters in the 80's horror film. Logic has no place here.) College children spend the evening with dinner with Conrad's body, sitting in the rank, depicting photos together and even dancing in the room before Conrad and his coffin in the attic park, planning to bring him back to his crypt in the morning. Meanwhile, Mrs. Ratzoff, who has been disappointed with the theft of her husband's body, has called on her to try her out and reach Conrad. Then you can understand quite a lot from the rest. Since Conrad was not a very nice boy in life, there is not much stretching that he is not friendlier to death. The Psychic Lady connects to Conrad and awakens it in a predictably labeled way, then spends the rest of the film on the ridiculously large corridors of the house, picking up the young grave robbers one by one. This is where the film breaks down. Endless scenes between teenagers traveling around empty corridors, saying, "Hi? Is anyone there?" are linked to outbreaks of violence (we get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene that is highlighting the movie) before the last two survivors finally understand (as if later, no intelligent people would have found the same thing ... but again, we're in the 80s the only way to stop the chaos is to get Conrad's body back to its encryption where it belongs. The slow pace is softened by the effects of many strange lighting and dry ice fogs, which are almost entirely supported by sound effects, not music (thunder, moans and storms, tongues, etc.), which after a while are very annoying <br /> <br /> can really recommend "Frightmare" to anyone who has not grown to watch cheap movies like this late night cable back in the 80s. "Modern Horror" fans will undoubtedly find "Frightmare" incredibly slow motion and silly. When you came to this magical decade, you can get nostalgic from "Frightmare". The Jeffrey fans ("Re-Animator") can also control this, because the future Dr. West will appear here as one unhappy film student. <br /> <br /> I suggest the reader avoids the version of this movie on the EastWestDVD label (with Roy Ward's "Vault of Horror" and sold in dollar stores) because the print quality is terrible. I have said that the film has become a luxurious excerpt through fine people in Troma, which seems to be appropriate. If you're a Troma-type person, "Frightmare" is just your alley.
