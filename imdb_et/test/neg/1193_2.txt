I'm a big fan of LoG. I thought the first two lines gave some of the best comedies that this country has ever seen, and the third, though different, was wonderfully dark and imaginative. The idea of ​​seeing Tubbs, Edward and Briss on the big screen did something to expect on July 3rd. But somewhere, everything went horribly wrong. Writers had no story or real ideas. The Old England part showed that the geniuses we know the League is capable of, but these scenes do not fit well with the film. Geoff gave some of the best, mostly bad jokes, and the performances of Lipp and Briss were great hits. If you love the League, save yourself time and money and watch the TV series again. And again. Massive disappointment.
