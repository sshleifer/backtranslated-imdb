Looking at this movie, I asked myself. I mean, the size of nudity and sex was one thing, but the second part of the film that gave its genre to the adult industry was its lack. I really wanted to get up and leave the whole movie, but I stayed. I was in the hope that perhaps it would be better to finally have good twisting. But I wouldn't have been wrong anymore. Finally, I still set up because I thought I could look at something bad about viewing it. I mean, you can't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with beautiful, sexy and vibrant women, but if the director only shows that the story with the shitty thinks the viewer wants to see it, we all offend. To think that we are all so low that we would only like to see a replicable burlesque, big film industry players are reluctant. My advice: rent another movie.
