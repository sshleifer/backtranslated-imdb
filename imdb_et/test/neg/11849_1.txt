<br /> <br /> ********** SPOILER ALERT *************** <br /> <br /> If you like JURASSIC PARK 1, 2 or 3: <br /> <br /> If you really appreciate the value of your entertainment for the value of your entertainment, not for its quality (highly recommended by John Carpenter for DARK STAR) <br /> <br /> You Like Like Movies With Dinosaurs - <br /> <br /> IF YOU HAVE BEEN ATTENTION TO THIS CINEMATIC CRAPSTERPIECE! <br /> <br /> Using shameless footage CARNOSAUR 1 & 2 make up the majority of this unfortunate attempt at dino / slasher flick - take a scene where a security guard meets his death on the jaws of Alpha T-Rex. For some reason, it drops about 50 pounds and seems 10 years younger. Why so? Just because this scene was picked up directly from CARNOSAUR, which was glamorous from the start. <br /> <br /> The end result was a CARNOSAUR 2 carbon copy because those unfortunate people who were losing this direct video. Again, we see that Mr. Rex is fighting a bulldozer that alternates between a forklift truck and a -daaa miracle - the above-mentioned CARNOSAUR 1 & 2 stock footage. The beast falls to his death as the complex revolves in flames. <br /> <br /> True insult to someone's intelligence. <br /> <br /> But it's better than watching ROSIE O 'DONNEL SHOW. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * off ***** <br /> <br />
