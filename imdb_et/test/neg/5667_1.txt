Again, like many other TV shows, a certain actor / actor who draws his attention to the luminaire, in this case Miranda Cosgrove, having built up his reputation in previous films (especially by Nickelodeon and Dan Schneider). show, sing the soundtrack (which it NOT WRITTEN and even more famous). Wonderful? It creates as much inequality as its other stars, especially Nathan Kress, who constantly pushes small rolls during each episode, except iDont want to fight, Cosgrove's music would never have shown charts without this show and his singing the main theme song (which was not written by her) and other covers like you and stay with my baby. do not forget that he / she will also sync / sing his or her song in life. Is this how you create vocalists today? <br /> <br /> Cosgrove gets more back to the show when she is in scenes with bikini scenes, Hawaii hula bra, and mentioned bras many times in many cases (though not other actors). Dresses are mentioned, panties are mentioned once. Let's not forget "Oh My God" coming phrase (whether all scriptwriters / actors Christian?) Allowed that the exhibition is not only for children, I am surprised at how many women mention underwear, especially in the first episode of "pointy boobs". I'm not sure if children would refrain from saying this home / school later. <br /> <br /> It is not that I am against mentioning or displaying women's underwear (which girls wear), but in the Nickelodeon exhibition, the people responsible should have realized that children are exposed to such things. I doubt that other Nickelodeon exhibitions have such content. <br /> <br /> As has been mentioned, the laugh is very annoying and unnecessary in many parts - for example, when the Sam symbol cries, how is the earth the time to laugh? It bothers people for fun and is used in almost every sentence. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, Cosgrove has been made a star of the exhibition and hence the ultimate celebrity and support for death fans who even frightened the hotel staff when they are told they will keep their noise levels (see http: // www. .youtube.com / watch? v = kk0gtfUk98U). Jennette McCurdy is the second star of the show, but is ahead of Cosgrove's competition in the music industry (compare the popularity of her new single vs Cosgrove's covers). As noted, the least observed third co-star is Nathan Kress. He is depicted as an atypical boy who suffers from bullying a girl and other boys, but somehow it is a wizard in technology. Her height in early episodes makes her a cute actress, but unusual because her character is on Carly / Cosgrove. In addition, Kress does not go to the music industry and when Cosgrove's celebrity grows with every episode, Kress falls behind. I would like to bet he is the least paid for all three participants. <br /> <br /> The content of the exhibition is, of course, fictional, but it also allows you to think about how it fits with a comedy series at a certain time (so the laughter of the laughter is used). It also contains a number of errors of continuity (how can your father be a colonel of the Air Force on a submarine? Special Forces have their own branches and the Air Force does not use US submarines - it's SEALS. The unique feature is to allow viewers to display their videos that are displayed during or after episodes, but again the videos do not match the comedy. <br /> <br /> Once again, this is an exhibition full of women's underwear, skin contact, and used laughter tracks. This is a series that still draws a teenage actress into the crowd so her songs / activities are over-supported by her fans, leaving her stars behind.
