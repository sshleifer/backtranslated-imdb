What can I say after watching a movie? This means that if you had interest and concentration to see it to the end. I had a wordless story because of an amazingly dull story, annoying situations where one American is equal to fifty or more Iraqis and a boring dialogue. I think if this film has anything to teach, it's probably like "Don't screw with the US or come and beat your butts". In addition, this film really encourages and votes for the killing of aliens in the name of war. I got a picture of chess pieces on a gaming table. Except, now it's fast and not so much thinking. And there is no character to which there is a spirit; so how do you care what happens to them. Except for war movie fans without taste, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. There should always be something interesting.
