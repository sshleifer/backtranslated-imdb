The other day, I showed my boy an excellent movie, Stand By Me, a movie I've shown to many people, and they respected it absolutely, but for some strange reason he didn't like it. He gives me a movie called Backdraft and he tells me he has shown it to many people and they loved it, instead I hated this movie. I don't think I've hated the movie for so much time, even though this movie is out of 6.6. I couldn't keep up with five million readings here: Billy Baldwin became a fire man, a casual sister contest, a random love story (s) who is a story of arson, a researcher, a fire who has a personality of his own. I just have a problem that this movie can't keep those stories, they didn't balance well enough to make the movie interesting. I would have preferred if this film was a firefighter or an investigator and how he would be one or exactly what he did and why. <br /> <br /> The film talks about a group of Chicago firefighters, two brothers. Stephen "Bull", McCaffrey, older brother, is obsessed with beating fires. Brian, his younger brother, graduated from the fire academy school several years ago, then started many other failed careers before he became a firefighter. His older brother, whom he expects, is going to look at his newly chosen career as a firefighter. Donald "Shadow" Rimgale is an arson researcher dedicated to his profession. He is called because many fires have somewhat similar connections. .Martin Swayzak is a member of the City Council. He has obvious hopes that they will be elected mayors, but he will have to make a number of budget cuts to the fire department. Many ranks and firefighters believe that the cuts they make are a threat to the lives of firefighters. However, Swayzak has managed to portray the fire department as expanded and ineffective after firefighters have been repeatedly killed in blazes. <br /> <br /> I just couldn't get into this movie, I don't know how anyone else did It was incredibly unrealistic and misrepresented firefighters. I loved the way they had a clich√© in every activity that would suit this activity. I just felt that such mediocre roles, Donald Sutherland, great actors, had a great talent but a strange role that could have been taken by a less well-known man who had the talent at that time. I know Ron is going for a great quality, but I think he made such big actors in small roles with this movie's mistake. While watching this movie, I even had to make my way of joking, commenting how the doctor was probably Kevin Spacey in the background. The fire was so unrealistic and the film was just so out, I didn't enjoy it and honestly did not recommend it to people, I would stay on that point in my relationship with the suggestions. <br /> 2/10
