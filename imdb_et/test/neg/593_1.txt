I'm completely in the kind of story line, but when the movie was fired, I honestly said out loud, "I just rent a two dollar budget for Christian POS". The only thing he liked about this movie was that he had a descent season, but it was terribly executed. Terrible actors, terrible direction and production. <br /> <br /> The director and the producer must look at the cube before pulling the film in a single room. There was absolutely something that would interest you until you noticed that you were in the whole room. Terrible! The two main actors were very simple from the eyes and you could say that it was in the manager's hope. But these two and their biocides can talk about it, the camera is awful. <br /> <br /> Don't try this. If you are not blind because it can go a few stars if you listen to it only.
