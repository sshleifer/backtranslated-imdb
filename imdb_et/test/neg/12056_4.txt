Yes, it is Friday, where the 13th hanged, but I have no problem with it. This is a good effort, the killings are not so harsh, but one girl's behavior carries a movie called Queen Jennifer Ritchkoff. For a low budget movie, the effects are nicely done, okay, sometimes you can guess how. Some people have problems using the camera, I don't see what's wrong with it. It's so strange that so many people don't know this movie, I really enjoyed it. Of course, the script is not original, but give me one, which means that so many wild people have been made. Maybe it's all predictable, but it's worth seeing, I've got a lot worse, I tell you
