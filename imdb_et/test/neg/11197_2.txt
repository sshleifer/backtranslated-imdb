I mean, come on! This film had such a great potential, but it was like they ran out of money to finish the script and just telegraphed the other damn movie about two-thirds through the road. The characters start to make this movie all the time for other characters who didn't ask for information in extremely dim spaces. They also fall into some stereotypical behavior because it has to be expected in this movie genre. It's really sad, because this movie could have been so much. <br /> <br /> I really hoped it would be a good movie. There were good deeds. Mark Hamill does a great job until the film breaks down, just like Sally Struthers. It was fun to see that they worked and succeeded in their crafts. Majandra Delfino was pretty good for a while until his lines just became unacceptable. I felt sad that he had to say that the lines that just filmed the credibility of the whole movie were thinking of some thoughtful film visitor. Brad Hunt is doing a great job. She has a really surprising number of talents who have recently decided on Lucky 13 (which was a piece). This man could be a star if he could choose the right scripts and be happy with the right director. <br /> <br /> I almost forgot! The music was so hard that you think this project was given to a small film school to be scanned. I call such music "Teller Music" because you can just say what the music is following. Less is sometimes more. <br /> <br /> Cut half of this movie, get a good movie editor, a little rewrite or two and it would be a very good movie.
