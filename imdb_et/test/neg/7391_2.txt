This is perhaps the worst film I've ever seen. Can anyone please explain the plot of this movie to me? Yeah, I know the bus ran out of the desert in the middle, after the driver didn't notice his compass didn't work, but what? And how did it end? Maybe I'm stupid to understand this movie, but it was a waste of time for me. <br /> <br /> My recommendation? Don't worry about seeing much better movies. This movie is at my lowest ever (Going overboard - Adam Sandler and Fire on the Amazon - Sandra Bullock).
