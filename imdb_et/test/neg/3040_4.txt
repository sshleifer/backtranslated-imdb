The transformation of Simon West from the 1979 horror class is a pathetic attempt to bring the excitement of old schools to a modern audience. Takes Camilla Belle with talented talent when Stanger's calls don't even create a shocked or even surprised face. Bad attempts to scare the audience away from blurry coats that look like people to build tense music to the cat who runs out of shadows. The plot is followed by Jill Johnson (Belle), a teenage girl who has to pay her father for childcare. He is called to work at night by the river in the house and thinks it is an easy way to make money. But he doesn't know much, the stranger goes in the house and harasses Johnson on the phone. An unfortunate apology for the film.
