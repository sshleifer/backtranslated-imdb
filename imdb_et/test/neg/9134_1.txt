Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi are both beautiful films, but this last part of trilogy has been greatly suppressed. They left too few pictures and photos with so little content. The executive producer puts his picture on the film ... It's just a pretense. Perhaps, if they had spent more than $ 3 million, maybe something. I actually thought that Steven Soderbergh was leading it because it was so bad, but Godfrey Reggio, head of Koyaanisqats and Powaqqs, led it. I have to assume that they didn't have enough budget to make a decent film. You think Francis Ford Coppola would have liked to be part of this movie and help make more money.
