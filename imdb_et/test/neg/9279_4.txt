This film is a window to Britain's world in 1973 - the world of holiday camps, phages and birds. I was actually in Pontins Prestatyn when it was filmed, so it's exciting to see where I burst as a boy and what world we are behind. "The plot", as it stands, concerns Stan's and Jack's attempts to go to work in a holiday camp (25 weeks a week!) As an opportunity to end young women and Blakey. They are joined by the rest of Stan's family, and some laugh at Arthur (Michael Robbins) and Olive (Anna Karen) for persistent friction, as well as for Blakey's strangeness, but for the idea that young women see something desirable as a brilliant Stan (Reg Varney) or lecherous Jack (Bob Grant ) is just irritating. Unfortunately, it is safe enough during this time, now it's just an overtaking attitude.
