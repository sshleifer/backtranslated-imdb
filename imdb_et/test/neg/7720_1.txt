How bad a movie can do. The good question to which the mortuary 2 will be able to answer. I could not believe that it was possible to get something worse than the first dead house, but the director was amazingly successful. The only feeling you get from the movie is that it's bad, just bad. What is excessive, bad FX and stupid story. This is a film that generally gives Z-Movies a bad name. Why couldn't they learn from the first dead house movie? Anyway, I think you have now realized that you shouldn't see this movie. It's just a waste of time. See "Bad Taste" or "Dawn of the Dead" if you want to see good zombies.
