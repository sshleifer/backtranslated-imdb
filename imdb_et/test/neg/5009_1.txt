Alien candies move in all wrong contexts, situations are not just funny with cheese voices and poor low-eyed comedy timing, a clear test of dry / black / dark humor is evident and can't provide all the elements of good elements joking. <br /> <br /> With a high drag and low laughing ratio, I was shocked that this show went through the first season, I personally like Scrubs, The Office, 30 Rock, Trailer Park Boys, Pulling, Peep Show, Simpsons, Family Guy and I know what your thinking is, these exhibitions are not at all strange, so some other good examples I've seen are Jam, Garth Marengh's darkness, a group of books, a shelter and a snus that are original dry / black / dark humor / satire and everything is at least 5/10. <br /> <br /> Garth Marenghi in the dark is particularly cheap, surprised and strange, but the context is conceived and works to make it really there and have fun there.
