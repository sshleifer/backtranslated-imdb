I participated in the review of this film. It was clich√©s and very uncomfortable jokes and structures. I think the other comments were from people who have worked on the film or the majority of family members. I'm surprised that this movie cost $ 3 to 4 million without real stars. Where did the budget go? Obviously, it didn't go over to the writers again. It's a nice idea to bet on Big Fat Greek weddings, but that's a great remnant. There were few sparks between the main characters, and the temptation leader was, at best, a bit thin. This direction remained unused and looked like a pupil's film. <br /> <br /> I don't even know what that means everyone wants Italian. Is this a real saying. I've never heard of it.
