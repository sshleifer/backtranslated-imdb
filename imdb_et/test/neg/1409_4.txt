I was aware of the Man's Critical Pans and the noticeable gross amount of the Year, but I was ready to question the film because I know that in the fall months of crowded release schedule, good images can fall under the radar. <br /> <br /> What I found was that the film was surprising. Surprisingly, Barry Levinson's gift to political satire (shown by Good Morning Vietnam and Wag the Dog) and Robin Williams' obvious comics. Robin Williams is actually mysteriously underrated. On the "The Of Of" featurette featuring a DVD, Barry Levinson talked about how sometimes he lets Robin Williams improvise on the script, as was his naughty secret. Are you really that big moor, Barry Levinson? If you have Robin Williams on your movie and want to use it for your comics (basically every movie he's had other than Insomnia or One Hour Photo), don't drill him inside the script. Let him ad-lib whatever he wants, because he's more funny than anything someone else can write to him, and his hidden comics can instantly raise the bar to any mediocre movie like RV or Patch Adams. What I found even more astonishing than not using Robin Williams was that in 1987 Levinson used this exact formula in Good Morning Vietnam by injecting Robin Williams' comics that were a war image to make a sounding political So film is not as many laugh-festivals as it may be and feels uncomfortable lost. If the film had something to do, he could have made one of those 90's thrillers The Pelican Brief, The Fugitive, or one of those Jack Ryan movies. At the heart of this plot was a Silicon Valley employee who discovered an alarm in the system, indicating that the state chose the wrong efforts of the president and general directors to eliminate him before secrecy, so if you replaced Robin Williams with a Harrison -Ford-type actor or even Harrison Ford he added a few more explosions himself and perhaps where the film tried to go. I never know and it's not worth it to try.
