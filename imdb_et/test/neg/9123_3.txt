I really don't believe that producer George Lucas really wanted to make such a terrible sequel as "More American Graffiti". But retrospectively, this was the first cracking of his then seemingly impenetrable armor. This film was a tremendous success for "American Graffiti", and at the same time as Star Wars, this film was the first to be successfully taken away by Lucas Coppola without himself leading it. The result is a typical Lucas - much more interesting in terms of its design and its modification than the actual material. Bill Norton, writer / director, is allowed to use different screen relationships and split screens to create odd connections in pictures. While it is interesting to see the ironic anomalies of the 4-story lines, this style ultimately only gives the film a broken nature. <br /> <br /> Lucas' brilliant original text was the archetypal one of the group of friends, "the last big night before school ends and Kurt (Ron Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) should go to college. One thing that made this movie work, despite that it is very episodic, that you had the initial characters together at the beginning, and they come back together at the end. Time is there, like Nick Ray's "Rebel Without Cause", where a certain period of time becomes very elastic and takes more meaning than that specific time is actually alive, but everything is going on in static space. "More American Graffiti" is fundamentally the opposite - space is very dynamic because Rooms (Charles Martin Smith) in Vietnam, his former friend Debbie (Candy Clark), hiding with hippies in San Francisco, Steve and Laurie's (Cindy Williams) participated in Berkeley's student protests and John Miler's (Paul Le Mat) semi-process contest. d to see John's race, but after that, the threads will not collapse and worship as they do in the original. Instead, they left and followed these symbols in about 3 years, just looking at different events at the New Year's Eve, which seems to be 1967, 68, and 69. It's easy for the audience to be confused and I think it's fair to say we're doing. Although the original film seemed to condense significant events and rituals for an unrealistic theatrical period that created a nostalgia experience even for those who never experienced these events, this sequel pulls on and stretches some plot points from the epilogue of the original and tries to make them a coherent film. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the movie for me are those made with Candy Clark in SF and Charles Martin Smith in Namis. Some jokes are flat, but the style of these sections is interesting and contrasting with each other. Maybe it would have been a good movie if these parts were a little better and if the other parts were not such a pull. Speaking of racing, the whole plot with Milner was really flat when talking to a student with a foreign currency, uncomfortable, and throwing Mackenzie Phillips at home didn't help at all. It was another well-established moment, as when they briefly explain why Curt is not in the movie because he is already in Canada. Instead, Laurie has another brother who is basically identical to Curt, but has a different name and now plays a very boring actor. For some things in Vietnam, black is a satire that is very similar to what I imagine if Lucas and John Milius "Apocalypse Now" had the original idea. And there are some of this manic fun in San Francisco scenes that made the first movie fun. But still with that fun, you have a drag on the rest of the movie, as if somebody would see Steve and Laurie claim in their terrible suburban residence as if they were a Spielberg movie about divorce and child abandonment. I think that even if those parts of the film were not so painful, it would still not be comparable to the first film, because there is no closure and no sense to come back, or anyone who has learned anything. It ends just when the money runs out or something, two "Lane Blacktop" cheap freezers and so much better movies. <br /> <br /> Like the original, this movie still has a great sound era hit that is likely to be worth your own and almost makes your movie tasty. The National Joe and the Fish have great performances and Scott Glenn all beat Candy Clark in love with the hippie. It's an observation to see - I don't know if he was supposed to use a wig even then? I couldn't recommend this movie, and yet I have a little affectionate heart because I love the original so much. Every few decades, I think I only have to try this movie to make sure it's really as worthless as I remember it. It's a party killer, but it's something that every "American Graffiti" or George Lucas fan generally wants to see at least once or twice. This shows how much effort can be made and it may still be half full. It makes you think about how many miracles it is that Lucas actually made a good movie like "American Graffiti", as if all the elements were in place and all the appropriate gods were placed. Unfortunately, this was not the case with both the film and Bill Norton.
