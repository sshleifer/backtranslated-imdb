I've seen previous films by Cédric Klapisch and so have been waiting for a high quality movie with psychological depth. Being an Erasmus student and having visited a number of friends abroad, I know very well what it means to stay abroad for a while and mix with different cultures. Yes, it's great fun! That's why I thought I shouldn't leave that movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed that L'Auberge Espagnol did not perform in many ways: the characters are stereotypical, the events are tiny and the story is low. Although there are quite a few familiar situations, they are irritating clichés and do not go beyond trivial events. This made the film interesting and gave me a strong "no-done-it-no-you-not-something to add?" feeling. In addition, the film has no definite story. Sometimes it looks like a documentary or an actual life exhibition as a serious movie. <br /> <br /> However, one can imagine that if you haven't studied and traveled abroad, it might be fun to watch.
