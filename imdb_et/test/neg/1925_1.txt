This empty, mawkish, manipulative film that tries to be both a cute comedy and an insightful drama is wasted on a fine young man. The movement of the plot takes place so slowly that 90 minutes seem endless because the characters do nothing but mope and emote. The dialogue is filled with fluffy clich√©s and lucky cookies with lace philosophy. <br /> <br /> Obviously, it is trying to have a moving and deep look at life and love. The only real weight is the load that the talented cast is forced to carry as well as possible. But never be afraid - they are detained by the plot dolls.
