Bones' first season is playing in Finland and I can't believe that the number that this show shows is characteristic - the characters are low, poorly targeted and clumsy. <br /> <br /> This is a poor man's CSI. Or, in fact, CSI without a single plot. Although Bones has the potential, it is unable to steer due to the absence of a director who has been unable to bring forth actors. It is really sad to see that it is thrown away if it could have been a descent, with just a pinch of more thoughts. From the start you will feel how unpleasant it is to act. <br /> <br /> Short story - don't waste your time with bones.
