I approached this film with the notion that it was one of the worst films made. I sat down to see this perspective and was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> It's not great. It's not that good; in fact it is pretty bad. But it's not as bad as I had believed, with a long shot. It is quite unfair, and obviously a lot of film material has been used as a cost-cutting measure, many of which are clearly not related to narrative. <br /> <br /> This is, however, an intensely personal film made by a person who apparently did not have the skills or financial resources to make his idea fair. Before _Gleni or Glenda? I, I would like to pull, but everything I try to sketch out, like stickers. I would like to sing, but all I do is scare small children. <br /> <br /> Wood had an idea and, unfortunately, he didn't have the job he needed. But it was an incredibly bold movie for the 50s of Puritans, although it may appear at first glance to be exploited or inconsistent.
