The movie started very well. You may believe that Isabelle's exorism was ... but later, gosh !!! I didn't know if it was a horror movie, drama or Black Not See! The acquired creature who attacked the sheriff was not involved in the film .... in any way. Well, it seemed quite real at first, but at the end of the film, the last part of the film, especially the teeth and eyes, was very exaggerated. If you want to watch a good "Exorism" movie, "Emily Rose's Exorism". <br /> <br /> With "Hard Candy" (totally boring, pathetic plot and end), these two films are the worst. seen from Lionsgate !! But the film company has produced great movies that are fans of the horror movie, but you never want to rent it !! Exorcism movie fans, just stick to two "Exorcist" and "Emily Rose's Exorcism"
