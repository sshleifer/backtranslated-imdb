If you haven't seen the first one, you must at least know someone who has and you need to know that it was painful to sit. There was nothing good to say there. What's different from others? Why barely make a sequel to the movie that was sad? It does not take itself too seriously. He knows that this has been done for television and is not trying to impress with a big or serious dialogue. There are times when he is trying to get "serious" or "intense", but these moments are so funny that you have to laugh. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, all the Uwe Boll elements and all the hints that came from the video game (except the title of the course) went. Do not go to this movie that is waiting for something your friends deserve to mention, unless they are in the camp, flat of zombie movies or are interested in drinking from this movie. Take two shots when Ed Quinn's character is mentioned by his dead brother! Take one shot if the ball had a better place over the zombie head instead of pumping three on the chest! etc etc.
