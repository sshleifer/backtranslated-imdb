This film is cyborg itself: half of the cool / half lifetime original films. <br /> <br /> This movie, as a cyber, has only one purpose: to have you spent the length of the movie in a dark room sliding into the testicles. <br /> <br /> Unlike many people, this movie was not rented by Angelina Jolie (I explain why I rented it soon). I'm not a big fan of Mrs Jolie, although I say her performance was a star! His empty foam and robotic action really believed he was an android whore. If anyone has his clip titled "Actress in the Studio", explaining how he prepared for this role, send it in my way. I will certainly use it when I try James Lipton for crimes against honesty. <br /> <br /> So what drove me to rent this movie? You might think it was a hope to see Angelina Jolie's nipples, but it wasn't. No, the reason for renting it was only one of the pictures on the cover of the DVD; Jack Palance's Face! ATTENTION! When I saw it, I imagined that the "Palances" legions were running slowly through the fiery wasteland, wasting on all the people who were stupid enough to resist. In my opinion, each of the members of this Holy Holy Army had a red, glowing eye; a red, glowing eye that looked at people and saw only "meat." They were supposed to be Oblivion architects ... a cold, sharp apocalypse ... a nightmare that mankind never would. This is a beautiful picture I love until the end of my years. <br /> <br /> Like most things in my life, the actual movie doesn't reflect my expectations. No, there was only one "Jack Palance" and the only visible cybernetic improvements he had were on his feet. Unfortunately, these improvements didn't fix anything. This is when you read that you consider a powerful POLIO VICTIM. At least they had a scene where Jack - like Alzheimer's disease-unhappy patient - smiled at some people in hell. I was waiting for him to shout, "I'm tired of paying too much for prescription drugs!" Unfortunately, all the outbreaks of geriatric rage were little and far away. <br /> <br /> What the movie had a lot of was a badly developed love story about a human being (Elias Koteas, a poor man called De Niro) and a cyber (Angelina Jolie, also called Demon Spawn John Voigt). Oh man, is the love between the roses of Rome and the Julia of silicon possible?!?!?! If you follow Jack Palance's simple tips: "You need to keep each other's time ATTENTION". <br /> <br /> Yes, I'm not sure what that means. However, I'm sure I don't want Jack Palance to be the one who explains it to me. Surely she doesn't want her to show me! As an experiment, I suggest that you ask your important other if he thinks we have reached a level in our relationship where we can begin to TASTA one another?
