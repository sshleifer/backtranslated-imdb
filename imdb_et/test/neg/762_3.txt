C.H.O.M.P.S. is very similar to any number of comedies from the 70s Disney family - Cat of Outer Space or Unidentified Flying Oddball. Nothing is missing from the creation, beating the same clichés with death, but uncomfortably in the sense of entertainment. Participants will not win any awards, as well as the director, writer or FX team, but there are some vague entertainment in their inconvenience and blissful prediction. The idea of ​​a robot dog as a security system is so full of holes that you can use it as a spacious one. Incredibly repetitive disco soundtrack sticks to your head, so beware.
