Looking at these comments and looking at all of these high ratings, I have to believe that a large number of red corn syrup wants almost every dead idiot in the brain. This movie is useless. A whole clich√© with a slasher film without any substance. I'm sure I can go into the details of the movie, but why am I barely able to sum it up? Probably everyone wants Mandy Lane and he probably doesn't want any guys. You can see it all over the movie. <br /> <br /> When he finishes the boyfriends of a typical boy with a loser zone loser, he gets ballistic and goes on a journey where he doesn't hunt (of course) one by one. Sounds so far away? But what made this film a miracle incredibly, is when you find that not only his loser friend is a killer, but he is too. The plan was ridiculous. Let's kill all our friends together and then kill each other. They don't give a reason why they wanted to do this, and whereas Mandy Lane's "Goody Too Shoes" behavior makes your head even more scratchy, motivating them to do what they do. It is sad .. this film had a lot of potential, but the manager or writer probably cannot associate with the audience at all.
