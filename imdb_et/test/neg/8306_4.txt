Mel Welles, you might like to remind him when Mr. Mushnick Roger Corman's humble shop is led by a somewhat interesting but completely twisted story of Dr. Frankenstein's daughter, who continues to work on his father after his death and creates a created creature, not its intellectual ability or probability of being good, but rather his sex appeal. You see, Tania Frankenstein, though she is a doctor and a scientist, really knows more than just stabilizing her main desires for a boy and making some sexual slaves using her body with a great brain that she does not love. The story here is tissue-thin, and one gets what one would expect: a lot of meadows and recommended comments (surprisingly from a female cooker), special effects that are not so special, action that is not because of the characteristic depth and not really much action or intercourse. And while this film is almost fruitless in terms of good storytelling, Lady Frankenstein has strangely some aspects that make it traceable - not very traceable, but still traceable. Italian actress Rosalba Neri AKA Sara Bay / Bey plays Baron's daughter somewhat and with many sex complaints. He is quite well inhibited by desire and seduction. Her performance is rather one-dimensional, but she's pretty cute and plays a little too well. She is also very open to her performance when you catch her drift. Poor Joseph Cotten, who is now regulated for a European horror film, plays his father short but competent. He is a star attraction, but went before the movie really started to move. As for the rest, Paul Muller is somewhat effective than dr. Charles Marshall, baron assistant and daughter's admirer for a while. As crimes and missing persons start to emerge in the village, the policeman (I didn't buy it) starts Mickey Hargitay to pump Tania for answers - no matter what you think is his satisfaction. When the film actually loses credibility, the last third of the film, with a suspect script, weak appearances, and a weak direction all along in the south. The creature appears and looks quite ridiculous. The film ends somewhat sharply with fast resolutions in the 1970s. Lady Frankenstein is not nearly as bad and reluctant as some may wish, but it is a really wrong film with some perverse, though intriguing records.
