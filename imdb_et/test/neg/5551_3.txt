I've been discussing quite a bit about what this rating is because it is my least favorite Herschell Gordon Lewis film, other than The Gruesome Twosome, but that's the best I've seen in Lewis. But we all know that it doesn't talk much. When the movie was done, I was happy because I felt like I was sitting through a 4-hour movie, although it was just 82 minutes long. I'm trying to see all the HGL movies and that's probably the only reason to see it. <br /> <br /> Gore is good as usual, one thing Herschell seemed to be right for. Operation is as bad as usual with one exception. This exception is Frank Kress. Would I say he is a good actor? Not in any way, but it is good compared to all other people. The story is boring and flat and does not go where and finally did not care what happened just as it ended. I know it's a cult class, but I didn't enjoy it at all. I hope you do that.
