When I looked at the back of the film, it seemed to me and my friends 82 memorable minutes. And it was definitely memorable. Puckoon was a movie where you asked yourself how it was possible. How was it possible that it appeared on a DVD at all. Of all the movies available from the movies available at night ... we just got the worst. And yes, they had a Tomb Raider. In this movie, I didn't have a little fun. Who came to the idea that it would be funny if the narrator could change the story with the recommendations of basic education? Of all the stupid things you can completely destroy the movie, it's now my favorite. The village idiot played by Nickolas Grace, the character Foggerty is the most annoying character because they started to film the color. If there is one movie that you shouldn't see this year, please give it to Puckon because I don't think it can be worse. I still don't know if it could have been the worst way I spent my money, and I'll take my word for having done a lot of bad purchases over the years.
