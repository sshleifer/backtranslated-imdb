This obvious and irregular love story can be used by the cookie cutter to work overtime. Such a scheme, as it is, has been done before the trillion times so it doesn't need to be read again. Suffice it to say that all 12-year-old girls love this movie, the rest of us are forced to face. Even the sound is terrible! It's not that I don't like skating, though I don't, because I don't like clich√©, bad movies.
