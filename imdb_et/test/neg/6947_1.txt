I couldn't believe it. This movie was a lost time in my life. Title is appropriate. Love didn't beat me from hell, this movie did. I looked and watched and waited and waited and hoped for something to happen. And nothing happened! Something! Terrence Howard wasn't even able to record this flat work on the movie. It was dark and confusing and I didn't get to kill a girlfriend. The film's tone and pace had to be built on dramatic climate change. It only helped to confuse the audience because it didn't go away from the movie. If you want pure torture, check out this movie.
