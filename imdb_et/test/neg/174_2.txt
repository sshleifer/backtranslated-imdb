I've heard people compare this film sideways. How this comparison was made, I never think, because this film was in no way comparable to the lateral. <br /> <br /> These two films were as different as Star Wars and Thornbirds. The only thing they had at all was that they both had a wine. <br /> <br /> Although the interviews in this documentary were semi-interesting, they destroyed the work of the absolute worst camera ever ... tried. I've never been worse off the camera in my life and I compare it to 5-year-old accidentally taken video games. <br /> <br /> I will give these two stars ONLY interesting interviews with French wine types and show how American wineries are tense and corrupt (are all companies not heavy and corrupt?) I would give him -10 stars (yes, this is NEGATIVE 10) A messy, dreadful, dreadful, dreadful, VERTICAL SYSTEM, 5-year-may-do-better camera confusion.
