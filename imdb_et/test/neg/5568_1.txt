Really! Here, in the bottom of the French cinema, and in comparison with this, the most attractive horror films by American youth, such as "Freddy of the Thirteenth Thirteen", and the cover are masterpieces of seventh art. <br /> <br /> It is even sharper because there were exciting original elements: Forêt de Brocéliane and its legends, drudos and King Arthur, all of which were excellent assets for dreamy fantasy and horror film. Filmed like a user who really reminded me of a fake forest near Paris is a movie of a fake horror, fake Celtic history, fake colors - you should see a professor (Wilms, who was a wonderful M.Le Quesnoy, who stayed "la vie est and long hairy) screaming "priceless", the production of which is likely to have been bought in the fine shop by fake characters, fake excavations ... <br /> <br /> Guys who are hidden in druid are inadvertently very funny, girls who seem to be martial arts experts. we can say about the monster professors? A ten-year-old writes a better scenario than this grotesque farce is still waiting for the manufacturer! <br /> <br /> Wise: Maurice Leblanc wrote his Arsene Lupin saga "l'île aux trente cercueils" made 30 years ago. Avoid this "Broceliande" garbage and try to see it.
