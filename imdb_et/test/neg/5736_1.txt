I know many people would demand some movies as "the worst all the time", but I think Redneck will put this award. A combination of quite frightening action from Mark Lester and Telly Savales, and a plot of progress that doesn't believe. <br /> <br /> Telly Saveles: Did he get drunk when he acted in this field? He seems to play slurring, laughing mad, without conviction. Maybe he confused his medicine with his whiskey, I don't know. <br /> <br /> Mark Lester: Play more wood than a carpenter. His cut British tones are not part of this movie; and her transformation protected by a teenage gangster apprentice within 24 hours is crazy. And the Mosquito-containing strip scene is not important for the plot at all; maybe the manager likes such a thing. <br /> <br /> Plot logic: When Memphis and Mosquito lurk at the beginning of the car, why doesn't Mark Lester's mother do anything to get her son out of the car before loonies run away? He just lets them all go by saying a word! On the other hand, Redneck must be seen - you don't believe how bad it is otherwise!
