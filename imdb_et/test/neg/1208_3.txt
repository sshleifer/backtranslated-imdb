This film is an 80's proverb that shows the viewer that as long as he tries something, they can be better than the pros. The main character, Doug, demonstrated his ability to fly on a Cessna plane, which was somehow equivalent to the ability to fly a jet aircraft and be able to kill people. We all would like to play a few million dollars ... maybe make good investments, donate, buy some things, but the leaders of this movie decided to make Iron Eagle ... never ... not twice ... not even three times; yes, four times. The thing to look at the most is the end of Hollywood in this movie. Just when you think the movie ends after the final cheese, there is another cheesecake. Then another. You must definitely watch the movie to believe ... and maybe on your own to remind yourself of how the 80's should be.
