!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> Except for TERMINATOR and TOTAL RECALL, Arnie's action / adventure movies don't think much. They are definitely better than his comedies, but it's not very much to say. The problem I have with the blockers of all my actions is that they are overwhelmed and have no morals <br /> <br /> Moral? I mentioned this scene in my TERMINATOR 2 review, where a good guy, the Terminator, blows out the collision line from the SWAT team. Do we think that because the hero carries people who do their job instead of killing them, we admire him in some way? This is a problem with ERASER when James Cann's character appears in the US Marshal as a betrayer of Arnie's character John Kruger travels with a witness he defends, but in several later sequences, Kruger kills the number of judges working with quite large soldiers. Do we take that they were all traitors? Certainly many of them were honest men who tried to stop Kruger because a bad man told them that Kruger was a traitor? It is a rather inconvenient idea that Kruger killed a number of people who tried to really keep the law. Despite the $ 100 million cost, the special effects are not all impressive. See the scene where Kruger releases the jet wing and lets the parachute go. This is obvious because this activity interferes with being a stuntman who queues for free fall, while Arnie is in front of a blue screen in the studio. ERASER is also a film that has unnecessary CGIs that have killer alligators, not just unnecessary CGIs, but also convincing CGIs. There are also some plot holes in the opening spot where a couple of witness protection people are involved with whom the mob is stuck. The Kruger opens the car's trunk and pulls a few bodies out and starts the fire that throws the smell of the mobile. In the following, Kruger will be seen in a couple of stored computers when reorganizing dental records. It would be logical to do this, but will all pairs of dental records be kept on the computer? Most importantly, do we believe that the US Marshal's Department will keep a freezer with body parts for such events? <br /> <br /> So they go, the typical Arnie thriller with long unlikely pieces and short intelligence, and it is interesting to note that ERASER did not get much profit at the ticket office because production costs were higher than the potential audience. After ERASER Arnie did not do much more work in the box, save TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF MACHINES, which was the event film, and it is interesting to see if he is remembered as a politician or a movie star
