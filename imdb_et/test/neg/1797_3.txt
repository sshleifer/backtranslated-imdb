The Joseph Conrad novel, Heart of Darkness, is a dark, deep and lasting novel that depicts the nonsense and irony that is happening in Africa. If you're looking for a great book to read on the weekend, it's not a book for you. Conrad has nothing to do in describing the imperialism of the 19th century, but the novel is meaningless without giving it reflection and weight. When I read this novel in search of a great adventure story, I would say that I waste my time, but looking at explaining the nonsense of the 19th century, I would say that this is one of the most important novels I've ever read. Since I read this novel in my English class and we analyze every page, I think I appreciated the book more than anyone just read it for entertainment. I do not lie, this book was hard and it pushes the reader to dig deep into this novel to find a true meaning. On the other hand, the film showed fatigue and boredom. The "Heart of Darkness" does not come with the giving of books. The film missed many important parts, which I find important to get a true message. If you have difficulty understanding and visualizing a novel, the film may be a good opportunity, but I do not recommend watching the film as an alternative to a novel or even a different perspective.
