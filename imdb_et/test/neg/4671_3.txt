spoilers <br /> <br /> This movie is not packed; it's slow and boring. It is not funny or exciting, it is predictable and plays cheap sentimentality and vague patriotism. Special effects are neither imaginative nor impressive. They are noisy and tireless. <br /> <br /> Functional talent is wasted hopelessly on foolish liners and clichés. The symbols that they should simply call "gentle giant men", "the eccentric genius that begins to crack," the square hero hero, "" the coward of the book, "the gambler who lives with the code of honor," the impulsive princess "and so on. br /> <br /> And Writing! How many undramatic countdowns did they think they could fit in with this? Is the scene where people have to break the bomb by cutting one or the other wire is considered more of a fiction? The drama of the last 15 minutes of the movie depends on it whether the audience cares if some jerkers can disregard their personal differences with Ben Affleck and say that Liv Tyler is BORN in time. All the work is done, we have to wait a few seconds for Harry Stamper, jerk, to throw away some cotton candy. that Bruce Willis is a charismatic boy in general, but his Harry Stamper character is an unpleasant hole. I thought he was awarded the Golden Razzy Prize for this role e. <br /> <br /> Because the film is so long, the plot is so obvious and the dialogue is so disposable, you can't help but notice flat inaccuracies, contradictions and holes in the plot. The size of 800 feet into something TX is less than a pinprick. Try walking to 800 feet TX and see how close the center is. After all the discussion about the artificial gravity of the Russian station, it seems to be arbitrary. In fact, gravity comes and goes all over the film. Does it make sense for someone, in addition to Michael Bay, to give these moles a couple of shuttles and send them the air that threatens the earth? <br /> <br /> sentimental phone / insurance / cola commercial style assemblies were reluctant. <br /> <br /> I like movies. Really. It's boring, stupid and really stuck in itself. It deserves hate and intimidation, because it is all the most costly efforts of Hollywood - a number of cheap clichés running from one expensive explosion to another. Oh, yes, the whole thing has gone through neanderthal conservative sex, politics and so on.
