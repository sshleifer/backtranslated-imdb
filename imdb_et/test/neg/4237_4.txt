There was a lot of prerequisite for the movie, but despite the fact that someone selling other furniture is alive, there is nothing in this film. The characters are cardboard. The dialogue is so painfully written that it is difficult to sit down, and when the movie is joking, I missed them. Marilyn Monroe walking into the walls because she doesn't want to wear glasses is absolutely unbelievable and not funny. Grabel's stupidity is also too foolish to believe. Bacalli gold digging is so forced, it's annoying to listen. Why would anyone want to sit through it is over me.
