I fully understand the historical importance of Rocketship X-M, but it does not make it a good movie. First, the plot (or its existence) is boring and inanimate. Five astronauts burst for the month? will they, of course, put out and end on Mars (ah?)? cavemen-looking martians throw stones at them? Will they return to Earth and meet with fiery death? End. Believe it or not, but this tiny plot description makes it much more interesting than it really is. Worse still, John Emery's character, Dr. Karl Eckstrom, considers it necessary to give long-spoken speeches about everything from human to nuclear weapons. It's just a thrill-minute (intended for sarcasm). <br /> <br /> Looking back at Rocketship X-M almost 60 years later, I would call the female woman a depiction if it wasn't so sad and mistaken. There are a number of examples to be mentioned, but immediately after the exchange, the dialogue between the male chauvinistic pilot Floyd (played by irritating, plastic-bearded Lloyd Bridges) and Dr. Lisa Van Horn (the only female team member) is exchanged. and Floyd's often horrible object of persistent attention), which illustrates the attitude of the film to women quite nicely: <br /> <br /> Floyd: "I've been wondering how this girl, like you, got confused in this kind of thing." <br /> <br /> ?? Van Horn: "I think you think women should eat and sew and wear children." <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: "Isn't that enough?" <br /> <br /> I think Floyd should have been left with his caves!
