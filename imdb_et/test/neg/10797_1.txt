It seems to me that Joe Estevez spends most of his time under the guise of his rather successful brother and appears in very bad films. Joe spends most of her time walking with black and looking pretty. He takes orders for the dead dead angel that you would feel Tango & Cash swollen as a facialist and swell the face of a cyber war of the future. Well, Joe and Puffy have a job to do and this is accompanied by the souls of some children on a big car headed by a stupid galo who doubts Led Zeppelin. Well, the car runs and the chase is on. Joe's fleeing happy kids look like Tonya Harding and Rick Springfield. They drive around the city, break things and Tonya gets her mother when she dresses in the bath. The activity comes to the hospital where we find out that driving in the sky is a lift. Finally, some green lights blink, Joe shouts and Puffy disappears without traces. I wish I could say the same about the movie. Look at the relative safety of MST.
