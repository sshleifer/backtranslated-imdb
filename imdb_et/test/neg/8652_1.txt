O my god WHY, did I waste this movie on expensive time? It's pathetic, blessed with OTT and unrealistic and one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. Yes, my life. I'm embarrassed by Yash Raj's films, poor guys have to live with terrible news that yes, they made this terrible movie. <br /> <br /> This is by far the most trashy, sexual, eyebrow film ever seen by Yash Raj Films. I'll complain about them, I really do. Together with Uday Chopra's terrible actions (or NOT acting on this issue) with a lack of talent "Look at my breasts" Tanisha, Neal 'n' Nikki has nothing good at all. Even music is not a standard left by the YRF. Directed by Arjun Sablok, here was a painful job. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I was expecting more. Much more.
