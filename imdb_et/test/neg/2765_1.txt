Noir is committed to being committed, not deceiving, it is a stink ... badly filmed, badly acted, and nothing ... anything here for a film that is looking for another solid B movie from the 40s and 50s of the 1950s classic. I tried to do it on a relatively high rating in IMDb. The taste does not have to be taken into account, but I did not find any other suggestion for IMDb members in this movie. This is a classic example of how I watched a movie and feel like you're frustrated by the number of x minutes that the movie went to that grateful death. Alan Ladd has almost two minutes on the cover of the DVD / tape and has less than two minutes in the camera and has almost no dialogue! This is not the weapon for the people of HIre ... this is a classic studio in a nervous sense that does not create a budget for the budget ... We are all looking for great ... save your time with Gangs, Inc. / Paper Bullets ... it's bad!
