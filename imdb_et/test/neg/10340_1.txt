I am 22 years old now and I remember it in movie theaters when it first came out. You heard me right, I was 5 years old, and yet I still remember what I saw so many years ago in the afternoon. Was it a mystical trip through the fantastic world of Mark Twain's creativity? ... No, on the other hand, it was a rather creepy movie for Mark Twain's dark, depressed and actually suicidal. One scene that still disturbs me was a particularly strange scene where Mark Twain plays the organ at his funeral. <br /> <br /> Will an adult enjoy this movie? Well, in this movie there are probably some interesting points that a person who knows about Mark Twain's writing can enjoy; but trust me in this, "Adventures" is not the movie you want to use to introduce your toddlers to Mark Twain.
