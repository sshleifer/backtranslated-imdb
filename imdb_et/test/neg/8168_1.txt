This is a film that reminds me of avatsi-starring rajesh khanna in the 80's. the question of division of parents and children is interesting, but it was dealt with in a rather unigeneous way. The characters were not fully developed and the children seemed quite loving (in the first 15s of the film) that they were not completely concerned. Parents, this transformation was not plausible to say they were little more researched. amitabh and jaya were uneven, because this helpless old couple .. first was not convincing in this role because he just didn't look like he should be helpless, i mean why not just go back to work where he wants to be w / kids who didn't want them .. hema wasn't convincing as a 60-year-old ... he didn't see the day over 50s. - A movie that deals with an important subject, but made better, I give it 5/10
