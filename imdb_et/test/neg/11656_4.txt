It was on "Shorts: Volume 2" - a rather boring collection of short films. Short pants are among my favorite styles, but people from the second collection found it difficult to find quality content - and it wasn't nearly as good as the first volume or other short collections. <br /> <br /> This short film feels inevitably incomplete. There is a story, but so many unanswered that the viewer, like me, feels a little out and is unfulfilled. The film begins with a woman, her boyfriend and her Westie (this is a dog, by the way) going to a lonely beach. The lady emphasizes that sometimes it is a little difficult to follow. Given that I find it hard to hear, I would be sure I would have loved if it were closed. Anyway, the boy goes swimming when he's asleep. When he wakes up, his dog is gone. He put and puts the guy on him. They spend most of their time arguing and unpleasant. Then they stop blue. Later, they find the end of the story of the dog. <br /> <br /> As far as characters are concerned, both seemed rather insecure and unlikely. She was a stubborn and demanding lady and she felt disdainful to her. When you thought why they were together, their little sex showed what bond they kept. <br /> <br /> Some may want testimonials - I found people irritating and unrealistic - more like cartoons than you might come across or know. It's not all worth waiting for (if you don't want to see a man naked).
