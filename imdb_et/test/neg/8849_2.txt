I appreciate movies from foreign countries with subtitles and especially those where the subtitles are weak and don't really seem to have followed the story or really make sense, but this film had too many parts that didn't really make sense. All in all, I can admit some scary and terrible parts, but they are repetitive, I felt like I was looking at the loophole; It seems that this was a short film filmed with different parties. <br /> <br /> RINGU and GRUDGE veins, but not even close to the hypothesis ... The exaggerated length killed the excitement. <br /> <br /> If you are not a dead hard fan of this type of movies (which I thought I was), don't waste your time in it.
