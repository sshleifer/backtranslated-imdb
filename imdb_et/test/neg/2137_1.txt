a boring, terrible piece of the Italian euro-garbage bin for a scientist who seems to spend most of his time eating beer (it makes him American, right? Our scientists spend most of their academic life out of their mind, surely. all really great theories come) who learns something (dolphin calls, fish migration patterns, who knows). He hears a strange sound through his headphones, proving that his radio chooses Jamaica. At the same time, Jack Skellington's girl, who has one of the worst, bleached bad hairs of 80, has ever been happy to witness, is trying to calm down the dolphins at Seaquarium, where she works. upset about how much fish he has been catching lately. The beginning of the movie was really a badly painted story of two annoying, very Italian people whose boat was under attack by something invisible underwater. A little woman never sees (the best part of the story) and the boys' body is without legs. A dim, alcoholic scientist (with an unexplained, English-American-Italian accent) and a hay-haired girl are theoretically thinking that a huge monster lies under the seas off the Italian coast. .Florida. <br /> <br /> They use the help of an electrician to create an underwater mike so that the monster can sing karaoke. This man has a beautiful girlfriend, whose only drawback is that he proclaims Peter "Pey-Tahi", but for some reason he is sexually drawn with an anatomical skeleton, which is a frizzly hair that leaves one flashing. <br /> <br /> Duplication is terrible, editor is spaz and the story is usually awake. It's a little bit about how this strange scientific corporation genetically transformed this monster's giant squid-barracuda thing for some reason that doesn't make any sense, and a really unpleasant fatty hairy guy is going to kill her again for no apparent reason. Driving is a stupid sheriff and his laptop deputy with a female scientist (who we know is smart because he carries big glasses). At one time, the female scientist took a big, terrible monster (yes, right, Ed Wood's giant octopus was more credible) with only a small revenge and won the race. Hooray for thin little women who obviously make the best monsters hunters! <br /> <br /> The solution to this gigantic problem is to blow half the Everglades, leaving the dead zone for several miles in every direction. Hell with ecology and the environment, right? We have to kill this giant monster! Finally, electricians and his broomman love their Vespa sunset, which is o.k. because she has overcome the deaths of her colleagues and she is not very upset that her girlfriend got a crazy guy with oily hair. Hooray for true love! Wait a minute, there's nothing like that ...
