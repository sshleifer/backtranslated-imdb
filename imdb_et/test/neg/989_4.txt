Talk about being bored! <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to this fascinating insight into the life of the person who wrote the mythical night on the Galaxy railway. I was expecting to see the exclusive man's mad stories and shackles and discover my inspiration for such a strange material. Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Spring and chaos are mostly boring, with only innovative animation. There is definitely nothing to write about at home and not nearly as good as NOTGR, which is something I suggest you look at. Leave this cage alone. If you absolutely need to see it, either rent it or find it somewhere cheap. Don't pay top dollars.
