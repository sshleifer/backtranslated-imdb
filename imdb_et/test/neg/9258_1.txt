Staten Icelandic filmmaker Andy Milligan is well known in the fear society because he is even worse than Ed Wood. And in this twilight example of my output, I agree with them. In "The Ghastly Ones", we basically have three fascinating couples traveling to their childhood home (conveniently located on a secluded island) to collect the legacy. There they are killed one by one and the events open up in a way of murder / mystery, where a thin retard hunchback butler is added to throw you in the loop. The film is in such a bad shape that it seems that someone just ran it through the dishwasher, the sound is terrible, the dialogue is bad, there is some primitive dummy gore (plus some breakages and guts) and it is technically unfair in every sense it may be wrong . But is it enjoyable in a bad movie? In some sense. It is an amazing watch, but a strange entertainment train wrecked way. Approach carefully. If you're not a fan of terrible movies, it's deeper in six.
