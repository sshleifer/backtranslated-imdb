I was really looking forward to watching this movie. It had all the ingredients of the big tongue in the cheek, but it just didn't come together. Kevin Spacey's accent was acceptable, except that he sometimes forgot to use it and I shouldn't have listened to Linda Fiorentino's pale attempt. He and Helen Baxendale were completely missing and personality, fortunately for their screen, the kids had loads, so you could find at least some of his 2 family members. You might want to try to spaghetti and I'm sure the script was written by some adolescents at an English language competition. This means that when I wasn't up, I was smiling so it wasn't completely wasted in 90 minutes. I found Kevin's face very painful in the painting and quite funny. Maybe I'm a little tough, but I waited a bit for quality viewing and it just didn't come.
