I would like to tell you that this movie is as exciting as the theories it offers. But I can't. The second species could have come and mutate when I waited for some action. For such a controversial person, Darwin lived the most common life. If you don't know about mad theories, you could almost hurt him for collecting the temple. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers have given Darwin a fear that serves him. Even if he lost his mind shortly because of his tireless theory, it was not interesting to look. Maybe big thinkers are boring people? I do not know what I was expecting: forehead-beating eccentric, with hairs and eyes that love his love for all things, the glow of frenzy that pulled the forged eyebrow down? A long-haired hermit who demolished animals? The main twilight, illuminated by the eyes like the beacons of truth? All of the above would have been great. It's a movie for Scorsese. <br /> <br /> But that was not the case. No lightning, no thunder, no wonder, no fear. Just Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly's fresh Subtle as a breathing school methodology. I imagine someone on Darwin's ideas had a brain like a speeding train, so why did this film just pick up - chug chug chug - like a slow winter? Disappointment is immeasurable.
