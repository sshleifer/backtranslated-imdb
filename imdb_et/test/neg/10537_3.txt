This is a very bad action movie for various reasons. First, Seagal is terribly out. He looks old and fats, plays like he has to fulfill a tedious obligation and his fighting scenes require creative editing or normal replacement. Second, his opponent is a very weak villain. It is a smart and medium mastery and does not produce chestnut. So what about action? Well, both parties are constantly shooting each other at different locations in the Alcatraz prison. They shoot natural and bad because the body part is quite low compared to the required ammunition. There is nothing to record this movie. There is no good line and no good fun. The little psychological difference with 49er One and judge McPherson is ridiculous. What is that? Well, ordinary bell helicopters, blue-light silhouettes and slow-moving doors, holes passing through 1000-watt lights, characters jumping into the air while shooting, wherever weapons come, a long black coat containing a bold black man and a thin wooden box containing 25 tons gold. The pain continues last, a hopeless approach to easing the closing credit. The California-based beachfront, Don Michael Paul, wrote and directed. At least this mountain of boredom comes from just one simple mind.
