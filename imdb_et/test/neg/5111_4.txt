When I wrote in Savage Intruder IMDb search engine, this was one of Savage's garden: international video library: story so far (1999), the only reason I mentioned it is that I'm a big Savage Garden fan & you should do it yourself and check some of your music, such as Affirmation or To Moon and Back, not to bother with this medium pot-boiler, sorry I just wanted to say that. Anyway, the Savage Intruder starts with an odd assembly that looks like MGM's musical and premiere and some revolutionary portraits that have no meaning in the long run. In the late 60's between Hollywood and the ages, there is a sequential killer at work, picking up aging actors, killing and destroying their bodies. A young man named Vic Valance (David Garfield John John Garfield) is giving up a tourist bus looking for a job when he stops at the house of the retired actor Katharine Parker (Miriam Hopkins), who was "one of the biggest stars" film, but currently lives in a big house , with the senior housekeeper Mildred (Lake Lake Florence), personal secretary Leslie Blair (Gale Sondergaard) and a young servant named Geta (Virginia Wing). Katharine has recently cut off her legs and needs a personal assistant and gives Vic a job. Slowly Vic competes for his katharine affection and more importantly for his big wallet. Vic is going to change Katharine against other staff, but Vic doesn't seem to be. Vic is a drug-dependent loon who gets Greta pregnant while having sex with Katharine. Greta threatens to tell Katharine and spoil Vic's cunning plans, but she has a close meeting, no house is safe, because Vic brings Parker manor into drugs, sex, rock'n's role and horticulture, while her unhappy plan is changing. more obvious ... <br /> <br /> Written, directed and directed by Donald Wolfe I thought the Savage Intruder was a bit messy, but at the same time lightly fun. The script is all over the place and it can't really decide what it wants to be, Savage Intruder carries an identity crisis! The film begins with the discovery of a broken head and limbs, immediately after the murder of a second woman (Dorothy Kingston) by a mysterious unidentified figure, but then it completely creates the elements of film she has never restored. Savage Intruder then becomes a kind of sensitive film because Vic communicates with Katharine and shows her how to enjoy her again and has an indirect sexual relationship with her, it's actually a nasty thought if she's old enough to be a grandmother. Katharine ends her life in extraordinary life and gives up alcohol because Vic seems to be happy when they go to the party and hold banquets for Katharine's friend as she used to. This part of Savage Intruder doesn't see Disney in the movie on the spot! Every so often, the feeling of good things, Vic, who strikes his mother (Sybelle Guardino) and silly hallucinations and cuts his hand with an ax, is also very sexy. When Greta is murdered, Savage Intruder turns into a strange horror film because Vic has revealed she is. Savage Intruder just doesn't seem to flow properly as a film because it mixes different genres with little success. Similarly, the elements of the mystery of the murder do not work and, frankly, are a bit of a mystery, why go to the murder scene to hide the identity of the murderers very far, but then make it quite clear who puts them in the rest of the movie? Vic as a character did not work for me, one moment he is a cool, calm, clever and frightening person, and then he is a tough messy loony! Why kill all the other victims, but try it with Katharine? What makes her so different? If it is because it has money, why not start after that? So many questions and so few answers ... Some of the 60's dialogues are pretty funny to listen to these days when Vic offers Gretale a painkiller, in reality, hard drugs, and Greta says, "What do I need a pain killer?" Vic is helping the "because of your pain", which this guy knows how to win! Or, if Katharine suggests that Vic does some gardening and asks if you have green fingers? he answers "no, but I'm good at the law!" There is not much gore in the Savage Intruder, some broken limbs and a pair of decapitated heads. There's also a pretty impressive shot when someone is holding an ax that is probably three or four times repetitive. The stupid observable hallucination scenes of drugs must be seen as credible. Technically, Savage Intruder is OK, filming a location in the grandiose mansion and the Hollywood Mountains will probably look better if it deserves, acting on average, as well as the rest of the production. In general, I would say that Savage Intruder feels that he is trying to be a murder mystery, which unfortunately gives away to the killer and as a result simply does not work. It's a lightly entertaining one-time viewing at best and a complete inferior movie, you decide what!
