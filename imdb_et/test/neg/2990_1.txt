Bad, surrounding sound. A lot of mixing. Loooong pointless scenes. Eg: A man sees an interesting woman in the lobby. Manages to stay there and watch him in the hidden expectation that the building supervisor will receive the package. Don't say anything. Marks terribly. More mixing and other irritating ambient noise. Wait. Wait. Wait. Guy says nothing. A woman sees fear or at least slightly disturbs her and rightly so. The manager comes back with the package. Guy goes to the apartment with a package. More ambient noise and mixing. Wait for a wait. The man is traveling to bed. If you can sit back on this movie, you can watch them later to watch the TV again. .
