jeez, when I heard that this movie was NATIONAL LAMPS, I thought it would be fantastic, but I really could say it was disappointing. I've seen the most of the movies they've made, from Christmas holidays to van wilder, and this film is the worst movie in their name, really bad actors and a much more intense movie. this movie is probably a good watch if you look at it with the people of working people and we can laugh, but if you're good at comedy like me, I don't recommend this movie, I'd rather watch van wilder the second or third time to watch this movie. .. you have been warned.
