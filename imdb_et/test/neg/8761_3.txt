"Zombie Revenge" is a rather weak and barely satisfying zombie effort. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Traveling in Bayou, Larry Adams (Robert Lowery) and Scott Warrington (Mauritz Hugo) are told that a friend is dead. Meeting with local Dr. Von Altermann (John Carradine) reiterates the idea that they are mysteriously dead. When they are there, they realize that help consists of zombies, restored people who make their master's offer. As the bodies grow up, he shows that he has made the creatures used in various experiments and everyone is trying to stop him before it is too late. <br /> <br /> Good news: there is very little right here. Opening is just the best, because it has several big characters. From where it starts, when horrible silhouettes are walking in the dark until revelation, it miracles both as a mystery and as a big picture. A great is really a scene where the creature comes up from the coffin in a long, slow and horrible picture. These are all here before the opening credit and this is a fun phenomenon. The scenes in the middle where the creature ranks inside the coffin are quite chilling and really look great. The last big positive is really a fun ending. With an end that remembers so many Universal experiments, it fits this style. From a terrifying transformation to a real action that is close to the swamps, it's fun and really works with others to give it to the real positives. <br /> <br /> Bad news: There are only a few errors here, but they are big. The first one is the main boredom of the film about inaction. Almost nothing happens here, mainly due to the tendency to speak everything, nothing else. Only intermittent scenes are placed in the zombies, but there is nothing to devote to the film any action. It simply has nothing to do, and that's what the film does. It rarely creates scenes that keep interest interesting and sometimes it makes it much longer than it really is. The film's last mistake is this pathetic apologies to zombies. Those who are accustomed to a more modern ticket price are frightening to their creatures and really have only several scenes. Zombies are not considered as threats here, making them even more frightening. The small screen time, the insecure nature and their fashionable behavior really destroy it. These are the ones that really hurt the movie. <br /> <br /> Final decision: watching bad zombies and hardly anything worthwhile, it's curious here. Those who are accustomed to modern zombies find that it doesn't interest it and come out the same as it is, while only classic horror fans have suggested doing so. <br /> <br /> Today's Rating-PG: Light Violence
