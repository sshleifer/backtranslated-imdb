... I've been left with little choice but I will use it at least once during the Respiro review. Among other things, what determines the claim is, in my opinion, the lack of emotional sincerity of the author. Respiro seems to have been made with too much and self-conscious intention to be artistic, symbolic, spiritual, provocative, metaphoric ... mythical, even. But fortunately, there are all true artists out there that there is no predisposition for artistic beauty and depth. Stunning in natural places (yes, these remote parts of southern Italy look exotic even to most other Italians), beautiful actors and some amusing, fun spontaneous appearances by small attractive kids. . Yet it is insecure and in vain and ultimately hollow films for art that only succeed in a very limited way, perhaps in some cases at random. I admit that conceptually at the pompous end there is some visual poetry. However, I believe that this was achieved in a way that was more closely related to the beauty of the Lampedusa Sea and its strong symbolic ability to bathe and water (combining so much that is mythical, mystical, religious, archetypal, etc.) than with the Crialese talent. <br /> <br /> Valeria Golino is boldly hysterical and influences her actions as Grazia. For a mentally unstable woman in a humble and provincial background, she definitely has a fashionable wardrobe. Her flattering, floating floral dresses and attractive sunny beach straps could have been the pages of every Vogue summer edition. The fact that he was a "nutcase" could be somewhat different than a fashionable addition to his trendy behavior and appearance - that is how skin deep in his "condition" seemed to me. Golino's two-dimensional stereotype of the innocent, natural child's wife, who was incomprehensibly understood and stressed by her inverted community, was worse and irritating, leaving me at best immobile and indifferent. I agree with a London inspector who wrote that mental illness in the cinema is very poorly earned - in the course of the film, we never get to know Grazia's disease and do not know what is wrong with him. annoying stereotype of "free spirit"). We do not know why he has injected and is required to see a Milan specialist. This general way of writing a mental illness is one of the main indicators of the overall lowness of the film. <br /> <br /> Another Respiro offensive is quantifying its location. I was embarrassed to figure out whether this film should have taken place today or in the past, seeing that its purpose was indeed a retrospective part of Italy (in comparison) to seem tenfold and more comfortable primitive than it really is. Again, this cunning and the lack of complete sincerity in the Criales section. Some non-Italian viewers glide nicely behind the prevailing, cliché of the macho Italian man, as if it were a normal place, so they would like to continue watching their country in a culturally chained manner in the 1950s (the question I would like to ask about David Ferguson, Texas, Dallas is next: is your country's mentality stuck in the 1950s? No, OK, why should I be?). Unfortunately, for those who still want to look at Italy in such anachronistic ways, this Respiro aspect is actually ridiculous and troublesome even in the eyes of this Italian viewer. Grazia and her eldest son had a subtle inconvenient tension and predictability as the sexist but loving husband of Fabrizio Bentivoglio. Especially, I was fascinated by this scene, where Grazia combines her husband and male finger over a bottle of beer, her husband's macho embarrassment and dissatisfaction. According to this film, this is not the place for a woman to participate in a man's conversation. Ah, but our "lovable" "free spirit" is too good for this place and does not understand the oppressive, unwritten rules of the Lampedusa Patriarch! This scene is not just a fake scene, but should in itself be enough to discredit the whole film. It is also a totally wrong end to the culture that it wants to portray, clearly showing that it has been written without a clear understanding of the location or its population. I would like to challenge everyone who knows modern Italy to say differently. <br /> <br /> For a truly accomplished contemporary Italian filmmaker who I think deserves to be one of Italy's famous cinematic past (unfortunately not his former shadow!), look no further than Gianni Amelio - especially Lamerica, Così Ridevano and his the last one, La Stella Che Non C'è. Unlike most modern Italian cinema, unfortunately, derivative and stagnant, Amelio has a fresh and independent creative voice. Despite my shameful review of Respiro, I am now more than ready to believe that Criales' latest Nuovomondo, now in the Italian cinema, is useful. So I'm looking forward to enjoying it, though it's not too shocking for me if I don't (considering my feelings for Respiro!).
