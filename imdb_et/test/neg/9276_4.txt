The last entry in the trilogy of the bus sees conventional waste disposal companies in their business in Wales. I am sure the franchise could have continued, but Harold Pinter complained that the scenarios made him worse, and so it was no longer done. <br /> <br /> It's actually less than two minutes before we can get our first sexism - the bus driver finds her breasts out of her dress for some reason. However, it does at least Stan (Reg Varney) laugh - but then what? He and Jack (Bob Grant) spend a little ridiculously ridiculously or not at all. You get the impression that they are wetting themselves dry. <br /> <br /> As before, the only funny element is the truly amusing Stephen Lewis, fun like Blakey. He is independently, with a cheesy, dated script that even wastes first-rate talents like Wilfrid Brambell and Henry McGee. However, it seems that only Lewis understands how the occasional shaking material laughs even on the weakest lines. In describing how his daughter fell by the river, Stan's mother "expects it not to be contaminated." "Well, it's now" Blakey quips. The plot - if it really exists - sees Stan as a laugh after a young girl, but her dominant mother has constantly hampered her. This is a recipe for adjacent fun. I'm sure you agree, and whether it's on a boat or swimming pools with a storm, exploiting Stan and Mavis will always bring the same result ... tired of boredom. Later, Maria, the Italian stereotype, and a co-worker are conquered. Even Stani's mother can stand one night, Stan reminds her to "put her tin drawers in." switch to the dark ("I can't find it") and thought he was talking about sex, so you understand why this work reaches the upper level of literary complexity. In fact, why it didn't reach the BFI's 100 best movies is over. <br /> <br /> Other rib-ticking Shenanigans involve Olive (Anna Karen) breaking her glasses. I don't know what's more surprising, lamp predictability or underdeveloped profitability. A short-sighted Olive follows a man who is in the lap who thought she was a woman's skirt. The next blow sees him on Blakey's march and directs women. And that's it. He then arrives at the other man's bed and his wife orders. And ... no, it's all in this scene. <br /> <br /> When the bus tour was last seen on British television, the transmission was a breakdown. It actually came to be a blessed relief.
