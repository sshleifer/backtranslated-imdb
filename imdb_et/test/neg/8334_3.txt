When the movie started, I got the feeling it was something special. The operation and camera work was undoubtedly good. I also liked the characters and could have dealt with them. The film had a good atmosphere and a hint of fantasy. <br /> <br /> However, when the movie went on, the plot never appeared to take off and just rolled the scene. I couldn't understand the relationship between stories. I only saw the signs that occasionally collided with each other and referred to the vessels in the bottles. Without it, I didn't have a couple of unremarkable short stories. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that Cannesis did so well
