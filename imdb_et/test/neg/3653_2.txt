I was looking forward to watching this movie, it seemed like someone who saw it. I was completely disappointed. The action was so superfluous. The script seemed that the writer had collected 25 different scripts from different films and randomly chose the dialogue and split them together to form one plagiarized script. <br /> <br /> Spoilers: Was there a cliché in this movie? Had mobstyle hit, homosexuality, prostitution, serum killer, fire, numerous godfather wannabees, prostitute-loving main character, cross dress, police torture, Hannibal Lechter-style injuries, I can go on and on. <br /> <br /> Similar to a line (godfather prostitute) <br /> <br /> "Ben senin arik calismani istemiyorum" (I don't want to work anymore) <br /> - "Ben calismasam kirayi kim odeyecek? " (Who would pay the rent if I didn't do it) <br /> <br /> Unrealistic Scenes: We've never seen any police officers during the serum killer scenes, but when the main character disappeared, his father took him to the police and tortured for weeks. <br /> <br /> The only way I can think of the idea of ​​this movie is whether the version on my scene was heavily modified by the original. I definitely do not recommend this and I would like to discuss it with anyone who will take care of it. <br /> <br />
