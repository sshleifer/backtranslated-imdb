After a record I hate spam. Except Mel Brooks and AIRPLANE! because they are classic and funny clich√©s, not real movies themselves. I think the scam movies are at the bottom of both the comedy and the film barrel. I especially hate things that Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, DESS MOVIE, EPIC MOVIE, and the "geniuses" behind SPARTANS have created. Since Friedberg and Seltzer had nothing to do with the production, I was as objective as possible. It was like one of their films. Basically, every sports film that was rolled into one flat nursery joke, and a disturbing picture of bodily injury, should laugh and fail. <br /> <br /> Only someone high would laugh with these jokes. Toilet bowl? Who wrote it? 11 years old? I was surprised that it was the creation of WEDDING CRASHERS producers, who was actually pretty decent. But the fraud channel experiment was as funny as a burning orphanage. The only reason I gave these two stars (if it was clearly earned) was that Friedberg & Seltzer had nothing to do with it.
