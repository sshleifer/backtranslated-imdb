Anyone who complains to Peter Jackson to make movies too long should sit through this CBS event. There's about a 45-minute story that has been padded for 2 hours with unnecessary sub-blocks containing blissful TV shows. Poor science is the main feature of harsh climates, so I'm not going to complain about it. Silly science can be fun to watch when it happens in a fun way. What kills this movie is that it has 10 subplots, all of which can be cut out without destroying what should be the central plot. One character that is fun to watch in Category 6 is Tornado Tommy, despite being a very annoying stereotype. <br /> <br /> Please note that I didn't like commenting on special effects. Their quality should not be surprising. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
