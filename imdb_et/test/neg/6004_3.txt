Se7en's blank top, not suitable for footwear cleaning. The word "predictable" must find such an event. Lambert is a tree, as always (moments of his emotions are ridiculous, as well as his accent). The "climax" is not at all as we have so many signals, and ultimately we are immune to meat, rotting, and so on. There is a real mess.
