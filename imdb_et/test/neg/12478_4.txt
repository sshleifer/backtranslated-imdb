Lucio Fulci, a director who is not well-known for his subtlety, tries to dead by touching black humor with his own hands, a TV movie by Lester Parsons (Brett Halsey), a psycho who seduces and murders a rich widow that pays for his gambling debts. <br /> <br /> Starting with a superbly passionate scene where a deadly lothario destroys his last victim through a chainsaw, a chopping machine and hunger hunts, Death touches will be enough to allow, but Fulci will soon lose control of procedures, introducing a strange sub-plot that includes mysterious copycat killer and some heavy comedy scenes. There are several more graphical murders that are really violent and harsh in the way of Fulc, but even a high level of bleeding doesn't prevent it from one of Fulci's poorer efforts. <br /> <br /> As with many of his films, the story behind Lucio's camera is not exactly on the agenda. This film has many special features that left me more than a little overwhelmed: why did Lester not destroy all his victims with a visible crushing method at first? Why are all his victims furry or hidden? What the hell is the end of everything? <br /> <br /> Many find Fulci one of the "bigger" horror craps; I do not understand his popularity, finding most of his films that I've seen so far, generally lacking proper stories and technical skills. The absence of death does not change my opinion for sure.
