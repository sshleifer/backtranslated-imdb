Experienced parties know how to act and have proven that before the director, who also wrote and prepared this travest, is so incompetent on so many levels. OKAY. it is a low budget, but I know that films with a lower budget and less well-known participants who can do a lot, much better. For example, because there were people involved who should know that some weapon platforms were completely irregular and never existed these days. Stunt work was clumsy - the story was hidden and hockey. If someone gives you a copy of it, use it on the laminate. By the way, I love the West and I have felt a lot of stuntmen and even went to one of the high schools, so I was looking for it to be good.
