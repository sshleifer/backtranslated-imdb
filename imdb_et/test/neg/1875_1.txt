Stripes, an army training camp comedy featured by Bill Murray and director Ivan Reitman, is my favorite. Meatballs, summer camp "romp" starring Bill Murray and director Ivan Reitman, are a complete waste of time. For the four screenwriters, it is necessary to make considerable efforts to create a film (the word "comedy" concludes that it is a work of understanding) as meaningless, anemic and boring as it is. <br /> <br /> Murray apparently came to the same conclusion while filming, but his usually credible improvisation powers are fleeing him and his hesitant attempt to inject life simply adds embarrassment - "It really doesn't matter" the scene of the song is embarrassing. It doesn't help that the supportive majority is the lack of talents - their most fun thing is their hair, but then the meatballs were made in 1979. "And by introducing Chris Makepeace as Rudy, it announced the opening credits. No, not Chris Makepeace?!) <br /> <br /> Reitman corrected his error two years later for Stripes. Murray shtick is so funny when he looks with John Candy, Warren Oates and John Larroquette. Ditch it and see it.
