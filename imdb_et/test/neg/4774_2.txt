It had the potential ... it really was. But the film is so much ridiculous and ridiculous. I'm a horror movie and I thought it was stupid; like my 13 year old! I was expecting me to be at least out of touch. And yes, there was a gross factor of vines for peoples; but getting a shelter is just stupid, stupid, stupid. <br /> <br /> I really mean who's going to hike ... into the jungle ... a stranger. little water and little snacks ... FLIP FLOPS, NO LESS?! Tel-rent! Better yet, who goes abroad and leaves the tourist area without translation or can speak a little language? Are these people full of morals? <br /> <br /> The German brother has not heard and does not need help? Who doesn't? He just finds some Greeks and Americans going to look and find a little?
