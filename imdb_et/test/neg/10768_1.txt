The mini-series screen writers should have been guilty of guillotine. They killed a very fun story and wasted the talents of Richard E. Grant. The only thing the writers kept from the original books was the name. All the characters were completely changed and the story was not the same. I strongly recommend the second version of Scarlet Pimperel. Every other version is better than this.
