Excellent fiction was played as if it were factual. Today I watched the Alcatra town. Robert Stoud was not an exemplary prisoner and he was in prison because he was pimping and the client did not pay. When he got into jail, he was so uncontrolled that he spent most of his time in solitary confinement or in a prison hospital. A few people were also killed in prison. This film reminds me of Alcatraz Birdman, but worse. Robert Stroud wrote books and contributed to society in some way. And BOA had some tips for Strouds' lunacy. HOW this man, Henry Young, who murders in the first sense, assumes it was a known bank robber who took hostages and beat them more than one robbery. He was not a poor man who stumbled in a grocery store that just happened to the post office and took the money. This man was a hard core. He also killed a man 3 years before he went to Alcatraz. He killed another person in prison instead of single imprisonment, which ended more than a year before the murder. The real story of his life would have been more interesting. They didn't even get the prison thing right. At the same time, you cannot be in 3 different prisons. And on all accounts, the custodian was upright when the guards went. If my math is correct, then Warden, played by Karl Malden in BOA, is expected to be the same filmmaker. Oh boy. Not only that, in this movie, we have to think that poor Henry committed suicide. And he wrote the word Victory. Not true. He was sent to Springfield, where Robert Stroud was also a medical center prison, then Walla Walla for another murder he did, and then released and jumped in 1972 with a password that was not found. Perhaps he has hung up this CB Cooper's son who jumped on this plane in Washington State after the bank robbery lol. Now it worked very well. Kevin Bacon belongs to the class of Jeff Bridges and Dennis Quaid, a remarkably undervalued actors' club. Gary oldman well they just could prepare a career so that he could play it because he was great. Christian Slater still sounds like Jack Nicholson, I'm not sure if it's good or not. Bacons' wife, Kyra Sedgwick, was in a movie that I just think she's a wife. I like him, but not in the flick. For some reason, I felt this movie when it first came out was to assume it was a special project for Kevin Bacon. I feel like he can take a person who is indeed a victim of a punishment system, there is enough and they share the light of their situation. Choosing other psychopaths to be victimized.
