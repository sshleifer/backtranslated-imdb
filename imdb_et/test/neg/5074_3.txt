How? I was wondering why I didn't see it in theaters or even in any of its commercials, and after I saw the movie, I realized that I had a HARDCORE confusion. I'm a big fan of the Transporter and a big Blade fan, so when I saw it, I imagined that a few killers, a lot of attacks, had a whole host of things in the fight of a killer. Instead, I got Ryan Phillippe's movie with a short studio called Statham and Snipes. The boy who makes sound and video in the crime lab got more time than Wesley. It was like renting a Jackie Chani movie, waiting for kung fu and Erin Brockavich. I look forward to bad movies from Hollywood, but actors such as Snipes and Statham should treat fans better.
