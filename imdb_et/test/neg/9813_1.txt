Anyone who knows something about evolution does not even have to say "fake". "it is never forbidden" is also a weak argument. The Universe has been said to have created a giant hippo that cannot be refuted. While it is fair, it seems that the only people who believe are the same people who open email attachments from people they don't know or give their bank messages to Zambia. No primate bones have been found in the United States and Canada. It is also a good reason why legal scientists do not investigate it. The same argument applies to the Loch Ness monster, ghosts and god.
