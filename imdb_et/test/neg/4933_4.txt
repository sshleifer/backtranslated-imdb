The beginning was decent; The end was fine. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film suffers from the full and perfect lowness of the characters, unrealistic confrontations / fighting scenes, and someone intelligent outside the shuttle. This changes the terrible middle of the scenario. <br /> <br /> Stuffs are looking for: too obvious predictions, fast healing cuts, too smoky fires, fun seat belts, late reactions. <br /> <br /> I gave it 4, not 0, because there were some elements of happiness and basic features development at the beginning of the movie. Relationships between the main, dark-haired girl and her groom are briefly touched and the blonde friend's influence on this relationship exists, though uncomfortable. The resulting business activity is becoming more and more common and done properly, as the second comment pointed out, not unexpected. <br /> <br />
