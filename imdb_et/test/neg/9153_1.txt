Who stores the store here? How could any producer / network manager / director allow the crew to stick to the skeeziest-faux plastic palm trees in the history of the film in the sand of Canada's exclusive beach and try it as a tropics? These trees were for real palm trees, which is the real fire of the K-Marti Christmas tree in the pink barrel. And who lets Dermot Mulroney go to the front of the camera with colored gray hair that wouldn't have been in high school? And does any genius who did the quality control of this thing think that he would improve (excellent) Canadian actor when he said gas instead of gas? Everyone who participated in the "writer" of the film, writer, director, actor, has done not only good, but also excellent work elsewhere. Between events that have changed too quickly and their deadly expiration, without any emotions, except for the obvious, exponential and natural - maybe it only seems to be one of Lifetime's worst films because all the red carpet pops it was featured. And I say this as someone who loves life. Everything that gives people? <br /> <br /> All of this said that a certain actor's work is in a certain critical film (and if you have seen it, you know exactly what I'm talking about) was so brilliant that the film would have taken me 10 if it would be the whole movie. Unfortunately, it was only five seconds.
