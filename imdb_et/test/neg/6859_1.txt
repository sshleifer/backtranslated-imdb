I've been following "LOST" with my family since the first episode. It was a great disappointment last season, they seem to be (writers) not sure what to do with the show, so they're trying to do it by stretching a whole episode of a single story line. The current season, which by the way I decided to look only at Rodrigo Santoro and also the little hope that things will improve; has been one disappointment after another; my husband and son even looked at the view. First, he (Santoro) will only appear for 30 seconds for each episode. But the real problem is a story that has nothing that is really happy, every episode can be shown in 15 minutes. We look for something that never happens in every episode; I'm not asking for every secret to appear at once, but how about the story of variation on the line? In the first and second seasons we had a different story, we saw the history of the characters, the little action, the little romance, now this is one big event that takes the whole episode. It's almost tiring to look at it when it's over, you have the feeling that you lost your time. It is now important to note that the actors are still large. I can't believe they killed Mr Eko (Adelawa ...), he was great, Jack (Mathew Fox) is still incredible, the perfect hero, so kind, surprising, brave. Sawyer (Josh Holloway), a "bad boy", is concerned about Kate (Evangeline Lylli), but it's cool. I miss Sayid (Naveen Andrews), Sun and Jin (Yoon-jin Kim & Daniel Dae Kim), they're all important part of the plot (or should be), but we hardly see them. I hope that Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro) will be at the show; if not, why did you make so much of his entry to the exhibition (Access Hollywood, etc.)? I'm sorry if I've been robbed for too long, but I feel deceived by this exhibition. When I started to look at it, it was used to it and now it is very disappointing to see how it goes. I'm here hoping for improvements !!! Katia
