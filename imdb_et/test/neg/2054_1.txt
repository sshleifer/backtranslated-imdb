I rented this movie today ... the worst movie EVER. It was a waste of time and a terrible story. Operation was terrible, especially by the "Sai" actor. He was so bad that it was ridiculous. I can't tell if this was his bad behavior or because it was that stupid first. I can't even wrap my mind when all this movie was terrible and pointless. I'm surprised that someone even thought this movie was a good idea and barely free it. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good vampire / horror flick, this movie is not you. Move right! It is a waste of time and money. Heck, I wouldn't even have downloaded this movie if someone would pay me. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that it doesn't even deserve "1". I wish I could give him "0"!
