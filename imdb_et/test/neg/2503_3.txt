Wow. I felt I needed it after watching it, but maybe there were other reasons I would leave my imagination. I felt I was using and abusing after hitting, watching this movie. Hairy breasts, thick mustache and well, hairy all describe this porn / horror movie, but hey, it was 1981, you can't call it "porneks" in the 70s and 80s without hair. <br /> <br /> It bites as a shock. But if I am using pornography from abundant Italian art, it's definitely in my library. The copy I have is in English with subtitles in English. I want it to have really badly dubbed English, I think it would have added an already existing sleaziness factor. The only white guy who puts in the movie is "Mark Shannon" - he's wearing a mustache, a hairy peeled piece of coat that really tries and gives it every time he "steps up". It was at the end of the era where porn producers actually tried to do something artistic. Something like a camera from a tropical background with a hairy man with a "doggie-style" sex with a woman. I can't laugh at all. <br /> <br /> This is one of the films I pray between my future wife and children.
