Too bad, I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director couldn't put it together. There are many activities, lots of promises, but it all comes down. The director did not do his job. Promising activity is flat. So much seems like a desperate attempt to save the movie. This version of "Rage" (credited by DirecTV in 1996) just doesn't have to watch this time. The other director would have done a better job.
