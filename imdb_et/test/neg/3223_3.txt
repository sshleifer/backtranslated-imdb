Well, I'm a big fan and follower of Elizabeth Berkley. I bought it from a DVD eBay for my boyfriend's birthday. We sat watching it and it was so boring. I never remember laughing. It's only about an hour and a half and it seemed to end. However, Elizabeth is great in this. Maybe it's just because I'm a big Elizabeth Berkley fan. If he hadn't, I wouldn't have watched it, but every time he came to my face, it came on. Unfortunately, even Elizabeth couldn't record this movie. Just a general story and terrible comedy changes the film you would like to leave for an hour and a half of your life. This is a very forgetting film.
