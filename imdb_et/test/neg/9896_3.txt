CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a strange documentary about the eccentric surffer living in Australia. For America's birthday, George Greenough has surfed and photographed himself, friends and recently dolphins in Australia for 35 years, using all the different invented cameras he has on his back, table or boat. In the mid-1970s, he joined Surf Mag editor and budding filmmaker David Elfick to create this visually interesting story about life and photography. The result is a 75-minute CRYSTAL VOYAGER function. Even among the audience of the 1970s, this film was not a film or a surf film, because George floods the child on a jerky table, not on a real surfboard .... it compensates George's tedious droning (sometimes so dry or sloppy that it was really funny ..) like almost a fire or something failed, the grandiose "you are" slipping power through the wave that ran for 23 minutes to everything set for Pink Floyd's music. In 1974, when the Sydney Opera House was opened, it also contained a cinema. was booked there as an artistic athletic OZ and got a default hit: when the "opera house tickets" cost much more than a movie ticket, the audience listened to this movie as a pretext of the Sydney Opera House, so the movie recorded the business as a small budget attraction for the locals and tourists who wanted to tell their neighbors that they have seen an exhibition there. It made it a myth that the film was a great crowd and a spread of reputation. antaasia film with FANTASTIC PLANET and had a trippy crossing the UK and Europe as a dual function. I ran it in the 70's coastal areas and the crowd was quite unreasonable about it. Recently, George has appeared in the Lord of The Flies style with another well-photographed sea adventure DOLPHIN GLIDE that offers spectators a dive and swim with Byron Bay's natural dolphins. It's an eccentric 20 min short and even more eccentric 20 min how George did it. Both met in a collective awakening of the media and the public in January 2005. All this makes CRYSTAL VOYAGER "you had to be" all these years ago. Especially at the Oz Surf night dinner last year, people turned up ... but in 2000 they turned every night to see summer summer movies ... ... so the fucking thing shook the second box office adaptation. How much this really is very open to debate. Again, they were obviously amazingly amazing with amazing astonishment. But since 1975, Elfick has been an important career and leader in many acclaimed Australian and international films. Look for a clear and current applause for your achievements if you don't see any jobs or STARSTRUCK or UNDERCOVER or RABBIT PROOF FENCE or LOVE IN LIMBO. But George is still floating somewhere by dragging and looking for something to shoot or fall into the camera.
