I was quite enthusiastic about seeing this movie. Its ads showed that it looks peculiar and I generally like Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, and the combination of the two seemed an interesting idea. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with Nurse Betty. Personally, I have usually found that graphic violence and comedy do not go well together and the only leaders who have successfully combined these twice are Tarantino and Coens. There is not so much violence in the Nurse Betty, but what violence has made me feel strange when I had to laugh. Of course, part of the problem for me was that there didn't seem to be many places where I was asked. <br /> <br /> The film does not work dramatically. Renee Zellweger's Betty, create the protagonist, is clinically uneven and impossible to relate in any way. I say Zellweger is doing quite well and Freeman, Rock and Greg Kinnear are doing a good job. The problem is in writing; Freeman is the only person who plays an interesting character. It's really too bad. 3/10
