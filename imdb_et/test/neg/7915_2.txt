... because it's another dead. Acting inanimate, second level animation, creative and uncomfortable songs (though the song sung by the devil would have been worth Tim Curry) and the weaker plot than Land before 99: fossils on the parade. <br /> <br /> I have to admit I haven't seen the first movie. I'm not a big fan of heaven or dogs, especially not together. However, I hope to see the first soon, because there was a reason why someone would create such a godly sequel. <br /> <br /> If I didn't get this movie for free, I wouldn't. t at all. For the "heaven" flick, the only good thing was the devil. 2/10.
