Hi people, <br /> <br /> I can't believe that the "shadows" that use this topic took this role. I don't think Cory Feldman would have taken that role. This film was a smoky pile of manure. Save your money and time and see every 250th peak. I swear I wanted to make Blockbuster laugh foolishly to let me rent it. Stay away !!!!!! Mr Hipp
