When this show first came to Disney, I love watching it all the time. It quickly became one of my favorite Disney plays, but this show became somewhat worrying and disappointing. <br /> <br /> Now I find some fun in the second and third seasons, they seem to look at some teenage shows again. I understand this garbage. The first season was very unique because it showed Sadie, who loved science and animals. The first season was a lot of fun. I don't like most of the season because of Ben. He irritates me and pisses me. The plot in the second season sucks and is just terrible
