This exhibition reminds me of "The Simpsons" episode where Smithers had just burned by Mr. Burns and was forced to live an unhappy life. All he did when the hour was to drink and watch Comedy Central. The effect was that Comedy Central was a pathetic TV channel for unhappy people who had nothing to do with their time. "Mencia's mind" is a little better than most of the Comedy Central programming, but it is still an example of why this channel is a low quality filler for people who have absolutely no life. It is true that Mencia is a fairly competent comedy that throws out tritical, soft ball ethnic jokes and money related to human pregnancy, sex or economic status or combination. of these three. If you've heard one of these jokes at one of your bars or work, believe me, you've heard what comedy "Mencia thinks". Carlos is also trying to have fun with the current events, but he has no creativity or originality. This does not mean that Carlos is always dropping out. I found that some of his sketches are fun, such as depicting his rap video as an oil-sheik. If you find shameful, mill-comedy, you probably enjoy the "Mencia idea". For those people who are tired of repetitive, pedestrian comedians who are wearing the same old-time jokes, stay away.
