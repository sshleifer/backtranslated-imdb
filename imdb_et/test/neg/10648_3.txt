After the failure of "Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth", the chapter that was a "blow of death" to the franchise was not a surprise, yet another embarrassing cheap deposit. An exciting attempt to explain the mystery of Pinhead and the puzzle box, which literally covers centuries of history, in a film that lasts for 90 minutes ... The inevitable action of sad action, inevitably evil B-film effects and a ridiculous and offensive attempt in the dark humor while STILL tries to keep the whole project seriously. I don't know how many frustrating directors this is? Poor Pinhead has so much time on the screen that every bit of mystery and threat that this iconic character has is completely lost. After an hour of talking and a dramatic attitude, we just want to say that the guy is busy! in lightly entertaining locations, especially in the first segment, this confusion begins to look and feel like cheap, silly TV straps that will slip after a while and end in the most ridiculous way: Pinhead with his pet Cenobite dog kills a lot of idiots ... in space! I'm sorry, but the real fan of the first two films that gave this movie more than 3 stars should be a shame. The next film is in the side book; "Hellraiser: Inferno" is actually a surprisingly intelligent and stylishly made movie-noir-piece that perfectly restores "Pinhead" as a master of illusion and cruelty and brings back the inherent evil concept of human nature. the centerpiece of the original movie and the whole story point. With any serious horror blower, look at Hellraiser I & II, leave the exhausting III & this one and continue with 'Inferno. You're not leaving anything, skipping this garbage ...
