I agree with many others that this movie was quite boring and boring. I found that I didn't like the main character and the next actors and actors. The work of the camera was not pleasant. Random shots and shaking movie scenes made me quite annoying and I turned the film out. I am doing my time, following the 1999 adjustment, and I hope it fits with reason and sensitivity; Emma; Getting Jane; and pride and prejudice. I only have a few others who watch these films, but I believe they were very tasty. The music was also on the scene, reminding me of another show I had seen this year. It was called Hex and BBC show. I found this one night on the web. I liked the first season rather, but the second season was dry and pulled things out of the air, which should remain cloudy. I found the main man in Henry's movie. Maybe I just don't like his way of talking or his growth. Well I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless they're going to silence it and they wanted to look at the ways of the era or how the homes were kept at that time. Again, I look at the 1999 version and hope it is better, and whether Jane Austen will give her justice in writing.
