This story is hard to turn. Great book / Good movie from Fred Zinneman, but this movie is FULL! First, the casting was terrible. Richard Gere should play Jackal himself, as Edward Fox was a similar cyber and they did not have to mix the original script, adding so many valuable (expensive) troubles. This film reminded me of Bruce Willis's films as much as you can see in the huge expense of not showing such cinematography. (This is his "Conspiracy Theory") It makes the real thing to make the film of such a fine from the original script. Every person from Michael Caton Jones should be banned from making films for 10 years; this is the insult that this film offers to true filmmakers. It would be a Hollywood trial because he had no idea what they were doing, this film would be an exhibition A. Shame on you ALL!
