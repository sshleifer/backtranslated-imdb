when I watched this mess, he reminded me of the movie title FIRE, which is the fire of this garbage. I don't even know what to say acting blew, the fire really looked fake, Andy chicks are not exactly supermodels. And finally I don't know what people are complaining about, I have this fucking movie, yes happy birthday to me. I think it may be worse than I could be left behind 2. And to make things worse, I have a whole set of DVDs, fire, volcano, earthquake, avalanche. All I've lost is a fantastic tornado movie that I hear sucking balls.
