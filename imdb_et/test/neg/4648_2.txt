Cameron Mitchell plays an actress who has met a younger actor who has so far used a film studio (too young for both). At the party, when she illuminates the cigarette, the studio boss throws a large amount of alcohol on her face and catches the fire. In the hospital, his face is fully bonded and he still lights up the cigarette! She becomes Movieland's wax museum and palace resident sculptor, where she lights up cigarettes! <br /> <br /> Mitchell is recovering more or less so that his face is badly done on one side. gray tie and ribbon and eyepiece. If Mitchell is not smoking, he kills people. Well, he sometimes kills people because he prefers to inject something that makes them a kind of waxy coma. If he does not manage it regularly (and he never seems to remember), they start to move a little, though they are in a hypnotic zombie state. But not all of his sculptures are people. Obviously he has a talent for sculpture. <br /> <br /> The end that seemed to hit a lot of poorer print than the rest of the movie is really absurd. They didn't know what to do and went back to the title of the idea. In addition to the strangely grainy final frame, the rest of the film has a pretty good shape, except for the sound of some scenes that sound like it was a blown speaker. Definitely not one of the best wax museum films.
