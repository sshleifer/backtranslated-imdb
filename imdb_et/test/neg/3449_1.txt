I'm glad I never saw this example when it came out. <br /> <br /> I just wondered why it lasted 4 years. It reminds me of the terrible 80s of fake people, fake clothes and fake music. How did I ever grow in this era? <br /> <br /> Acting in most of the episodes being tracked is forced. It makes very boring exhibitions. The plot lines are not very interesting when showing an old Twilight Zone. The old exhibition inspired imagination and provided the next exhibition. <br /> <br /> Leave the old Twilight Zone and save yourself from garbage viewing.
