The button with the button gives the couple a chance to be free of charge, but the cost is a person's life they have never met. This is a very annoying movie to watch. Richard Kelly, who wrote and directed it, decided to make a movie without payout. You will be slowly recruited with a series of small revelations. At some moments, I thought that it was of great importance, but nothing. The film leaves one way of thinking: "This story could have been spoken for 30 minutes without all the mess coming out." I hope you avoid this god of horrible movie and keep your peace of mind.
