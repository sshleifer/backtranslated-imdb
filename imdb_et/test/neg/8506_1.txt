I remember it for a movie hour. . . silence. More than half of the movie has ads (no, really!). The easy pretext of the story can easily be said in 25 minutes (and almost is!) The end result is a predictable sculpture that is obviously put together in a harsh commercial attempt to bring some more bucks from the modern Debbie Boone hit. Yeah, it's as fast as it was made ... a song that "inspired" was still great when the movie appeared! <br /> <br /> Despite the decades of bad films, it is still impressive for the extravagant, smooth, stop-jumping of the most annoying, absurd and indelible cinema. It really deserves to be included in the top 100 worst IMDb lists and has never left the top 3 of their personal "worst" list. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this thin masochistic excitement!
