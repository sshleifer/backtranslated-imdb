First of all I have to say that this is one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen in my life! Unfortunately, the factor number one: never see the "son" face (the whole movie). And an infinitely more annoying factor: this incessantly rings the phone ... nothing but listening to the ringtone over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. . The old man was harassed, but VIEWER was too! At first the film was interesting to me, but it worsened very quickly. The film may be short, but it was certainly not enough to keep up with the length of the feature films. I think what I am trying to say is that the message of racism (which eventually appeared in the last two scenes of the movie) is secondary to the harassment of the old men. Who cares to sit and watch what is really more than an old man who smiles at someone who called him? If you've never seen a movie that just goes under the skin and drives you to CRAZY ... check it out!
