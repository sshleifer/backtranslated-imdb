This is the situation of Emperor's new fabric. Someone has to say, "It's not funny and original, (etc.) Film, it's a bad movie. Don't waste your money." The film is inconvenient and the people living there are embarrassingly worse trailers. They are just too realistic. They have no lines, they don't act. The American dream does not create shameful non-quality films or anything that is shameful and of high quality; it is something of quality and thus success. Only people who desperately want to praise any movie that hasn't been made in Hollywood (this can't be done in Hollywood, is it?) Try to attribute some quality to this movie. It is worse than "Ed Woods", another movie from the filmmaker without standards. These movies shouldn't have been done, and you shouldn't watch the "American movie."
