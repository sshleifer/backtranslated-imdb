I saw this movie on the big screen today and I can't honestly believe some of the comments made by the people here. I was really hoping to touch this movie, but I wasn't. <br /> <br /> I am a former Australian army and very patriotic to this great country, but I feel this film does not give us justice and those soldiers who fought in this battle. <br /> <br /> The film is badly filmed. I thought it was terrible, they weren't credible, and they didn't give me a reason to take care of them. People say that this movie was graphic, there were a few graphic scenes, but I found most of them very weak. War scenes were very short and only a few minutes. <br /> <br /> In general, a weak film that does not make these soldiers justice.
