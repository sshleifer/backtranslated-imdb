Not just the money we rented for it, but also the movies. I'm talking about how big production companies are wasting so much money on things that are actually boring and not ridiculous. The millions with which they made such a movie, because I don't think the actors here actually work for a free or insignificant amount. With that money, imagine how many good independent movies you could make, or maybe a good Hollywood movie. Its just hanging out for you, but not for anyone, just most of the teenagers who are ready to go and see the Ashton Kutcher movie, just because they are his fans. I don't know if anyone with common sense can actually act in such a movie. If you look at it in the future, the participants will have the same movie quality. So I think I shouldn't be surprised, I couldn't wait anymore.
