OK, just what HELL should all mean? Halloween 6 (let's just call it OK?) It is undoubtedly the most secure film in the series (and what I've heard doesn't see the original "cut by" producers seeing it doing anything) less nervous than "formal" release). What a mess. <br /> <br /> It's not really a bad movie, as some have said. It has its own scary scenes and some quite intense moments - it doesn't make any death! Don't tell me that Michael was "originally created" to be evil and kill and destroy, and blah blah blah. It was bad enough when they turned to Michael Jamie Lee Curtis's brother (so they had an excuse to keep him in another movie) - that's too much. <br /> <br /> It seems that this is another case of filmmakers trying to be "too smart" by presenting a new premise that shocks and impresses us all. Bad movement, boys. We are not looking for an explanation of why Michael kills, so please do not try to mess with us. Show me Michael is threatening and killing a lot of people. Show me dr. Loomis, who tries to track him down and, as always, just short. Don't waste (which turned out) to Donald Pleasance's last performance, telling me (as confused as possible) that Michael was "created" by some cult in hell and that his "seed" is passed on to another and ... oh, brother. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 has its own moments, it doesn't get me wrong, and we all know that it has been worse than FAR (Hellraiser, anyone?) loads a deep red corridor, especially effective) and try to ignore the screwdriver plot. Hopefully one day we will see all of the "producer cuts" and maybe we will have a chance to make it a little more meaningful. So far, it has to do ... <br /> <br /> -FMM
