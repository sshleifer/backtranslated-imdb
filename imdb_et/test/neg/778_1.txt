I do not understand why so many of the comments here indicate that this is acceptable entertainment. This cinematic monster cannot be overestimated. I and my girlfriend looked at it together and I'm not sure we can ever have sex. I'm not sure what was worse, filthy, unpleasant cast, their extremely photogenic genitals, dirty humor tests, amazing voices claiming to be songs ... <br /> <br /> No, I know what was the worst. Girls in a green trick, with a green face, licking Alice to dry her, and then offered the child a broken speech to breastfeed milk. It was also the worst. <br /> <br /> Also, what about nurses and why do they have so many problems finding each other's vaginas? Why are all male participants gay? Why Humpty Dumpty casts a dildo in the air and pretends it's a penis? Why did my eyes have to see it? There are no words.
