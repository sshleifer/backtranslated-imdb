My mother and I rented this pearl a few years ago when she was here to attend Thanksgiving. I have so rarely laughed. It is a typical low budget horror movie with stupid special effects, a worse plot and even worse action. But do you really expect classics when Linnea Quigley gets the best reward? I thought not. <br /> <br /> Because this movie has some entertaining value, I'll give it three out of 10.
