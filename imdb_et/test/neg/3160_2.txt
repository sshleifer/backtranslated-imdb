Spheer used this documentary to push the stereotype. This documentary is biased and manageable, not objective. Cutting methods that jump from interviews to interviews can be used to exclude interviewees from the context. When watching a movie, the sticky idea of ​​the punk interviews is that they are pretty stupid. The band members and other trousers seem to be little intelligent and unable to explain their motives or give general or uniform answers or even answers. I very much doubt that if some of the interviewees knew what Spheer created or saw, the final product will allow the project to be involved. This film puts the pants in the light, making them unknown and easy. The Spheer movie should not be taken by L.A. as a punk scene. If you want to see a good point documentary "Another Country in Your Mind" with a youth brigade and social distortion.
