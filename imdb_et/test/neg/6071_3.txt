Amazing! <br /> <br /> Despite the good results of Ed Harris, Diane Kruger and strong budget (3-star reason), the film is the worst thing I saw in the compilation of the composer and the worst-performing music masterpiece. I agree with some fiction to update a biography that wouldn't otherwise be so "charming". This was done with the best results in AMADEUS, but this B copy is a mistake here. Beethoven had a strong person, but he was a sensible artist. In this movie, however, he sees much more than Mike Tyson! I do not know whether, despite his deafness, he heard all the whisperings in the last scene (can an inner ear implant?). I prefer listening to the ninth CD with some nice maestro. Today, most of them run modern Vagner orchestras. By the way: I gave Amadeuse the 10/10!
