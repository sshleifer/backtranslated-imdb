Sorry it was a shameful excuse for the film. The plot line was so bumpy that it reminded me of a block of Swiss cheese and pleasant letters that seemed to me to be completely interpersonal. Well, of course, except for Carlyle and Lee-Miller, whom I could have sworn, I had to be in love. Unlike Tyler and Miller, who were mostly, like the rest of the movie, completely convincing .. although the final product was innocent and amusing all the lies reasons, production values ​​were high and worthy of recognition ... but unfortunately the end result was garbage. they should have packed it early.
