This is a typical "perfect crime" thriller. The offender and the investigative police officer are being ignored, ignoring all the clues, who knows who is to blame. The public must wait for the whole movie to be guilty. The result is like any "Columbo" or "murder" episode. The director himself refers to the hacker, showing a police officer who looks at the Matlock episode! This story barely takes 90 minutes, but the director demands that every 120 minutes be filled with each book. Leave it out, you're missing something.
