This movie is terrible. Action is cheesy and ridiculous. If you know anything about Rugby, the game's action is boring. In fact, any Power Rangers episode contains more realism than this movie. "Action" consists of no more than one passage and shooting that transmits the test line or which is not handled without the ball and the heroes who knows who knows. It is impossible to say. There are no exciting, skillful, and hard points that the real Rugby contains. As far as haka is concerned, it is a bunch of attempts to mimic a tradition that they do not know, such as the character of a white scar that should have been excluded from the film. The next time we're dealing with a Rugby movie, we can only hope that people who know Rugby will do it.
