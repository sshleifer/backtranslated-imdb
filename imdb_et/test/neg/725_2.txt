Others have mentioned the dialogue on this series and I agree with that. <br /> <br /> If the mother and daughter were really sharp, they should be the queen and the princess of the universe, not in a small town. <br /> <br /> I have really tried to watch some episodes, but when the witty staccato mumbling pop culture starts, the klappin channel. <br /> <br /> I looked a little new episode to see if something had changed (the better I was hoping for), but the quick, the same old "we are so clever with our reference to pop culture", which I almost barreled. <br /> <br /> Long-term fans who are not satisfied with the latest seasons because they can just wake up and get sick of regurgitation that never stops.
