QUICKIE (1 out5 stars) <br /> <br /> A pretty bad movie ... the story of a high mountain gangster who wants to give up his empire to his intuitive son. Of course, it is not easy or just to stop this route for someone ... so the contract is put on his life. Following the expulsion of the big party (Jennifer Jason Leigh, whom I think will never be anything other than TV movies or low budget direct video bin), the scene is called. Our "hero" makes him bypass, offering him great money for "fast" ... he falls down on his offer, even though he needs money ... but still beats overnight ... even after he harasses him when he thinks he sent his father to kill. Ugh. The story goes on and on ... you'll see every "twist" and "turn" that come miles away. For some groups, the "Tiger Lilies" strange soundtrack guides most people's nuts ... but I thought it was finally a kind of track. Or maybe I was just excited because I can say that the movie was almost over? Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer ... what the hell happened to you?
