If good intentions made the film big, this film can be one of the greatest films ever made. The film has big actors, a master director, a remarkable theme - at least a desirable significant subject, the undertone of the existential world-fatigue of the fifties, the air scenes that should have burned both senses and imagination, and characters, one of which could be deeply cautious. It is a question of patriotism and healthy patriotism. <br /> <br /> Ten years after the movie, I felt that Air Force officers taught my R.O.T.C. classes at university. They were intellectuals. They thought deeply about their work. They have a sense of humor. One was a crew member on the first plane to drop a hydrogen bomb. I've been wondering if anyone of them died in Vietnam. I imagine they flew there. <br /> <br /> Sorry, the movie is not successful. The film lacks visual interests, drama, expression of cognition, and celebration of patriotism that emphasizes narrative. No actors in this movie in June are worse off at allison. Her Susan Holland is a woman to escape, not to embrace. Colonel James Stewart (who was then a colonel) does this role as a colonel (and later a colleague) in the Dutch Netherlands. But the most interesting thing he does in this role is a sandwich. I'm not kidding. Stewart was good as biting sandwiches, as he did in the Saint Louis spirit. <br /> <br /> You might think of Ted Williams, but I'm not doing it when I look at Mr. Steward in this role. I mean William Holden as Harry Brubaker in the Toko-Ri bridges. Comparison is not good for Mr Stewart, who seems to be wasted in this film. <br /> <br /> Footage from B-36 looks like airline ads. Although beautiful, the air is hot everyday. Today, they have impressed the viewers. The clash in Greenland involves some modeling. You expect the result to be good. <br /> <br /> The undertone of the movie - the subtitle - shows that air force teams need to be familiar with their long-term missions and the air force that air forces have used for their business - well business like any other business. One depicts how La Nouvelle's insecure director could explore this issue and then think about how someone with imagination would have filmed the film. A few moments are missed. When the teams returned from longer missions, the crew members received a picture and massage before the mission was introduced. Showing what might have helped. <br /> <br /> Banality was an air force's desire and Mr. Mann housed the brass. Maybe the movie works in that sense, but not for me. <br /> <br /> I mourn while watching the movie because I think we all, director, actors, team, viewers and members. the armed services could have given and get much more than we got here. <br /> <br /> I don't think this movie should have been dr. Strangelove or 2001 never understood. But I enjoy watching it. I think their long missions and ground teams are in isolated places. There is a certain meaning of honor here and I celebrate that honor. I certainly understand why people who praise this movie here and in other places appreciate it. If there was no deliberate mistake, I get 10. <br /> <br />
