If you see this movie in TV lists, ignore it. If you are looking for something frightening, it is better to look at the X-Files runtime. <br /> <br /> The previous comments that point to the incredibly poor performance of a female driver are dead. He's almost unobtrusive. The total amount of his choice includes "whiny and scared" and "whiny and not afraid". <br /> <br /> I'm a movie buff who enjoys a good "bad" movie. But that's ridiculous. There is no direction. The plot is as simple as the number of numbers they throw at you and resemble a set of numbers, it doesn't matter at the end. <br /> <br /> Your time will be better when you turn off the TV and give your dog a bath.
