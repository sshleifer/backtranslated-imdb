I just don't understand how someone who is a fan, or just someone, could find this terrible, lazy, badly written abomination even remotely funny. It is so embarrassed below that it corresponds to a real tragedy. Its potential was enormous, it could have been great. What a shame that all the talents, kits, props, good will of all involved were so miserably wasted with a script that should have burned. <br /> <br /> There is a clear lack of any rigorous production and quality control here. Like these hammy Hollywood movies (the mad mad world, the casino royale), where the stars are just against each other and "have a great deal of time", which basically means no control to do anything. <br /> <br /> I could have written a better one to send me to sleep. Actually, I'm awake though. I did this in 10 high schools and presented it with my classmates. It was better, I look at it now and the gags are more funny. Steven Moffat You are TALENT BUM! What a waste that is wasted opportunity. Makes me cry.
