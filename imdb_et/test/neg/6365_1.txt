When I heard the release of the movie and the topic it was, I felt very curious. But when I saw it, it was the biggest fraud in my life. Technically speaking, the sound is bad, you can talk about the rebuilt manners of the studio that have been badly achieved in the final blend. Secondly, photography is mediocre, some of the films show some night vision soldiers and how the operator reaches this "dark night" illuminates everything as if they were in a real military base with lights. my god! And no less importantly, most of the batteries are really poor, it's not entirely plausible if the roll of a soldier's wife, her performance is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> A great disappointment, a jury of shame who decided to send this film to Oscar to represent Colombia.
