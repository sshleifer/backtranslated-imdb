I didn't make any big assumptions that it was definitely a very free adaptation to the work of Eça de Queiroz and I have to say that this free customization makes up as many possible good ideas and signs of the book. The problem is how to do it, with no caution, no taste, only the rumor of bad tastes everywhere. The script is so fake and unreal characters that make the dream of seeing actresses nice, Unas, Bryner, Morgado, Lagarto and others lost themselves except for cinema or storytelling. To my surprise, the newcomers, Jorge Corrula and Soraia Chaves, are brave in their presentations, but you will see that they have disappeared as an undirected boat without any direction. And are we talking about this direction, it seems to have disappeared completely in this movie? Where is the Director? Everything is a bad taste; Frames are any, and whenever manual use of the camera without a valid reason, there is no light design that should build the environment (and no excuses that all the point is a dark real story). The problem with this overall film test is that there is no taste or very bad taste. It is sad to see Jorge and Soraia melt in fake and peaceful sexes that have been painted here and there, through a film like holes in the closing channels or motives of fakes. Perhaps Carlos Coelho da Silva should see the adaptation of Carlos Carrera's 2002 book, Eça, and manage to build a real film.
