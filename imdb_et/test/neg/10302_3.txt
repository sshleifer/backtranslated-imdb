This movie starts from the wrong foot and never goes. The first scene shows the landing of the helicopter with Life Flight, and you can see the mountains clearly in the background behind the window. For those who may never be in Houston, there is no change in height. The city is above sea level and a 5-foot slope is considered a great mountain. To get to this landscape, all the shots in the hospital say to the viewer that they are not in Houston. Trees are missing leaves or there are pine trees, none of which is very large in Houston. Even the hospital itself, from outside, is very unbelievable. Memorial Hermann Hospital is one of the United States Higher Hospitals and is just south of the medical center in the south of the medical district, but every outside hospital shows that the hospital is out of the suburbs, or it is obvious that anyone responsible for the real tropical storm section , went out because the numerous radar shots were wrong. The first film radar picture is Hurrican Hugo, who hits South Carolina. Later we saw that Kris Kristofferson left his job and one of his assistants tells him that Alison is moving south of Houston, but Alison is clearly out of the Gulf of Mexico to Houston on his radar picture. Alison. <br /> <br /> As for the actor, it's not that bad. JoBeth Williams, Kris Kristofferson and Rick Schroder are doing all the right job, given that it is a live TV. The story plot is decent and the fact that it is based on a real story makes it a little more fun. One of my problems is shown by the Houston people, who have great southern heights ... actors who sounded like they are between Birmingham, Alabama and not Houston, Texas. and to the public he does exactly what he wants: entertainment. If you are looking for a factual overview of what happened to Houston in June 2001, you are disappointed. One thing to remember before watching this movie is that it is based solely on the evacuation of Memorial Herman Hospital, not on the tropical storm Alison and the impact on the Houston Metro. If you are looking for a real report on the tropical storm Alison's impact on the Houston Metro, I would recommend looking at the channel's channel for the tropical storm alison. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 *****
