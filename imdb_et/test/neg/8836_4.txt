STAR PACKER is one of the approximately 152,000,000 westerners that John Wayne was operating in the 1930s. Well, this figure is a little exaggerated, but it seemed almost as much. This is because these B-films were made quickly with very small budgets to be second or smaller in the theater. Most Bs were quite cheap and inclined to cut costs and STAR is no exception. To save costs, no random music is used, downtime less than an hour, writing was often derived, and actors are mostly less talented - and Wayne himself was not the name of the household at that time. Some of these Wayne functions are pretty good, while others, as it is, are traceable but also quite stupid and irrelevant. I enjoyed this movie and most others, but it's probably because I cut Bs a lot of relaxation. <br /> <br /> Wayne stars as John Travers - USA Marshall, which explores the actions of a local gang to chase local people and steal on stage. It's strange because the film was probably set to be contemporary or near it because they used handsets and modern machine guns - things you just didn't expect in Old West. Such anachronisms are actually quite common in B-Western - as Gene Autry's films (for example) are with them. Wayne's Sidekick is Yak - played by a stuntman and the real friend of Wayne, Yakima Canutt. <br /> <br /> A bad guy is an unknown figure called "shadow" and he gives his instructions through a black screen that hides his face! It sounds exactly like it is a movie series character - what the kids loved, but the adults fell as they were so stupid and a bit like Blofeld or Dr. Evil! The problem is that when you listen to his voice and pay attention to it at the beginning of the film, it appears that this "shadow" is George Hayes. Now, speaking of Hayes, this is the same guy who is later known in the movie as Gabby Hayes, but here and in several other Wayne films, he sees and acts NOT like Gabby. In STAR STARER he was well dressed, articulated and cleaned - imagine! In real life it was probably more real George Hayes - although I doubt he was evil! Now that you can say in the last paragraph that there is really no secret in this movie. You have the ability to function (satisfactory and nothing else) and tricks - which were really amazing. Again and again there was an amazing stunt after another - like men who jumped from horse to horse and some big fighting scenes - all, by the way, Canutt and his friends. Canutt was often double in John Wayne films - and it took decades. The problem with some tricks, however, is that the filmmakers actually killed some of the horses to get those big "stumbling blocks" to see later in the movie. Until about 1940, filmmakers often pulled a thin metal wire and ran horses over its full length! In the process, the legs of the horses were usually broken and horses were killed later! One of the worst examples was JESSE JAMES, where several horses were brutally killed, which led the American humane association to demand that the representative of the organization be in the film to prove that the animals did not harm production. So, since about 1940, movies have a little responsibility. STAR PACKAGE was made before the disclaimer and I don't see how the horses did not kill these "tricks". <br /> <br /> Generally, it's a time-passing because of the plot. occasionally bad behavior and incredible cruel attitude towards horses. I'm not the heart of bleeding, but I just don't understand the disregard for this bad old animal.
