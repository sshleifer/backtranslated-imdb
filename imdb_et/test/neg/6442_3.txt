I spent three months living in London's East End in the second half of 1987, when the exhibition was almost two years in the air. There was a running joke there. <br /> <br /> Why? Because it was white. Each cast member and extra in the first few years was white. <br /> <br /> The street where I lived was tall, over 800 houses, and to my knowledge, I was one of three or four white faces living on this street. We were in the corner of the "Quarter" of India and Turkey, and even if you excluded these two races, Asian and Afro-Caribbean white people crossed over twenty. And, of course, of the few white people who lived in the area, most of them were Scottish like me - the "Cockney" accent never heard. <br /> <br /> It was not a racist bead, just a simple factual statement. The BBC was unable to interfere with London's crossing to do its research before writing this soap, or else they had only white actors who decided to bluff. <br /> <br /> In both cases, as I say, at the end of time, we thought it was a comedy show. :-)
