This movie is about two female killers who are traveling to kill the random men they meet. <br /> <br /> "Baise-moi" got the worst movie of my time. The plot is crazy, pointless and unnecessary. The whole movie is full of violence and sex, and I'm sure no sensible parent would want to show this child to their children. I don't understand what people get out of making this movie or watching that movie. Maybe someone has fulfilled their perverted desires. The existence of perverted and exhausted work is not just an excuse or a reason. <br /> <br /> The only consolation I offer is that I looked at it quickly so I didn't waste so much time.
