I've become a big fan of Carpenters and I didn't enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I think it focuses too much on your anorexia and did not let his true personality shine. I was not too fond of depicting Cynthia Gibb; especially knowing that he decided that Karen's anorexia was a suicide that it was clearly not. Though her family was not great at hugging and kissing, I thought the film depicted Agnes (their mother) terribly. <br /> <br /> I have found some scenes that were harassing in the way he sees himself in a mirror that seems distorting and harder; I thought the metaphor (so to speak) was quite effective. When the family plays the pool and talks about his divorce and he breaks down and Richard is shocked when he feels comfortable and feels that his weak body is quite mobile (which is probably the wrong word). <br /> <br /> Generally, I think they need him more effervescent, peculiar - his true personality. Even if at the heart of the film, there was no point in understanding what would mean her anorexia (although of course no one really knows), and almost it seemed to be unfounded. The film was, in my opinion, a poorer singer-anorexia than the story of Karen Carpenter. <br /> <br /> I assume they changed their husband's name / profession and everyone because they didn't get their permission actually contained it (there were some bad conditions), but all this aspect was inaccurate with the changes. With this remark, I cannot recall a film that brought out its longing for family and children, which greatly exceeded his life and explains his romantic romance and his quick marriage with his wife. <br /> <br /> Generally, it comes as a low budget TV movie that is simply not very high quality and may be disappointing if you are a hardcore fan who hopes to see beyond Karen's disease. I feel that such a legend deserves a better film than a tribute to an amazing person and an awesome voice.
