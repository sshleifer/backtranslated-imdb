Carrot Topi's "Chairman of the Board" and his AT&T ads are living evidence that browned stools are available in orange. However, HABEL is not available as HBO for such garbage. Blehhh! The COTB's sustainability is that it definitely fills a suicide hotline across the country, likely to work for thousands of phone therapists who lost their discredited job in memory processing, although (unfortunately) Carrot Top is likely to help its sponsor AT&T in line with the increased phone traffic devastated HBO from viewers. I can visualize the traumatized horde of television viewers, the phone on one side and fully charged .45 cars, on the other hand, calling out the last minute despair before you leave the table to escape from the COTB orange monster. their synapse like nervousness, irreversible meningeal swelling.
