I didn't really get this movie because I'm not like you who's a lesbian stuff. <br /> <br /> A red wig girl is trying too hard to be funny (her lips are silicone!) but she's very flat and insecure. She tries to get out like a surfer-boy (better than a dress, but still weird and definitely in fashion); the film does not explain why he tries to leave himself as a man. Oh, right, to get a poor, stupid girl. I forgot. He makes all these foolish inventions that are not funny, and he is really a sad actress. Plus, that waif look is so OUT! <br /> <br /> This stupid blonde girl Melrose Place plays (surprise) stupid blonde. He thinks a girl is a man! They even make out! Ewww! I think this part was funny.
