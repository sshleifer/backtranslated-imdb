The most accurate description of how Billy Crystal's "My Giant" fairs are to say that this film is under his "Ishtar" career was Warren Beaty - it didn't destroy it, but it slowed it down ..... . Crystal should know Hollywood's three golden rules: 1) never play against a child 2) never play against the animal 3) never play with a counterpart who is almost 3 feet taller than you is as innocent as a child and "acting" like Animal. <br /> <br /> What is it? Comedy? I think, but I did not laugh, except for scenes where Crystal is independently and not loaded with his (what-on-her-roll-in-this-film) former wife or the aforementioned Giant. Did I mention that there is a child in this film? Well, forget him. The Son has brought us to know us for Christ's sake, and we do, but for the actor, not for the character. Billy Crystal is a funny man. If you don't believe me, check out his old episodes of "Soap" or "Saturday Night Live". Go to "City Slicker" or "Running Scared" or "When Harry Met Sally." <br /> <br /> The giant is more than a pay-f-fum. <br /> <br />
