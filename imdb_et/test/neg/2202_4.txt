Okay ... he's in the boat with this man, realizes he's killed him, kicks him out and finds out why he's got out of him, the chain that killed his colleague. So what does every rational person do? Maybe you have to get him out of your head again to make sure he's really out? Tie it up? Look, Sandra honey, you have a chance to escape if the man is only so long. Until you know how long you will take you to flee, make sure he can't come after you. I hate these stupid roles for the female victim. The rest of the film was just a series of revolutions that were completely complicated and too unbelievable to remain interesting.
