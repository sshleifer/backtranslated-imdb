In 1976, her mother, Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz), lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden). One night, they put their home on the door of their home, and the next morning they cut open the box to reveal the button device to be opened with the key. In the late afternoon, a terrible frightening man will come to the door and submit Norma's offer. This man is Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) and announces that if they push someone in the world to not know the family, they will die and they will get a million dollars in cash. If they don't press it, nothing happens and the offer goes to someone else. Norma and Arthur must not tell anyone, including their son, about this deal. Pressing the family incentive button raises their financial difficulties. Arthur, who is currently working for NASA, is not accepting a new job he is applying for, and teacher Norma is learning to reduce his faculty funding. <br /> <br /> One joy of this bizarre sci-fi thriller, based on Richard Matheson's short story "Button Button", determines how far they are willing to take this ridiculous assumption. Opening a film is particularly problematic when it comes to realism in the household. Richard Kelly's previous film Donnie Darko used the state of schizophrenia to justify his excursion to paranormal activities and parallel universes. Without this much higher-level dream of a movie, The Box and a highly thought-out device that can kill anyone in the world is completely unreliable. The fact that Norma would also accept someone in her house, which has almost the same scarring as the two faces of Dark-Knight, and I believe that this offer seems to be equally established. <br /> <br /> If it is unlikely so far, it's next. even more absurd, including the possibility of conspiracy, stranger life, or other divine influences between a person who was struck by conspiracy. Gates, random nose bleeds in the public libraries, and frantic drones that overshadow the Lewis family are almost absurdly comic. At some point, the film can be called intriguing to see where it goes. Kelly is sometimes smart in her ability to keep our attention through many movies. In one scene Norma teaches a class and then asks a strange boy about his leg. He complains that he is four of his toes. Later, at the dinner wedding that Norma and Arthur attend, the same student appears as a waiter and seems to be pursuing them. Nonetheless, the final justification for all these strangers is packed with a highly developed science fiction that many find it incredible and difficult to swallow. <br /> <br /> What is most disappointing about the film is that when the button is pressed surprisingly early, many of the moral consequences that were originally promised will be reduced by the length of most images. The end, which does not break here, restores these moral issues, in the hope that it will repeat the tragedy of Greece. Although similarities can be seen, there is little reason for the fact that so many films and uneven performances are unlikely. The south accent of Cameron Dias may be unnecessary, but it is surprising to Langella, who is the most disappointing in the film, with a mysteriously written role as a mysterious army man who seems to be a hidden military base that would make Dr. Evil proud. This is really just her shadow over Frost / Nixon. There are not many for many other film actors; in particular, Norma and Arthur could not be regarded as characters, but Kelly's ideas as a pastad. Lack of advanced and short conversations, such as where Norma knows Arlington over these deformations, and also when Norma and Arthur ask if they really know each other when a button kills both of them, raises it. <br /> <br /> Since 2001, Richard Kelly has been unable to make a film that would have lived up to Donnie Darko's quality and imagination. Although this film may remain intriguing for a while, it is too absurd and unlikely to be fully enjoyed and does not provide multiple views due to the rather illogical manifestations of the film. The fans of science fiction can appreciate this somewhat more and make their own conclusions, but what Kelly actually tries to say under the surface is secret. This year, the box is one film that should have been put on the shelf.
