Personally, this book was very well written, an amazing, exciting part that was not taken against the film. Looking at the movie at 12.01 in the morning to see that the larger parts of the book were left out, I was disappointed to see that it affected the "different" result of the movie. There was something to be desired about this movie, but it was just missing from the plot. <br /> <br /> Someone who has not read the book saw how this film is called and entertained by its contradictions and proportions. But for a committed reader who has read it seven times, I did not see a strong link between the two: both the film and the novel. <br /> <br /> Larger characters (such as Maximilian Kohler) and a sharp turn to the last cardinal survival of the plot preferred the plot of the film to be slightly bent, leading to a different picture at the end of the story. Hassassin was also portrayed as a normal white man, compared to the novel in which he was portrayed as a Muslim; his motives in the book are basically related to his connections with the Illuminati, but his motifs in money and seem to be a similar work as a personal relationship with the ongoing task.
