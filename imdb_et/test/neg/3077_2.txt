I usually start with comments explaining how and why I watch the movie. I can't just explain that. I had to wake up to work the next day, so the last thing I wanted to do was watch a movie I didn't know. But something kept me glued to my cozy futon when I looked at this Heather Graham vehicle. Oh, that's right. Boredom. <br /> <br /> Graham plays the bohemian nutcracker Joline, who feels obsessed with his marriage promises rather than his marriage (played by Luke Wilson). If her husband decides to leave for better things (work, women, and scripts), Joline starts a fanatic effort to find her husband and release her "spiritual wheelchair". It looks like I'm doing it, but unfortunately I'm not. In reality, it is more than a practicing exercise for Graham, because he gives training about the role of Phoebe-from-Friends. Oh and Goran "ER" Visnjic is also there for some reason. <br /> <br /> It was a comedy in TV shows, but I couldn't find any laughs. It struck me that it was a personal journey to Lisa Krueger (director and writer) in the same form as "Girl, interrupted", but even it had more laugh than it did. Graham's character is just too independent that the audience would care and I felt suffering from the chicken's imprisoned husband when he bravely fought for freedom for his clearly spiritual wife. Very little of this movie made sense, because the characters just appeared as if they were about to stand up, waiting for Graham to look like "Truman's show". In fact, the only positive comment I could make about my scribblings was "Heather Graham - nice baps". And not because I was too tired to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to think of someone to recommend this movie. Graham purists (a very small number of general movie visitors, I think you agree) must be dedicated to the harsh and potential hippie students who gather American Indian dream catchers. I was surprised that the average rating (at the time of writing) was 5.0 - that would make this movie as good as "Die Another Day" and "Gothika" in my book and it just isn't right. "Dedicated" is a film that does not entertain or enlighten, it is strange. It's complicated, pointless, and just too boring for my taste and probably for you. Don't even think about it.
