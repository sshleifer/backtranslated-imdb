I can't find the redemption value for this movie. It seems to be loosely based on the Lion King Thinking School. Dad gets killed, son can't fill his shoes and tries to escape etc etc. Etc. The only difference (except for the bunny in the jungle) is that Barnyard is trying to make music with the "things to breathe" club. They go over to the top to try to be cool. The problem is that it is not really cool. It's like "this man". Everyone knows at least one of these "men" who are older and who are still in a frightening attempt to adhere to their youth with a younger crowd. They are trying to be cool, but they really are not. That's the movie. <br /> <br /> But if you have the money to burn and you feel you are paying for a life of 90 minutes, don't let me stop you.
