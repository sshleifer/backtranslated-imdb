First of all, let me say that I wasted a Halloween movie night looking at this garbage. Secondly, let me inform you that the current DVD, available on Shriek Show, is not cut, so you have a lot of fears. Thirdly, one scene is highlighting a movie and, as it is cut, you see well where I'm going. <br /> <br /> I know that many movie fans dig this movie. It is atmospheric, with a very nice landscape, waterfall and such. But after opening, to kill a very brutal shot of men who have been trapped by the hunter's feet, it cannot be killed by a real brutality. And with the slasher movie you want it. At least I'm doing. Director and cover. Make something new in the woods with a murderer, many of which were made just in the early eighties. The only thing this has done is that you don't hate actors as much as you do in other movies. They're kind of nice. The kids are there to stay there: one of them has some hill property. But it is not clear why his family has property there. There's no cab or house, so why buy real estate in East Jesus, especially if you're not a hunter or anything? Well, I'm sure some people buy land for camping, but it just seems unusual. Anyway, there are two hanging backbone bushes starting to chase the campers and picking them out. And as I said earlier, you will not get decent deaths after the machete kills at first. At the end, there is a killing of the wall killed by Connie, but even that is not enough to make it almost equal to the totally unforgettable movie The Forest, a spiritual numb. <br /> <br /> If the Shriek Show had become a true uncut, this review would have been a bit more forgiving, but it is the day and age of the undiscovered / unrated DVDs of old covert films like me. If you lightly get us, you get an overview. Unfortunately, the presence of the great father, George Kennedy, is the only highlight of this film to distinguish it from other trash bins that were cut back during the day.
