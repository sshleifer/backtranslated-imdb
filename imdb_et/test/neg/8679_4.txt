This film with fine production values ​​contains secrets and how friends use each other. Henry May Long is a very well-functioning, dimly lit, depressing turn-of-the-century era of deadly sick people and melancholy, indebted junkie friends. Talky dances are not my dish and all crying is wearing thin. Recommended if you like independent, intellectual, slow-acting merchant ivory-like qualities. <br /> <br /> I suspected the main characters were in love, but their association was so close that it had no "Brokeback Mountain" emotional effect. It has some good writings discussing how to disappear in life, but it's a really dark and depressing film.
