What could go wrong with a movie that contains a bunch of Italians pretending to be a Flordians, and some vague-stage-octopus crustaceans like hellspawn-devil fish? <br /> <br Everything is wrong what I say to you! <br /> <br /> This is a very good MST3K episode because the ball that is right when the movie is hard to do is a piece. dirty bad and boring plot. <br /> <br /> 9/10 MSTied version. 1/10 to MST. <br /> <br />
