The art teacher comes through an antique wooden bed made of gingko trees and puts it in her apartment, but she has a terrible history and she hunts for an ancient spirit who carries her human form, pushing the hearts out of her heart. > <br /> This beautifully designed horror? Well, in fact it is more of a fantasy / romance than anything else that raises some chills and offers some stunning, but the plot was barely interesting and the script lacked any life. The problem was that I spent most of the time trying to keep my finger on the fast-forward button. This would certainly have increased the slow pace of the film, but then again I do not know too much about what is happening, which was reasonably difficult to think or keep interesting. The performances varied too melodramatically or simply from the usual, and this is probably because these characters are not convincing, stale and coma. The real background of the old bed and the spirits is incredibly boring and confused, focusing on too little romance, being ridiculous if it shouldn't be and the common one is built in a conventional way that simply lacks or the belief of wearing a movie. What compensates for the shortcomings of the story is really beautiful pictures that seemed great, but the use of some pictures was somewhat puzzled by what they really mean towards the movie. What catches your eye is a faded color scheme, but sometimes the actual screen looks smooth or snowy. However, it shows the raw intensity of the production valves, but also adds some nice polished effects that fit well with a soothing but sometimes nervous score. The camera's work was quite varied (although it didn't add too much to this feature), but during some of the better scenes, there were too many close-ups or dark lights that made it hard to see what you see. The exhibition also has some beautiful blood and gore moments, but is not obviously large or distinguishable from most other films. <br /> <br /> Letargically odd film with bright images that look out of the paint, but still not very appealing. Beware, it can put you deep into the trance!
