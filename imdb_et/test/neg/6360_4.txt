Critters 3 begins on the open roads as Clifford (John Calvin), his teenage daughter Annie (Aimee Brooks) and her young son Johnny (IMDb on the list of two actors Christian & Josephh Cousins, identical twins perhaps?) Are on vacation home. Suddenly the tire on your van-blows & they have to stop for a public recreation. Although Annie & Johnny meets a child named Josh (Leonardo DiCaprio, yes) who, in turn, runs all of Critter's last two films to Charlie McFadden (film producer Don Keith Opper). Charlie tells them the story of Critters and Grovers Bendis, but they don't believe him. At the same time, Critter returns some eggs to the bottom of the car. When Clifford has fixed the tire, the trio went home, in a city town in Los Angeles, with Critter's eggs. On arrival, the eggs will hatch and Critters will drive straight inside the rental block, quickly destroying Frank (Geoffrey Blake), the caretaker. Since there are few people left over at night, the fat woman is called Rosalie (Diana Bellamy), Marsha (Katherine Cortez), telephone guard, Bill (Zuckert), and Menges (Frances Bay), together with Clifford & her children to fight Criters. Josh also appears when his father (William Dennis Hunt) owns a building. But can the group beat Critters and stop themselves for dinner? <br /> <br /> Director Kristine Peterson I thought Critters 3 was an incredibly indistinguishable film, but at least she can say she made a movie that looks at Leonardo DiCaprio and not many people can say it! The budget of Critters 3 was probably not exactly a fortune, because all the output looks cheap, there are very few signs, very few Critters and I think only 3 will appear at the same time and lose any corner of space, so it's not expensive space ship or far away Special effects of alien planet. David J. Schow's script is strictly ancillary and highly predictable. A group of people have been isolated with Critters and they don't have the tool to get in touch with the outside world that the scheme scenario sounds very familiar? Well, it's the same as previous Critters (1986) and Critters 2: The Main Course (1988) and many other horror movies, so it should be. Critters 3 does nothing if he never tries to add anything to an old, tired and well-used fetus. Critters 3 is also very amazing for a horror movie where only two people are killed, the lack of comedy elements is serious, and the best jokes about Critters 3 can be Critter, who eats beans and then funny, very funny if your about 5 years old. Characters are mostly common clichés of horror films and quickly irritated. There is no blood or gore in Critters 3, but a few bleeding and frustrating Critters 3 seem not to show violence. Critter's special effects are OK, but they still look like static, simple hand dolls with very little movement. The action is not so good and Critters 3 happens to be the first full-length feature of Leonardo DiCaprio to be fair to the child he is right and I don't know if any other majority or team had an idea of ​​what he's going to do. Why does Charlie have to open Critter movies on Earth? To give Critters 3 some credits that are moving at a good pace and not bored, it's usually well done with good enough production prices and it's a bit harmless fun if your right mood and fortunately it only lasts about 80 minutes. General Critters 3 is a OK run, but doesn't expect anything deep or meaningful. There's nothing very wrong about it as a cheap horror movie, but I couldn't feel I saw it before. An average run that is not as good as the previous two Critter films. Critters 3 ends with "continue ..." because it was filmed back with Critters 4 (1991), which surprisingly went straight to the video, probably saving even more money. Critters 3 is a good way to waste 80 odd minutes if you can watch it in T.V, otherwise you won't care.
