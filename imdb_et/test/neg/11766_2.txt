Here are some interesting works and pleasant and pleasant Bruce Weber. Perhaps, if a professional editor had assembled this for Biography, I would have felt more satisfied. Instead, I spent $ 8 at a film festival. There is almost nothing about autobiography about Bruce Weber, except he likes to look at photos, shoot interesting people, especially beautiful teen boys and listen to jazz. "Crumb" manager would have made a much more interesting and coherent film.
