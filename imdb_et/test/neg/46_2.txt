Acolytes offers an interesting combination of original concepts when the "scream of teenage" cliché is more trillery-like. In some ways, Acolytes is a great success, but in many other ways, the movie is unlucky. <br /> <br /> In general, Acolytes avoids the usual forms of archival forms of infinite naivety and innocence of endless horror films, such as Cabin Fever, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and countless other movies where unlikely and relatively naive and innocent teenagers are having sex, running around and shouting one by one, hitting a monster. Instead, it replaces the innocence with pride, reluctance and arrogance. The characters had several ways to save the immanent death and despair, but could not do it because of their personal demons. Finally, you were left with no (and perhaps no) innocent victims. <br /> <br /> As the name implies, the film is also heavily influenced by the driver or the body. It was used in the strict sense of whether the main character would become a sequential killer and was used less directly on the entire film. Following the central figure is a recurring theme of the whole movie. Through this, the filmmakers have added a lot of clichés that I deliberately suspected and gave the film a unique blend of depth. as low as I found intriguing. This may inadvertently play characters who are very low at first glance, but when the story develops, it is obvious that they are at least two main male characters, quite complex. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film has many problems. Cinematic art, which is generally considered to be very high, I find quite sophomore and over-styled, using the approaches of formula 2/3 too rigidly. Many of the transitions I felt were too stylized. The use of insignia was not only vague, but also largely over-exploited. <br /> <br /> Plans were poorly planned and relied solely on false information to achieve a rather complicated twist that was poorly resolved and left the audience confused. The methods used to solve the peak are cheap and poorly prepared, the motivations are unclear at regular intervals and the main plot points remain unbound at the end. <br /> <br /> In general, the relative originality of the film, the themes and the dissertation are abolished by poor technical realization, overly stylized images, unclear motives, blunt and unnecessary insignia, and cheap revolutions that are only retained by incomplete or completely false information. <br /> <br /> If the film was done better, it would have been great. But Acolytes, in my opinion, gets only two stars.
