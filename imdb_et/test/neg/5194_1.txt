I can pretend about cinematography or Mr. Angelopoulos. But I know Greece and I love her. In July, I drove to my 14-year-old son and Turkey to Cappadocia, looking for some neighborhood residues where his grandfather, Iordan, lived up to the Great Exit of Anatolia Greeks in 1923. Reading the movie summary (Odessa refugees) I thought maybe I could learn more about the forced migration of modern Greeks. If I weren't home in Rhodes if I hadn't been to Greece 28 years so many years ago, I wouldn't have known dozens of islands and cities in Greece and if I had never been unsuccessful in friendship with drunken friends I could have believed that this lie had nothing to do with modern Greece.

And this is all because the different powers (the Eleni "guardian" colored uniform) did not allow the generation of "aristocrats" (Spyros) in 1919 to follow the call for peace and freedom (Nikos and his music). musicians, ie movement, reason). This dark, surrealistic review reveals the true and heroic efforts of the Greek people to maintain their lust through the tragedies of the 20th century in order to achieve more than any of their Balkan neighbors that they are both politically advanced and integrated globally.
