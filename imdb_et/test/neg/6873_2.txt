Here's another movie that has insecure controls that are completely immoral and yet, should we root for them? Not me. There was no sign of the devil in this movie. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams plays the car dealer "Joey O'Brien." A man is not a class, a loser in every moral sense, and a boy who thinks he can talk about his way. Knowing Williams' ability to speak, he was in favor of this role. The women in her life also gently guide her. Some of them are not much better than him. people, including his wife, hostage. Robbins, as normal for him, plays a disturbed and ridiculous character. I think these nut roles are readily available to these two participants. Gee, I don't know why. <br /> <br /> This movie has so much shouting and screaming that it gives you headaches. Combine these two screamer with Fran Drescher's nose voice and you really have a tedious overlay. It's like listening to chalk on the board for an hour and a half. This is comedy? No, it's flat. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams actually says there are only a dozen comments that tell you something. It's far from his best movie.
