Kubrick can be the greatest director of all time. He may have made more classic than anyone else. He may be a perfectionist. But the man was his first attempt ever bad! <br /> <br /> Kubrick had a good reason why this movie disappeared from the map: it looks like Ed Wood's film. It has a strange story, cheap pictures, bad dialogue, malicious music that resembles your 50's sci-fi / horror strike, and looks like "Reefer Madness" cast families that for some reason are not crazy. > Of course you can see the undeveloped Kubrick. It's a psychological / horror war. The characters became dehumanized and crazy. There are people who play more than one role. The faces and specific facial expressions of different people are constantly photographed. And there are some interesting shots. But really, it's a mess. <br /> <br /> Of course, I won't prevent you from watching it. If you hold on to it, you join a group of your choice and a few thousand people around the world who have access to it.
