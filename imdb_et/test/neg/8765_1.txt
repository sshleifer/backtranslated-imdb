This movie was terrible. Action was terrible. The script was terrible. Even worse was camera shots and sound. Half of the time that the voices did not match the lips of the actors, and the different corners of the camera in the same scene would be completely different tones. The worst part was to be when one of the actors was at the top of a huge cross-shaped building. The building was to be 50-storey and probably 100 feet wide. But when the actor was still falling on it, they had "built" the top of the building. The width of the building was reduced by about eight feet. How could one hundred feet tall be eight feet wide? I know the film was a low budget, but it's unforgiving. The film itself rejected the ideas of "rapture", which was actually a story or a point. This reduced the script to mere rubbish, the characters seemed to sell ideas in their ranks, not to convey emotions and move the film in the direction. It was a complete waste of time. The film gives the Christians a bad name when it is one of the best Christian films out there.
