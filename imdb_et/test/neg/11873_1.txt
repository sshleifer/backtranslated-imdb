to start with, i'm just happy. I am not in any way a real critic and a film that can be tragically discovered by authentic critics, friends, family and newspapers, and may even be nice to watch. <br /> <br /> But not that. <br /> <br /> I got this because it was the latest wesley snip in my DVD store. I like snips, but it was let-down. <br /> <br /> Bad story, bad actors, continuity errors, funny sound, frustrating spots, pseudo-snips, I really had to stop myself leaving even some tags in the frames where the car was supposed to stop. <br /> <br /> And I'm not talking about "small manufacturing / young director / low budget" bad where you can ignore some mistakes because you feel compassion. <br /> <br /> An unwanted blocking action movie that disappears for a long time like no other.
