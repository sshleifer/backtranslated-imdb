You're probably very disappointed with this sequel that is not a sequel.AWIL is classic, but this movie is about as far from the classic as you can. What a joke. A special effect that is not a very special, terrible dialogue and not a ridiculously ridiculous sub-block quickly and convincingly (not to mention a brief) about the left.did movie, I mention that this story is less than flat.se There is no chance that it would have been a serious horror movie, but it is stupid to be funny in any good way. At this point, this rating (4.8 / 10) is too generous if you ask me.
