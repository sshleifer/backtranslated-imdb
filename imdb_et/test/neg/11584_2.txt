When members hear two popular villains / characters, they scream into the theaters to see how the battle ends. There's Freddy vs Jason, where two very popular horror icons are trying to kill each other. And like that, there is Godzilla vs. (Add a name here). But the very common Komodo vs Python is just a terrible title and even worse premise. Of course, the film's D-list is an image, but at least there is a more convincing name, perhaps something that can deceive the unsuspecting viewer while watching it. With such a name you know what you are entering. <br /> <br /> The army is leaving a group of military personnel dead, including 20-year-old sexy scientists. an island where a giant Komodo dragon lives. As long as they get out of the islands and boat, they are fine, but ... no ... there is a giant python who watches the ocean and the exit. We hope that all these men will get out of the islands and that python and komodo will not save each other in some horrible special effect battle. <br /> <br /> Really, this movie is just about any way. Action is pretty bad, or maybe it is that special effects are so exciting that acting is incredible because no one believes that these people are at some risk with creatures that look like they were made in the early 90s. However, this movie is pretty funny. The creatures are so nervous, and the actors give it all their pretense as they are in danger. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that this movie is a steamy bunch of sh * squawk! ... but I can't. This PG-13-rated film pulls itself out. Every time the speaker comes out, the word is limited to parrot noise. Even the words that can be said on the network television. How to * break down to make them less expensive and less parrot. Eventually, they got the parrot noise and I couldn't smile with incompetence. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad from the foolish start to the end of a living dead ridiculous style, but it's also funny. In the case of a horror film, it is unfortunate, as a feature film, it does not succeed a little less, but still quite bad, and when comedy looks. <br /> <br /> My rating: * out ****. 95 minutes. PG-13 for Violence and Squawked Church.
