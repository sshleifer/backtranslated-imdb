This film does not have a very clear picture of what he wants or wants. There are some good bits on the Stewart screen and they give him some lines to work on. It works best at the beginning of a romantic comedy, but the story continues towards a more dramatic territory and disappears in the process. In the last fifteen minutes, the plots are just a series of dramatic clich√©s. <br /> <br /> Part of the airplane seems to be caught in some other film material. <br /> <br /> The main reason I mean this is if you want to say that you've seen all of Jimmy Stewart's movies.
