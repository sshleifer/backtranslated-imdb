Tacky, but the soft core of the early 90's, the soft core comedy includes three outdoor spaces as a teenager, Xena (Sarah Bellemo), Luna (Tamara Landry) and Sola (Nicole Posey). Xena's parents have been on vacation for a few days. After some persuasive persuasion of his friends, Xena agrees that he will take his father for a spacecraft. The end result? They will stop gas discharge in space and land on Beta 45, the land of AKA. In the meantime, Dave (Michael Todd Davis) and Jerry (Ken Steadman) have come to California to stay with Dave's Uncle Bud (Joe Estevez) who lives directly on the beach in the summer. Three of them ended up meeting their three space girls who have been away from the crash. Uncle Bud has been thrown out of his soon-to-be-found coastal paddle thanks to Sally (Linnea Quigley), who lives right on the hill and has been in a relationship with Buddha earlier. She is also a bikini country and is trying to win a bikini design competition for $ 30,000 .... exactly what Bud should improve her assets so girls decide to win her. And that's it, people. Knowing that their thin piece of paper was barely enough to keep the length of the film, the filmmakers offer us a scene after an endless beach party scene, with tons of extra girating on its half-naked bodies in the scorching sun. Oh, and don't forget the sex. There's quite a lot. Before I go on, I have to put the context in this movie. It was released in 1993, long before the emergence of soft nuclear labels such as Surrender Cinema and Seduction Cinema. Compared to these newer, more advanced, clearer films, the soft films of the 1990s seem somewhat mild. When Beach Babes From Beyond was first released in 1993 by a full-length Torchlight Entertainment, it was announced as a "mature audience" type of label. Needless to say, times have changed. This particular film genre has gone from some steaming but short sexes and short snapshots of a woman's full foreskin to extended sexual scenes that suddenly threaten to get into the hardcore. Looking back at Beach Babes after viewing it in their 93s release, it is safe to say that if the same movie is made today, hell would be much more stressed on sex scenes and less time on the chart and dialogue. In the case of gender scenes, they tend to behave warm and cold. Our three space girls don't waste time in the evening with the boys calmly. That way, every couple gets a soft core that comes with tedious slow motion camera work and too dark light. They are not really terrible and a couple of surprisingly graphic on the spot, especially between Xena and Jerry on the back of the trailer. But the scene of one sex, which really leaves a lasting impression and makes you surprised by its overall intensity, appears early in the film. Sally visits a topless photo taken from her three models featuring a pool. All the actors in this scene are beautiful, but Nikki Fritz is different from all two thanks to her great presence. Keep in mind that this point in her career has not yet reached tremendous popularity that will soon follow. She puts an unforgettable sequence of fantasy in the naked pool where she shows her soap in the bathtub and then again when she goes away from the bath. Waiting for a man almost inflated to bed, we are waiting for a full-length full naked scene with a nearly heart-shaped rear end and perfect back. It is good that Nikki's back is so muscular when it starts to do a good workout. In the next few minutes, Nikki spends a variety of things with a perfect hunky man in a scene that is filmed in a completely different way than the other three love. In the dark light or in the irritating slow motion, here is not just ... but two actors in one huge bedding and lids that seem to work hard from time to time. Nikki's ecstatic body language just proves that few other actors seem to be happy about filming sexual scenes as much as it does. It's really the only time Beach Babes From Beyond really delivers the goods. But even without this remarkable scene, I recommend this movie simply because it is quite observable and never boring due to the incredibly energetic and attractive pain, many of which remain in the rest of the direct video function up to a decade.
