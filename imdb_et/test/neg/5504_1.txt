this movie is the worst EVER !!! Sorry, but it was a good total of hours. kvas psychology and b-actors make a baaada horror movie. You can say that when you are in for bad movies, you adore it. and the "hot chick" wasn't all that hot. there is no top for the film and the worst part is the final song. some homemade stuff with these words "it's a terrible condition in the world of confusion. When bodies and girls fall unlocated. They are helpless cops, eaters eat their car." Jesus! Sorry, boys, but the milk went badly against it.
