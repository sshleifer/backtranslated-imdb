I really wanted to like this movie because it differs refreshingly from the hordes of daily horror movies, and I appreciate that filmmakers are trying something original. Unfortunately, the plot just got together and no character was pleasant enough to really take care of them or their destiny. <br /> <br /> Toybox was visually interesting. The director took a lot of risky moves, such as adding small parts of the (flash-looking) animations in parts and really special effects (such as a certain amulet light). Sometimes it has worked and sometimes it was not, but it deserves praise for testing, and cinematography was generally of high quality. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, with the same approach to selling a lot of things on the wall, see what sticks have been applied to the plot, the results were not very good. The film does not really find any of the shades it likes, moving the schizophrenic black comedy from the family soap opera to the 80s witch sliding into childhood nostalgia to worship the family. Each of these elements is self-made, but they work quite well, but nothing is a satisfactory whole. In addition, larger bits of plot are never explained. I am not the one who loves me with a spoon, and I like movies that leave things to the audience, but those parts that stay out of Toybox seem just like they did before they could make money, or they didn't really think about the beginning of things . <br /> <br /> I look forward to the director's next project because I think there are a lot of talents here, but I can't really recommend The Toybox's own.
