We arrived at the theater too late to see Rendition, which was our intention, and "The Comebacks" was the only movie that hadn't started yet. I had a look at how bad the film was on the ticket counter after reading a short stroke. The theater was empty when we arrived, and only two people entered before the movie started. . Think of all the football films made and millions of dollars in schools and fans spend football every year and realize how mature it is to show or redeem. When you add Texas to the mix, you should offer a "Little Miss Sunshine" sports version, not a big awakening. <br /> <br /> The first movie to remember when we left the theater. "You can't stop music" For comparison, "can't stop music" without Bruce Jenner, Valerie Perrine, or villagers. <br /> <br /> When the film had one sign of mercy, it saw Matthew Lawrence grow up.
