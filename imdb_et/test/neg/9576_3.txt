A deformed, aged female scientist kills other scientists to steal cells for rejuvenation and to reverse the aging process. He takes it and becomes a beautiful, evil Satanic (Magda Konopka) who goes around, seduces and murders wealthy businessmen. <br /> <br /> She sticks and manipulates the mods of the late 60's very stylishly, looking at DIABOLIK's film late with Marisa Mell. Coincidence ... <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is amateurish and sloppy without the James Bond pop-art gadget that DIABOLIK had had. Even the shooting places of the Madrid and Lake Geneva do not fix it. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is made by Manuel Parada and Roberto Pregadio and is not at all bad, consisting of lush orchestration with a small fuzz. guitar for guitar. Ideal for one of these Loungecore CDs that appeared in the 90s. <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVDs also use poor-quality color printing, which is in bad shape and at the beginning is explained by the age of the film. Bull! They didn't bother to look for a better source or they didn't find any. There are only a few photos of Magdas and that is the case. <br /> <br /> Sloppy and poor collection, it comes from 3 out of 10.
