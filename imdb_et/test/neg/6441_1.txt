Eastenders has been in full motion since 1985 until it has completely disappeared. It is such a bad reflection of nationality that this mess is at the top of the ratings. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​plots may consist of nothing more trivial than ever the characterization of a character's hat. The first two (regardless of their gender) are sleeping with each other, 3rd and 4th fight out in Vic, five of them being arrested, 6. developing addiction, 7. getting pregnant, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Producers are smart. The 30-minute show consists of only three rows. <br /> <br /> 1) Someone goes to Vic and says, "What's going on?" 2) Someone else will say, "leave this hole" (out) 3) Then the woman says, "Doan choo come bright" n "insult mah fam'ly" <br /> <br /> That's it. It's every show. In addition to random "Get it sort-id / Is this sort-id?" <br /> <br /> The exhibition was once a realistic picture of the East End people and their way of life. The buffers came out when 1) they extended it for two nights from a week and 2) the Slater family got up. How they attract viewers is over me. Kat characters symbolize everything that has gone wrong in society, treating someone else like something he pulled out of the bottom of his shoe. <br /> <br /> The people who vote best will have to be the same in these polls as those who vote for Jamie Redknapp 'Best Sportsman, despite not playing for 3 years. <br /> <br /> What I never understand is when the show is on British television, why are all the biggest names leaving? The list of Ross Kemp, Martin Kemp, is endless. <br /> <br /> How long have you been married to the longest couple, are they faithful to each other? Yes, people leave, but until the script writers realize that the characters can be interesting and pleasant without sleeping, the exhibition continues to worsen. Last week the episode had 3 separate plots exactly. And Zoe & doctor top Lofty & "Shell" as "Most convincing couple ever appear on TV." <br /> <br /> Yes, Eastenders is the most traceable show that is indisputable. But many external factors contribute to this. 19.30 / 20.00 is the perfect time to get the most public figures, it has an omnibus edition of 2 hours and more than a million viewers watch it, not just the habit, but when they were completely honest, they admit that (in 2002 more than ever it may be completely pathetic.
