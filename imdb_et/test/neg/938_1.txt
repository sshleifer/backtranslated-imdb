You saw it as part of the DC Reel Affirmations film festival. I hope they got better movies because this film did not give any hope that the audience could have felt since fantasy to see James Franco without his shirt, more simple wishes, such as decent action, cohesive directions, character development or actual product values . With the influence of film students, such as freezing frames to show moments of emotional stress, and the obvious effect that stretches from my own private East to Terminator 2, this film was not able to engage the audience at almost every level. After the first twenty minutes of trying this seriously, the audience tried to throw their hands and just started enjoying the natural embarrassment of the movie. I could be disturbed that I paid nine bucks for it, and that was two hours, I never get back, but on the other hand, it was fun for two hours, which I never get back. It would have been a classic Mystery Science 3000 episode.
