Glove boring, firm brand, confident confusion, it was not terrible, but not too good. When the shape lives, it is a good scary little. Not much will happen, and the movie will just feel a sort of scummy. I was happy when it ended, and I don't think anything about it being a real story .... very surprised it is an average of about 6.
