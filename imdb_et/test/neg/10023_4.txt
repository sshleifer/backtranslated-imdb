Everything that everyone has already said is true when it comes to 'Prey'. Endless natural video footage, poor performance - in addition to these elements, it is a traceable film for film fans, which in some cases is considered a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Jackson Bostwick and Jackie Coogan are pretty good at each other. There's also a three-minute banjo solo that shows Bostwick's skills behind the instrument. Not too bad when I say it myself. <br /> <br /> The last ten minutes of the movie are the grace of saving it. The end still haunts me so far. It can also do sport with a short lifetime, so early John Carl Bucheler makes special effects. Some may know him from movies like "Troll" and "Friday 13th part 7 - He directed both movies." All in all, this is not a movie that everyone finds something to redeem. In fact, it is at Hollywood level. The fans of this handful (but very loyal) of the film in the world can even forgive bad and terrifying nature shots.
