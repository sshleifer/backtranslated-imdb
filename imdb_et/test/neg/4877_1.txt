Where do I start. Allows you to list the good things about this movie first. <br /> <br /> 1. Michael Persbrandt is great as a gangster Thomas. This is the only sign you really care about, and he's a bad guy! (Allthogh never does anything bad and is generally a nice guy) 2. Kjell Bergkvist is always great. She's a little toned here, but she's still funny. 3. The film was well known by Swedish standards, good depth of field and good use of lights. <br /> <br /> It's bad now. This is by far the worst script that will ever make it a big screen. The action of all others was rather bad and up. The direction was terrible. Fully meaningless story, totally unrealistic characters and events, and 1.5 hours long. During the emotional scenes, everyone in the theater laughed. People started walking through screening. <br /> <br /> There is no way a story can be put together in a single, so I even try. Any ever created clich√© is there and in every wrong place. I'm sorry to say it's one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Watch it laugh, but try not to pay it;) <br /> <br /> .R
