Obviously, in the eyes of some people these days, there are not enough fear films where young people travel in the desert through a mysterious, bloodthirsty crazy man in a truck. I mean, all we have to date is Joy Ride, Wolf Creek, Jeepers Creepers, Monster Man. REST STOP may be the worst. It is a girl and her boyfriend who will leave their lives to start in California. On the way, they stop at the grimy toilet, so the young lady can release her, but when she returns, she finds her boyfriend and his car missing. From there, he learns that the culprit is the boy who drives a yellow pickup, who continues to stalk and terrorizes him when he hides in the toilets. This movie is so unique that it is boring. Action is annoying, gore is easy and the killer whose identity is not shown throughout the film is nothing but memorable. Terrible - terrible movie ...
