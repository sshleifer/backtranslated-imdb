I've been waiting for a long time to watch this movie. Finally, IFC ran one night. I thought it was Barbet Schroeder "Barfly". Wrong. This film does not produce the bottom of the bar of butterflies, dirty, filled, filled with characters you associate with your stories. Nor does Bukowski remember what Mickey Rourke did so well in the above-mentioned film. This natural smart ass attitude. Fans of Charles Bukowski enjoy seeing their scenes on the screen, but people who are familiar with his books have the wrong impression of their works. This movie looks like another "movie of the week" in drunk and his relationship.If you want to get a better view of Charles Bukowski's "Barfly" view.
