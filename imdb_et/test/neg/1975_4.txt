This exhibition lasted most of the 1980s and was at its moments, but the plots were usually thin and often painfully spent. <br /> <br /> Terry Scott and June Whitfield were wasted in this sitcom, both deserve better, but it gives some pleasant memories and I've found myself smiling with some repetitive scenes. June's Whitfield talent for comedy allows you to get repeatedly (if he's not Terry's foil) and he's really smart. <br /> <br /> The 1980s is the last decade where you will find such a middle class, medieval comedy, and many people will remember it pleasantly, but I prefer to remember the decade of an alternative comedy and Spitting Image's biting satire.
