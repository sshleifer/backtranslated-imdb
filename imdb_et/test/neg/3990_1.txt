Once again the posters lied to me. <br /> <br /> The marketing of this flick was deeply contrary to the content; "explosive"? When I read the summary of this movie, I was expecting to see delicious grotesque, bleeding from everyone and swelling with alcohol, peppered with heroin needles and bent into double chronic masturbation; on the contrary, the pure shaved hero, the bright Gabriel come. Instead, the film was completely the opposite of what I had been waiting for. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes of the movie showed us that Middletown is a simple little place with poor people who do the best they can. either a little to agree, drinking to forget the pain or watching the fighting (chickens, not penis) to prevent boredom. In other words, the townspeople were desperately plain. <br /> <br /> The only (deliberate) grotesque in this piece was Gabriel, a temporarily washed Presbyterian preacher played by Macfadyen, whose face was designed to suggest constant air confusion. If I were kind, I would recommend that the preacher Paisleyite's rantings be a funny comment aimed at disproving Gabriel and his faith. Unfortunately, Brian Kirk is a filmmaker who has not done so, so you despise everyone in the movie quickly, leaving the audience astonished by his eighty-minute blind, hackneyed thedium. My only breath of such celluloid waste was the game "I think the pressure" broke down with the "spot of the spot" rounds. Are we surprised that Gaybo can steal his brother's child and stifle his father? Of course not; he is a biblical preacher and therefore psychotic. All the townspeople are shocked at the end of the film, but I suspect that they have just realized what turkey has put their names on. <br /> <br /> The Northern Ireland Film and Television Commission is spending the budget, but there are better projects than this weak company. The only thing I can say about this movie is that he has been able to replace Superman Returns as the worst film in 2006; one of the achievements of hell. <br /> <br /> v1: 20061114 v2: 20080107
