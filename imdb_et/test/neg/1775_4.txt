My tolerance towards the shlocky direction was astonished by some of the choices that were in this really good time. <br /> <br /> When "romantic" intervals gave me a story and "How-and-did-do-movie-do-do- /?" in mode, you have to realize that there is something missing; Brian Brown is a capable, empathetic actor - usually. I think he didn't like the project or the people and it shows. I don't remember anything the other man did. Can't even imagine your face. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it doesn't have to be good entertainment; some vignettes and twists are fun and even brilliant. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie (buying $ 2.00 from a rental site) with scriptwriter tips; I understand that he was tempted to remove his name from the credits. The question of pride, I bet.
