The capture of "The Bigfoot" by Bill Rebane is one of the most terrifying films ever made. Greedy sawmill owner Harvey Olsen (Richard Kennedy) decides he wants to keep Bigfoot at all costs. But local gamer Dave Garrett (Stafford Morgan) learns that the bigfoot lived in peace that was disturbed by a geological expedition, trying to protect the creature. There's nothing interesting about this crap. The film is extremely boring and full of terrible songs and cheap special effects. gore, not any tense-just giant boredom. Avoid this terrible junk like plague.
