After reading mostly glowing reviews of this movie I decided to rent it despite some doubts about TV movies. I should have followed my instincts. <br /> <br /> I tried so much to warm up the movie and find that value, but I just couldn't. The story does not pull you or the ring is true, and the actor is in the best and worst case, ridiculous. Everything in this production is amateurish. <br /> <br /> It is always a pleasure to see Mary McDonnell as the only speaker to escape this disaster without compromising her career or reputation. I don't even bother checking the name of a leading person - hopefully he'll do it in advertising. <br /> <br /> Even the poor Vanessa Redgrave, whom I adore and respect, seemed to direct Katherine Hepburn all the time. if he were home at home. Maybe he needed money. <br /> <br /> If I lose one person from this 100 minute, I will feel right.
