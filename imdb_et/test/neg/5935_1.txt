I read just a few months ago in the series on the left and made a mental note to check it out because I have an interest in how religion is used to drive people into our increasingly hated full world, so imagine my surprise and joy when I found in my local library a copy from the left: a world in war, where I got innocently between big budget movies. <br /> <br /> Now that it's poor at the movie. Action is direct from primary school production and "special effects" would have been seen in the early 1990s. For the third part of the series, this story is incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen or read the other left-wing films, and even with my previous knowledge, it was still ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Religious, I do not think anyone who has not been filled with the Lord's spirit will find anything in the movie to persuade them to change their way. How should you be afraid of the Antichrist if he has a comedy Russian accent, and the worst of his powers are some pathetic CGI? <br /> <br /> But my main problem with this film is a blatant attempt to try and think people believe it is a big budget campaign. After picking up the box and reading the spiel, I noticed immediately that something strange ... the packaging did not mention the true nature of the film. Someone who does not know it will appear for all intentions and will be left to the Left: The World War did not differ from the last Tom Clance. Nor did he say that, in the copy I rented, he didn't say it was the third in the series. <br /> <br /> Considering the series's premise that the Antichrist has been deceiving the whole world, I find it very hypocritical that filmmakers tried to mislead me two before I even received! If you are so confident in your beliefs, why not be honest about it? <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that it would not have been a "Christian" movie with a fan base built with it, I doubt it would ever have been seen in daylight. When the Cloud Ten is hoping that I can see my road error and give myself to God, I'm afraid to say I would have died of boredom and / or laughed at death before I ever had the chance.
