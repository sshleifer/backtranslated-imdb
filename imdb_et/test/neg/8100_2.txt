Bela Lugosi is a real mystery. In the early 1930s, after Dracula appeared, he was at the top of the world. Yet he made the wrong decisions over his career again and again. Maybe he was a bad agent, maybe his drinking and drug use was or maybe he was just crazy. Regardless of the fact that he destroyed his reputation, he appeared in many films ranging from great horror films (such as THE RAVEN) to large budget clips (such as NINOTCHKA) to make Z-class flickers the cheapest and shoddiest studios. Interestingly, although he agreed to make this terrible movie, he actually turned back the role that later Boris Karloff in FRANKEN! As for this movie, it is a very foolishly produced World War II propaganda film with a stupid plot and wretched editing. Lugosi spends a great deal on the murder of the movie saboteure - not bad. Finally, we learn that he is a Nazi surgeon himself, and all the American-looking men he killed were actually Japanese !!!! Its more fun part is in rebound time. You see that Lugosi talks to a group of Japanese men before he changes them to American-like men. When the camera scans them, the men are clearly Asian. But in all other close-ups, they're all very close to the West - many are bald-headed !! They saw absolutely nothing like the Japanese men. I suspect that the plot has to be rewritten and this can lead to a manifest error. Or it can just be a dirty production value and editing. In fact, at the beginning of the movie they show the street scene of the city, and all the cars (about 1942) are old T-models - probably from the film material !!! The bottom line is that the film is bad but also very dull. Unlike PLAN 9, OUTER SPACE makes it hard to laugh for this intuition - just sleep.
