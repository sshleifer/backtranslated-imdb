The words hardly describe this movie. Loaded with ridiculous stereotypes, stupid plot and poor music, this movie is missing in almost every category. <br /> <br /> Don't deceive IMDB credits. It's not Michael Dorn's movie. He is a secondary figure in another scheme. <br /> <br /> "Prince" is on the credit list - it makes me wonder if this is the same artist we know before .... Then again, I'm not sure it's worth watching this movie . <br /> <br /> Great summary ... of teams ... one is kidney ... one is $ 35,000 .... one is "illegal Substance" .... and one is $ 350,000. Add some confusion and confusion about who has to respond to who, take revenge and such, and eventually you get the clutter of this movie. <br /> <br /> When making a choice I'd give it to Film.
