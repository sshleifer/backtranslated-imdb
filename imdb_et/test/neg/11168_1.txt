Keep this movie FAR AWAY. The fact that you read the comments tells me that you may have been terribly appalled. It's really a horrible movie ... so let's go down to the problems. Writing and Direction: It wouldn't be surprising to me if they were handled by some over-active classmates looking at "shouting" and "I know what you did last summer". Holes in the GIANT GAPING plot are plentiful; Although I can't congratulate them on this movie, it's nice to know they're finally educated. Actors (or their absence): only the best of this movie ... the best of the screen, now starring their talking role in their debut! As a warning I have to note that I am able to see and enjoy almost anything. I feel a good movie when I see it, but I can still fuck and smile at Bubble Boy (yes people, its true); so when I say to avoid something, you know I'm not kidding.
