To be honest, the movie was SO HORRIBLE that I loved it. I've never seen such a sharp film in my life. Ma was a dance. I don't even know what to say. <br /> <br /> The characters could not even keep their weapons, one minute the boy was with M16 and his friend's MP5, then the next scene they exchanged weapons. (Don't ask, trust me, I know your weapons) And I never understand how they got from the place that looked like Vietnam, from the Arizona highway, from my backyard, and then from the chemical industry in California. I took it out. <br /> <br /> Why are you afraid that a boy in a Halloween mask, wearing a trash bag for a bag, and shooting you with plastic arrows? How is it scary? I wanted to swallow the arsenic film halfway. I love how the "skeleton man" decided to kill a smile that day. But hey, whoever made this movie, should be kneeling down and eating on the mound of fire. <br /> <br /> Good day.
