Eddie Fischer was just bad. Perhaps the worst scene came in at the beginning of the film when she penetrated into a spontaneous song and dance issue that focused on piano and some comfortably placed employees. The song was totally foolish ... I think I could give you some lines on a piece of paper that would probably surpass Grammy. Then, as the writers came out with a better way to escape the ridiculousness of the scene, Fischer says, "Don't say (enter the name of the man). He doesn't like the music" and smiles. I can't describe how bad it is, I felt a little embarrassed. And this man, Debbie Reynolds, works and who always strikes him is so annoying. I can't even imagine someone wasting a fraction of her time with her. The jokes were delivered without any chemistry between the characters that made the film crawl. At least the baby had lovely hair. The two stars are for Reynolds, who was like swans with odd shavers. <br /> <br /> See Bachelor Mother.
