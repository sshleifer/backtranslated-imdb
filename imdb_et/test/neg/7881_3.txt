How to make the film as provocative as possible? This sketchy straight-out shocker is trying to get two low-life Paris women (one prostitute, one recently raped ex-porn actor, no less) who go primarily through male sex and murder. <br /> <br /> A very short driving time will give you a hint of the experimental nature of this violent hardcore "Thelma & Louise" - but it's done without irony or contemplation of a possible feminist message ... And since we're not close to the main characters, Violence actually seems to be silenced and anxious - and maybe it's good. <br /> <br /> As a liberal advocate of freedom of expression, I am always welcome if the "serious" film industry dares to include full sexual scenes. But the question is: does it work for the film as a whole? Is that good? Here, not very much, although we are given a new meaning to the phrase "shooting the ass"! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 Ozjeppe
