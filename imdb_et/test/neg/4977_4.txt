And now to another point of view: I didn't like it. I didn't really finish it. I know some "Unforgiven" is one of the biggest Westerners who has ever done it. I know it marks and was led by Clint Eastwood, one of the American cinema icons. I know it won Oscare. However, I did not like me. I don't like Westerners, and that is obviously a matter of taste, but I don't suck Eastwood. He is not and has never been a leading man. He's not Burt Lancaster, not Paul Newman, John Wayne. In this film alone, he is dwarf Richard Harris and Gene Hackman; they are both participants. No, Eastwood is a tall guy with a reedy voice who usually plays tough guys. Here he plays a tough guy with a pensioner. When I see her on the screen, I see that the man is acting on her. Then there is the western western plot. Too obviously it is meant to inject modern values ​​- respect for the role of women, black, Americans and single parents; respect for violence and drinking; the health associated with marriage, including racial marriage, and the small divine children, a century when these values ​​were not necessarily accepted in this way. When promoting these values, the film appears as if it were not preaching. Then there are the stereotypes of the movie - with the golden heart of the prostitutes, the boy who is unable to hit the line straight, the city slips into the wild west, the suntan shine in the summer afternoon with a musical accompaniment in larger chords. Finally, Eastwood's direction is changing. I gave up after an hour. Eastwood still drove to the bottom, Morgan talked to Freeman and a child who couldn't shoot directly, sixty minutes after the plot run by a prostitute burst. It was too slow. Someone had to find these elements. I'm afraid it was me.
