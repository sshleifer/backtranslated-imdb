I think "Rosemary Baby" is the most overrated horror movie out there. Not scary, interesting or anything else. It's pretty well targeted and Ruth Gordon was wonderful, but that's it. But this sequel makes it "Gone With the Wind"! <br /> <br /> I caught it back on TV when I was 14. Unfortunately, I still remember it. From what I remember, Rosemary's baby Andrew has grown up now and the leader wants her to take over (this world). But there are forces that try to stop it ... and Andrew has doubts about himself ... <br /> <br /> I give it 2 for some reason: Gordon is in it (and still very good); Stephen McHattie was actually pretty good as Andrew, and at the beginning there is a horrible moment when Rosemary (Patty Duke) is "robbed" by bus ... without a driver. <br /> <br /> Apart from being boring, stupid and unnecessary. The original did not require a sequel! The follow-up of Ira Levin's book in 1999 was not much better. <br /> <br /> Vote early for the Duke ... then tune. Not worth the effort.
