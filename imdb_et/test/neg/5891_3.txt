I look forward to more of this movie. This may be a problem. The camera was not once more. In close-ups, the camera shakes, objects move and get a headache. The cuts are so frequent and so fast that the viewer often finds what has just happened. (SEE, SPOILER ALERT) And at the end of the movie, if you hope you have a happy ending after putting out so much pointless thought to understand what's happening, they lose. For me, this was basically a terrible film that was broken by a cameraman with ADHD and a lack of a meaningful plot.
