I have been waiting for Wirey Spindell to watch because it has happened over Schaffer's "Fall". Unfortunately, I found that WS is a misleading, ungaging, dull bunch of blows that are, together, apparently a Schaeffer's signature, story, narration, and poetry. The film describes Manhattan's sexual and other experience, married to independent setbacks. Like beads on a string, Schaffer probably has put together every little life experience, ignoring the beauty of the necklace. The result is a splitting story that tells the boy to grow up, which does not create empathy and leaves the viewer open, unsatisfied and with a bad taste that prevents mechanical sensitivity. A mediocre indie and a step towards Schaeffer.
