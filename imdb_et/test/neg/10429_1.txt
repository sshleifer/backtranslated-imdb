Every film school student could shoot 1000 times better than garbage. As someone who had read the book, I was expecting that even another talk of the book would make it a fair film. It was possible that a talented director could go beyond the Woodward narrative and make an excellent film. Well, the director went beyond the Woodward narrative. He added a hip-spanish angel called Velasquez, which was not in the book. He had an interview with Bob Woodward for the dead Belush in a grumpy shift. The film had an overview of PCP with stones that looked at his navel. <br /> <br /> If this is a spoiler for you, thank you for it, because it is absolutely the worst movie.
