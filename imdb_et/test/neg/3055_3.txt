When I first saw it, I thought its bits were pretty scary. But horror has been somewhat undermined by the fact that dull teenagers are so irritating that you really don't care what happens to them. There are some really good moments, such as Angela's speech about demons, and a briefly visible demon is effective. However, it really does not last for repeated viewing or accurate analysis. It's all pretty sticky and inexpensive in appearance and often quite silly, pornography and awkward wisecracks too often replacing horror. However, the music is great, and the epilogue is definitely fun, but this movie doesn't have much to suggest, just over the other Jason-type stalks and slashes.
