Oh dear oh dear. It goes to my nerves when a low budget, meaningless fear, tries to look at the credit when casting a good number of good names to involve everyone in the smallest, most meaningless possible roles. In this film, we have Richard Lynch in one scene, Martin Kove, for a moment, a short spot for Vernon Welles, a little more time on John Philip Law and some time for Karen Black. This amount of random cameos really does not rise, although Richard Lynch and Karen Black raise some of the few smiles in this movie with their incidence and quite painful, because no major box is good at all. I could hardly think that if more movies were filmed with a b-movie veteran, the film would be much better, but because there are only a few tantalizing glances about good entertainment without the film ever having really achieved much entertainment value. The main casts, in my opinion, were just charismatic or pleasing performances by Steve Wastell, like Axel and his girlfriend, whom I believe Elina Madison played (never heard her before, but she has some screen presence and good figure). In this drawing is a simple, evil undead miner going after those who want to steal his gold, and it should make a good fun fun, especially considering that it is led by John Carl Buechler, who has made many special effects for them. sort of movies, including all three major franchises (Halloween, Elm Street and Friday 13th) and small gems like mausoleum. Unfortunately, the film lacks a tight, pleasant and satisfying gore. There are one or two mildly pleasant moments, but nothing is worth watching the movie, I wouldn't say. In fact, except for the aforementioned cameos, this whole movie is really quite hidden and the markets with the characters that couldn't get off fast enough for my taste and unfortunate lack of real interest. I didn't even find it in the sense of a ridiculous bad movie that is rare to me because I love a lot of pretty tough movies. I would say, avoid.
