"My blue sky" is boring. The plot is inaccurate; characterization and dialogue; Musical numbers, though sometimes staged in interesting ways, are not only too often absurd, but also lyrically tricky, painfully white and emotionally hollow on the core. Betty Grable and Dan Dailey are attractive professionals; despite their comprehensive efforts to lift harsh and unreasonable materials, they fail. David Wayne and Jane Wyatt, of all other projects on talent, are more or less cyphers. <br /> <br /> There is only one reason to watch "My Blue Heaven". One reason ... one letter: Mitzi Gaynor, on his film. His entire screen time is probably less than ten minutes, but what then? His intelligent and promising personality on the screen, the beauty of his cats and his extraordinary charisma gleamed brilliantly, making these minutes the most traceable, memorable and exciting moment of the film. If you would appreciate the possibility of seeing a huge young talent on the rise, look at Miss Mitzi Gaynor's "My Blue Sky." By the way, I despise (and invite you to avoid) the Drew Casper mania, obsessive compulsive DVD commentary on this movie. Wordy, dwindling, overly demanding, often poorly timed with what plays on the screen, and galoping with all the nervous energy, his comments are absolutely digestible.
