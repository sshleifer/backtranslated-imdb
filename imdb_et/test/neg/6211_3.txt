First tell the story. This is a copy of "Hitch", accompanied by Indian flavor. A man who is a guru of love, and another man who is seemingly strange when it comes to ladies, and how this seemingly mammal becomes charming with the guru of love, forms the story. Salman Khan is a guru of love and Govinda is a flat boy. <br /> <br /> Now that artists have been performing, Salman Khan crosses the entire movie, trying to be funny but unable to spend much time. You see Salman screaming over the whole movie, not seeing any real action in his performance. Govinda couples replied to Katrina Kaif (Oh, my God, she's one girl.) True beauty) is a real 50-year-old guy and Katrina is a girl in her twenties. In the film, Govinda looks out for Katrina Kaifi's grandfather. What a pity! Filling the movie. This film looks like a B-film and a bad imitation of Hitch. When Hitch looks like a movie with the purpose and depth of the film, this film is low and goal-oriented, with no justification or clarity anywhere. <br /> <br /> Just forget about this movie because it's nothing but boring, typical Bollywood price. In fact I give 3/10 because it's the lowest I go.
