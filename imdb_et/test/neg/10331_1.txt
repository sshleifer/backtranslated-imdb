Noteworthy is the good debut of the great Hollywood stars of the future, Sandra Bullock, the ridiculous activity that is so many holes that it is easy to suspect the spread of termites. The story is incomprehensible and very poorly thought out. Production values ​​smell cheese. In fact, the whole value of the output LACK would have been better ... at least the film could have looked like a grittier in this way. The ADR is ridiculously bad and omni in the film. It is debatable whether any dialogue stories were used from the actual fire. <br /> <br /> Performances are usually terrible, although there are some exceptions. However, in these exceptions, the performances are undermined by the fact that the director obviously gave the participants a bad direction and sometimes changed them completely out of character. (ie, characters that go from passive to panic in blinking eyes. Bad direction.) Also, constant "sound effects of weapons" (downloadable magazines, slides threw, etc.) are completely overrated and more often than not, are completely in sync with what is shown on screen. Add this cheesy "Bad Guy" to the vocal distortion leading to the conduit (mainly because you know it's misunderstood by the offender's films) and you have a recipe for disaster. <br /> <br /> The situation in the film goes beyond the usual "stopping the unbelief" and becomes ridiculous. One leading figure spends a good part of the film on the board before he decides to use a butterfly folded in his sock to get rid of it. So, my questions are ... why he didn't do it before and why he even has a butterfly. He didn't look? BETTER. This is one hundred examples of totally ridiculous situations that have been put together in a 90-minute package. <br /> <br /> "Hangmen" play as an unbearably bad R-rated TV movie in the 80s. If not for Sandra Bullock's future success, it would never have come to DVD. But this is so my only advice is to steer clear. Watching this movie can actually damage your IQ.
