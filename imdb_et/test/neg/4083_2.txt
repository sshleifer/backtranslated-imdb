Oh Mr. Carell! How far have you fallen! After a glowing moment in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, Steve Carelli's film selection is sharply opposed to what has come since then. Although 40-year-old VIRGIN was entertaining, it fell under the "sunshine" character. Hoping to find something that would get me into my nose, I decided to rent EVAN ALMIGHTY and see what possible guffaws I could expect here. Not much ... <br /> <br /> Given the tricked and cliché script, the whole movie felt forced and meaningless. Evan Almighty tries to try to bring a deeply biblical moment to humorous conditions, but he is unhappy, when trying to mark the family values ​​and the environmental impact of the current US administration. <br /> <br /> Almost every person on earth knows the story of Noah and Ark. God's wrath went under 30 days and at night the rain that flooded the whole planet when Noah, his family, and two of the Earth's creatures traveled through the wet through relative comfort. wooden ark. It was a huge moment in the history of mankind (if you believe in biblical text). Why should God appear to one person and ask him to build a ship that would transport the animals of the world only a few minutes after the dam was cut off? The simple answer is that He will never. Too much emphasis was put on US government policies and not enough on world events, making Evan Almighty a terribly myopic and Amer-centric film. Although it is meant for comedy, it never laughs closer to the stomach. Maybe a few grunts and smiles, but little else. <br /> <br /> John Goodman (CARS) is pulling another compulsion because despicable congressman Chuck Long, who is the only goal, is to create development opportunities on protected national lands. Even the strong presence of Morgan Freeman (10 MINIMUM), like God, cannot help such a wet catastrophe. <br /> <br /> The only funny moments between Carelli and the animals. , especially when Evan learns what animal magnetism really likes. Birds literally tolerate. Sheep flock around her. Lions are proud of his closeness (please forgive the plugs). <br /> <br /> Special effects were fun to watch but were short (for good reasons). "Flood" was interesting because Ark was obviously led by him and pushed in the right direction. <br /> <br /> But besides being little more than an insult to common sense and intellect.
