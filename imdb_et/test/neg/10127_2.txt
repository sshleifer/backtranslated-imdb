It may be thought interesting to show regular teenagers in big countries, but that is far from it. Take, for example, the concept: the main branch (s) have a big secret that they reflect on their peers. It's like Hannah Montana and that's Raven. Next, it's just average. Selena Gomez seems to have half slept through many scenes. Finally, jokes are clich√©s or boring. If they do not use it, they are colorful, but a strange dialogue that makes us "laugh", they throw various props around the room. I really want this exhibition to use more original and entertaining material. All in all, Wisard of Waverly Place is disappointing.
