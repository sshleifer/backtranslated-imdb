Whatever other people have said, you can't look at this movie without comparing the original, if it were from your own, it would be from 2-3 movies, but it's 4-5 of the 5 new movies and so is there standards to live and we need to see if it achieves these standards. If the film was reusable or as on the Apeside planet, the original transformation could be seen in the film's own right, referring only to the original. Imagine it when someone took the model "Mona Lisa", put her in a different way and painted her so that you could only compare the framing, the concept, etc. to the original, but if someone painted her again on the original, you should compare it completely. <br /> <br /> It said that this movie may not be as good as the original, it does not impress, as it was or not, that the original was one of the best films ever made, the shower scene is never forgotten; be a celebration of Hitchcock, but ended up with a downgrading of her and her craftsmanship. <br /> <br /> The humiliating aspects of this image were Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. There's nothing to do with whether they acted better or not, that Norman's and Marion's relationships in the original were really innocent, Norman didn't understand the gender, he was almost no contact with the outside environment, and when he meets with a beautiful Marion and looks at his change, you feel that he does it partly from the snow because he does not understand sex and his attractiveness to him, it makes Norman a compassionate and almost anti-hero, you are on his side because he does not fully understand the world and is constantly fighting for himself and his mother. When all the dynamics are gone, I have to admit that Janet Leigh is not my type, but she is very attractive and that you see that Anne Heche is really unpleasant and that finding an attractive Norman's "Marion" is incredible when you add that Vince Vaughni Norman, who masturbates when he looks at him, and you get Norman, who is just waiting for a chance to defeat his neighbors, no matter what he sees, whom you feel sympathy, they destroy even further Norman's innocent nature by putting his sleep in his room. It destroys the character we have liked and we regret it is like "it's a great life" and the main character is pimp, totally humiliating. <br /> <br /> The only other sign I had with Rita Wilson like Caroline, Marion's co-worker. In the original, when Pat Hitchcock says the line "he must have noticed my wedding ring", it makes a laugh when he's totally funny when Rita says it just seems plausible because there's no other reason for her to flirt over Anne Heche over. <br /> <br /> I admit that I am very biased, the original "Psycho" is my favorite movie all the time, if the film had been redesigned and a different angle, you could have turned those characters into your head and it would have been completely acceptable. <br /> <br /> Hitch was famous for being too colorful and black and white. It made the film more atmospheric and scary in its own way, and gave it the beauty that could never be captured, and it is a sad statement of how the film does not know the public, that people have said how the shower is more scary. (nb, before people think he can't write, I remember I'm from England and we're writing this color) <br /> <br /> Transformation should be just what's done, it's a fake, full copy and very bad. I could compare, but it makes no sense, almost everything is better in the original. The only thing that is better is the production by Viggo Mortensen of Sam Creating, John Gavin was very flat in the original (Hitch called him "The Stiff" back) and Mortensen gives more credibility than less pleasant performance. William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are the only other players to keep the originals up. <br /> <br /> In general, a movie that should be labeled "Dear embarrassing failed attempt. Just look at it when compared to the original or if the original is unknown to you. But look at the original. "The movie would have been made of 3 out of 5 if it was original or reprocessed, but it is from 0.5 out of 5 (Macy, Moore and Mortensen)
