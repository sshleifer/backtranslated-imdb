In the third part of "Left Behind", the makers did not make the PLACE OF THE SURFACE. Although all the weapons on the planet have been confiscated by the United Nations, World War III suddenly starts with a finger. Within a few seconds, the former lover of one of the main protagonists passes passionately enthusiastically to direct hate against the confession of melancholic love without any trace of instructions. <br /> <br /> But this movie is really an irony-free zone. After the consent of the President of the United States of America as the savior of Jesus, he immediately becomes a suicide bomber and blows a skyscraper in the middle of the city. Osama Bin Laden is very jealous when she sees this movie!
