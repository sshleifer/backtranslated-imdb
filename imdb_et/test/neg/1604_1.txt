Very dumb show. Worse still, it's very racist. White guys are stupid idiots and the only romance is black and white. There's nothing interesting about this romance, it's not exciting, it's not fun, they don't seem to care for each other at all, more like an interracial for writers and directors. Why is this media so popular today? It's social programming and it doesn't bring good, there are always tensions when too many people want the same thing. This exhibition is not worth 20 seasons, it is a waste of time and harmful to society. At least when they use television programs to sell products, they are more discreet, selling any item on the agenda quite obviously, and without clear thinking, some may be wrong to accept it, but some of us know better.
