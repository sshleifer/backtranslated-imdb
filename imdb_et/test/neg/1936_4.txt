My Take: Even great underwater photography can save familiar script and paper with thin characters. <br /> <br /> For those who have not yet received FREE EXCHANGE pictures, FLIPPER can earn a decent rental. Others recommend staying away. Although FLIPPER is a harmless thing, it hardly shows an adult audience (unless it's your first time seeing a dolphin). <br /> <br /> FLIPPER, a 1960s TV show and movie release, may seem like a good idea: the dolphin captures the life of a boy and a girl, helping the environment alone to get rid of the toxic waste thrown into the Florida Keys sparkling wine, and at the same time Time to Fight Shark and a. salty sea baddie, who is responsible for poisonous dumping and also hates dolphins. But even in the 90s, especially when a failed movie like FREE WILLY was hit recently, FLIPPER is another harmless but occasionally empty summer splash movie for kids. Although animals (that is, when it comes to the main dolphin, clumsy pelican and a realistic appearance of a sharkfish, a type-approved cable) and pristine underwater cinematography steal the show, FLIPPER has nothing else to steal. br /> <br /> The story is completely predictable, but nothing more than 6 years old today. (Man) cast, led by RUTE EELH Wood and Paul Hogan outside of Estonia, is rarely anything to do but stand around and be beautiful. Their skills, no matter what they do, are rarely seen on the screen unless you think that the cheerful dolphin on the bottle cap is "acting". I do not think that FLIPPER is recommended if the frenzied family life is not fair, but everyone over the age of 10 (No, do it 8) is better to rent or buy. Moreover, the film is about 95 minutes long. It can just give you enough time to do something else without worrying about your children. This alone can be worth the rent. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** 5 out of 5
