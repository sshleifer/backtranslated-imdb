If you have a lot of time to kill and the DVD has given you free, but it may still take a lot of courage to watch this movie that doesn't have a good script or humor on this issue. <br /> <br /> The functional front side is immaculate about frozen time / action, Tushar Kapoor was a little better than Imran in this movie. Paresh Rawal was good at comedy. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the college campus where Imran is a bad boy. Tushar is good, they say they are in conflict with the nature and so the story goes on ..... <br /> <br /> Look at it only if you have nothing to do and the movie works on local cable TV.
