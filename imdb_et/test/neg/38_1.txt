I just came here to check out Terror Hospital's alternate so I know what not. Not only do you get the original title, but I found that the Terror Hospital is still one of seven nicknames. It's a real clunker. Such films can usually be forgiven for any production level due to any causes, mostly unintended consequences, resulting in at least light entertainment, mostly entertainment. It has nothing. Instead, the viewer witnesses an excessively unnecessary and five-too-convenient-for-the-situ exposure, and draws scenes of characters that have been desperately moved from room to room, and all this is half the movie. Forget trying to figure out where someone is (or who they are) in dark or night scenes; you probably don't care. There is also a casual car chase that seems quite boring as some old driver movies that I slep ... er, i mean sat and watched back in high school. Really, we're talking about the mystery, the possession and the killer here - not a bad recipe for the trash. Unfortunately, there is nothing here that would make it a "good" waste bin; joining the aforementioned circumstances, bad performance and not-so-special effects are just the same - bad performance and non-so-special effects. It's just a trash, clean and easy. Leave it on the shelf at the pawn or at the table. There's a reason ...
