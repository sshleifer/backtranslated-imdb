I've seen this movie about 6 or 7 times, and it's really funny every time. Maybe I enjoy the most tired character paradigms the film offers us: the evil American male male chief, his blonde girl, the glasses of jokes, the brunette girl, the antagonist jock and the brunette girl # 2. However, we are presenting two magic martial arts experts with cablots that travel with convertibles. If anyone can explain this, please contact me. Among other things, Bobby Johnston's imagination about the nature of the jock, Dell and his brand line: "That's why I keep him around." When looking at Johnston's performance, it is not surprising that his career fell quickly with soft-core porn. (SPOILER) Even after several views I have no idea what this great demon is saying at the end; it is just electronically muted noise. Well, it's probably better. And finally, why are all demons so slippery? Is damp skin less sparse? This film certainly didn't help.
