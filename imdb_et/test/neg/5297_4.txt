In spite of John Travolta's statements in interviews that this was his favorite role in the career, "Be Cool" is disappointing to be consistent with the smart and smart "Get Shorty" of 1995. <br /> <br /> Travolta delivers pleasant results in this lightly fun movie, but ultimately the film falls due to the lack of developed plot, unlikely characters and surprise between Travolta and Uma Thurman. Although there is some laugh, this ununny example of dialogue (which often appeared in trailers) does it all: Thurman: Do you dance? Travolta: Hey, I'm from Brooklyn. <br /> <br /> The movie shows that everyone in the entertainment company has a gangster or wants to be one that compares it to organized crime. In "Get Shorty" was a prerequisite that the gangster "filmed correctly" was a smart water idea, but "Be Cool" seems to biz has since then been curved. <Br /> <br /> The film is interestingly cast and the absolute highlight is The Rock's "monolgue", whose character is an ambitious actor and goon, where he recreates the scene between Gabrielle Union and Kirsten Dunst. Go ahead. ‚ÄùVince Vaughan's character thinks he's black and he's often seen dressed in a pimp - it was quite funny in the first scene that introduced him and gets tired and embarrassed almost immediately after that. <br /> <br /> Generally, "Be Cool" may be worthy of John Travolta coinage (which I am one of), but you can keep your finger on the fast back and forth to get through without feeling too much time wasted. "Get Shorty" fans can actually do it to prevent it because the sequel is not the most of the things that one winner did.
