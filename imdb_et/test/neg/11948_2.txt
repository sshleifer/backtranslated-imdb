There is only one word to define the whole movie, that is: terrible. How "mostly Marta" was rebuilt is terrible. The movie's title is terrible. Participants are terrible. And the idea of ​​good cooking and uniting the US is terrible. If you have seen "Bella Martha", this is the original title and it means "Beautiful Martha", it is abdominal pain. M.s. Not to mention a chef who plays a different role better. And the little girl ... is worth noting. Bella Martha was a very nice movie, authentic ... why was it restored? There was a story .... here they took it out. No story ... What does it represent? In one way, this film was perfect. Do you know if all the ingredients fit together? Well this is so. Perfect Crap.
