Why did I not want the film to be a foolish fool of the actors themselves, that someone might actually believe such a mess. <br /> <br /> First of all, the second coming of Christ is at the end of the words, and when Jesus Christ arrives at the Judgment Day, he will not come, as He did before, in human form. He comes in his full glory as God and we are not only understood for our sins, but also for the consequences of our actions. Everyone! Secondly, I have seen the eternal Gay pride shown in this film, which is indisputable "I read the Bible last night and it is not written everywhere". Well, that's it. Moses refers to three different times that men who love other men or women who love one another as if man and woman were killed because they never inherit the kingdom of God because they are unpleasant! If we really had to follow the Bible literally, then it would be executions, wouldn't it? But I think the misuse of people will do more harm than it would be ... It was in the Old Testament. <br /> <br /> Psychiatric departments have many ransomers who think they are the Son of God, but make a movie after you really think about how many idiots there are, can make a movie.
