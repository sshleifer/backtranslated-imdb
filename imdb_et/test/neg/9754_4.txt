I wasn't really interested in seeing Step Up, but my friend still kept me watching this movie, especially since he was in love with Channing Tatum. I constantly tease him, saying it's the only reason he loved the movie. But he persuaded me somehow that it was a movie worth seeing when I love movies like Dirty Dancing, take the lead and Save the Last Dance that I should love Step Up, what the hell? I think every film has the right to look in some way. <br /> <br /> Well, do you know the movies I just mentioned? Dirty Dancing, take the lead and save the last dance? Well, put them in a mixer with some gangsta love and what you have. Not to mention whether you've seen these movies, frankly you've seen Step Up. Because Channing is a lower-end street player who just naturally knows music, while a snobby class girl has to follow step by step how they will ever fall in love if they are so different? After all, it is their chance to "dance" to dance, mystery and lust! OK, it was a silly plot explanation, but as I said, as long as you've seen the movies I mentioned, or even if you just saw the plot, you get that movie. I don't understand how it has a 5.5 rating, I bet they are Channing's lovers! LOL! I joke with you guys, but that's all good, I think I just didn't get what others did with passion, dance! Oh, Antonio Bandares, where are you when we need you ?! <br /> <br /> 4/10
