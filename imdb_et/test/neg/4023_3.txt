The original story was all the ingredients to make a thoroughly captivating film. But this version failed because even Cherie Lunghi was a pale imitation of what she had to change - so much that I suspected she should be an end-user accomplice. Sherlock Holmes became a warrior quite different from what Sir Arthur Conn Doyle suggested? In fact, it was Dr. Watson who showed a little bit of common sense. The dwarfed dwarf of the Andoman Islands saw that he could not get out of a paper bag and what the villain in Baker Street did not want to do would be something that the old Scottish yard would never have dreamed of. So please send this TV movie to your black museum.
