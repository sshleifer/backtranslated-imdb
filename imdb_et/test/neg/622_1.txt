Leave Ed Wood alone. To call "Outer Space Plan 9", the worst film ever made would deny this hesitantly vulgar heap of Hollywood, which is its legitimate title. This unintentional association of unlikely mad and obsolete social-political comments seems to have actually been designed according to the "Plan 9" lines, with poorly staged scenes where participants are happy, with cheap kits mixed with what appears to be battles and crowd scenes of higher budget ethics . But while "Plan 9" sometimes can be funny, if it means general and reasonable entertainment, then this sticky competition is terribly missing from the main show; tried to embody Joan of Arc by listening to his "voices") that annoying (Dennis Hopper does nothing about Napoleon's role) Peter Lorre's unexpectedly embarrassing appearance in psychotic Nero. Give Irwin Allen the worst driver's trophy so little change.
