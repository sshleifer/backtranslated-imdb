Produced from International Playhouse Pictures, it seems like filming in a doll house. Everything is a liar, everything is dreamy, without toys without good reason. I'm not saying that all movies should be completely realistic, but such incredible fantasy things and situations in one movie are too many. How did they get these beautiful actors - just this movie? It's nice to see Mia; if we should understand why his wife wants to kill her, Mia does it well. Not funny, not moving, but fake. Ultimately, Stephen Dorff, perhaps for play, appears less for the film, but it is not for measuring things. Terrible.
