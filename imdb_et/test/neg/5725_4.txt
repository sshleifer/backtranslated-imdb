This movie was released shortly after Conan's films, a sort of female Conan, Red Sonja, played by former husband Brigitte Nielsen. Unfortunately, he is not a very good actor, as Rocky IV and Cobra have shown. The whole movie looks cheap, but strangely Arnold Swarzenegger appears in this movie, but not Conanina, though she looks, acts and fights like Conan's two Conan movies, I don't know what it is. Anyway, it only appears every 20 minutes and doesn't hang long. Maybe in the movie Arnold did it off at Conan's destroyer or something like that in the movies? In any case, the film's feature film is slow and boring, skip it and look at Conani Barbar instead.
