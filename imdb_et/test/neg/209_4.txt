Dillon, Fishbourne, Reno, should have done much more smarter efforts, because it slides into category B and could have done it without naming actors and a much smaller budget because anyway, 2 armored trucks and a waste warehouse would not have been too much. As the writers were unable to come up with a smart hysterical plan, they were geared to the drama of the situation, but there was not much to use. Fishbourne and Reno do not bring anything to this movie except the media, they are just an expensive advertisement. Dillon is fine, but it was going to be in the park. The basic character of Ty Hackett is quite endless and final, with a "reward", is quite childish. Waste of time, money, actors, etc.
