Comedy? What's so funny when you look at English alcoholics who attended 6 anonymous alcoholics (when I turned it off)? Escape with fearsome and mumbles and drunken slices. The Hollywood Religious "God Saves You" With The Strike Of Redemption. The second reviewer mentioned in the Leone's "Sassy Dialogue" - I managed to watch almost an hour of this boring movie and I have still not seen any shit - in fact, my 80-year-old grandmother is more entertaining than knowing her character in this landfill. The road is more rocky and shows less emotion than Keanu - really wondering if he's not addicted - maybe botox, his face is so wooden? Save yourself from this movie, the killing of which is boring.
