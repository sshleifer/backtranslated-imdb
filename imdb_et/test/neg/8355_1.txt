This movie is as bad as the "Alcatraz bird". I am not referring to acting, but rather to the premise of both films that try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic. Moreover, it disturbs me when respected, honorable actors like Alan Alda (and Burt Lancaster) play such a role, because their status tends to give the director the will to raise the subject of the film, the social deviation. <br /> <br /> I was in Caryl Chessman's primary school in recent years and her death sentences and books were in great news. I remember the opinion that the death penalty was wrong and Chessman was a victim. <br /> <br /> Get the people involved. Learn about history. Chessman was a criminal and sexual predator. He drove the streets of stolen police light in his vehicle at night in LA. He stopped cars with attractive women during traffic arrests. then the women were robbed and raped. Rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience, and many victims say they prefer to die for their horror and humiliation. <br /> <br /> Chessman got exactly what he earned, just ten years too long. There is no compassion for the devil.
