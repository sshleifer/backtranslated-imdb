It's about as stupid as it gets. <br /> <br /> A classic case of two-dimensional characters that always work exactly the opposite of what a reasonable person would do in the same situation. It reminds me of the Scary Movie scene where Carmen Electra escapes from the killer. There are two characters, one of which is marked with "safety", the other with "solid death" (I remember), <br /> <br /> And like Scary Movie, characters always remain in the direction of "Solid Death". <br /> <br /> Why oh, why did a girl start a fire in a cab and hold the door shut ??? Did she prefer to die in the fire instead of killing the boy? Why oh, why did they sit on the seat after cutting and overcrowding the driver, and being wounded by him instead of normal shooting or at least tapping him? He ran over to his friend and killed him for a few minutes, but are they disgraceful? Why oh why one hundred more things ... <br /> <br /> When this movie was on the road, you could not drive a fence because of holes. Everything is so far drawn that it starts to physically hurt from time to time. <br /> <br /> Ruthlessly add players and a small budget, and here you get it. Looking at the rating and comments, I know those people who have looked at a completely different film. <br /> <br /> One thing that really was missing is the infamous red toolbox "Although he was out" - a movie that is similar to an unrealistic plot and stupid behavior by characters.
