ABC people forgot to do their biographical research ... so many scenes were just wrong! An actor who played JPII was very rigid, with no personality. It is very obvious that this film was at the bottom of the programming totem survey, so the movement is so small. The script is terrible. Conversations like: "You must follow the rules" "No, people are hungry." Lame. Plus, this movie jumped from events to events to suit two hours. Terrible! A better use of your time would be to watch PBS documentaries in JPII. CBS also put a mini-jersey into JPII, far better than ABC. JPII was a great person, and it bothers me to think my grandfathers get this ABC movie and think it's what he really liked!
