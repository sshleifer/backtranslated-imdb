I want to say that I went to this movie because my expectations were too high. I thought it was funny because it's a sequel to Bruce Almighty, which was really funny and it marks Steve Carelli, who is a great comedy actress, but a boy whether it sucks. <br /> <br /> The film is promoted as a sequel, but in fact it has nothing to do with the original, because the only people who repeat their roles are Morgan Freeman and Steve Carell, but Steve's character is completely different, he is no longer first he was here first. . The story is different and the actors are different and not funny. <br /> <br /> All those involved (Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Wanda Sykes, John Goodman, Ed Helms and even Jon Stewart in a very embarrassing fire)) Talent is a talent, but none of them seem to use it and it seems like the movie there is only money. <br /> <br /> Now the graph is designed after Noah's story, but with so many wrong things, I don't know where to start. I think the big problem is that everyone around Evan thinks he's crazy, despite all the things he's going to do, he grows a huge white beard in two days, he gets help from animals from all over the world, he builds a giant arc in a few weeks In real life, people would not have worshiped after that, they would say he was a new Noah. <br /> <br /> Special effects are also good, but what the hell is the biggest film flood ever filmed in Evan Almighty? Did they really need to waste such good special effects as a filler of such a twilight movie. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey seems to be a clever man because he has stayed away from the three worst sequences ever made. Mask, Dumb and Dumbered and now Evan Almighty. <br /> <br /> It was a giant disappointment and Tom Shyadac should be ashamed.
