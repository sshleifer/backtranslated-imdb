I no longer respect IMDb ratings. I think a number of Mormons got over the website and voted for it. It's not an artistic film, it's Mormon propaganda. There is nothing wrong with that, but the plot and the way it is described are completely misleading. If you're a Bible who casts a Christian or Mormon, watch this movie, you love it and think it's really amazing. No one else, do not worry, the story is so artificial, random things happen that really don't follow consistently. This man is trying to commit suicide because he sleeps near his neighbor. Are you kidding? What a pussy! Anyway, it's a terrible movie.
