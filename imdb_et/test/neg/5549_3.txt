Low-budget Schlockmaster Herschell Gordon Lewis reaches a new low level (even for him) with "The Gore Gore Girls", a "movie" (snicker) with all his technical brands: poorly recorded sound, bad lighting and OTT gore. It would be acceptable, even a bit charming, if the film had at least an interesting plot ("Blood Feast", with all its ridiculous glory, this is a good example), but "Girls" is a complete stabbing. Absolutely unlikely pompous-ass private investigator Abraham Gentry (Frank Kress) is a recruited newspaper reporter to find out who has killed the settled removers (you have to take care of who is the culprit for a long time before these two cases go up). As before, the appeal is not a test piece, but the creative methods of bleeding (including the girl's wooden furniture with a fan) and the occasional blinking of the skin that has been wiped from time to time ... but it is simply not enough to lift the material above.
