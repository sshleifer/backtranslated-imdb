Unreal !!!!!!!! After reading the initial reviews posted by the alleged reviewers, I was shocked to find that almost all the initial reviews, 38, all rated this movie 10. Compared to other great movies, these reviewers thought that Fast and Undead is a Better Movie than the 6th Sense (8.2) ), Keep Private Ryan (8.4), Lord of the Rings (8.7), Godfather (9.5), Gladiator (8.1), and Dawn of the Dead (7.8). Hopefully, these colors will use their next discounted shot procedure they hear because it is quite obvious that these reviews are counterfeit. <br /> <br /> I thought this film was a unique concept in the genre. Zombie movie making. Unfortunately, looking at Quick and Undead, it is obvious that these reviews have been created by people who have been involved in production or who have an interest in the marketability / financial success of films. Nothing in my mind changes it more than hearing that part of this movie was shot in Texas, was randomly distributed early posting, which praised the film. Zombie film / Horror B film culture as a whole is a forgiving group, but unfortunately this film is over all redemptions. The characters are recycled and the plot is bad. The quality of the film was not bad enough for the tagged camcorder, and at least they used a film quality camera. Action is terrible, the star may not succeed if Clint Eastwood wants to clone. Christ on a bicycle !!!!!! Even the main actor's name is Clint. He was just terrible. The only similarity to Clint Eastwood is that lead uses "wood" from Eastwood in its style of action. Zombie makeup was higher than the quality of the Halloween party, but it was not fully applied to full Undead members. Zombies were not shared. The plot was so hokey that I had the hope of a power outage, a DVD disc error, or that the zombies would turn their attention to the driver. Perhaps the film is worth for some viewers, but not for my hard earned dollar. Fortunately, I used this free DVD to use my free rental voucher. Maybe this movie will be saved by Nott (aptly named), which will release a special collection DVD that binds open mistakes and delivers allowed goods? Some, how do I think NOTT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!! Lets just hope that their next release, The Flesh Keeper, is really a recycled version of the movie "Keeper" and not the 5th generation Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Fingers crossed people here ... but only when you care.
