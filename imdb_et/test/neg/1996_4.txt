Chuck Jones '' Smell-capable Kitty '' is a comic that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world? in some sense. Pepe, which we know and love (or hate for some people) and the character, has some important differences in this comic. First of all, there is a hidden cat that Pepe loves "smelling Kitty", clearly a man. Also, Pepe has fallen into a scam whose real name is Henry at the top of his cartoon, his French accent falls off when his wife and family appear. Pepe is not even a leading figure here who focuses on a cat who hides himself as an enemy to scare his enemies. Most of the time the story follows Pepe Le Pew's comic, but Pepe's aggressive treatment touches the usual wisecracks and direct camera addresses that make him so great. She is not nearly as beautiful as she would have changed and quite uncomfortably animated. In fact, "Smell-capable Kitty" is a pretty crazy and clumsy-looking comic. Its main source of complaint stems from its concept, which was original at this stage, before it became a copy of each subsequent Pepe Le Pew. Such further development has been robbed by the "Odor-capable Kitty" effect, and for modern viewers it just seems quite boring for Pepe Le Pew, who has a strange surprise. As a child, I hated Pepe Le Pew. As an adult who can appreciate his more complex, verbal and dull humor, I love this character and most of his cartoons. "Fragrant Kitty" makes me feel like a baby again!
