Time is not kind of silent default transition days for this movie. The plot has a gangster who falls on a member of society who wants to help his lucky violinist he loves. Of course there are complications. The film's problem for me is that it is not well out of date. Performances are all over the place, some emotional scenes seem both top and ridiculous. One late change, where Carol Lombard throws someone out of his room, was above my song song. There are other times when the film becomes static, which is a sign of microphone constraints. It's not a bad movie, but the fact that the movie's technical limitations get a real pleasure. Usually I'm forgiving, but this time I just couldn't go with the flow (then again I saw what I saw was terribly terrible). It is worth forgiving (and remember that Robert Armstrong actually played more than playing Carl Denham in King Kong)
