I went to this film with half-high expectations after loving a series of serials in my childhood, and it broke that love for me. Jason Lee, in David Seville's movie, is terrible. I understand that CGI characters that aren't actually there can't be easy, but I really found his result frightening with all the other non-animated characters. The musicians were divine, but sometimes obviously obvious when the story was moved, and therefore did not tempt me to stay in the theater for more than half an hour. If you feel you have to see this movie, rent it the most. It's not worth eight bucks to see it in theaters if you don't want to laugh.
