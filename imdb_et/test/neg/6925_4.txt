Milla stands out in this movie because of her personal sense of style and hanging clothes. I've learned to hate this wrinkled little three-year-old face as he pretends to cry. It does all the points he tries to make as a serious actor. Of course, in the film with BALDWIN and Denise, the acting actor is a mature actor. David seemed to make Woody Allen Howdy Doody. No word or gesture in the whole film seemed sincere or even sincere. "How Harry Met Sally" and "Two Weddings and Funerals", even in "Sleepless Seattle" were scripts, locations, and ACTORS. The script seemed to be the distinction between bad and crude oil lines, separated by LOT OF TALKING. Locations seemed a few blocks apart. There are only two participants between Indie flicki, Milla and an adult girl who played chicks who were in the stars. I watched it mostly for the first time with sound off, just watching Millat. This subscript was old when I first saw it, and it's a silly hanging song "How to succeed in business without really trying".
