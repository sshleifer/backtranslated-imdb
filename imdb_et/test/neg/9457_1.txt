Nothing but the director's fantasy comes to life. This "film" is nothing more than an excuse that the director / actor plays a kissing face against an attractive young woman who would not otherwise give her time. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, the direction is non-existent and the movie drags when the actor / director / writer / narrator tells you. Don't be fooled by X-rated, nudity, and minimal gore.
