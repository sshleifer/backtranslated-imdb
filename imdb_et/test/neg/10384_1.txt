When I was watching BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM, I encountered such incredibly bad scenarios and dialogue that I was convinced that it was going to be a comedy. Some of the selection bits that deserve your stomach: "I ate a rabbit." "I TOLD you that he was in possession!" "Are you telling me the devil is my daughter?" <br /> <br /> There are many, many more, but you must discover them yourself - if you dare. <br /> <br /> The story goes in all directions and things happen to probably not and all seem to be some kind of pervert or psycho (even a priest). And I haven't even got into bad behavior. The best known in this area is Isabelle's father playing with. The director had to tell him exactly how he would keep his $ $ $ because that is the overall impression one gets. <br /> <br /> I don't want to drive anyone away from BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM because there is an entertaining value that should have been ... for all the wrong reasons, but if you are looking for a decent horror movie that makes sense and is actually scary ... well, don't run.
