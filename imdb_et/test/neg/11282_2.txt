I walk from very few movie rides, and this movie became one of those I could no longer watch. As for the prizes he won, the awards given by the Turkish festivals are, in my opinion, not reliable. The only explanation for the Queens Festival award was to think that the comedy layer was "translated" in some way, because the subtitles helped distract the scary performances. <br /> <br /> At the start of the screen, the chairman briefly talked about the history of the Turkish cinema and at one point mentioned that the early Turkish cinema was appropriately called the "theater of performances", as many filmmakers and participants were people in the theater scene. <br /> <br /> Ironically, this movie falls into this category. English-speaking speakers may think that the Turkish language is a loud language when reading subtitles, but attaches to it all the temptations in the film, but the attentive local commentators immediately note that all actors are over-voiced. You can attribute it to the nature of amateurs of all the actors, but the biggest source of "shouting dialogue" is the main character played by the only professional actor in the movie. No wonder his background is in the theater. My guess is that, in response to the transfer of his loud lines, all the other amateur actors also raised their voices, making the whole movie an unnatural performance. <br /> <br /> Put it all on a style that develops at a snail's pace, getting a very boring movie. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I also have a personal problem with Turkish films that depict rural and low-grade unfamiliar characters. Since "Zugurt But" is one of the best Turkish films, Turkish filmmakers do not seem to be able to avoid country country complaints. It is interesting only in small doses and if it is just as beautifully organized with excellent writing and directing like Zugurt Aga. Most often, it is extremely boring and, frankly, a bit embarrassing for local "city" Turks. The rural communities form part of the neglected minor in the country, and although it provides good material for comedy, it is very large in the Turkish picture. <br /> <br /> A Western audience whose only contact with Turkey is this film, no doubt that Turkey is like Afghanistan. I want filmmakers to understand this and let their passion for "rural" stories and be loyal to most of the countries that live in cities that are shaming European metropolitan areas.
