This is just one of those films that always silence you and what I wanted. There are many problems and there are few good points. I feel that the main problem with this film is that it is an example of cheese and tries to make it an epic film about the super evil monkeys of the movie and the intelligent people who simply sign it is not epic, it is cheese. If you have cheese, make the movie more fun. It is allowed that the monkey-ending scene and this laser was very pleasant to watch and more such things were needed. Instead, the actors do such a serious job that you feel that the film has all the serious tensions the film tries to set. The plot is reversed by a woman trying to find her lost ex-spouse while searching for some legendary diamond. He uses these two men who trained the monkey to make sign language, and now he wants to go back to his nature to get into the country and start a mediocre adventure of life. The only things that make this film somewhat tolerable are the character of Ernie Hudson and the end of the laser attack.
