In Chicago, four Dean (Richard Grieco) electricians come to an old building to cut off power. They accidentally activated the portal and reached another dimension where Chicago destroyed Spider Queen and lived with mutants. The group will meet with the leading survivors of Crane (David Nerman) and Elena (Kate greenhouse) and will find the portal inventor Dr. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox), who has lived in this dimension for thirty years. They join forces in trying to restore the portal to bring them home. "Webs" is a traceable plagiarism of "sliders", but worse. Most dialogues seem to have been written by a person who has not graduated from primary school, so they are so wonderful. In addition, the story is illogical and it seems that Chicago is the only city in the world. A scientist trying to start his own complex machine with broken wires, as if the car was stealing, is very funny. Richard Grieco's face looks like Michael Jackson's white version and is terrible. When the viewer closes his brain, he may like this forgotten TV movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Na Teia do Terror" ("Horror's Web")
