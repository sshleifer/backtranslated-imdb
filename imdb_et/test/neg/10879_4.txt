First let me say this ... Ghost Story .... Hi!?! <br /> <br /> If any of the other people who trashed this movie from scratch to end, understood it, their reviews would have been very different. The fact that the characters disappear when the protagonist turned back should have been dead. This movie was not presented as a ghost story when you rented it into a video store, not even clues, and this is the biggest mistake made by the studio that marketed it. It was deliberate that they would not market it as a ghost story to confuse how the main character is confused when you try to understand it. The problem is that they lost too many viewers; The ghosts appeared "too human and real" without the usual signs, images or special effects Hollywood usually uses to let you know that you are now seeing a ghost ... and that is what they were trying to do. The main character does not know that he sees ghosts or viewers. Now you get it? As long as you realize that the main character sees ghosts, you understand the film and are not so upset about what is perceived as major continuity or error in the plot. <br /> <br /> I admit that saying this was still not a good movie, just not so bad that almost everyone else did it. Just understand if you are going to watch this movie, everything you see is "not" always what you think. 4 out of 10 for action, 3 for originality, 5 for plot and 5 for deer, although there were some gore and spooky moments. Still not a good movie, just misunderstood.
