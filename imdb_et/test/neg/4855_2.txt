Although this film has much praise, I personally found it boring. Brazilian sunsets are beautiful and characters are plausible, but the story of how they interact, even if our standards are very unusual, is not long enough to keep the film. A central woman takes one man closely after another and puts the interests of her children first. As the tolerance of different men is stretched, we see the formation of these characters. The story opens with dignity and is supported by great actors. This is a rare look at the hinterland of Brazil, far from the city but hardly exciting to keep your eyes open.
