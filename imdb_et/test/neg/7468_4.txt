I saw the Grande Ecole world premiere at the Rotterdam Film Festival. I had no idea what I entered and would have any idea I wouldn't have entered. This is the most terrible movie I've seen for a long time. It is trying to be provocative, but deep, with its full homosexual sexual scene - it won't work! This is nothing more than a bad excuse to show naked people on the big screen. 4/10
