The reason I gave this movie 4 was for a couple of reasons, but this movie wasn't that bad. first off, editing I found too pretty bad at times, the script (or what they were one) wasn't very good, and if not Nunzio La Bianca, acting would have been a mess. but all this aside (ha ha i know its similar to the whole movie) is not so bad for very low ind. , low budget movie. If they had got more money, a little better actors (but they were scary, so it was good) and a little more detailed script, this movie would be terrible. Somebody has to tell me that the warrior of Walter Hill influenced this man. I mean, this movie is exactly the same. anyone who has seen both movies agrees with me.
