Having loved Stephen King's novels and short stories for years, I, like most reviewers, have consistently been disappointed with the customization of my film. Some remarkable exceptions are "Stand By Me" from "The Body", "Carrie" from the same name novel and "The Shawshank Redemption" from "Rita Heyworth and Shawshank Redemption". This movie is by far the worst thing ever produced by the name of Stephen King, which has been added to it. Not surprisingly, Mr King has quite a few links to it. I feel that the thing that impressed me with this badly-behaved, cheap-filed, terribly trashed trash is that they had the full readiness to change the end. Don't waste your time or money on this amazing bow! !
