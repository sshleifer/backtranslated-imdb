I just saw it in a local independent station in the New York area. The cast showed a promise, but when I saw the director George Cosmoto, I got suspicious. And certainly it was so bad, every pointless and stupid, like any George Cosmotos movie I ever saw. He is like a stupid man, Michael Bey, with all the horror that recognizes promises. <br /> <br /> There is no point in conspiracy, no burning issues that require conspirators. We leave the opportunity to connect points from one graffiti bit to the different walls of a movie to the next. Thus, the current budget crisis, the war in Iraq, Islamic extremism, the fate of social security, 47 million Americans without health care, wage increases and middle class death are all covered by the fear of graffiti. /> <br /> A truly amazing idiotic movie.
