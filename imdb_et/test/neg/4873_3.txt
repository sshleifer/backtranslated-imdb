MST3K Feed. It's so bad that that's why it's worth seeing. It has some fun things like a mysterious device that a bad guy sees as working for the whole movie, which is the little helicopter that slips around the engine room and burns without being a witch, but is a bag of balloons (the one they release political conventions). Many other wonderful varieties. Stars Charlie Sheen. There's one scene where he spends five minutes recording a conversation, just to accidentally drop the Potomac river microcassette. If they took the part of Emilio Estevez that would never have happened.
