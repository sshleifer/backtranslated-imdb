I got AFI Festis 2:37 in Los Angeles. This is a very well filmed first film (although the DV format will start showing off the scenes) and I'm sure it has good intentions to show us the "dark side" of high school - in other words, everywhere in high school. But the filmmaker does not have the talent to write or direct the assumption. There are several characters, but none of them are more than what the plot requires. These caricatures have no deeper depth than "I am in difficulty with the X, I have a Y problem." The perceived roles of men and women in this story are phenomenal troubles. <br /> <br /> Let's start with men. You have a stoner boy who is gay who is also a gay boy who rapes his sister and Mr Peepants. As the stereotype requires, all gay men must be sexually abused and violent towards women and themselves. Of course (or unnaturally, if the stereotype requires), two gay male characters beat women, peepants and themselves. I would be fine with these features if the stereotypes were turned on on their heads or if the characters had crossed them. However, it did not happen, and it is all the stories of these characters. <br /> <br /> Next, ladies. One young woman wants to be a bully housewife, another is a sister-rape brother and there is a girl who kills herself (I'll go to it later). Again, I do not believe that there is a requirement for film makers for political correctness (I was out of this work), but I think it is only justified if this character or story is more. If this archetype was used to show something other than "I'm a teenager and sucks life," I would be happy as a box. But nothing new is evident! Nothing undermines or changes or sublimes. <br /> <br /> Finally, the girl who kills herself. It is blunt and high sloppy storytelling. Should we sit down for 5 minutes from a girl who killed herself, who we've seen for 30 seconds throughout the film? We've been following all these other stories in an hour and a half and are now being called to torture ourselves for a part of the story? It's cheap, exploiting and sloppy. Despite the fact that millions of crappy indie movies came before that, you have to do something like that. You can't just buy it on credit. So this suicide happens, we get diapers from characters that move like anywhere but down, and the movie ends. What have I learned? I already knew that high school was sucked - it's been there. I already knew that people have stereotypical views of gay men and young women. I already knew children with disabilities were mocked. <br /> <br /> What else is there? Smoke, mirrors and some really nice views of the leaves. Oh, and the nastiest deus ex machina I've seen for a while.
