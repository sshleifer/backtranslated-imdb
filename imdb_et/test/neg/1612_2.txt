The space disorder sends astronauts Neil Stryker (Glenn Corbett) aside and headed for a parallel world called Terra, facing the sun exactly against the Earth. Because a creature from space threatens the order of this world, Stryker is kept until he can decide what to do with him. But Stryker doubts his surroundings and flees. With the help of a sympathetic sister and an old scientist against the government, Stryker tries to board the spaceship and head back to Earth. <br /> <br /> Spatial space (or stranger, if you like) is another of these 70's television films that had to become a regular weekly show. In this case, it's easy to see why he didn't. First, there is nothing new in the exhibition. It was undoubtedly intended to follow the same formula used by The Fugitive or The Incredible Hulk or Apes Planet. You know, as you move through a stranger, you go from one city to the next by doing whatever job it can continue to do by a government agency or newspaper reporter. This is the formula that has been put to death. Another blow to the frosted space is his leader, Glenn Corbett. Can this man be less pleasant? I grabbed him. Without the compassion of the main character, such an exhibition would never work. Finally, it should be science fiction. Just because everyone is left and somebody has hung three fake months on the horizon, should I jump to the conclusion that this is some far from the planet? So it's just a coincidence that they all speak English, dress like people on Earth and run Plymouth Furys? Yes, right. One highlight for me was the involvement of Cameron Mitchell in pain. Of course, it's hard to see something terrible, but you know the old saying - every Cameron is better than not Cameron (yes, I've never heard of it). <br /> <br /> Like many of these 70's films made on television, I watched the Mystery Science Theater 3000 as a fond place. I wouldn't call it a big episode of any imagination, but the journey has some good jokes. So finally, when I appreciate movie 2/10, it gets 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
