Okay, let's finish chasing - there's no way I can get anything other than 1 in 10; and yet you must see it! Action is bad, but there is nothing bad like a script that is itself before production values. Cardboard Edges? Yes, we have. Car floor mats are painted in silver and used as a weapon? here it is! <br /> <br /> The film itself pretends to be artistic, but is simply cheap; the same frames are used repeatedly - especially drawn in the fight; very little dialogue (luckily!) and lots of "artistic" music to bring home horror. <br /> <br /> And all this terrible is convincing - you have to look at it just so you can say you've seen it. I have not even reached the scarred collections, the "plot", or the extraordinary special effects; it really is "how not to do it" in film making school. It has to be seen - spread this word and let the world join, if it is wise, what will happen on earth at the end <br /> <br /> The best thing is that they made a sequel.
