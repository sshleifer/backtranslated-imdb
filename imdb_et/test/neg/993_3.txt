Monkeys "Head" is one of those peculiar phenomena I've noticed - when nothing makes sense, people try to read things and give it great deep meanings that its creator never foresaw. That is the case in this case. <br /> <br /> In the film, monkeys have a vision of consciousness floating in and out of a variety of sketches, blackouts, bundles, etc. that are similar to their TV show. But while the TV show was laughing, it doesn't seem to have been played, except for some deep, triple, pseudo-intellectual state that this psychiatry marks. All in all, this Monkee is the same schtick, but now it is "raising consciousness" because the laugh is removed. There is no sense of humor or meaning for the whole thing; it just calls with colored lights. <br /> <br /> "Good" music should prove to anyone, beyond doubt, that monkeys did not have the ability to write a song. Songs are mostly garbage; the only thing that is even heard is the "hymn" that opens and closes the movie. But the thing is that it was a song by Gerry Goffin-Carole King, and although it is higher than the Monkees average, it is below average for Goffin and King. It's like hearing one of the old Peter and Gordon songs Paul McCartney wrote to them: you might think it's a pretty good song, but then you know who made it, and you realize it's empty. Mike Nesmith's song is perhaps satisfactory, the rest is worthless. I think Davy Jones is what the filmmakers represented as a "big number" because it is the only song that has been presented as Show Biz and is not cut into movie montage or a dream sequence, but it's also flat because the song isn't good. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I always liked the monkeys, so the movie is a real disappointment. Of course, they were hair, but they were so happy. <br /> <br /> They knew they were cheesy and they were cool with him. But then they were ambitious. In "Head", they're actually kidding that is made of a pop product, but the truth is, they wanted something more. They wanted to be great musicians and take artists seriously. Maybe the Beatles don't like it, but something like that is approaching. "Head" proves that they failed in all censuses. 1 * 4
