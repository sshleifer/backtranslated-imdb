Is it just me or are most of the participants in this adjustment obsolete? <br /> <br /> Jemma Redgrave, although it is a good actor, seems to be joining her children instead of letting her off the couch. (I would have loved to see Brenda Blethlyn in this regard, despite this last pride and prejudice). <br /> <br /> Blake Ritson and Rory Kinnear were the only two I felt spirit and performance with their characters. Every other seemed confused or in place. Fortunately, I am not very familiar with dr. Who (I've seen only a few episodes so far) or it would definitely have even more cast. <br /> <br /> Mansfield Park is too bad on the screen (either big or small). This novel requires the talent of Robert Altman to successfully balance all the complexities of the characters.
