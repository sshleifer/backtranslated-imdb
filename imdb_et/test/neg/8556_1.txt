How can someone invite you to a family film for this propaganda. This is nothing more than a PC that is an unknown insult to small town church students. The film depicts a woman as the great white savior of a small Midwestern town, and all the other towns (mostly men) are just shelters in distress, able to honor those who cannot take care of themselves and who have to rely on the fundamental character to redeem. This film is just a love affair that is somewhat disciplined, lofty, with a little spatter, which she expects to admire. <br /> <br /> The creator of this film apparently spent all his life looking for a sensitive church and was free to crack small but not the majority of the church members. The same people who give money to the Salvation Army during Christianity, gathering donations to help missionaries, the poor and the homeless, sing, companions and make friends with each other. What's wrong with this modest group, which offends these righteous raids? Most Christians in this world would stand in front of the train and give their lives to all those in difficulty, even if they disagree with them. Most Christians do not mind if a church pastor or a church worker took their fur (or outer shirt). They didn't condemn him. This movie is ridiculous!
