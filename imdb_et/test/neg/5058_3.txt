It's not a terrible movie, it's terrible. The plot is deeply faulty and unlikely. He tries to be a number of genres and fails at all. It fails like comedy, a temporary thriller and a horror movie. It succeeds almost in science fiction. The direction is uninspired and Katie Holmes, the lovely cherub face she is, should model teen clothes, not act. The only thing that keeps this movie out of 1 is Helen Mirren. His performance is fabulous and it is (almost) worth the rest. His ability to transmute imperative faux to be manipulated and controlled is a masterful choice. Other than Marissa Coughlin's pleasant exorcist shift, Mirren's only reason to see this movie is. Strong 3.0.
