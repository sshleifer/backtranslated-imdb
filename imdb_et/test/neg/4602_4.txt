It is clear that this film was made for a newer generation that may or may not have been the work of Charles Bukowski. The autobiographical Henry Chinaski, which appeared in Bukowski's stories, excellently featured the perfection of Mickey Rourke in 1987, "Barfly", as well as Faye Dunaway. Anyone who has seen "Factotum" should definitely see "Barfly" to see how Bukowski wrote his character. "Factotum" lacks the fatness of Bukowski's scenario and his single hero's fearless hopelessness. Inadvertent humor that revolves through Chinaski's mistake in dark despair does not work for Dillon, as it did so admirable overweight dirty blood-moistened Rourke. Rourke's character makes pain and joy of the previous night's misbehavior a place that is another shocking ugly day in the life of an unknown writer who drunk. Dillon's character loses those characters in favor of a useful, beautiful and relatively clean-looking writer who barely gets to Chinaski's story. Dunaway's buggy heroine, Wanda, is the perfect complement to a non-loyal Henry. Factotum Women Can't Candle Using Dunaway's "Nervous Goddess" and Using More Prophetic Sexuality in Factotum proves that it is a displacement of raw material rather than a portrayal of the red-colored Bukowski raw and unapologetic functional relationships. I was stunned how exactly the same scenes were used in "Factotum" (Marisa Tomei bought all the stuff and downloaded an exact hit from "Barfly" to her old man). <br /> <br /> If you want to see the best of Bukowski's stories from the movie, see 'Barfly' and 'Love is a Hell Dog' (also called 'Crazy Love').
