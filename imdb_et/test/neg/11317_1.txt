I saw it with my kids who love it, but I didn't want the song to go over the reindeer, but what the fuck he got in this dirty movie is like what the hell why, when my kids heard drowned, they thought that it was good, but we watched that they were such "fathers, why grandmother" said my kids say grandmother, but my kids said "father why grandma hit me" i told them the movie was filthy when they agreed, it is sad why any name would be a dog "Doofas", which is just stupid and if anyone who is dressed in black, so I thought Daphne looked like still emo goth girl seemed like Goths & song they found on grandmother's site i think she died song but in this weird crappy movie she had gone i think they should take it show off OK everyone would love it i give it 1 out of 10
