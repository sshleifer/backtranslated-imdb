<br /> <br /> A very wretched and painstaking adaptation of Amise's amusing satire. The hero is depicted not as a pleasant loser, but merely as an oathist cretin. Most of the rest are pure cartoons, with only Helen McCrory, which gives real quality and gives something of a romantic mindset. The setting of periods is as it would be in the 1920s, not in the period of post-war fear-comics and rock'n rolls. Even according to the UK's poor TV standards, it is a real noise. <br /> <br />
