The original Road House was a classic cheese fight in the 80s, which was not very close to the award-winning writing or display, was a very enjoyable and popular film, largely due to the presence of the star Patrick Swayze and the great supportive story of some great scenes and eye candies. <br /> <br /> 16 years later and MGM / Sony is trying to create a magic that left us all with one liner and three rules to bounce ... a movie that cites all of the original's best liners and describes three rules. <br /> <br /> If it was an amateur fan, it is considered a loving respect for one of Swayze's most popular films. As a professionally made film, it falls directly on the face of the DVD Bargin Bin, constantly reusing lines and plot from the original film, which becomes rather a tedious sign of lack of originality rather than a cold reference to the original. br /> <br /> Having said that, with new lines like "I'll kill you like I killed your father", it is no wonder that the scriptwriters decided to change most of the original script. <br /> <br /> I knew it was never something special, being straight on a DVD, but at least I was hoping that there might be a couple of new ideas and fresh things to live by Road House, but what you get is just a remake of the same movie of 2006, with some drugs added. <br /> <br /> If I were a director, I would have removed all references to the first film so as not to destroy the original and its characters. As it is, we have now got the character of Patrick Swayze, which should now be dead (Jake Busey was stupidly killed) and his brother and son are now the main characters who have strangely different names. <br /> <br My favorite thing was that Dalton's "son" drove the same car his father had done, a really cool tribute, though later it was destroyed when the car ran out exactly like its predecessor. This is a good example of how this film moves too far to include '89 movie sequences and ideas. <br /> <br /> Also, of course, who forget the legendary moment when Wild Bill promises to kill Shane, as I killed your father and then tries to send him completely differently. Amazing writing there. I see Schaech listed as co-scriptwriter. Try to act or preferably nothing. <br /> <br /> In general, this is OK if there is nothing else to watch and you want to turn off your brain in one and a half hours, or if you haven't seen the first Road House, but Swayze's classic fans are Almost disappointed at the moment when you feel offended by how much this movie pulls out of the first. As someone suggested as an alternative subtitle for this movie, "Even Jeff Healy is glad he doesn't see it!" Stay with the original teahouse and live an old old Swayze day!
