Twilight Zone has achieved some mythology - like Star Trek. This is because there are many dedicated lovers that no matter what each episode was a winner. They are the ones who evaluate each individual for 10 and are unable to objectively assess the reading. That's why I looked at all the original Star Trek episodes (good and bad) a while ago, because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive. Now is the time to do the same for Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> Now I was very surprised to see comments on this blissful episode that described it as "the best" and gave it 10 points. If so, why do all I know this episode has hated as much as I do? It is possible that I and my family and friends are all carts, but it is also possible that this is another case where rabbis fans raise the rating on average or below the average episode. <br /> <br /> The episode itself stands for William Windom and others as different archetypes - soldier, dancer, etc. They're all stuck in a cylindrical space without escaping, and only at the end do you understand the "shocking truth" - which is not at all shocking and is really flat. No, this is a badly written and unplayable episode. Yes, there were a lot of episodes in the series that were worth 10 but few as unwanted because of the low script and the unpleasant resolution.
