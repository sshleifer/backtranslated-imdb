I'm a good, credible, acting film fan. And I'm a big fan of elite troops, like the SEALs of the Navy. Finally, I'm a big fan of Michael Biehn. Unfortunately none of them allowed me to really enjoy this movie. I recently bought another option when buying a DVD. Here are the problems associated with this movie in the quick list: 1. It's a poor male master, like a virtual music video from the SEAL team, playing golf with "The Boys are Back in Town", ending with Charlie. . <br /> <br /> 2. It's just Charlie Sheen's movie when Sheen tried to be famous before she started doing things like Hot Shots. I have heard that Sheen was a kid in the set and it influenced the role and direction that the rest of the film's participants got. <br /> <br /> 3. Biehn is the head of the SEAL team, but Sheen rarely gets him. Any SEAL that indicates the lack of discipline that Sheen's character is doing or who threatened the team, as he does, would not even have completed the BUDS training, not to mention the team. <br /> <br /> 4. SEALs are cross-trained with weapons. But in one part of the film, SEAL needs to "find out" how to use the US Stinger Missile. <br /> <br /> The film has some good scenes. The beginning of the attack at the beginning, Bill Paxton as "God" and some film material that was supposed to be Beirut at that time. In general, though, this film is loser.
