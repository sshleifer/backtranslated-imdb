Oh. Good. Trouble. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in TV shows and thought, "I have to watch this movie, I land on Snakes plane, it's terrible, but hopefully also ridiculous. Well, I was half right. <br /> <br /> This movie is strikingly bad and unfortunately unintentionally fun. It's just bad. Worse still, something like action takes almost an hour. In the first half of the film, we have to endure some foreign language (Mexico or Spain, excuses for my ignorance) and terrible action, because some women vomit the live snake for reasons we only know later. Then we have to endure even more terrible actions, and we learn that people who speak in a foreign language can speak English anyway, as the snakes finally get rid of the train and things are moving from sedative to ridiculous. The low budget doesn't always mean "bad", but in that case. What we have here is a movie that has no sense, a terrible script, a bad lie, and even the idea that it is of little use. I'm giving two characters for a decent special effect and a messy end, but it's still a bit too generous. Avoid if you can. <br /> <br /> See if you want: Stagknight, Wicker Man's remake, terrible CGI.
