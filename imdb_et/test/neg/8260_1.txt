Okay,. I went to this loving RuPaul. I still love him, but I mean a little less. This is one big movie that shows many male genitals. This is a fraudulent use of the films of the 1970s for the exploitation of blacks and has been purposefully badly done. For me, the only fun part is that all the voices are eye-catching with the voice of a dropping queen, even true women. It's over the top, endless, laughing at your back so it's a stupid, badly made movie. I would never look at it again, but I appreciate what the filmmakers were trying to do. There is no rating for this, but it would be R or even NC-17. RuPaul has done much better work.
