He wants to be the Apostle Paul's life. He opens up with him who participates in the wrestling of the priest's nose. It was called the Pharisees because they "separated" themselves from the hellenism forced by the Jewish people. The thing is that Saul would never have participated in the Greek-Roman wrestling. TIMETABLE. <br /> <br /> Then we have two men (Saul and the priest, Reuben - a completely unusual fictional character) who have been exposed to a naked Roman style bathroom. Again, the Torah, which Saul followed religiously, condemned in the strongest way the nudity of another. <br /> <br /> Reuben has shown that it is pushing Saul to destroy the church. Again, the text of the scriptures is not important because for them, PAUL says that he put the church to waste and breathed threats and killing against the church. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Barnabas "beating" Paul - not baptizing (dipping) him when the Scripture says it was in Ananias that did it. <br /> <br /> Their mark is not on Mark or his return, so script writers are forced to be Paul and Barnabas argues for Paul's wish to preach in Rome as the basis for their separation. <br /> <br /> No Silas on Paul's Second and Third Mission; No Timothy ... EVER. No Titus; No Apollos ... No, NO, NOOOO !!! James is said to have "felt Jesus for a long time," instead of saying, as the Scripture says, he is the brother of Jesus. <br /> <br /> Why not just invite "Frank, a fictional apostle?!?"
