I'm a massive fan of drama in prison, reflected in OZ, my favorite American TV show all the time. I think the appeal lies in a sort of cunning prince to see bad things with the bottom of bad men, but I found that Don Siegel's RIOT IN CELL BLOCK 11 is quite disappointing. Okay, I knew that because it was done in 1954, it wouldn't be a bad language, graphic fabrics and gang rape, but even so it's a relatively weak film compared to depicting a prison in earlier films like EACH DAWN I DIE and WHITE HEAT. The problem lies in the preaching tone of the film, where Dunn, the head of unrest, is something of a prison reformer. Yes, it sounds ridiculous because it is a violent hero, not a somewhat hugging tree that hugs good. There is also the problem of making a B movie with such radical themes (It is quite ironic that Siegel will later make DIRTY HARRY, where the only good offender is dead) and this is the majority that is not very good for Emile Meyer if the guardian is particularly irritating in her work. like I said a disappointing movie
