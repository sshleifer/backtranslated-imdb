Nothing about this movie can be distinguished from either big or terrible. <br /> <br /> Ultimately it kills. Beauty is not just good. I can't tell you to wait for Will Smith to be better, but I certainly made Kevin James "Queens King" - but hey, I get used to saying a lot lately. This movie tries to make its mark as a poisonous romantic comedy, but it never hit the bull's eye. In fact, it never hit the target *. The allergy scene is disturbing; The fact that Kevin James cannot dance is something that does not blame anyone, and therefore (in such a film) is not funny. This film is constantly trying to win its heart, but always with the wrong time. Some parts are okay (but I'm looking for examples of my brain), but I think this movie should be avoided.
