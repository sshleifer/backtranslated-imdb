Marigold's main picture is a romantic comedy, where the film industry is seen as a backdrop. American actress Marigold, played by Ali Carter, stays in India. What's worse is that he's in the money. He then decides to play a small role in Bollywood music so he can make enough money to get back to his people. Here he can meet Indian choreographer Prem, played by Salman Khan. In principle, the movie fails at the script level. Simply calling a movie, Hollywood does not guarantee a high quality cinema. The best example is Marigold. The direction of art is weak and outdated. Musically, Marigold has turned out to be a dude. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's is far from being recognized as a proper hearing. Salman gives his press the most amateurish performances. Ali Larter is good and has a huge screen. The result is wise, he's good. <br /> <br /> You can also find good comments on this movie at http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=36310
