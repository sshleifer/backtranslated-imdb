"Carlito Angels" is a looting of "Charlie's angels", which is not even afraid to sometimes fool itself, but that does not mean that the film would be criticized by the viewers - it is amateur and minor (I think fast) -Motion " quit about 1914) The attacking rap music drives the dialogue often, and the film seems longer than it is, though it lasts barely over an hour! The girls themselves are hot and divine, with excellent lean bodies, and although they never get naked, their outfits leave I learned that one of them (Alessandra Ramos) is actually dealing with a film career, I wish her happiness, because although this film is bad, she (like other girls) gave her any energy and I wouldn't want to see her again on the screen at all.
