Pretty cheap PRC is cheap, which I rarely look back on again, and it's no wonder it's slow and blunt and dull like a knife. The crazy doctor, George Zucco, is back on it, combining a combined cultivation house (Glenn Strange) with a wolf. Unfortunately, the makeup is virtually non-existent, consisting mainly of beard and dimestorefangs. If it weren't with the lovely Anne Nagel in the presence of Zucco and Strange, it would be completely unnoticeable. Strange, who continues for two years at the Frankenstein Unuiversal Monster, makes Lenny's impression of "Of Mice and Men," it seems. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (of 4)
