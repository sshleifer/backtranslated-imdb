"Apartment Complex" is a comic comedy filled with a comic strip created for a real story that talks to young psychologists (Lowe) who works to manage an apartment complex and gets into a mystery of murder ... you can call it. This low time does not contain any tension, no excitement, no drama, no action, little funny moments, nudity and almost no romance. "Complex of apartments" is a satisfactory, forgotten junk food only for the poorest couch powders.
