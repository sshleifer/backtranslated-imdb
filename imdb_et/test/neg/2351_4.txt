The subspecies are set in Romania, where two American college students Michele (Laura Mae Tate) and Lillian (Michelle McBride) arrive with the help of their local friend Mara (Irina Movila). There they rent the hotel rooms and become curious about the mysterious ruins of a nearby castle, it turns out that there is a powerful and evil vampire named Radu (Anders Hove), who has stolen Bloodstone from his father, King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm). Radu takes pride in three girls and starts drinking Mara & Lillian's blood, meanwhile Michele falls on Stefan (Michael Watson), who is the brother of Radu. Michele & Stefan decide to compete and destroy the evil world of Radu ... <br /> <br /> The film led by Ted Nicolaou seems to be highly appreciated among genres, and although it is not terrible, I certainly wouldn't want to. t call it very good and i didn't see anything very excited. The subspecies is a rather slow film, not so much actually happens, and although he tries to stay close to some classic Vampire lore, it is all meaningless about Bloodstone and some of the small monsters that grow up for some reason from Radu's separated fingers. The subspecies could have been a half-decent film, if not so boring, I really don't remember much, good or bad. The characters are fine, but some f dialogs are foolish and there is a scene that threw me near the start when the girls are ruins of the castle and one says they have to go because it gets dark, but it's still clear in the middle of the day and very light. There is also a scene where one of the American girls finds a coffin that is not in the hotel attic, and what really doesn't seem to bother her, I'm not funny, but there is some lady whose house I was in the coffin in my attic I would like to watch very, very worried if you know what i mean. I don't think I'd ever look at it again, there's no real danger, the plot is weak, which mixes classic Vampire themes with foolish sub-blocks, and I was clearly all. Not the worst movie, but hardly the best. <br /> <br /> The film looks nice with places and local landscapes, though you feel that the look is more of a budget than the makers who try to try out authenticity. There's not much gore besides decapitation & some broken finger tips. For no apparent reason, the creators cast some average stop-motion animated monsters that really do nothing or are important to this story. Based in Bucharest, Romania, output values ​​are better and better than many later band products. The actors are not big, as many of them have chosen par performances, while the regular Angus Scrimm genre has a small cube at the beginning. There is sometimes a bit of style, with some scenes that resemble the original Nosferate (1922), especially the one showing Radu's shadow that rises down the stairs when his long claws like nails stand out. <br /> <br /> A subspecies is a movie that many seem to be for reasons I don't see, I thought it was at best average and quite boring. Bloodstone: Subtype II (1993), Bloodlust: Subspecies III (1994), Subspecies 4: Bloodstorm (1998) and Spin0off Film Vampire Journals (1997).
