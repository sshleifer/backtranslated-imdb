American Graffiti is one of the best films ever made. I've seen it at least 30 times and I felt it every time I see it. (I graduated from high school in 1962.) <br /> <br /> Still, American American Graffiti has ever been one of the worst films ever made. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe as someone who's involved. this terrible sequel was related to the great original film. The part of the Vietnamese movie was extremely inaccurate. (I serve in Vietnam for 18 months in the 101-member airspace.) <br /> <br /> There was nothing useful about the film in any way. <br /> <br /> If somebody wants to take the incident to the big movies, American American Graffiti would be the best example of what might go wrong.
