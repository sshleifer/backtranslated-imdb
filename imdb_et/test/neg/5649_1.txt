What more can be added? This is undoubtedly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Dreadful action, drip-script, annoying slow pace - even visible microphones hanging from the top of the screen. I could go ahead, but I really didn't bother. I looked at it 90 minutes before the feeling of losing to live became too big for me. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the first set of comments and votes was from people involved in advertising. insult to British filmmaking. <br /> <br /> And worst of all, I had to buy this letter on Sunday to get it :-) The only reason why the DVD has not been moved to the wheels now is that it is now a proud place for Top 10 of the worst movies in the collection. <br /> <br /> Be sure to avoid it.
