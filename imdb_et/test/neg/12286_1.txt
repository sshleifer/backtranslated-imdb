Adventures in the city of Dinosaur, although a creative idea, was an amazingly frightening attempt to film. It is interesting to have a TV and suck into the new world. Three teenagers who are obsessive semi-animated with dinosaurs are not. Don't waste time or brain power to see this loser. I don't even let my kids watch it.
