Based on a great novel by Dean Koontz's followers, this is an extremely horrible movie that no one should see. Not from the "Running Man", I've seen a book that has been recognized so far. However, the difference is that the movie "Running Man" was still enjoyable as a fun action movie loaded with millions of million sentences. This movie? No, something far from amusing. In fact, if you love this book, I hate this bastardization even more. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING ** Includes spoilers ** Rightio, I'll tell you basically the story here almost completely. Why? Because you, dear reader, do not have to suffer under this abomination? This is good for me because I like to look at the mess. Because I like to complain about * tty things. Now this is a nasty thing: this film revolves around the boy and his mother, who flee from the government and a mutant-monkey-creature-soldier who fled from a destroyed government genetics laboratory with a super-smart golden retriever called "Furface" by a "hero". Groan ?? Believe me, in the novel, this story shook. I'll go to it later. Anyway, the hero is no one else who dreams of a kid boy Corey Haim. Oh, I'm not kidding. Our hero runs around, a striking voice and everything, trying to convince his mother to help this dog save the "evil government" that gave birth to him and made him genetically ultra-smart. The monkey creature, sometimes called "Oxcom" (God helps us), is also the genetic search for the creature created as the final fighter of the future battlefield. Michael Ironside (Total Recall, Starship Troopers? Always playing badass) is also in this movie, and no, I couldn't figure out how someone convinced him that it would be a good idea. He plays a non-governmental representative with the NSO who will share the dog and the creature. Oh yes, there are some spoilers here: It is also the creation of the government and the same lab, and, it seems, most of the film is going to jab and kill people? And all this killing is done by the monkeys. soldier. Instead of a rockin 'kick-ass, a horrible horror movie, we have a rectal haemorrhage of teenager's horror. Dog intelligence is discovered all-too-comfortably and is believed more easily than we believe that images can be seen in appearance. Breakdown !! <br /> <br /> Change from a book to a movie: <br /> <br /> - Travis has turned from person to boy. <br /> <br /> - Man's love for interest in the book (Nora) is now his mother, and his entire depth and character growth have disappeared completely. <br /> <br /> Black Johnson, a black man, is now white Mr. Ironside. This is important because character strength is built on his legacy in the book. <br /> <br /> - The relationship between the two creatures completely ignored, Lem now kills a boy who was originally his best friend. <br /> <br /> - One principle of the book is now completely absent, "immortal" that heroes heroes - maybe it should be Ironside, but why is anyone else? <br /> <br /> - Dog never gets the name Einstein in the movie. <br /> <br /> - No part of the book was in high school, at least nothing that had a strong impact. br /> <br /> - puts a few days, rather a month, like a book, at an unrealistic pace. <br /> <br /> - Corey Haim's girlfriend in the movie appeared in no more than two chapters of the book - and they never came together in the book. <br /> <br /> - Lem Johnson's character is no longer cool; Instead, he is a complete asshole that tempts his way through people. <br /> <br /> - Hero Travis was part of the Delta Force (a military segment specializing in terrorist hunting), his father who has never been seen. film was part of this group. <br /> <br /> Business information that has now been completely absent from the monster. <br /> <br /> - Soviet and Mobi tickets are completely out of the story. <br /> <br /> - These are just the most unpleasant changes and the one I remember from hand (and the day later). <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br Finally, after 90 minutes of pain and mental distress, the film ended. <br /> <br /> No harm, no help: <br /> <br /> -Michael Ironside usually likes me. <br /> <br /> - The dog is still quite pleasant. <br /> <br /> - A little "80's" title screen. <br /> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> - Okay, writing one is extremely terrible. <br /> <br /> - The direction is so semi-confident that anyone who watches the movie will feel like everyone is involved with it. <br /> <br /> - Action is dirty and weak, especially Corey Haim. <br /> <br /> - Lose, weak and desolate story. <br /> - The monster just seems pathetic, that is, when we are allowed to see a bloody thing. Its head is gigantic too big, yellow eyes that were so much part of the book, can be seen for no more than two seconds. Instead of a lean, powerful, fast, intelligent killing machine, we have some jackass that is forced upon us by a ugly monkey costume. <br /> <br /> - Developing a completely non-existent character. <br /> <br /> - Even violence and gore are done badly, f * ck, it should be a HORROR movie !! Usually, violence is at least well done! <br /> <br /> Ugly: <br /> <br /> - The idea that Dean Koontz got out of his brilliant novel to get this dirty f * cking piece including * t dangerously near me and everyone close to vomiting . Such movies are worse (headache if this idea may seem), but so far only for me, "Alien vs Predator" is greater travesty and more painful disappointment. <br /> <br /> A memorable scene: End credit viewing begins. <br /> <br /> By: 3/10 story: 4/10 (the novel was really good, it's just terrible) Atmosphere: 5/10 Movie art: 4/10 character development: 1/10 special effects / make-up : 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 0/10 Violence / Pure: 4/10 Music: 5/10 Direction: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I would recommend someone to watch this movie, except for a few extreme frightening fear fans, and only if you haven't read the novel. Instead, I would recommend that anyone who is interested in it should be completely prevented and bought / checked / borrowed. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
