As a child of the 80s, like so many other reviewers here, I hated the original V and V battles. I own both a VHS and never a video camera to watch. I remember that this short life series doesn't like it, but I didn't remember why, so I borrowed the first album. After the third episode, I had a memory update. It's terrible. Writing is terrible. It's not even FUN. They had a lot of work here, but it seemed that they just didn't know what to do to make it "Life Days with Lizard Aliens". How cool and potential is Elizabeth Starchild's concept? All they could think of is to grow her into a tiny and boring teenager to compete romantic with her mother? Marc Singer appeared to be less embarrassing in Beastmaster II than he did when he was trapped in this driveway. The point is, are you one of the youngest people who have just discovered V or one of our older sci-fi fans who are looking to discover some old amusements, save yourself and FOLLOW THIS!
