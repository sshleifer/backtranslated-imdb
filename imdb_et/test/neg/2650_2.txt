To criticize one of the critics for reviewing a movie, "it started slowly and stopped." The plot was credible enough (although some of the characters' actions seemed very, very RANDOM), the script was pretty well written (because the dialogue didn't seem to be forced), but everything went too slowly. There were too many breaks between the lines and the way the lines were delivered was not that big. This film was potential, but it blew like a teenager who turns to drugs. My advice? Wait until it appears on your TV before you see it.
