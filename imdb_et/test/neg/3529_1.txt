Hi Y'all, <br /> <br /> I bought this from a DVD in England. You see, I have one of those multi-player players. I thought it would be nice to show a nice movie to my friends. Well, surprise to Amy-Jo Johnson, he's hardly in the movie. Although he is on the cover. It is really hard to imagine how this bad movie was first made. Maybe someone has a trust fund. <br /> <br /> Oh ... It's about vampires living on the beach
