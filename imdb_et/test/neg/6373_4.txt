It was something I was waiting for. The Ultimate Avengers movies had both exceeded my expectations and, as Iron Man has been one of my favorite Marvel characters, I thought that the same production team could do really great things with the Iron Man solo title. But the last film was not satisfactory. I didn't expect them to spend most of the movie, respecting Iron Man's gray guard. The red and golden armor are seen in ten minutes together. Not a big complaint, but not what I was waiting for from ads and box. The worse thing was the story, actors and cells shaded by CGI animation for monsters and army armor, which was not convincing. It didn't mix well with cell animation at all. Even on its own, it seems to be sticky and inanimate. Tony Stark's character trail, as it is incredibly slow, is both forced and convincing. I wanted to see this movie because I love Iron Man, but after I was forced to shoot through the film, I wondered if they could have come up with anything that was as good as the Ultimate Avengers movies.
