Returning to Frogtown was a tough movie to follow. Well, I reached this mission and had sat on the shelf for a good time. I wish it was so! First, Sam Hell is not Roddy Piper of course. He replaces a big face, less charisma, and this poor actor is very soft for this part! Sam Hell should be rebellious and awesome. Here he gets stuck three times! What a hero is that? Here another spokesman replaces the spangle. Why didn't we get different characters here? It was stupid! Lou Ferrigno celebrates this film and is not even a hero. Common sense says Lou is the hero of the movie! Bad effect, bad performance and just forgotten movie. Fun when they take pictures of Ninja Turtles 2 with the whole scene of this concert. At least Ninja Turtles 2 was a funny and not a bad movie! I really wanted to go back to Frogtown, but I just shrugged when fighting scenes started. This movie makes turtles 3 gold! Avoid it or you are the one who sings "meaner, greener, talk turtle TV dinner!"
