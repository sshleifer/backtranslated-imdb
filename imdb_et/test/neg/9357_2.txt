I was very disappointed in this movie. Twice I was tempted to go out because the movie segments were so demoralizing and frustrating. There are elements in the film that refer to all living things (pornography, murders, suicide, mischief, hatred, gangs). The graphic nature of the violence of this film was particularly disturbing. Richard Dutcher makes a great service to the LDS Church in depicting the attitudes, commitment, spirituality, and obedience of missionaries, both vague and incomplete. <br /> <br /> My biggest objection to this movie was that it was exactly the opposite of a sensitive film. <br /> <br /> The Dutch army of God was okay. His Brigham City was pretty good. This film was his best in casting, showing and drama. But from the point of view of inspiration or resurrection, it was as terrible as it was. In fact, this film is demoralized that I am sorry. I have lost interest in increasingly supporting the Dutch LDS movie with a ticket purchase.
