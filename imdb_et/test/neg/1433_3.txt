This movie was one of the most boring horror films I've seen for a long time (and I've seen a lot). Personally, I liked that piercing takes all that was original, but not that it was a secret. I couldn't stand as an actor or singer for Dee Snider. It seemed he was trying everything he said to make it memorable for the quote they weren't. I can get free movies and I don't think it's worth it.
