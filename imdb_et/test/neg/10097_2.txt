Eric Roberts "celebrates" this Tommy Lee Thomas debut in a prison movie. He's playing around a corrupt guard. While most people's standards are evil, his character is such a guy who is nice enough to give you supportive wires when you hang the ceiling when he tortures you with "deadly weapon" electrical prods. <br /> <br /> The film has a complex plot of prison corruption that makes no sense. Thomas has Clint Eastwood's eye-catching eyes, Dolph Lundgren's lining, JCVD's ability to act, and the smallest man's body you knew at school, who took steroids after graduating. <br /> <br /> Martin's "Cobra Kai" Kove's career shares this low point with Roberts, it is hard to say in the film whether Kove's character should be drunk for the whole movie, or when Kove came in that way. I couldn't blame him for doing it. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for all involved, this film is "so bad that it's good", which can be fun if you have absolutely nothing better to do.
