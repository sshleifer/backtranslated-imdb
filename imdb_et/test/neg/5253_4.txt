I've heard a lot of things about Beowulf, maybe because I'm from Romania and a good part of the movie was filmed here in my country. And I waited a lot for this movie. Finally, I was disappointed. It's not as terrible as other users said, but it's definitely bad. It's all a monster who kills people in a 6th-century castle and Lambert, who's gonna kill him. Lambert is good because he is in all his roles, but the rest of the characters are sucking and the action is not too good. Perhaps the only thing that could have made this movie, special effects, record, as well as very bad, the monster looks terribly (not scary, but terrible). Oh and another bad thing: music. The film tries and can create the atmosphere of the 6th century. But all the sequences are presented in rock music, which is very bad. I mean, rock is working great in a movie like Charlie's Angels - where it's the perfect way to do it. But here it was a very bad idea. <br /> <br /> Vote: 4 out of 10
