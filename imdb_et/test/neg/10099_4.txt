Enjoy opening credits. They are the best thing about this second-level, but unpleasant timekeeper with satisfying performances like Eric Roberts and Martin Kove. The main part, however, goes to the newcomer Tommy Lee Thomas, who sees this kind of action a little less, but who can still occasionally bring out banty-cock type warfare. For the first time we see her being exposed, sweaty, and dealing with her favorite "beef" activity - cutting wood. After that, he has seven more scenes without his shirt, including one in which he is hung by his wrists and captures electricity with La Mel Gibson's "Lethal Weapon". However, he could use a better script because the way he tells the truth about corruption and violence in prison is never very convincing. There are also millions of dollars that are probably related to this research but never explained. However, there are some advantages. "John Woodrow" secret "John Wilson" is an amusing game in the presidential election, and co-star Jody (Ross) Nolan promises to be a prisoner who at the beginning of his procedure has been hung up and nailed by his wrists. by a tasty guard. One last remark: The low budget of the film is painfully responsible for the lack of "extras". Despite the impressive size of the prison, it seems to keep only about 12 inmates! (Note: The credit at the end is not too useful. Bill Fishback and the young, fair hair who manage Jody Nolan as a punching bag play for the record. Electric shocks for Tommy Lee Thomas are played by Marc Chenail.)
