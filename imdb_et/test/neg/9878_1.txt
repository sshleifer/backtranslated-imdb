*** USE A SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> I was super excited to see friends with blood and chocolate. I couldn't wait because the book is one of my favorites. But as soon as the film started, I couldn't believe how different it was. At first I was like, okay, so both of her parents are dead ... maybe it's okay. But then the rest of the movie came. By the time it was over, I was furious. Nothing was right, but their names and the fact that Vivian fell in love with Aiden. At the end of the book, Gabriel was my favorite of all time ... and then the film goes and turns him into a complete heartless idiot?! The film also showed shippers or werewolves because these hostile, evil creatures were like a book showing them just as they want to keep and keep their packaging. They wouldn't kill people for that fun. <br /> <br /> If they wanted to make a movie as they did, they would have had to give it a different title and name different characters. Because then I would go out and watch it again and buy it, but if I think it's all, it's bad. You couldn't pay me to see it or buy it again.
