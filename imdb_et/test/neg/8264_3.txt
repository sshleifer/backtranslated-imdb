Master's Horror: Sounds in Seattle, where Larry Pearce works as a computer software call center manager, having lost his 6-year-old son Michael (Nicholas Elia) for rare heart disease, he believes he has hypersensitive hearing. Larry hears all ten times, people who write on computer keyboards, people whispering into the room, people touching the floor on the floor, dripping taps, and finally even the people who breathe, become unbearable for Larry because he is constantly bombarded with noise-permeable noise. Finally, Larry decides he has enough and if he can't stop the noise himself, maybe he can listen to himself with the wise meat of the big ... <br /> <br /> This Canadian American co-production was episode 4 from season 2 generally hit and guided by the Horror TV series, written and directed by Brad Anderson. I thought Sounds Like was a definite shortage. The script was based on the story of Mike O'Driscoll and I'm really surprised at the very positive comments he has here on IMDb, at first it would be very difficult for me to even describe it as a horror film and it seems more than a few odd sentimental dramas to the last 5 minutes, when Howard Berger, Gregory Nicotero and KNB boys are actually engaged. Larry has this strange inexplicable ability to amplify sound and noise from the beginning, so that this episode reaches 55 minutes exactly the same type of repetitive designs that endlessly end, although recording an episode is late. It is going quite slowly, and although it is well written, it is not meant to be horribly themed and I'm a little confused about who it is for? <br /> <br /> Director Anderson does it well, but he simply repeats the same things over and over until there is no drop of blood in the last 5 minutes. There is no horror, no fear or tension, no absolute atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's very well done, good value for money and doesn't seem to be a cheap TV program. The action is really very good and it is a disgrace that the story is somewhat limited. <br /> <br /> Sounds As one of the worst masters of horror episodes, many people seem to love it and that's fine, but it's definitely not for me. Another master of horror, another disappointment.
