No idea how it is as high as it is (5.8 at the time of writing), but this movie was totally terrible. The action was not entirely bad, but in fact it was not at all worthwhile and the overall quality was poor. It's obviously a B-film (or C, if one exists) and it looks like it was made at the weekend's friends house or something. Im all for low budget movies and I usually look at any, but it's really very bad. I mean like "The Fanglys" bad. I don't know what else to say but trust it because I've really sat through this terrible terrible movie and I can save you ... Don't bother. Seriously ... Just away.
