I never heard of this movie when it first came out. It must be sunk immediately. : o) I saw it in a cable during a hospital illness, so I barely had enough energy to watch it, not to mention turning the channel. A better choice than a style channel. ; (Filmed locally, this travel document should have been on the travel channel. Recycling of the plot takes place on the ship of the thirties and forties. The pain seems to have been recycled in the fifties. Donald O'Connor, the star of the Musicals and Edward Mulhare as the shark of the card about the main light, plays Walter Matthau still the same part as he did for boys and dolls, or for the orphan, Wiseacre irresponsible gambler and more. With Jack Lemmon he plays his part so straight he can't dance and slip straight during the dance, and as mentioned, Dyan Cannon is great attractive when another scammer sailing with his mother who thinks Walter Elaine Stritch plays Diana's mother, still in the fifties, is the most fun of Brent Spiner as the dominant and brilliant cruise driver, who immediately puts Walter in his bad dancer and spends his time try to be able to unleash that he would pay for his free movement gi he gets his fire. Meanwhile, Jack recalls, meets an attractive woman with a mutual attraction, but Walter is wrong that Jack is a doctor when he was actually a retired department store purchaser. But in the end, two men take a rubber boat to the sea to stay on the plane and everything is fine. No major player seems to be under fifty.
