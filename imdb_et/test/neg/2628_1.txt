Milo is the perfect hanging for Mikey's slip table in 1992, when you really check that both films have the same label! But if you want to watch an incredibly funny movie with no plot ...... there is a movie for you. Operation is terrible and the setback scenes are overwhelmingly confusing. The story of this intimidation is simple Milo Jeeder is a child with serious family problems, his father is an abortion doctor who keeps an unborn jail (NICE!) And was desperate for his own child, he thought the way to bring one of these interrupted children alive and he called him .. ........... MILO !!!!! <br /> <br /> Apart from all the bad deeds, terrible control, annoying Milo's voice and the sound of the clock on his wheel, if you take away all the badness that is still bad, but funny with the film. <br /> <br /> I'll give her a burst of 1 out of ten
