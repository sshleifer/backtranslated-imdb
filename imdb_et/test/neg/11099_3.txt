The film is probably based on the popular French horror novel, Arthur Bernède, since 1927. Not as I heard it before, but Belphégor has been a popular theme before movies and mini-series. The first film was released in 1927 with a novel. Arthur Bernède was a part of the writers who wrote and simultaneously made films and novels. Belphégor is one of his most famous works. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, Sophie Marceau was a promising new European actor to conquer Hollywood. He has now returned to such films. There is nothing wrong with playing French high-quality films because it is the country from which it comes, but this film is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The problem is mainly that the film relies on its special effects to make the film good and scary. Well, horror and special effects have never been a good combination, with some exceptions here and there. It's not like special effects are bad. Especially in the case of the European film, it is just good, but it is simply misplaced because the film gave the feeling that it could have been done without it. It would actually make the movie better and worse, no doubt. <br /> <br /> The film is not simply tense or traceable, as the film also has difficulty in choosing the right approach. Sometimes the film is easy and just less serious, while for others it is clearly a frightening fear film. This is usually the reason why the film does not work at any level. You can say that the movie is even a bit boring. It will definitely end all the way to the end. After a while, you just stop caring for this movie and its story and you start to want to look at something else. <br /> <br /> Editing seems completely out of the question. It uses too many cuts without much style, while fast editing was probably meant to give the film a good, contemporary style. It is also uncommon from time to time as some sequences have changed in the wrong order. <br /> <br /> The music spot is also very annoying, and at times it doesn't even fit the movie, as if it had long since finished the movie. I can't believe that composer Bruno Coulais is an Oscar-appointed composer. The music point is almost as annoying as the sound effects of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is full of characters you just don't care for. It also seems very unlikely that a woman like Sophie Marceau would ever fall for a man like Frédéric Diefenthal. The film also features Julie Christie, which is nice but just doesn't add much to the movie. <br /> <br /> It must be awful. <br /> <br /> 3/10
