Hi, I looked at the first part when it came out, and I don't remember leaving me with such a bad impression as it did. <br /> <br /> First of all, animation is dirty, wood is not worked, there is no nature - I understand that the drawing style was somewhat athletic, but it can be done in the usual Disney finesse ... to see "Tarzan" to see what I'm thinking. If I didn't see the DISNEY logo at first, I wouldn't say it was a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> Second, the plot was more like a PC game style, like a good old search. Not that it was bad, but it didn't have a story that links the viewer with characters and their goals. It was at least convincing. The film was meant for children, but it was childish from time to time. <br /> <br /> Third, music ... I'd say it was wrong, but it just fits the whole scene and animation ... <br /> <br /> I think it was some kind of entertainment in general just a lot of trainee animators, just to fill up the number of Disney movies. Sorry to hear about myself, a big Disney lover ...
