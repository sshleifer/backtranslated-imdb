I think my summary says it all. This MTV-ish response to the classic Candid Camera TV show includes Gen X (or it's Gen Y) that puts the wrong hackers and wears different hats and wigs and lets people in quite extreme, though often not very interesting situations. Example: Kennedy has a guy who calls his parents a "wedding". Kennedy is the bride that is made in a full bridal dress and long wig. "Nali" is that parents realize immediately that their son is marrying a man who claims he has no "bits and pieces" anymore. The problem is that this scenario goes too long, probably for time. And Kennedy is about as funny as dead cod under the sun. Candid Camera would have run three or four scenarios at a time when Kennedy took it, running around, constantly asking "Do I look at fat?" I know the show wasn't for me. It was made for 12-year-old pinheads who think JACKASS is the height of comedy today. Let them laugh. God thanked that the show was short-lived.
