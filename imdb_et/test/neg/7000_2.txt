1st Review 21/21/2001 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Emmanuel Itier): A pretty much worthless thriller that spends more time pulling us into sexual meetings with and without "Amber Smith". It tries to tell the story around the sex elements, but as usual with this type of film, it is not done very well. I was so bored about the movie that I really ended up getting over it. The video version I watched was called "Tell Me No Lies".
