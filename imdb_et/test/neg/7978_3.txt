Geesh, I've never ever thought I'd write the four words above. But in fact, he is the high point of this small fragment. <br /> <br /> Since the film was packed when I rented it, it is probably a comedy about a woman who has been kidnapped but has no medicine that keeps her stable. It sounded like a cute concept. Over the years, everything we've seen about Spelling, such as Donna Martin in 90210, and the endless parade of inanimate TV movies. It sounded like his chance to stretch a bit and, given his TV success and his rich father, he had no financial reason to make this film, I thought he took it because it must be a small false one. <br /> <br /> Wrong. <br /> <br /> Instead, the spell is small and a bit of a mentally unbalanced victim is just one of several stories. If he is not on the screen, the film crawls so badly that I could swear that it was longer than 85 minutes that were listed on the tape. It would have worked so much better if Spelling's story had dominated and it would have become a romantic comedy with her and Phil, the least irritating kidnapper.
