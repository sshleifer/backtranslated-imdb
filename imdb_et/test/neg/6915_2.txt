There's not much to do in this movie. This is probably the longest 65 minutes I've ever spent watching a movie. The effects of make-up on a pianist with Makromeglia are pretty good, but that's the only thing that keeps it from price 1. The medical assistant goes through the passivity of extreme mood disorders to hysteria in seconds, and then seems to forget where he was next scene. The director created a lot of the right ingredients for the crazy doctor's film, but somehow I forgot the story to hang them on. If you don't know anyone about cast or team members, I wouldn't even recommend it.
