Michel Soavi's mixed art zombie film Dellamorte Dellamore plays Rupert Everett in the tomb of Francesco, where the dead are not long buried. Thanks to his simple assistant Gnagh, Francesco's cemetery is dealing with a zombie problem, either by shooting a dwarf or by pushing his skull. <br /> <br /> But soon after she is a mysterious widow. One of his recent conquests, Francesco finds himself a busier than ever before? <br /> <br /> Having collected some particularly favorable comments from some of IMDb's more detained horror officianads, I decided to see what the noise was. I've just finished watching the movie and I can honestly say I'm not disappointed with the horror movie for a long time. <br /> <br /> With its harsh, cluttered pseudo-philosophical drawings and extremely unpleasant power from leading man Everett, Dellamorte Dellamore is an irritating and tiring mess that even some splattery gore (courtesy of Sergio Stivaletti) and welcome nudity (busty Anna Fialchi) can't be saved. I am sorry to understand the depth of the in-depth analysis and discussion that this pretentious drift has received from its erroneous fans.
