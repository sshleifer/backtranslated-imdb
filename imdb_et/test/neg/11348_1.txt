I just finished one episode (S1- # 5 boy in the bush), so maybe my review is not very fair. <br /> <br /> Based on this episode, this is a very poor version of the CSI; The protagonist Dr Dr, whatever his name is, is so fake that it really hurts. I didn't want to add him to the play: <br /> <br /> Another wounding thing is David Boreanaz, who is an "Angel" celebrity, a good actor, doing a good job, but wasting fear. this woman's idiotic behavior. <br /> <br /> Supporting casting is OK, but everything is destroyed thanks to Emily Deschanel's stupid behavior. it appears in the filmography of some potential talents. <br /> <br /> This woman is really at least in this episode. But on the basis of this one view, I do not even invest in looking at it, even when it is shown on the elevator screen.
