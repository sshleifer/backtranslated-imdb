seriously, if i wanted to make a movie that makes nonsense meaningless, never and having lesbian scenes as the only high point, I could have been. <br /> <br /> David Lynch is the worst thing like this movie. Someone could have made a better movie with at least some answers and the story was not so slow and long-lasting. The story doesn't mean anything but credit at the end. what a waste of time. I'll never get those 147 minutes back from my life and hope others can learn from my mistake.
