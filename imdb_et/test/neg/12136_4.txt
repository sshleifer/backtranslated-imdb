Can someone please help me out to miss the last moments of watching and I don't want to pay money to see the whole movie again. I just got where they are in the train, and he says, "What's with this drink now?" and smiling. what happens after that? is there more dialogue or action? will it not stop there? I was a little bored in the movie and I hoped it would improve. I love Kristen Scott Thomas, does anyone remember the UK TV series where he was about a nun? I want to know the name. Sean Penn was a great Madonna to eat her heart! everyone else is actually a little predictable about the movie, it was a "local star". ended up as a surprise, I thought he had burned his boats ..... if you are a fan of what some stars are watching.
