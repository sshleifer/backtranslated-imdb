Try it the way I can, just couldn't get into it. Maybe it was bloated tones; maybe it was an outstretched approach - I'm not quite sure, but although it wasn't a "bad" movie, I didn't find it to be a very effective "movie" (words that I understand it is so much more arbitrary than their normal use). <br /> <br /> So here is basically the fact that a number of adolescent deaths cause a small province town to investigate and anxiety that triggers a witch hunt. What does the mysterious, sexy woman who has appeared in the city do to the death of the boys? Is a crazy party woman involved? Is it voodoo? The story is a mixture of drama and horror of crimes, because all the townspeople are all suspects and the bodies still appear as a result of bloody violence. It was, moments ... a boy who walked on a beautiful naked seductress was pretty good and the scene where the fathers won the private hell was a bitter comment (even if the impact itself failed, considering that his skin seemed to peel off like they would with red warm whips). <br /> <br /> My biggest problem was the end. I've already made spoiler tags for this review, but be warned, HERE IS A GREAT SPOILER: I don't believe it. I don't think the priest could convince himself to kill young boys to be sexually conscious without hints of this psychosis, other boys, history or any other personal influence. The end of the movie wasn't really over. Stop spoilers. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Fulci is a big name and I'm more than sure there is an audience there. I must definitely look more at what he has done because it might have been a poor introduction. Most Italian gialloids are still missed, so I look forward to seeing what else this man will be able to write before. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
