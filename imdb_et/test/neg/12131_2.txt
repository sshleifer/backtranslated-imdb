The contribution of water to the cinema world should be searched by telescope and when / if something is found (random and much happiness), it should be analyzed under a microscope. <br /> <br /> And after it has been analyzed, it will be well next to the "totally useless things trash". One atom of this microscope is worth all of his films combined. <br /> <br /> CB is extremely combative and deliberately so. Ordinary JW stuff: comic strip dialog, simplified plot, morally cheerful characters, chewing gum pop, overflowing, etc. Water knows that he can't make a high-quality movie, so he hides a "deliberately chewing film mask" - which supposedly makes him a special "anti-artist." But being in the cinema world is often a talent that's just that what Waters hoped - and finally it was. That's it. Charlatans infects the world of cinema and contemporary pop art; it's a plague. <br /> <br /> Maybe we are guilty of John Waters to inspire Baz Luhrman to do all these terrible foolish turkeys: It's like a virus: one Waters creates five new bad directors and then these five are creating more and so on. Where does it end? What is "Dancer In The Dark"?
