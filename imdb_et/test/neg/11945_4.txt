I am a long-time fan of this original film (Bella Martha / Mostly Martha), and everything that makes this movie look great and enjoyable is missing. There is no slow pace, signs, and style building in small gestures, light and mood dominance, and moving over to dialogue. I don't think the story itself is enough. Martha / Kate is more lonely and Mario / Nick is not a clown. In most cases, things that make one scene big in the original do not work here in your copy. Small changes will eliminate the tension. My opinion is that you should go and look at the original. It deserves subtitle discomfort.
