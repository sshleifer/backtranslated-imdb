Perhaps this is just me, but this film seemed to be a queue rather than a follow-up project as a separate project. Why? When it was filmed (just a few years after the war), most viewers probably knew why Rommel was so famous, why his death was so important to an ally, why he was Hitler's favorite university, but now, 50 years later, it's not so obvious anymore. <br /> <br /> "Desert Fox: Rommel's Story" is a decent war movie, but it's not just somehow explaining how Rommel got his nickname that he did Allied considered him the best overall why their soldiers were afraid of Africa's Corps? That's what we don't have in this movie - we see his fame, his character, the way to treat soldiers and enemies, but that means it's also something we don't know. we also see that Hitler complained about his achievements in Africa, calling him a coward etc. So we don't have a big picture here - it's "Rommel's story", but unfortunately there is no part of "Desert Fox".
