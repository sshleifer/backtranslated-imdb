This movie didn't do it for me, an appealing SNL fan for the past 14 years. The depiction of Jamie Gertz was OK, but there was something around the film itself. The facts in the film are completely skewed. But Merv Griffin gave it out to explain a lot. He was never in SNL and had nothing to do with it. The points in your life when he was in SNL are back. When we see him for the first time in the SNL, walking through the studio Lorne Michaels, the logo on the wall is about 1988-1989, not 1975. And we're talking about cast - who are these people? I've never heard of one of them. Really dissatisfied. This movie shows why TV movies are just such TV movies.
