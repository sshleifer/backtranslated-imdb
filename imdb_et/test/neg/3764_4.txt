It was a real shaker. This early sci-fi flick has nothing like a clean camp. There is so much scientific mambo-jumbo in the dialogue that is ridiculous. Part of the female character played by Massen is just a drawing machine for male characters to make sexist comments throughout the length of the movie. Check it out with your girlfriend to guarantee that it makes her blood. The only good thing is the musical score that builds the moods of the film competently. The peculiarities are relatively raw, but not bad considering the vintage of the film. Leading some good B-letters is not too bad. But the rows they have given must give them a big challenge. The challenge is not to laugh at their heads.
