Well It was a complete celluloid waste. The preview was promising, but after watching the movie, it seemed that the preview * was the whole movie. No plot, with a clear company, just some misplaced intercourse. The director seems to have tried to create an atmosphere of mystery and fear, but there are still gaps. Why drugs? Why Number 11.11? (Btw. When Sarah enters the library, at 11.14) What is the connection with the murder of the parents? What is the role of this Rayden woman? Is he one of the children or not? Who are these kids anyway. There's a lot of material that is around to create the ultimate cult film, such as "Apples", but the director simply leaves them on the floor without the story being shot. Even the "Blairwitch Project" was more frightening than it was. All the gaps that you hope to accomplish, such as "Butterfly Effect", will remain open when credit starts running. OK. Off to next movie ...
