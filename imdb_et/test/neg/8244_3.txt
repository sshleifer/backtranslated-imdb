Oh, what the hell, I'm revealing the secret: this movie smells! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some fun dinosaur effects that were probably very exciting by then. Now they don't cut it, but they're not terrible. They are just good enough to tolerate without being able to laugh. So they just sit there and I sit watching it, not laughing, not excited, just, well, bored. It stinks! <br /> <br /> When I use my Jay Sherman for a while, the movie really is. The box allows cowboy dinosaurs and in a very general sense it offers. Boys dressed like cowboys are fighting a few big dinosaurs. But in fact, these boys are siblings and the hero is the loser (more of it later) and the dinosaurs are hardly scary. The plot is an entertainer and it doesn't make much technical sense to laugh. It's all just gray and more blissful. <br /> <br /> After some terrible nightmare (one and a half color filmed I called it), we get a plot that includes some people doing things. That's what I got. Oh, and they're in Mexico at the turn of the century, so they dress at least like cowboys, even if they don't. <br /> <br /> So many of the people I think were human, they go to the desert and they stumble upon these dinosaurs (if they find a miniature horse ... I don't know, let's go on). Then, in the final act, the film breaks down into a truly disgraceful King Kong ripoff. Then I had lost my will to even keep my eyes on television and I fell into consciousness and out of it. <br /> <br /> "The Hero" plays the boy under the monkey planet who played the part of Charlton Heston when Heston decided he didn't want to be a sequel. He was chosen as the reason, shocked by the shock, he looks exactly like Heston. That's all he's done with him. I was really upset when he was the hero of the movie because he does everything, is a glowing, elbow, bag in a chick movie (Who is called TJ ... unfortunately he is not a prostitute or finally the origin of the name has appeared). Meanwhile, his friend kills all dinosaurs, saves the day several times and what does he get for that? Don't recognize, nothing! And he dies, sacrificing himself for his friends! They won't wait for him even when they run away! <br /> <br /> Bored, long, slow pace, little enjoyment until the movie decides to copy the King Kong script onto it, it is better to avoid this movie if you don't feel the pain that puts your eye on your eyeball.
