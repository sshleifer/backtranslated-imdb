Surely this is not a good film, but not as bad as some paint it. The nightmare of the wax tells us that a man whose face was hidden by a typical setback scene awakens his revenge on those who are directly responsible and indirectly responsible for the loss of his life - a particularly beautiful young actor with love and companionship. Cameron Mitchell plays the artist with his typical elegance, although it is limited. In fact, I thought he gave one of his better performances. What does this really mean? Mitchell carries an eye patch, smokes cigarettes indefinitely, carries a bright twill and speaks with his creations. They are not your usual wax mannequins, but people who are still alive, controlled by a serum that makes them lose control over all neurological functions. They become zombies. I thought the assumption here was inventive if nothing else. It has some ridiculous explanations, but it serves a plot. This is a 60's film that is firm with Bud Townsend and the company's psychedelic camera work. Action is mediocre, but Mitchell, Scott Brady and Barry Kroeger make interesting turns. Hollywood's past wax figures have been made very efficiently and most of the location images were very reliable. At the end of the film something is not really real - an example of 60's of cultural music or the end of a scriptwriter's creativity. I'm in banking. Despite many mistakes, I enjoyed the movie. The opening scene that showed the actress was stunned was done effectively, as was the police pursuit on the beach.
