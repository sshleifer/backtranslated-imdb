If something like this is worse, I don't want to see it. I remember so many amazing things - the nun fell out of the coffin to make a little blonde boy; a little blond boy himself adored; Many stock footage in Peru is the perfect vacation spot. Shining Path and Alberto Fujimori should break all the ideas that Peru is a vacation paradise. The whole thing is so terrible that Plan 9 or even the Robot Monster is quite aesthetic. This movie should bombard and print and bombard it again.
