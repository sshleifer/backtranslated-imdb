In summer, the attraction line for this attraction is really long because it is a water ride. It is very well-themed, but many ride artifacts seem to have failed. In general, driving is not worth it if you have to wait almost 2 hours. in order. The end result is exciting, but the whole race itself could have been better. The creators of Indiana Jones could try. these Hollywood designers helped. It also breaks the race several times and causes others to wait longer. It is also very unpleasant if they only have one ferry that is open and not two as they should. During Halloween nightmares you drive in the dark and it's exciting if it's your first time, but if it's not, don't worry about the four-hour route.
