It was terrible and simple. What was their message? Where was this movie? It contains all the components of a Class B movie. Imaginable story is bad, which has a slow history of cheese. Previously, I watch a movie I've already seen like Goodfellas, the Bronx story, even fat. There are no pleasant characters. Finally, you want everyone to die already. Save 2 hours of your life and skip it.
