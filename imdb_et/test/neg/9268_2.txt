This is probably the most ridiculous mess I ever watched. Three unrelated stories of totally stupid and random things sometimes break with the eternal monologue of a bus and an eternal person. Christ knows why so many people participated in it. Highlights: The green refrigerator man who read Jean-Paul Sartre, slob mans dinner guests and his horse products, RIDICULOUSLY unreasonable woman in the third short, who suspected that he was interested in his overall activities, Fans. <br /> <br /> I probably have to use a few more lines so you can mention some stupid movie stuff. The first film includes a man who drives a car and follows absolutely no apparent reason for his unreasonable demands. The only way you look at this movie is when you were blind and had your own personality and other weakening defects in your brain. It is a kind of funny ironic way, but also very tiring, as it is forced to chew on a painted carpet for a very long time.
