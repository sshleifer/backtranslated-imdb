This film tries to be artistic, but it is as pure as the first attempt of a film school student. The next one is trying to be erotic, but it's as clumsy as the virgin's first attempt. Finally, it is trying to be cruel and thrilling, but aside from Kinski's appearance, which is powerful but strikingly in the middle of the amateur melodrama - it is about as captivating as your hand around a damp noodle (which is a suitable metaphor, considering how erotic that film is). It includes a mouth scene, which is even a cameraman, as the ChloÃ« Sevigny career burial performance by The Brown Bunny. Run away if you have a chance. Go to Victoria's Secret Lingerie Catalog - it's more artistic and erotic than this.
