It has been a long time since I have been in an art house theater and I went to see Douches Froide because it has received such great comments in papers. <br /> <br /> The thing is in this movie, whether it's a head or a tail, but only a part of the time associated with the lives of three main characters. <br /> <br /> When it started, I already knew it was going to be a long time, but sometimes things could be better, in this case not. There is no real character development or interconnection between players. You start in the middle of the situation, maybe there is a girlfriend and then there is a boy with whom he keeps friends to fulfill his sporting aspirations, but how they are quite strange because they are "just put together" so it seems. <br /> <br /> Maybe they have sex with each other, at least one you see. Feeling guilty or jealousy with another boy is hardly noticeable, and all I can think of during the film was "when are they sex again?" And if you think it is completely crazy. Because it basically means that nothing is really worth it, but the three are doing it, and at least for me it makes a very dark film, leave it clear and save your money (my ?? 7.50 is wasted)), better art movies than that. <br /> <br /> I give the star three stars, one of them.
