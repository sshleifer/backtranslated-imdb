Get Shorty was a great movie. It was funny and had a perfect balance between very comic behavior and a serious plot of land. Be Cool is like some cheap knock-offs who are trying to move on. John Travolta, as Chili Palmer seems to have forgotten, was once a mob. He's playing it like he's a boring film, not a boring movie that used to be Shylock. Uma Thurman, the great in almost every role he played, comes out as tense and confusing. Should he be cruel or wise? The chemistry between him and Travolta is tense and uncomfortable. In addition, just add the cliché of each movie you mean. Well-educated rap producer Cedric the Entertainer, intuitive gangster wannabe Andre 3000, heart, soul and a good set of tubes for Christina Milian, a gorgeous black guy Wannabe Vince Vaughnis and a stupid celebrity celebrity Stephen Tyler. The only funny part was Rock, who proves his new cliché as gay samoana bodyguard actor. Probably the biggest crime is the plot: it does not make any event. Get Shorty was smart when Chili played one group against another and came out. But this movie tries to do it with about a million different characters. And even Chili doesn't know what's going on. Warn Get Shorty fans: this is a very different, very worse movie.
