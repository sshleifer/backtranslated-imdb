Sir Seitzman, or whatever I have to be responsible for Mr Seitzman, who does not judge Rabid Wolverines with the right fate to eat, <br /> <br /> I don't know you and cannot comment on your character; Everything I know you give to charities and helps small older women cross the street. However, I must insist that you never write another scenario for your general well-being when you live. Put the pen down, step away from your laptop! <br /> <br /> If you refuse to submit a wounded brain, I've watched a movie or two in my life, and I believe you'll find my helper helpful: <br /> <br /> 1. Don't add love scenes where The name of the boy boys overpowered in the US is the body parts of their girlfriends. If you need to fill in such a scene, do not name "New York" and "New Jersey" breasts; this causes unnecessary speculation about which cities are located in the nipples. It is also almost foolish and annoying. <br /> <br /> 2. Don't rely solely on John Hughes films to strengthen class differences. <br /> <br /> 3. Don't let the audience over the candles. Yes, yes, Kelley and Sam stand out, and it cleans them from their care. We get it. Yes, roses continue to bloom in the greenhouse of Kelley's dead mother, although every other plant has begun to rot. This is the symbol of their love. It is also very painful when it is applied to the back of our heads through a blunt-force trauma. For God's love, Mr Seitzman, we get it. We all get it all over the country. Amish people, hearing difficulties, unborn children - we all get it. <br /> <br /> 4. Don't require participants to mime sequences. Never. No, never. <br /> <br /> 5. Did you mention that you should ease the symbolism? Because the audience can draw in parallel between building a restaurant and creating a relationship between Kelley and Sami without help. Really. We get it. <br /> <br /> 6. Go through your script and complete the following lines and similar lines: "I don't know what we are." "I do not want to lose you." "He's like others!" (And the consequence, "Dad, you don't even know him!") <br /> <br /> 7. Yeah, he's in the sky, running around. We get it. <br /> <br /> 8. And in other news, we get it. <br /> <br /> I've seen dozens of terrible movies in my life; I never waited for my art, and I would have just left the theater, but the elephant painted on his side with the words "DOOMED LOVE" fell from the sky and fixed me on my seat. Finally, your writing bites, you owe me ten dollars and I hate you.
