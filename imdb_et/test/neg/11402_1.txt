One of the movies I just don't want to see. I got this in the hidden preview, but fucking it was very bad! At the end of the movie (I'm still surprised to watch the whole movie ..) I wondered why I watched the movie. <br /> <br /> Here in the Netherlands, the writer of this film (filmed in Giphart's book) thought it was very bad and was disappointed that his film came out. The next time he wants to play a role in choosing people.
