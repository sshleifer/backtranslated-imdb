Sometimes things should not just be done. And while the design seemed good enough, it only continued to frighten the audience. But the problem is that it is not yet another saw movie. That's just so bad you want to get Jason Voorhees punished. And he usually flopped in his experiments. True, when they say to their team, they should be real players on all topics at first, somewhat funny. It and the fun of "Radio" and "IPod". <br /> <br /> In general, I can't review this movie again. Even Trantaia is worth more. "D-"
