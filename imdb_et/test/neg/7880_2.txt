I'm sick with the "open mind" argument. I am generally quite open, but such a line is basically done by people who enjoy things that should not be "enjoyed". You know what's there, so many people are disgusting about it. And just because there is no one out there, it doesn't do less. After all, the reason is disgust and no "open mind" or "suppression of the envelope" should lose that feeling. Otherwise, we are no better than meaningless living entities. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. Another argument is that this film puts women in roles that are usually reserved for men, so men don't like it. But just because it proves to be more men than otherwise it would be great. Maybe the men in the film industry should not be turned on, but should women do that? Maybe if you don't like movies, TV, and entertainment that have so much sexual objectivity in women, so much violence, don't look at them. <br /> <br /> And if you're a director, don't make them. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, someone will ask for a day's open mind if what happened in this "movie" takes place in real life. <br /> <br /> Heck, some people seem to like it so much.
