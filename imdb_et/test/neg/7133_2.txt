People can say I'm tough, but I can't help. The film is so bad that I was completely stunned. The first movie was bad enough when you asked me. It was very exaggerated and stupid, but, despite the scary scenes, it is a serious ass-stupid story. They went deep into the past of Kayako and found that he had a mother (who speaks English fluently) who was exorbitant and "fed" by the evil spirits of his daughter. Stupid? Yeap. OK, it started with Kayako, who was a common housewife with a somewhat like-minded person who died himself. This part is still OK. Because of this anger, he became a spirit of revenge, killing everyone who enters his house. Possible. Now his killings began to stretch a little, where he actually had the opportunity to travel all over Tokyo just to stop the victims. (His victims traveled, didn't they?) It hit me hard. Now that the ghost could actually do something like traveling across the country without paying the public transport fare, I wouldn't want to. Ask someone to kill me, then * snorts *. And crowning things, the ghost, once portrayed as a great revenge (Ju-on: The Grudge, which was better than this trash), is now shown as a face that truly enjoys himself and felt that it was his mission to end people. Things became worse (viewer for me) when the ghost came in large hair layers. I'm thinking, ??? If the ghost had such a power, I seriously think it is one. I never liked movies that portray ghosts as MONSTERS because they're not. The overall results are simply bad. Like The Grudge 2. With better style and less exaggeration, this show would have been better
