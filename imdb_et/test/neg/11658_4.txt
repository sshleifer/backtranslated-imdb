This movie looked like he was in a hurry for some reason. Definitely not a well made film. So incredible. The scenes where President (Holbrook) was walking downtown and people were a farce. In such a situation in real life, the public would not be able to be 30 meters from the president. If it wasn't for blood and contempt, it was shot like a TV movie. It could have been decent if it was done differently. Holbrook's (President's) talents in this film were never understood. Shatner's behavior is fine. The production values ​​of this film leave much to be desired. In general, I think most people would be better off if they didn't waste time watching this thing.
