In 1984, Karate Kid had a charm, even if it was a bit more than a poor man's Rocky. Unfortunately, producer Jerry Weintraub was unable to understand that it was best to leave the scene where it was finished and convinced that Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita were trying to make the film trilogy. Part III was the final low in the franchise, but somebody has to think that the series still has some potential. What other explanation could be the existence of the next Karate child? <br /> <br /> Wait a minute. Next? Yes, Macchio has gone (at least he was smart enough to finish), and his replacement is Hilary Swank (!), Playing a troubled teenager (what else?) Named Julie Pierce. Now the girl has family problems. She also gets in trouble at school. The school has a sadistic gymnast (Michael Ironside). As it turns out, one of his students is really a nice guy, and Julie falls on him. Naturally, it will go harder than before. He is happy for him to live with his grandfather's older friend Miyag (Morita), who knows how to get back to the bad guys. <br /> <br /> All of these factors are up to seven clich√©s, and it's just a general plot summary - imagine what detailed scenes have to be! The Next Karate Kid is tired from start to finish, a flat and boring idiotic marathon and set. Happily, Swank has to redeem such accidents as Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby, but why did Morita promise to come back? Maybe he got the first Oscar nominee for the first film and was quite enjoyable in the aftermath, but he doesn't have anything to say here - even "wax, wax out" is born dead. Like Ironside, he's a little better than Martin Kove and Thomas Ian Griffith in Part III, but it's hardly a stretch. So, is this picture really terrible? Not exactly. There is one sequence that succeeds in making a strange beauty, but if the best bit of the movie contains a dance group of Asian monks when they listen to pop music for the first time in their lives, it doesn't qualify as a recommendation to see the rest.
