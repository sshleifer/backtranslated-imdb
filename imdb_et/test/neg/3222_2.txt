A great gangster flick with great performances from famous actors with amazing scenes? Well, not this one. <br /> <br /> It is quite amazing to see such a wide selection of well-known actors who have a lot of movies in the film, but it can undoubtedly be one of the worst they may appear. <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot is as if you were expecting your average gangster life stories, nothing new, something that wouldn't be. The way it is said makes the movie longer than it is (if I thought two hours should be almost over, I was quite surprised that only 45 minutes was over). <br /> <br /> Action scenes look much like the 80's TV series A Team. It's just that in the 80's (especially with the A team) these scenes were much more complex than "El Padrino". It is especially fun to see boys pointing their arms into the air and still catching something (not talking about people who take the car behind the doors, which later look like they are beaten). <br /> <br /> action is pretty good for action. You get the same reaction for all that happens (Dolph Lundgren style) or is so superfluous that you might think it is a parody (but unfortunately it isn't). <br /> <br /> My recommendation is to stay away from the movie, any other gangster movie is better than this.
