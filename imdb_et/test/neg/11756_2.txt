This is, in itself, a higher than average movie, but why was this Bog made for it? It is impossible to consider it for yourself, because it is a remake of the 1960s Alfred Hitchcock classic. You can't watch it without the 1960s movie that comes into your consciousness. <br /> <br /> What does "credit" mean? How can we credit something to Van Sandt and his companions, except by deciding to use different players, a little different set and color? <br /> <br /> Anne Heche is attractive but lacks a firm decision by Janet Leigh to be a respectable middle-class woman. And Heche is younger than Leigh, who brought his infertile attempt to marry and settle down, desperate for a 40-year-old woman. And Heche did not design anxiety about how Leigh did. The scene with a CHP officer looking at his car window shows the weakness of his role. In the original, the officer asks, "Is there anything wrong?" Leigh: "Of course not. Am I like something wrong?" The officer hesitated before answering: "Well, frankly, yes." This change has failed because of the simple reason that Heche is not nervous enough. <br /> <br /> The worst change is undoubtedly the replacement of Vince Vaughni with Anthony Perkins. It may not be Vaughni's fault. Who could match Perkins? Perkins are nervous, similar to birds, with long collars, hidden from the externally charming exterior that masks the inner vacuum. His every move (eat candy corn, his adami apple pie) and every speech, a weak laugh, a dry cry, is on the spot. He just can't fix it. Vaughn brings out a short-haired fat guy who was just a Lance Corporal from a US brother. To show his psychosis, he can only make a manic abyss on what is otherwise perfectly normal in Norman's speech and manner. (Unlike the original Norman, Vaughn doesn't even spoil the word "fraud" because it resembles a "phallus".) He could just hang around the motel to wait for his request for a football scholarship to UCLA. > <br /> The direction deserves some comments. I don't see what this story adds when we see Norman masturbating in Anne Heche. I don't admit it. I don't know why it exists, as I don't know why the rest of the movie is there. <br /> <br /> And I think the impression of how much color adds to the visual experience seems to be Van Sant's hitchcock's slightly smaller stuff. Heche gets underwear from all different colors - green, pink, orange and mango? Is it color? If so, what is the color of hell? Do not mind. The point is that in the original, when the travel camera for the first time looks at the Phoenix hotel window, it takes Janet Leigh in bed with a clean white half-lace and a white bra. Later, after he has stolen the money, we see him in his underwear again - this time his slip and bra are black. It's a little thing, but it's Hitch's own. <br /> <br /> In this case, the idea of ​​taking a picture of color may not be bad, except that the original black-and-white imaging was great. The effects of color and bizarre lighting in this version make a normal, boredom and unconsciously malicious mantle look like it belongs to a Las Vegas drill. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, the 1960 movie was more than shocking. I remember seeing it in a car ride in San Diego and looking at the screen when it turned out that the central character was actually the half way of the DEAD movie! Something like never before. <br /> <br /> This murder in the shower, both in the movie, was a big step forward with Robert Bloch's original novel, by the way, where the author writes something like, "Then the murderer came into the bathroom and cut off his head with a knife." I don't. Well, not entirely. Even here, Van Sant's movie gives us too much. There is more blood and more bare meat. And when Hitchcock closed the blood with a bath and dissolved Maria with an empty eye, he slowly pulled the camera back to reveal his face, turning the camera slightly upright to the right vertical, giving the viewer not only a disbelief for murder, but a dizzying disbelief. Van Sant did not tilt his camera to 10 or 20 degrees as Hitchcock did. He practically spins it on his axis. <br /> <br /> It doesn't make it to Hitchcock's bow because it's not. This is the financial looting of Hitchcock material ("Psycho" I, II, III, IV and "Psycho: the early years" and "come to my cabin: Mrs. Bates" revenge "and" hand me "This knife, do you ?: The real story of Norman Bates . ") Reorganizing and Crushing Truly Original Things, Crumbling, If Not Criminal Proceedings, And That's not to talk about many other films, especially French, such as Marcel Brulee and Jeanne Gateau's notorious" ocean of boredom "scenes" La Mere de la Nuitis ". (Maybe it would be better to add that the last sentence is a terrible experiment with a parody of academic critics. And if the chicken intestine grinds corn, it is a" crumenal "act, as they are, more fun than a movie.) <br /> <br /> So who did it? I have to think. Children who are too small to know the original and who do not like black and white movies? Children who hope to see another ordinary movie? Chimpanzees?
