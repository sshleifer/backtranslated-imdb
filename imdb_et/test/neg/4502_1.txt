Having been a fan of Godzilla for years, Gamera was a cheap hit for me to take advantage of the success of the Toho # 1 echo. MONSTER LIFTING was for me (1975) an almost painful viewing experience. <br /> <br /> Last weekend, I attended the annual Godzilla Festival, known as G-FEST, where Carl Craig, one of GAMERA stars, appeared against VIRAS. Of course, these films were. It was one of the fun bad movies. Of course you have to look at it in the right view. In one scene, for example, boy scouts imprisoned an alien on a spaceship, they were able to escape by mixing non-too bright foreigners. When they realize they are deceived, one of them says, "It's funny ... I think these kids were lying to us." Even PLAN NINE OF OUTER SPACE cannot boast of such a dialogue. <br /> <br /> It may not be GODZILLA or even GAMERA 3, but it is a good timer if you look at it in the right sense. <br /> <br /> But if you want top quality entertainment, check out the recently released GAMERA 3. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** 1/2 *****
