Being a fan of the game and watching this movie made me physically vomit! <br /> <br /> It was a terrible movie, although the story was similar to a playground. all the super human soldiers thing. Other than that, Jack Carver, the entire American man, is playing a germ, unless it is some kind of twisted irony, it made me pull in the middle of my television screen with another finger at its beginning. The fact that you can tell your movie in the middle of the middle of the woods is not satisfied because the game is set on a tropical rain forest, while it looks like the director just looked into his window in the morning and went "it's a good forest." <br /> <br /> This is a sign for all managers: If you are planning to make a movie based on a game or book, play it, understand it and ask fans for it ... don't just play it for an hour and assume you know it!
