Greyfriars Bobby is NOT Westie - Bobby was a skye terrier. The highlight of my childhood day trips to Edinburgh was to go to the Bobby Monument. I grew up with the hope of a brave and loyal little dog, as every child in my generation did, and I remember lining my mother outside the cinema - with many other Dundee children and their mothers - to see a wonderful Disney movie. How could a film made on the basis of such a wonderful story be made by Westie for heaven. This is for example the creation of a movie about Robert Burns' life and depicting him as an English language. I say, give Bobby your breed back!
