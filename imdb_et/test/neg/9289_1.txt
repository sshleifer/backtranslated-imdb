Martin Lawrent could be considered a talented person, but these days are long gone. Runteldat shows a man who is trying to play a card of compassion at once, but takes responsibility for it whenever he thinks he will benefit his ego. The sad truth is that on his day of life his best days were behind him: his half-funny show had died in the water after his star trace, and today he is facing a career in voice-acting and horrible movies of the gods <br /> <br /> that this concert movie was not made to give Lawrence's career a further boost after his humiliation, but rather a childish attempt to purge the air, trying to save his life from the miserable life and somehow turn it into something he'd be proud of, from the moment he showed himself "famous". Unfortunately, the concert is nothing more than just talking to Martin, who was trying to be funny, to call sinners, and then to claim that he didn't care about it at all because of the hardcore. The sad truth is that it is a real public embarrassment for Lawrence: the way he grieves a ridiculous laugh, he wants to just slip his lingerie down on the stage, reload the weapon, and just reload it. . There is no real understanding of his activities. Like a childlike title state, Martin tries to make his final moment of truth on his way and fails. It would have been better to wait for E! Instead of a True Hollywood story to start the show and make an idiot a second time. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the saddest thing about this concert movie - or rather the career eulogy - is that Martin hadn't thought about it. What should this film prove? Unfortunately, because his fame was short, he had a flash light before the underwear case and now that the only way he gets to work is piggybacking the output of Will Smith or Pixar. They could also name this tomb "Tombstone" because that's it. Martin Lawrence is just dying on stage and an interesting career. Now? Just a pathetic milestone in history.
