My name is Earl (2005) <br /> <br /> Overview: ...... Because I've seen it. <br /> <br /> It's something else. First, how is it so high? I don't understand that. This "exhibition" is filled to the top by either annoying people, stupid people or just unlikely. "Gags" are harsh. <br /> <br /> I saw an episode where Earl's brother's wife rebelled and died with dead fish. No jokes. It wasn't funny, it's modest. Then he and Earl's extremely stupid brother (and I mean stupid) then had sex. I almost threw it up. <br /> <br /> It must be one of the most desperate attempts in comedy for a long time. Jason Lee is a talented actor, but in this horrible "comedy" role he is helpless. <br /> <br /> Earl is currently in jail for the current season. We hope that it will get to the board just so that this exhibition will come out of its misery. <br /> <br /> The last word: this exhibition would be funny for people who think the man of Larry's cable is funny. For the rest of the world, NO OPPORTUNITY. Avoid like plague.
