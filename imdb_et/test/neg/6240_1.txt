How two major actors can break this kind of spam to filmmakers. My only conclusion is that they and their director believe that every movie they celebrate must just be seen and praised, <br /> <br /> Now for the film - probably the worst "thriller" I've ever seen. Actors showed minimal emotion; the plot was reasonable for a 1/2 hour period (not 91 minutes). The FBI agent was an almost silly parody - his partner was probably buggy and didn't speak one word. Robert Redford's paraphrasing was a villain's pointless piece! The film was pulled out and was meaningless - the only question was whether the hero would die or not. One really strange part of the story - the waiting family seemed to continue for at least several days; the hero and the antihero seemed just one day. <br /> <br /> All in all - a waste of time
