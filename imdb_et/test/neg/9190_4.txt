This film basically tries to portray the heroism of firefighters by turning the whole movie around an American father with a good heart that puts others in front of himself. Now I know that they are trying to show Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) a typical American father who is a firefighter, but as he has nothing interesting that is so forever, so when the movie reaches its peak, there is little or no. emotion. This film basically tries to make the life of a firefighter exciting, but it just gets boring like any other job unless you save lives or property by extinguishing the fire. John Travolta plays the captain of the fire station, but somebody could have played his role and he is a boring film as the rest of the film. A good movie can be that a firefighter is put into heroes because they are firefighters and make the whole scenario an interesting melodrama. <br /> <br /> 4.9 / 10
