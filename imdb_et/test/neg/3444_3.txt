this exhibition disturbs me. it takes a nick in the nest that could be reserved for a fresh prince or George Lopez. even full house and Roseanne. they are all better than home improvement. first off, Mom Jill irritates me so much. she is a hypersensitive baby and i really despise her. brad is a greasy toad and he is also annoying. and the youngest brother, I don't even know his name! I don't notice him at all! This is probably not an actor's mistake; it's probably writers. Tim is just a stupid ass. Though Jill is the REVIEW of my least favorite, I don't like them. the only reason I gave this stupid show is the three stars one star randy. As an average child, he is still an irritating little brother, but an older brother, and I like his fun character. the second letter goes to Al. as a chubby friend, his character is pleasant. other than randy and al, this show sucks.
