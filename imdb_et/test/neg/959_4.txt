An interesting plot, but painfully dull. No script ... no action. For me, this movie is comparable to "Made for TV" type movies. I was happy to stay in the movie without sleeping in my popcorn. I watched this movie with my family. It's safe for your children to watch. (Only one half sex sex) If you want to see a young Meg Ryan ... watch this movie. Very 80 ish. You like this movie if you like a combination of Christmas and depressed people. Or maybe you're like me ... and I have higher standards for acting in movies. But I liked how the movie started and ended! Mark.
