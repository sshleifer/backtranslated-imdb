Being a big fan of Disney, I was very disappointed when I looked at this garbage. The animation was pretty and the backgrounds were amazing, but I believe that good animation does not compensate for a weak script or a weak story. I have to disagree with people who say it is not suitable for children. Yes, there are some deaths in the movie, but it's not death that kids should at least be exposed to? But I ground. The script is full of bad punches and flat jokes ... what I'd expect from most dream movies. The music was unpleasant, morality forced (and forced without any charm), and the characters broke the song in completely inappropriate times. bar irritation). I am a big jungle fan, Aladdin and Emperor's new groove, but this Disney movie was complete and a waste of time ..... don't look at it !!!
