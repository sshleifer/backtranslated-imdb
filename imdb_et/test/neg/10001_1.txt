First of all, I hate those moral rappers who could not act if they had a pistol against their foreheads. All they do is curse and shoot each other and act like a clan version of gangsters. <br /> <br /> The film does not last more than five minutes to explain what is happening before we are in stock. There is no sympathetic character in this movie, except for the homeless boy, who is the only one who has a semicircle. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton and William Sadler are both mountain balls, and Sadler's character is just as villainous as gangsters. I didn't like him right from the start. <br /> <br /> The film is full of meaningless violence and Walter Hills specialty: people who fall through windows where glass is traveling everywhere. There's not a lot of land there, and it's a big problem when you get roots. Everyone dies, except Paxton and the homeless man, and everyone gets what they deserve. <br /> <br /> The only two black guys who can act are the homeless man and the junkie, but they are actors in the profession, not the annoying ugly brain dead rappers. <br /> <br /> Stay away and watch 48 hours 1 and 2. If they have no signs of caring, humor and anything other than real actors.
