WHAT IS VERIFICATION?!?!?! When the sad actor is enormously talented, like Michael Rapaport, who stole our hearts from "Mighty Aphrodite" and fascinated us with "Ill Town" - he has turned to this pathetic level. Writing this sitcom is the crust left on the bottom of the barrel after scraping it. Shame on everyone involved. There is a trend: big filmmakers, who are no longer hot goods, turn to TV - often with catastrophic results (referring to stink rods in CBS and NBC, but ABC has hit "Boston Legal" - hip writing and big nostalgic use Bill Shatner ). The waste of Michael Rapaport in this "All In The Family" is attacking viewers and mostly Michael.
