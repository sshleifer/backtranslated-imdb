First of all, I have to say that I enjoyed the first Underworld movie. I was interesting and curious to learn about vampires and lycans, etc. In this last part of the series (hopefully) I just feel sorry for the vampires being pathetic. At least in the first part, you had tight leather clothes ... now the vampires seem like victims of a bad pest control problem. They look and behave like a naughty white paste. <br /> <br /> Some ideas were clean ... the whole thing with human nobles was interesting. I'm sorry the thing was exhausting. The slave was also possible. <br /> <br /> Other things hit me just as pathetic. Spoilers now. Bird walls that you can jump over a few steps? Enemies who do not attack during the day? Big bad ancient vampires that take the fight for aging and then go away after a few minutes from lycan leaders? Werewolves, who is near your enemies? Lycans, who kidnap the armor ... what? They don't use the axis and the sword or armor! So a vampire leader that he can't take him on almost everyone? Romance is so convincing. <br /> <br /> So I don't recommend this movie if you can't get it online or buy a very cheap movie ticket. Some of the activities are good OK. Certainly, vampires and weapons are interesting. Otherwise, there is a very weak script, which was poorly assembled and uses all kinds of nasty parcels.
