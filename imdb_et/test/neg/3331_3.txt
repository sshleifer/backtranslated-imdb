This extremely low budget monster burns in the center a group of mine inspectors investigating an abandoned gold mine to see if it has been reopened. They get trapped in the trap and find that they are in the mercy of a strange, clinging creature that seems to be bent down by dropping them off one another. The word that was most remembered when I watched this movie was desperate. Script and action are terrible, stop-motion monsters were unintentionally funny, and since most of the film is underground lighting, the visions of a logistic nightmare showed convincingly. But for some reason, for some reason, I felt that this film was not about effort, but perhaps about lack of budget, experience and / or lack of creative inspiration. The whole thing came out as it was a college project or the first amateur film, I have a certain affection for such films, even if they completely abandon the brand. I think I'm saying I'll give him B-tension and D for real results, not insulting bad because some low-budget monster movies I've seen but aren't worth it if you don't have much free time on your hands. I am voting for it 4.
