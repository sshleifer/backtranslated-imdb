"The New Hope of Romanian Cinema" ... if this is a new hope, I really wouldn't want to see such a fruitful cinema (Romanian cinema, that is). Now, seriously, where should I start? 1. Dirty scenario: am I kidding, it is not even plausible to say that this is a great stupidity 2. Direction: in which direction? This film should have at least a psychological tension, because they have decided to make it as uncomfortable as possible. Okay, I testify that Radu Muntean is not Polanski, Hitchcock, Fincher or Lynch (the list could go on), but at least the minimum effort would have been welcome. 3. Language: Oky, I don't understand why (almost) every Romanian director believes that if you make a movie as unhappy and obscene, you have art. I don't mind clear language or poor picture quality if the end result makes it valuable. That is not the case in this case. There is nothing to comment on, because all this movie is said to be thousands of times that the characters are depicted too little to make them memorable, "shocking events" that occur are also ill-illustrated and become more important. This film is based only on self-induced emotions, "we must" leap. Someone was found murdered, so "WE" feel sad, frightened or panicked, someone went through it and so "WE NEED" to know a certain way. It's balanced. Because film is fiction, nothing is real here. So the only real emotions are what you discover when you drive deep into this world (movie, that's it) <br /> <br /> * / * * * * *
