This is an inexpensive film made by Al Adamson - a man who was once the worst filmmaker - perhaps even worse than Ed Wood, Jr. Adamson specializes in extremely low budget horror and leather movies in the 60s, 70s and 80s With headlines such as FIVE BLYY GRAVES, HELL'S BLOODY DEVILS, SATAN'S SADISTS and LASH OF LUST, it is clear that he did not make Shakespeare! All of his films had rotten production values, sensations, gore and amateur actors. <br /> <br /> There are many stocks of BLOOD OF BLOOD here for Adamson actors (like his wife, Regina Carrol, Zandor Vorkov and Angelo Rossitto) and had appeared in Adamson's previous film Dracula VERSUS FRANKENSTEIN, this is fortunate because the previous movie was so terrible and so badly filled at every level that BLIN OF BLOOD can't help but looks great! plot fool (it includes a widespread brain transfer scheme) and works on Z-level, but it's still better than the last movie! <br /> <br /> The only positive thing about this movie is that an aging supportive actress, dwarf Angelo Rossitto was actually better than the usual part - more dialogue and more important role on the plot - and sometimes there is a sense of danger and tension. As for Mrs Carroli, she looks like a stripper and the rest slips through this stupidity. But it is bad enough that watching bad movie fans is good - you just have to see a man's acid-burned man and also a quick gun that seems to be made of old backlights!
