This film has a prerequisite that is good enough for someone to speak and for sure a beginner. "Do you sleep with someone you don't like or don't know that a million dollars?" Although the film had many options, this poor performance makes it a b-class soap opera. The film has a high lead and after the proposal we are really a movie, but then it drops dramatically. The last three quarters of the film are spent by characters who call, complain and regret what they have done! The end was so broken that I had tears! This is very similar to the assumption that "honeymoon in veg" is much better. Look at it.
