It's like the Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters would be reincarnated in Rutger Hauer's body and revenge on the rival's pregnant woman! If you see the obsession of obese Hauer with very pregnant Isabel Glaser (imagine that this competition has a backbone-stabbing), then watch this movie! Seriously, if Hauer is what Iraq's POW looks like in six years' imprisonment, hungry people should go to jail everywhere in Baghdad. In general, Tactical Assault evaluates instead of 2 stars because Mike Mitchell as Hawk is terrible. Mitchell burns the screen as a NATO pilot until his plane is burnt (with an enemy missile), after which the film loses what little was needed to start.
