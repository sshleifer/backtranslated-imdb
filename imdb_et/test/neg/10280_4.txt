I've always wanted to see ELECTRA GLIDE IN SINIS for a very long time. I've always been interesting with a title, a star and a desert, but for some (now quite clear) reason, this movie is not shown on TV, or I happen to be showing it. Well, after watching the DVD, I know why the movie is rarely shown: it's because it's not that good. In fact, I would say it is a lot of confusion. <br /> <br /> SILMA ELECTRA GLIDE was first made by the director and shows. The film is primarily a series of vignettes that have absolutely nothing together. More than a set of short films that have come into contact with each other. The movie can be boiled down: intro (murder); cop and girlfriend together; intro credit; go to the police; crazy man tells the story; the cop finds the dead body; policeman and commander and girlfriend at the bar; chasing; etc. Scenes do not flow together. They are very separate from each other and therefore the characterization is weak, amateurish. A girl with a girlfriend, a scene with hippies, a big scream with John and the chief, were worthy of. I stopped this movie during those (terrible) moments. <br /> <br /> The lack of filmmaker experience is proof of the entire film. Style, like the 1970s, is all over the map. The introductory credit scene makes the film commercial for commercial use. Then he tries to be a friend (Big John and Zipper), then a mystery of murder; then a melodramatic love story; etc. The film does not have to be a specific style to be successful, but I'm afraid the ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is a mess of style. You can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he went with it. <br /> <br /> Film is not a complete disaster. When ELECTRA GLIDE BLUE is almost amateurish in content, its appearance is very (and deceptively) professional. The film is stunning. Every frame is worth the exhibition in the art gallery. Or because the first (and last) timekeeper took part in a music company that deserves an album. The beautiful appearance of the film gives financial products more recognition than it really deserves. Thanks to Robert Blake's example (really badly written character), the film retains a certain reality, although nothing else makes sense. What is remarkable about the film's appearance and composition is that it has been copied and duplicated a million times. Intro credits were reminded of me like TOP GUN, which was made 13 years later. Johnny's dress on the bed, reminded me of American Gigolot. Strangely enough, ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is a very modern feeling for you thanks to the stunning visuals, even if the story and the philosophy behind it are hopelessly outdated. <br /> <br /> So, ELECTRA GLIDE SINIS is, on the one hand, a remarkably underestimated and neglected film, as it probably apparently influenced many future filmmakers. Very few movies can claim that this is achieved and the legendary operator Conrad Hall should take full credit. On the other hand, the EGIB is also forgotten, because the poor characters, the confusing story and the confusing direction, none of which is worth remembering.
