Two years after leaving the small town of Grover, Bendi in contact with Crites, Brad Brown returns to his grandmother for Easter. Meanwhile, Krite's eggs begin to hatch. Because they cause problems in the city, Brown and the townspeople, as well as the creatures that have come to perfection to fight bloodthirsty furbals, before they wipe out the city. <br /> <br /> The original Critters was a small attempt to rob the family's Gremlin. It became a favorite of the cult of video tapes and was successful in ensuring follow-up. This sequel plays fear and changes it over the entire focus comedy. Unfortunately, comedy is both cumbersome and childish. Operation is equal to the rest of the movie. It's just that the movie suffers from a weak script. Visual effects are quite well done. <br /> <br /> Rating: D + Review by M. K. Geist.
