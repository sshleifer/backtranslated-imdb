The Bermuda Triangle that we are talking about on this cellulose waste is a portal to another time and dimension, and it can go through bad extraordinary effects that cause bad participants. <br /> <br /> I just couldn't decide who would be the target audience for this fiction because it would seem impossible for anyone to get even modest. Avoid being even bad enough to be good.
