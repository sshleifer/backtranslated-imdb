LTL is a formal, hopeless comedy enjoyed by sheep that stop and listen when they come into contact with a band playing in a mall. <br /> <br /> I remember that Murray advertises in a CNN show with Larry King's mess, where he said something, "if this movie doesn't hit, I'll stop making movies (or comedies)." He wasn't nearly as jovial as one might think; he had to feel that LTL was a sure fire and that his failure would mean his status as a star that had dropped significantly - hence a sort of ultimatum lively air for his fans to spend his hard earned money on a stupid elephant comedy. (Comedy is a fool, not an elephant ...) Or maybe he just realized during the shooting (or when he saw the last paragraph) what this turkey was, so he desperately tried to convince everyone how much optimism he had of quality. "Look, it's really good!" Actors are prostitutes combined with car dealers. <br /> <br /> LTL is a peculiar project from Comedy School Friends; their motto: "If you ever run out of ideas - or if you have never had any first place - then paste the animal on the ground and inject at least a brightness element". Cuteness = sad substitute for funny gags. The second motto "Friends" was: "Always include meaningless, boring sentimentality," which this film ends up predictably when Murray says quite pathetically: "What they forgot to tell you is that you will never forget an elephant". Maybe not an elephant, but I certainly managed to forget this turkey, which I saw years ago. I was suddenly reminded of it when I saw this scene today on TV (so the same pointless review). <br /> <br /> Murray wastes his talent on this turkey (hidden as an elephant) but he's not nearly as interesting / bad as McConaughey (or the name of that person is written); one might think that M.M. it would be an easy time to play yourself, that is to say, a hick, but he is so painfully uneven and convincing that I can barely look at him to put himself out of such a jackass. It was worthy. To round this nonsense, we have a rather useless role in Garofalo with this generation-X buffer. What's more, all that is in LTL is useless ... <br /> <br /> After being known to be bombarded with LTL, Murray became a "serious actor". What is it with their comedians and their inferiority complex? Is it just getting prizes, i.e. "acknowledging their peers" (read: voices from their colonists)? This lovely piece marked the end of Murray's great and great films, made in the early and mid-90s, such as "Groundhog Day", "Quick Change", "Mad Dog & Glory", "Kingpin", "But Bob? And" Ed Wood " Recently, we have had an immeasurable joy to see him in garbage / environments like "Hamlet", "Lost in Translation" (you don't get from "highly talented copolymers") and "Broken Flowers." Compare these two lots. <br /> < br /> One man described LTL as "funny as a devil." Now that this audience is expecting this audience ... Shopping centers and caravans ...
