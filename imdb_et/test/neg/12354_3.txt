Charlie Chaplin meets open hearings at the Lodestone studio. Rival Ben Turpin arrives in the same studio, probably the comedian of another unemployed! Turpin tries Chaplin's action after the studio head, "Next!" However, Chaplin manages to walk in Turpine. Charlie happily manages jobs as an actor and carpenter. Finally, he can get a big break, but is there a star? <br /> <br /> There are many jokes that include buttocks. The original scene, which includes the Chaplin and Turpini strokes, is a relative highlight. Note that Gloria Swanson is a printing house that is on the far left of the film when it opens. Agnes Ayres also appears. <br /> <br /> *** His new job (2/1/15) Charles Chaplin ~ Charlie Chaplin, Ben Turpin, Charlotte Mineau
