I had great hopes for this film, even though I hadn't read the book. Richard Gere and Diane Lane should be good together. But the film does not support the promise. I was waiting for the symbols deeper and was not there. I have no problem with having only a weekend for love. This can happen. But we never know the characters. I would be more focused on them. The film reminded me of the bridges of Madison County, and this film was much better. I really felt the characters of this movie and there was chemistry between Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep (much more passion) that there was no Gere and Lane. Each of them is a very good actor in his own law. Just not the right movie for them together.
