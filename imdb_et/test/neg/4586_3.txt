Plot: The truck (Kristofferson) fights with the corrupt sheriff (Borgnine), collecting the bands of its co-authors and forming an unstoppable convoy that reaches miles away and will soon create the madness of national media. <br /> <br />: Setting the movie is weak and will be even weaker. It has all the good-no-boy / truck clich√©s without adding anything new to the process. Finally, SMOKEY AND BANDIT make bright and inspired. Kristofferson is a too confident man who can't wear this picture. The character of Borgnine is uncomfortable. At first he looks like a real sheriff shrinking, moving over to a small struggle that starts running the whole thing. Finally, he is being made somewhat more sympathetic and even mysterious with Kristofferson, who doesn't work at all. In both cases, Jackie Gleason is much better for this type of role. The worst part of the film, however, is director Peckinpah's attempt to throw into this stupid action line a "serious message" that does nothing but slow and bomb the process. <br /> <br /> POSITIVE: The only good scene in the whole movie is the sequel to the truck stop restaurant inside. Director Peckinpah makes a funny spin on his brand "slow motion" and the result is fun. Unfortunately, it will slowly start moving the rest of the picture until it finally becomes tiring. McGraw is always a joy to watch, but unfortunately he is given little to say or do. <br /> <br /> BEGINNING: If you've read the summary when you've seen the movie in principle. This movie, based on this film, is pretty good, but the film doesn't give it anything and it should never be done. This is all a very endless thing for such a driver. <br /> <br /> EVALUATION: 3 out of 10.
