This movie happened today in HBO, so I watched it. It was a mistake. I think I watched and watched, though it was a lot like a wreck of a train, terrible, terrible, but somehow you can't just look. shaudenfraud I think! ; ). <br /> <br /> This is a story about a photo shoot on some of the Caribbean islands. Everything is killed one by one. One drink cleans the liquid, one breathes up to the waverunner, one goes over the rock ... so these are not accidents, but for some reason the police have never been called and no one thinks maybe they should "wrap" shoot and go home, not only in respect of the dead, but perhaps in fear of your life. They just continue to shoot because it's the most important thing. Forget dead models, we have a magazine to produce! <br /> <br /> One of the sub-blocks is the owner of the Evil magazine, played by Lee Majors, Rex is his name. He is the most obvious suspect and every time the model is killed, he spins and says, "Well, I can't say it's not good for sales," mooo hoo hoo hoo ha ha ha. The second sub-block is when it turned out that Rex is one of the baby dad's models, only when he learned about the baby, he tried to persuade the girl to stop. <br /> They try to give you the wrong clues and point to some type, called Raule, because he is the only one who has the accent and "sees the horrible". <br /> <br /> Ultimately, but this movie came out years ago, so if you haven't seen it ... ... it was found that one of the women was dead in the pool. The name comes with a Rex weapon, they fight, the gun is burning and now SHE is dead! Although he puts on the floor, he says that the magazine is worth all this bad press. it's all his fault. She can overwrite her magazine. If he is voila! All the dead models come back to life and you find that the whole thing was difficult to get back to Rex. <br /> <br /> Oy! What a ridiculous movie. As someone else said; If you want to see something like this April, Fools Day is much better!
