Of course, Sadie is the worst show I've ever seen, that's a kind of ** and full of **. I didn't find any gags funny or somewhat clever, it was all terrible jokes. <br /> <br /> Wonderful miracles, many character-drawn characters, Charlotte Arnold (Sadie) is such a terrible actor, other characters suck too (Magaret, Rain, Hal). <br /> <br /> The plot is not unique and creative at all, and the show has many predictions. This is one of the worst exhibitions of all time, it shouldn't have been done, the idiots responsible for writing this garbage should shoot (if they didn't already). the season was just a catastrophe, watching the show was too hard, it's terrible.
