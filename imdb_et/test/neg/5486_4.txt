Pedro Almodóvar has now seen quite a few movies, but it should be the most disappointing so far. This film seemed to be pure, which is usually everywhere in his films, and the story simply didn't interest me. This movie has many Almodóvar's ordinary soldiers, so it's not like the lack of screen talent, but this movie seemed more serious than his other films. If this film had a comedy edge, I couldn't find it, and it made a surprisingly weak movie.
