This movie was painfully terrible. Most of the films consisted of people walking in the woods, walking through the woods or dancing in the woods. At least half. Then the two children who discover two "terribly corrupted bodies" in the woods will return to the forest next night for a romantic walk. ????? Time is not consistent. that day, night, day, really really at night, its dark, its black black, its day. All forest scenes will continue until you think you will lose your mind. really bad. The Sheriff discovers five-foot nail printing that is placed in the forest's dirt and thinks that the super large alligator may have learned to stand upright. Really foolish film with no real motivation written. May be entertaining for young children, as an alternative to truly graphic things.
