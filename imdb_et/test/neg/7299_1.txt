My lover and we bought the video "The Roller Blade Seven" from our local video store in the hope of finding a bad movie that would laugh. This movie is not even ridiculous, it is pathetically bad, even worse than Jack Frost 2 and it says something. Script, Drama, Production, Tricks, Sound, Kits, Everything is absolutely terrible. In some places, participants have not even learned their line and are obviously ad-libbing or in one case actually reading these lines and simply repeating them. In the film, after the apocalyptic wheel zone, the film has a film that is obviously composed of about a 45-minute film, many of which have been edited poorly or repeatedly, unlike different camera angles, to make the film longer. It gets very annoying very quickly. There is no point in the plot (this is probably amalgam of two books written by Scott Shawi), not even seven of them, most of them are not grains, they are wearing roller boots and it seems to me that mostly the film is completely sold because there are about 3 minutes of female nudity. The writer and star Scott Shaw are obviously somewhat samurailed, and the whole film has very poor stunts and forms sword struggles that look massively amateur. Nevertheless, his website claims that the film should never be compared to a traditional film, as it draws the limits of contemporary filmmaking. My housekeeper and my whole challenge was to speak and despite my efforts to burn a video file, he decided it might be some kind of ring presentation that needs to be passed on. If you see videos in stores, take it from me! Leave it alone!
