The 80's slow (glam) rock is like 90's of house music or current bands: it's boring and has no ideas or ideals. The only thing that makes a little "cult" today is that it has long been so we can laugh with this stupidity. "Rock Star" is not too bad at all because it has to be one of the most boring films of recent years. <br /> <br /> Chris (Mark Wahlberg) is the singer of the Steel Dragon Honor Band. When he bands out at the same time, the real Steel Dragon singer will be pulled out, he will be the next lead singer. You already know how this will end when Chris loses this sex, drugs and r & r, and forgets his long-term girlfriend / leader Emily (Jennifer Aniston). <br /> <br /> Too much (boring) music packed with this standard formula as an excuse for a movie and should be avoided at all costs. See (overpriced but more fun) the almost famous movie about real people who are playing the real emotions they are dealing with. <br /> <br /> What a stinker. 2/10.
