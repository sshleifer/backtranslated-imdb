OMG, which Disney has recently done ... almost all the new exhibitions suck. The life of the Zachi and Cody suites is pretty good, but other exhibitions like the Cory house, Waverly Place wizards suck and are invisible. <br /> <br /> Of course, Sadie is just stupid and stupid. It's about a teenager named Sadie who loves science and grows up and goes through her everyday life. His friends Margaret and Rain and his older annoying brother Hal. There's everything annoying and stupid. Especially Margaret, who thinks she is the most popular girl in school, and thinks she's pretty pretty ... its just terrible. I hate all seasons of this show, which is terribly terrible (the first season was better). <br /> <br /> If you appreciate your life, you will not see this crap, its painful and stupid
