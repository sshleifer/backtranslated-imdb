I'm sorry to say it's actually one of the worst documentaries I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Because of his name "Darwin's Nightmare", I was expecting a documentary about problems with the Nile perch in Victoria Victoria Lake. <br /> <br /> What I really saw in this documentary is the open accumulation of single stories, most of which are not fish or lake. And for the most part, these almost stories can't be read - it's more like some of the scenes that have no meaningful connection ... <br /> <br /> Why this movie takes time: - shows us unnecessary information Russian Family Families (several minutes is wasted, for example, on the snapshots of the women and girls in their private digital chambers) - mourning the death of a crocodile-bitten African child (as if it hadn't happened without the Nile perch) - Show us about 100 times how the planes land and start at the airport - Shows us strange religious events for several minutes - discussing in detail the life and death of a whore at the airport - Talking to the kids about their mothers, fathers - what they are working on and / or how they died (well, guess what: some died of HIV - who would have thought?) These are just a few examples , I could go to several pages ... <br /> <br /> This movie is totally purposeful and doesn't know what he wants to say. If you have never heard of Africa and do not know that this continent has problems with social / health / HIV / violence / war problems, then this movie may be right for you. If you have not closed your eyes in the last few decades, 90% of what this movie shows is not new to you - and how it is presented here is trying its best to sleep. <br /> <br Maybe my expectations for this movie were high, but I really did not like it, although this is a topic that I generally find interesting. If this film wanted to show how poverty is related to the Nile perch, it would have had to spend some time discussing this issue ...
