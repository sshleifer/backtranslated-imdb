I had sometimes avoided this movie ... because I looked at it as an unnecessary part of a series that was supposed to be just 2 parts. But after reading some of the IMDB observers' relatively favorable reviews ... I spent $ 1.50 and rented it at my local video store. You need me to go further ... when I say .... it was gone from 50. This movie is one of the 10 worst films I've ever seen. First of all ... I realize that nobody wanted to see the 33-year-old Macchio in this movie ..... But why couldn't they read a letter from Miyag or something about Daniel-san ... maybe explained what happened to Daniel ... hell , at least they could have daniel or something to mention. But not ... and already to add a bad script .... they added these foolish monks ... I thought the monks made a silent promise ... I think these frantic monks will not take their promises seriously ... hehehe. The training that the girl went through in the movie picked up and stupid ... and the young men's paramilitary group was a confusing concept to say at least ... it wasn't even a martial arts film. ... she fights with the girl only briefly in the last scene ... and then she didn't even even hit once ... a man who fought for her ... give me a break ... she would have been hit at least once. I think writers and directors thought it would be shocking to see a girl hit by this man. I could go ahead and ... but basically ... I finish saying that the movie was just so bad .... even the girl they chose wasn't nice to watch (she was sorta) butch "looking). ... I can only think of a handful of movies that I have to sit on ... that compares just how bad this flick was ... ........
