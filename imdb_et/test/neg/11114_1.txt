I watched this movie knowing that it would be terrible, but devilish if it didn't break the new and revolutionary land as stools for entertainment. The plot has a deep rise with dull effects and HORRIDs. On this line ... well ... wow there's no way to put this movie down because I think these words are not yet in English. The sad part is that the filmmakers thought they were doing something good. You don't believe in your eyes when you see how many movies they rip, not even trying to hide it. Deep Rising, Alien, Jurassic Park, Predator, Jeepers Creepers are direct scenes / plot devices and the list can continue forever. Unlike all these films, it just goes out of the celluloid. The most unbelievable thing about this movie, besides how he tries to be competent but fails, is that Gimli's freakin-himself is in it. How hell they can afford to John Rhys-Davies, but not the proper effects, writing, actors or sets. Really terrible ... and not bad, that's good.
