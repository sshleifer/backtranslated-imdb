This movie shows you what you can do if you have a camera, a spare color and a cardboard, a toy ship, some friends who acted in a community theater, and a wrong understanding of what can be filmed. The end result is a non-slip timer that you can skip when you don't take it out of a DVD player and throw it first through a window. <br /> <br /> Open Scene (especially as Lee Morgan's "captain") and toy crash rocks before credit is a good indication of what you are using (with all the foams, it seems like this "special effect" was photographed I think that Boyette thought he was saving money, wash the dishes at the same time). The bad cinema seems to be the funny thing about "Harrow's Prison" seems to have inspired (maybe at random) the twist of "Manos: Fate's Hands". Yes, it is the same flat "I was a victim and now I am taking the place of a mad caber". The more irony is that two intuitive, talented filmmakers could make two equally evil, Texas-filmed horror films and get away from it. <br /> <br /> Monotone nerd Russ Harvey is a noble family (why they were big, never pulled out), bored of us when we drop our family line and branch before his ship even runs (we treat it as well) the whole film). Unfortunately, we are not so happy. His family's toy ship breaks in the sack of polystyrene and is washed to shore with its expanded captain and some women who are comfortably placed on the island of the mad county. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the Count will visit the evil spirit who dressed in Blackstone's Magic Kiti dresses will attack him with different dolls (spiders, snakes, bats ... all icky things). Count (William McNulty) moves worse than Shatner and has a remarkably difficult time that keeps a straight face through typical insanity. <br /> <br /> I would also be crazy if I should keep this disaster. The woman is killed immediately by the county's wild dogs and two twitches remain in her servant's hand. The Count blames them as pirates (apparently his worst fears), he captures his caregiver a lot (probably his greatest joy), Fatboy is tortured, there is a woman who is a servant and one who is a sister, a purgatory ally-a-wedding dress County Prison (he digs Nerdy Noble and is the only effective and horrible thing in the movie), a lot of conversation in the dining room table, the blubbery captain kills during a miserable escape (watching the gap between the battle, lion). . . this is a ugly concern for me. I spent most of my time on the back and forth button. <br /> <br /> Anyway, jerk noble and sister will escape and think they will be rescued by three men on the lake lake. yes, we should believe that the lake is the ocean. They do not do it because the hair of the nerd became gray and scares the potential rescuers. Honestly, I think they just took the chance to rob this outrageous movie if they had the chance. They go back to the castle, the sister starts to rot, like the countess (and your belly, by that time), and we finish with these two preparations. . . HARROW DUNGEON !!!! Blech! <br /> <br /> I love old, horrible horror movies, but they must have some entertaining value. I feel this biscuit is even low at a low price of $ 5.99. It would be hard for the Mystery Science Theater to do that. I took a couple of nut experts who claimed that this film had an atmosphere and some horrible moments. Wrong! Avoid this charge at all costs and do not even waste a box if you find it somewhere in the dollar trash. This movie makes Corman's "Terror" like a masterpiece of horror and atmosphere.
