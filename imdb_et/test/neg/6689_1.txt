It was terrible, enchanting and full of worst clich√©s and racial stereotypes. Seeing that Hayden P was trying to "getto", it was painful (hi, one leg in the trouser sweating up and some ribbons downs doing you "with the huts"). Solange Knowles is pretty grim through the film. Most of the configured sequences look like they were filmed in cardboard boxes ... what was the final? And poor Rihanna was just used to allow people to see his "act" that he can't. Simply put, this movie doesn't deserve even one star. Please put it in a tired franchise to rest. Or at least do the following Bring It On IV: Cheerleaders vs. Freddy & Jason.
