I wouldn't call myself a fan of stupidity invented as a great genre, so I may not be the best audience for this show. Although as a critic I have a sense of what I personally like and dislike, it is later. <br /> <br /> A sense of humor is a great comedy when it comes to comedy, things can be pleasant, cool and perky for about 4 minutes, and after that you start to stay eternal, unless a few years ago this is bad animation (? ) This is exactly the opposite, rigid scenario and all the superfluous voice commands are just stupid and very boring to be passable. Unfortunately, because he had a big market before himself and a lot of potential. <br /> <br /> A waste of time.
