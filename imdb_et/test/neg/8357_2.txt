I'm just writing this review because I'm a big fan of the book, Prozac Nation and the movie terrified. <br /> <br /> I think if you hadn't read the book, you would have lost the movie because it didn't give Wurtzel a real backdrop to depression. His childhood (his relationship with his father, his summer camp experience, his first therapists) was not really mentioned (in fact, the film gives the impression that he has never been in Dr. Sterling therapy) ...). This means that if you had read the book, you would have been confused about the amount of editing you made. <br /> <br /> I found this book to be a vivid depression image, emphasizing Wurtzel's lower points. and the experience he had on the road. The film, however, began in Harvard and literally threw the audience straight, without any real explanation of what was going on. <br /> <br /> The events that were important in the book (such as the miscarriage of Wurtzel, his summer work at Dallas, his suicide attempt during Prozac) were out of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is also pedantic, but Wurtzel did not lose his virginity with Noah. The suicide attempt shown in Sterling's office was completely different from the book. In the beginning, he actually went over to Mellaril, unlike the para-suicide gesture shown in the film. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you read the book and enjoyed it / identified it, don't look at the movie. Instead, read "More, now, again" (same author). Or look at the girl, interrupted. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming feature was Anne Heche's performance, which I think she represented Dr. Sterling very well. Christina Ricci was also good, though her perception seemed a bit ... prone. Jessica Lange made a nice look, but it seemed the opposite of how Wurtz's mother was described in the book. <br /> <br /> Summary? Do not worry.
