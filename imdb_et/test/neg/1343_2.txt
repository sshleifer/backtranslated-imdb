Diane English women (2008) are, unfortunately, a waste of talent. Annette Benning, Candice Bergen, Bette Midler, Cloris Leachman, whom I like and enjoy in everything I've seen, and Meg Ryan, Jada Pinkett Smith, Debra Messing and Eva Mendes, who may not be my favorite actors, but have a nice look How could a movie be boring, predictable, embarrassing, sloppy and just bad? It was made by Diane who is known as the writer of the very successful TV show Murphy Brown and her first film she wrote. The film has been a love for English who had long been trying to do it and I respect it. I even found scenes with supportive players, Bergen, Leechaman, Carry Fisher and Bette Middler in short but memorable places, funny, smart and enjoyable, but in general the movie is second hand "Sex and City" that appeared little but back. I didn't find Sex and the City very good when I saw it, but besides Women it was just great. At the very least, Sex and the City saved us from the long and tasteless events of the hospital showroom, where one of the characters was with the child and his friends supported him. Poor Debra Brass, what did she do to deserve this nightmare she'd put in, and us, the spectators with her? Movies like "Women" give a bad name to the whole genre, the chicks flick. There's nothing wrong with the genre, but why is it so hard to make a really good comedy about female friends and difficulties, marriage, motherhood, and professional proofing? These are all very important and important topics that every modern woman can touch. Why make movies with lines, dialogues, and situations that are so clever, predictable, not funny and insulting that they are forgotten right after the movie ends? <br /> <br /> After seeing a new movie, I originally checked my local library with The Women and I really enjoyed it. The story was much better talked about 70 years ago and I kept my interest completely. The old film had a real star power.
