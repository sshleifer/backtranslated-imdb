The artificial melodrama, together with the scenario that Mel Dinelli adapted from his "Man" game, concerns the owner of the storerooms, who takes the worrying handyman who may be killing. Despite the works of East Lupino and Robert Ryan (both of whom are trying their best), this annoying yarn is not very inventive in its primary set (which will quickly become visually faded) and inaccurate characters (still a smart pooch who feels the worst!) . Hokey and humorless, inclined to Harry Horner (maybe Lupino should have?). Where are all the ad promises? Dinelli was a co-producer. * 1/2 from ****
