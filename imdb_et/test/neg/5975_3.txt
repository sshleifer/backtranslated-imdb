When exploiters become evangelists, they are still using poverty! <br /> <br /> The first reaction after seeing the movie is ?? God bless me for not eating fish or other plant products! <br /> <br /> The documentary is Lake Victoria, Tanzania, where a lot of cute fish lived, and one day, in the 1960s, someone came and injected a powerful fish Perch, which became the European and Japanese markets for the export of Tanzania. The consequences were serious? first, all the local small and big fish were out; secondly, the fish could not fly empty because it did not change the commercial / commercial / capitalist idea, so it was filled with weapons and ammunition (that is what Europe can give to this world); thirdly, pilots (like all migrants and traveling residents such as truck drivers) must implement their sexual needs, flourishing cheap African prostitutes for them; fourthly, enriching brokers, brokers, central men (mostly Indian businessmen) and Tanzania remain unchanged; the fifth poverty leads children to crime, drugs, etc. <br /> <br /> This documentary was great. Did Hubert Sauper, director, succeed in making a good documentary? It's a big NO. <br /> <br /> I say the reasons: As in India, it needs a higher box of Brahmin to stand and project the world, India's poverty and immunity; likewise, Austrain calls for a European documentary born to tell the world the story of Tanzania and its degrading and destructive economy and poverty. It is a pathetic motive of ignorance of the rich class (who has never seen poverty or the poor) who lives, serves and hears as a pest that hangs out for poverty as soon as they see it. African and Indian poor people who see such pictures are nothing but despicable. <br /> <br /> Hubert's intent and motives seem to be completely different. Images, characters, localities, interviews are too serious and blind, blind and disturbing. He uses an exaggerated ignorance to play his voice. What we finally know is the damage and sadness of the Africans. We are also starting to consider the Tanzanian government and people as criminals. It may be that some Western countries, sitting in their air-conditioned rooms, would have time to discuss and discuss the pitiful living conditions of Africans, but that would be nothing more. <br /> <br /> Does the director even keep showing himself once on the screen? so that it cannot be identified among the poor Europeans who use this poor country. <br /> <br /> This director, Hubert, can only survive the giants of those exploiters like today's CNN and BCC media. Hubert had no courage or common sense to talk to Europeans who were eating or importing those fish products. Totally intermediate tension! But do I understand the same reasons? Hubert just wanted to practice his fame by sitting and smiling with prizes in his European comfort. <br /> <br /> No more words to save this pathetic effort. I hesitate to give the documentary a higher rating of 3.5 stars out of 10, but because the topic was right; but it was used and blown away by an ill-advised director who only made intelligent western countries! (3.5 out of 10)
