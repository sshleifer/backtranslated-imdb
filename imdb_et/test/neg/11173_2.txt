This is just the fourth effort I watched with this director (whom I met and found quite brilliant at the 2004 B-film retrospective at the Venice Film Festival in 2004) and worst. Like THE BRONX EXECUTIONER (1989), which preceded it, it is a great example of the end of the Euro-Cult era - this is the key, because it shows the depth that the previously revived style had fallen by that time! <br /> <br /> In fact, we get around the plot - I'm not kidding, people - killer phone! Pretty but fun Charlotte Lewis - in her third film after PIRATES (1986) and GOLDEN CHILD (1986) - is a model that has probably ended; He expects his architect to love to call him back, but every time he rings, it is all static, accompanied by voices coming from a distance (or some kind of mess). He communicates with a new tenant in his apartment building, who knows comfortably the powers of paranormal activity (William Berger) - who, happily explains, that the negative energy that has been triggered, for example during family arguments, can be a deadly force through home appliances (I swear I won't do it) )! <br /> <br /> Among the highlights of the movie are the lower points of the film: a sad bartender whose embarrassing place heroes a few times (the chain of events may seem to be interrupted only when Lewis goes through its pace, ISSUE ANGEL (1962)) -style!), a large number of exponential phones, a heroine photographer's friend's apparatus that collapsed before her killing, a sarcastic cop who welcomes Lew's strange announcements ("And what's a toaster, I don't know?"), a rapper who was killed from a phone booth having fired the coins, and Berger's own bloody death (with the phone it affects the pacemaker and causes the doctor's heart to explode)! <br /> <br /> The climax of the movie is rather confusing and it seems that all the "lost souls" who live in the pigeon house and fly out of the "predominant" office window (lonely service!). Whatever it is worth, the least result of ex-Goblin Claudio Simonetti is effective enough, despite the fact that dated heavy metal numbers have been recorded in the sound recording.
