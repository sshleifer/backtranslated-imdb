Some reviewers of this film were very commendable. Personally, I was disappointed because of these reviews I was optimistic because the opening credits started running. <br /> <br /> The story is too familiar: The deformed boy and his father live in the Louisiana sex. Local boys laugh and torture him. The local boys are starting to frighten, oh sorry, I mean Victor Crowley's cabin in the fire with it. The father tries to save his son, formerly known as Eddie Munster, who meets the elephant man, but accidentally puts the child's head. Victor becomes a murderous ghost who is chasing the miserable ones entering his domain. Oooo ... scary. <br /> <br /> One thing I appreciated about Hatchet was that he never took himself seriously and some gags even made me laugh. The thing is, I've grown from tired Hollywood polished, B-horror sticks. I like to laugh and I have good intimidation, but this film didn't give any solid dose. Crowley is next to Michael, Jason or Freddy ... Pumpkinhead has a better chance.
