There are many reasons why I am not a fan of fact-based movies, but more than any other is how filmmakers create a license for a license. If they have such a great imagination, why not use that talent to do something original? Otherwise, stay with the facts. It could have been a good movie if only they had done that. Ed Gein was a crazy frightening man. It has been said that if you took Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Leatherface, wrap them in one person, Ed Ge would still be thicker. Why can't anyone make him a movie that could convey it? When will they realize that reality is ultimately thinner than fiction? <br /> <br /> I have read books and watched his news and now I am not a scriptwriter or anything, but I believe Gein has enough documents that it shouldn't write much about all the atrocities he did without they would have created murders that had never been documented. I am aware that he was convicted only in two murders, but all the evidence in his home and in the shelter should have been many other ways to assemble this film, not to use a deputy's relationship with his mother and girlfriend. filler and too much of it. <br /> <br /> I think what I mean is why at the end of the movie I knew more about supportive characters than Ed Gein? Why did we not know the relationship between our mother, father and brother or theirs ... which made him a psychopath ... what kind of abuse did he carry as a child, which could help the man he got? Instead, the only thing we got from our childhood was when his little boy ... ran. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'll give him 4/10 stars. Thats for 2 gore and 2 for Kane Hodder. Though it was, in my opinion, a bad casting, Gein's weighing was a small-scale man and maybe feminine, and Hodder is nothing but small and not far from what I would consider feminine. Maybe I was just excited because he was Jason Voorhees.
