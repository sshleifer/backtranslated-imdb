Bank heist / Cop thriller sounds good? <br /> <br /> Chaos looks good: nicely framed, good product values, high-heel hats ... <br /> <br /> But ... <br / The plot has a unique achievement to be both smart and incredible , blatantly incredibly "how did we actually get the money" in the mode and "complexity and why" is too complicated at the same time ... <br /> <br /> Moreover, Ryan Philippe is not serious or scary ... and he is not particularly harsh or scary when he tizzy fits. Frankly, his big outbreak in the film is the only very funny scene. Must inspire him to turn Anakin Skywalker's role back and do it now ... <br /> <br /> Stratham is usually good as a harsh but quietly hard nut with self-evident humor, but here, the additional draw lines are so ridiculous that even he sees discomfort by saying that any of the required clich√©s are necessary. The quieter seems to be the best? <br /> <br /> Snipes is really OK, but another nail is a talented actress in the church: she needs an actor role that is not a hero of action. Perhaps this business will break its taxes and the public and the critics will give him sympathy for voting. It would be good if he hadn't written so often all the time. <br /> <br /> The line that these men speak when they don't do plot development and detective work can be summarized in one word ... .pheeeuuuh. <br /> <br /> Film knows everything and it's never gels: I found it in the first 45 minutes of irritation and the toughest part was satisfactory. It should / could have been good, but it just can't redeem horrible lines, overwhelming scores, and overall levels of irritation with credibility. In general, I almost didn't do it: incredibly irritating and Ryan .... please, please, release the gold watches.
