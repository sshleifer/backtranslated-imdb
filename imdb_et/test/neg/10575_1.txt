It was a stupian movie I've ever seen in my life. It's a waste of money and time. I went to watch this movie with my friends and if the movie wasn't more than one person in the movie - not that there were many people to see this terrible movie, he said, "What's a good movie." Someone really went out! It was terrible! It was nasty and I hated every minute. My friend put his head on his shoulder because after the scene where Rick was on the ceiling he had enough. It wasn't funny at all. Believe me, I went with 11 other girls and none of my friends liked it. It was ridiculous! I've seen many movies, but it was the worst! I mean, the movie scene is with an old man who makes a coffin with a dead person. I just can't do these things.
