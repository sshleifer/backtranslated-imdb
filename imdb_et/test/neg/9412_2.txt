I went to the movie that wanted it. I usually enjoy dramas like Wall Street, Glen Gary Glen Ross, Boiler Room, etc. I went to this movie, thinking I'd be on the edge of my seat. Plus, I'm a big Pacino fan. <br /> <br /> What a garbage. Quite probably the worst film I've seen in five years. This makes Pacino any Sunday attack really good. First, half of the film is viewed by Matthew McConaughey's lifting mass. OK, we get it. You're the shape of Matt. We don't have to see another other scene pumping with you, shirtless. <br /> <br /> Second, how many movie holes are in this movie? Why take Brandon's long lost father's phone call and never reconsider it? What was the idea of ​​hanging up her mother - why even her call to tell her she was sending too much money - what was the point? Boy from Puerto Rico, who lost 30 million? Also, because sports betting is illegal in NY, and its recognition is illegal, how can they ultimately predict everyone? <br /> <br /> It was just a very poorly written script. It was potential, but it didn't have a single plot. I thought Pacino was studying the script after choosing any given Sunday, but probably not. My Gosh, this is the same actor who played the godfather! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money.
