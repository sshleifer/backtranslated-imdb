I am not usually willing to write films that I think deserve to be mentioned. But in the quest for a writer and film critic, I feel it is important to express my thoughts if I don't like the film. "Damaged Queen" is one of those films. <br /> <br /> Anne Rice's popular horror stories about Lestat, a bisexual vampire, first came to a successful "Interview with Vampire" in 1994. Two of Hollywood's biggest heavy trucks at Tom Cruise and Brad Pittis celebrated the film's stylish aesthetic and gothic scene. Although it may be a style of tea over the substance, it was something that worked, despite its chance (never been loved by the vampire genre). <br /> <br /> Since then, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise have done much bigger things. It is likely that both would have come across a laugh when asked to appear in the queue. They would have made it even more difficult to see the end result. "The Queen of Fucking" Type Cr * p Hollywood content is good to pay at a low price, hoping to earn a quick hit thanks to a medium soundtrack and a major marketing campaign for 13 to 17 year olds. <Br Needless to say, this movie is terrible from the start. Lestat, which is now played by the British "Stunning Fish" of Stuart Townsend, awakens its dark grave ... ... you thought Nu-Metal. He casts out some confused punkist musicians and joins his band, provided he only appears at night, burning in the sun and all day long ... <br /> <br /> Jesse (Marguerite Moreau, Paranormal) a student who has learned to try to find out if Lesta really is what he says. Along the way down to him (something to do with his strange past), but he has little competition for Queen Akasha (Aaliyah), the queen of the Vampire demon, who returns to the underworld of Lestat as a chosen king. Film <br /> is shamefully self-evident, but its comb-like tone leaves room for its depreciating humor. Anyone who sees this movie, but laughs, has to see more movies! Viewing Townsend is enjoyable. She knows that the role is completely up and doing her best to walk between tight and serious behavior. The late Aaliyah is unfortunately a terrible title. It has a minimum timing and what it does not use does not use it fully. Poor makeup and special effects will not help; sometimes it sounds like he speaks through voicemail. <br /> <br /> This film is moving straight to the video until Aaliyah's premature death last year. With the opportunity for people to see their latest movie, Warner Bros. Otherwise, it would have been one of the movies you see on the shelves of video shops, but avoid it because you can say it's just terrible. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, such films are made. Check out the rupture of teen rom-com or spam yourself with movies like "Not Another Teen Movie". If there is a market to take advantage of Hollywood, this biggest problem with my film is not a film. Hollywood is earning money, so if this film has a market, they will continue to do so. It's a business. But I am most concerned about the fact that people are actively going to the cinema and paying money to watch it! I think this is the biggest argument in the cinema world: is cinema the first and the second entertainment, or is it the opposite? The only people who can decide are the audience. If you like and are interested in good movies, leave this turkey.
