Their PURPLE MOMENT <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Quiet <br /> <br /> (Black & White Short Film) <br /> < Two successful nightclub artists (Laurel and Hardy) are unable to pay their bills by provoking a violent accusation from a hot tempered waiter (Tiny Sandford). <br /> <br /> A typical L&H scenario that is less important than some of their best work ever since, but it is worth looking at. Stan takes a round at this time, after finishing financial hours after part of his work to finance the night in the city, but to find out - too late! - that her victim's wife (Fay Holderness) has replaced her stash with valuable coupons. Some long Laurel close-ups, when he slowly becomes aware of the disaster, show his genius for characterization and mime. The moral of the 1920s is represented by Patsy O'Byrne, who plays a hatchet-occupied body who is pleased to note the bad behavior of the spouses of L & H's (Holderness and Lyle Taho). Ends, but there is still a lot to recommend for the movie. Director James Parrott.
