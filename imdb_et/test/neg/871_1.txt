This movie is the last shoulder. As a dedicated fan of romantic comedy, this film has finally made us realize that nothing has come of this genre because Love really is. There was nothing good about the film. It was love, death and everything in between. Including horses and beaches. There was no chemistry between the characters. This film took a spark from Nicholas Sparks. Diane Lane can't save her life. He was not convinced of his laugh, cry and dance. And she needs a better hairstyle. There is no reason to watch this movie. Save yourself. Romantic comedy is officially dead.
