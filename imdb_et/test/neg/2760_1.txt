I was forced to read this blissful "love story" between the German 24-year-old POW and the 12-year-old Jew. It has the "political correctness" that has been written about it. Such as the movie "SPIRIT", in which the horse wants to be free, but those "evil" Americans will not let him because they need it. Well, I have good news, the Americans are a "soldier" in a German soldier and in his summer book. Why !!! Horses where God has given us and when Americans need a horse can use it well. In the same sense, Germany tried to kill the Americans to kill, but this book / film seems to be OK! Casting is absolutely awful !!!!!!!!!!!! The girl is a Spaniard, her mother is a white father, mostly of white origin, and a little sister is a "shirley mall". Action is too bad, serious parts become comedy! Concluson-Bad, a bad book, but both have different ends, don't read or see either!
