It can easily be better. In fact, perhaps so much that if the filmmaker hadn't even tried so hard, it would have been better. <br /> <br /> Good note. The lighting was reasonably good. But pretty much everything else was missing. Wobbly camera works. (Yes, yes, I know it should be a style now.) Poor recorded sound. And when someone looked like someone, I was watching too many Ulli Lommel movies (which are some of the worst edited movies.) All in all, it seemed that the film was a rationalization of the director / writer / headgear to get some young women naked to put them in a fake prison and grab them, saying "threatening" things.
