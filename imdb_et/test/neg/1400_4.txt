Stylized Hollywood Westerners with familiar conventions seem to have eternal life, and this is an avatar. All this seems to have been unlocked since 1939 on the back of the drawer, a larger budget implemented and the release of its output. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper has played this role tens of times - displaced Southerner, hero and confident, though confident as possible. He plays Blayde Hollister, who travels to Texas, looking for a gang who destroyed his cotton seed. He wears a backpack and carries six elephants with six elephants. He speaks hopelessly with an accent - "The fan can do it." (See "Sergeant York.") The Gang is led by sneering Raymond Massey, who buys and sells land, usually with the least possible means. Gang contains Steve Cochran, who can't play the West, although he's generally in bags. The woman she needs is the daughter of Ruth Roman, the owner of the Mexican plantation, who looks and speaks both Mexican and Boston brown betty. <br /> <br /> I don't think I'll prove too much. There is no doubt that anyone has studied it in detail and there is not much to mention. Like all western countries in 1939, it is a maze. Everything except Cooper and his friends is underestimated, and there are several double and exchanged identities and hidden secrets. <br /> <br /> Everything is retro. The plot, dialogue, wardrobe, even music. The result is Warner's disaster Max Steiner. He's the man who threw "King Kong". It was in 1932. This film was released in 1950. <br /> <br /> Cooper's name, by the way - "Blayde Hollister" - prompted me to look through the RACA - Real American Cowboy Associate records. - See if this name is in their archives from the beginning to February 4, 1911, when the last real cowboy died due to a failed meeting. There has never been a real cowboy named Blayde. Hollister, yes, but not Blayde. In fact, there are no real cowboys Wade, Luke, Cole or Matt. The most popular names for true cowboys were, in descending order of frequency, Clarence, Mortimer, Noble, Nebukadnezzar, Plautus, Pinchbeck and Hortense. <br /> <br /> If this film appeared in 1939, it would have been routine. In 1950 it is a peaceful memorial in the history of humanity recycling.
