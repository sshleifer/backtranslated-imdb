I would like to make the monthly salary "The Magnificent Seven Returns" (MSR) on TV. Other reviewers confirm that MSR was a theatrical film, and I take their word. The logical answer is to assume that it was originally made for the TV and after the change of the studio-heart it appeared theatrically. Every actor is mainly a TV actress: Mariette Hartley, Michael Callen, Ralfe Waite, Stephanie Powers ... all the television performers. Lee Van Cleef shared his time between television and theater screens. In the last thirty years, Stephanie Powers has made only 3 or 4 "real" films to produce a positive positive positive film for a very productive television career. Small players are veteran-small-screen actors who can be seen in the old Gunsmoke, Wild Wild West, San Francisco streets, and so on. <br /> <br /> are identical to Universal Studios Tour kits that are often viewed on an old episode TV. And editing is a testimony of one or two rushes of TV with limited camera movement, positioning, cutting and lighting. The sound, apart from the original themes of Berstein, is directly on the television of the seventies. Yes, I'd put the money that it put on the TV. <br /> <br /> This is an important issue in MSR assessment. At first I watched the MSR cable, assuming it was an old theater release. Compared to the original "Magnificent Seven", this is a joke, a comic, an amateur experiment to make films. Acting, Lighting, Writing, Settings, Action, Cinematography, Music (Releasing Berstein Themes), Editing, Stretching, ... in and ... all bright compared to the classic "Magnificent Seven", close to the perfect western 60s and one great movies of all time. Nevertheless, I think the film is a film made for television in the early 1970s, which is actually better than average. Those unfortunate to live through the 70s as an adult know what I'm talking about. MSR would have competed with "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" and similarly, a delicate network would show. During the seventies, Gunsmoke was a quality exhibition that focused on character development rather than action, emphasizing playing weapons on two shootouts a week. The first shoot, usually murder, sets the hour for the plot to move - the second shootout runs alongside the episode, killing a stellar star, solving his conflict or otherwise solving the conflict with Marshal Matt Dillon. The MSR has more activities than the entire Gunsmoke season. In this light - in this frame of reference - the MSR is a satisfying entertainment that is higher than that of a TV ticket this decade.
