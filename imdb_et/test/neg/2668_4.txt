This is the worst Halloween movie ever made. Action is bad, except for Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence. The girl who played Kara (forgot her name) was ok, but in general this film was basically a big drop. Nothing moved the story forward, lacking content and fears that made Halloween and H20 so good. All and all, skip this movie, it's not worth renting.
