I didn't see two other "Ninja" movies and I know everything is known, but for some reason I watched it. It starts quite quickly because this ninja goes to super-killing. He's almost unstoppable because he takes him a lot. However, he is not in the hope, because he comes with a woman and he continues his killing using his tool. The second ninja enters hell and apparently the only way to kill the ninja with another ninja is that it is voluntary. It will lead to a great battle, because the dead ninja will go back to his body and they will have it all in war. Sounds better than it really was, but at least it wasn't boring.
