Tug-3 is absolutely right. Although I'm sure Mr Osmond wanted to make a sincere, cordial Santa Claus, it's as cynical and scary as they come. The religious meaning of Christmas has been forgotten and replaced by cute children, unsuccessful adults and fools. The production values ​​show that it was filmed either in a riding session or a truly inexperienced filmmaker - I suspect the latter. The worst part, weird, is really music. You think someone with a long-term musical career could do a better title, but you would be wrong. Even my mother didn't like this movie, and she likes Osmonds and Sappy things.
