It was another one that showed that I looked out of the positive elements and since I'm a fan of Nick for years. Some of them would be productions, B-plots, guest stars and some of the main players who were good. I bumped through the show at high school when I grew up quickly to despise Jamie Spears with other chicks who can't work. The only characters that seemed to be Dustin, Quinn, Stacey, Michael & Logan. Quinn is the perfect challenge that finally began to fit; Stacey is a complete football; Dustin goes through a number of strange random situations; and Michael is a better man in Logan's comic relief. There is a significant difference between the B-plots containing them and the "A-plots" between their performance and the quality of action, which showed bunch of funny girls and iconic "Miss Perfect" that repeated bad lines and worshiped the boys. This exhibition would have been great if the main plots included the quality of the side surfaces, but the main plots simply do not give anything. When he came back recently when I restarted and tried to see it again, I was more inviting to the girls' exhausting action and I had to change the channel. But I give credit for the above listed characters because they made the show more or less worth my time.
