British teen movies that focus on the girl (Justine), which accidentally creates her dream man (Jake) with a virtual reality machine, is just one problem (well? Not just one?) Her body is a geek as the only person who knows the truth and the only one the person he trusts. It sounds much worse than it is, I found it more observable because Laura Fraser played more than the movie's content in it, indeed she seems stunning, especially when she sticks with a red lycra dress to impress Jake. WOW !, if I only had a virtual reality machine ??????
