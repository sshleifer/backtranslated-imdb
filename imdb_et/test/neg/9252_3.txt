The "Mill Mill" was one of the lesser novels by Mary Ann Evans who wrote the man's pseudonym under George Eliot. I tried to read this stupid and very complex novel years ago, but I couldn't finish it. I'm only looking at the version of this movie on my own because I don't know how it follows the original novel. <br /> <br /> The film's opening credits are printed in an old English letter that refers to medieval. This is a very poor choice for a 19th-century film. (On the other hand, we see about half the movie, we are seeing an over-the-counter advertising that advertises real estate auction. This handbag is set in authentic Victorian typefaces and looks * very convincing.) Most of this film is very convincing in the early 19th century England's architecture and clothing. The exact location of this movie's story will never be disclosed, but - according to the actors' exhibitions - I will place it somewhere in Cotswold, perhaps in Warwickshire. <br /> <br /> The plot that is there This includes a mill that switches hands a couple of times (within a few decades) between two rival families, one rich and one working class. I disagree with another IMDb reviewer who claims that James Mason has only a small role in this film. Mason has the greatest and central role in this drama as the family of the richer family. Like spoiled and petulant Tom Tulliver, Mason is darkly comforting and booming. His performance here belongs to the right film: it made me want to see Wuthering Heights again with Mason as Heathcliff. <br /> <br /> Because it is a multi-generation saga (made by George Eliot much better, "Middlemarch"), several of the main roles of this movie are shared between two actors: a child's prologue, an adult's main narrative. The prologue of this film is a very well-written scene that makes Tom Tulliver early deliberate and troublesome and the young Philip Wakeham is decent and thoughtful. Philip struggled through a hard workforce with a half-penny: Tom is trying to tempt him, but he doesn't want to take the coin with force: he wants Philip to give him that. All the children, men and women of this film are talented and attractive. Unfortunately, all children talk about their dialogue in post-accented accents that are completely different from those of actors and actors who play the same role as adults. This discrepancy draws attention to the stagnation of the material. Unfortunately, none of the later scenes is as good as this prologue. <br /> <br /> There is a rainfall at the peak where there are many workers who are much better and photographed than previous scenes. But today's viewers (at least in the UK) can no longer take this material seriously. By now, practically every British comedian has made a "mistake" in the mill's comedy routine, parodying this topic, so I had trouble viewing the film in a straight face. <br /> <br /> Character actress Martita Hunt plays a small role, but open credits (in this old English typeface) give their name "Marita". I appreciate this boring movie's 3 points out of 10: one point in one part of James Mason's performance, the children's early scene, and authentic Victorian prints in this auctioneer's handrail.
