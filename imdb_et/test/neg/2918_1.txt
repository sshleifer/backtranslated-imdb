If someone returns to the threshold of speaking, Harold Lloyd would predict a bright future. Unlike his competitors, he was a comic actor trained at a legitimate stage, not in the music hall or in the vaudeville district. He had a good voice that fit his picture. What's more, since 1924, his "silent" films had sequences that were based on the audible signals lost to the audience (eg the FRESHMAN watch series Fall Frolic and the monkey sequence THE KID BROTHER). However, Lloyd's sound features failed consistently in the post office when WELCOME DANGER's novelty was unsuccessful. Lloyd blamed his fall on many external sources, but never realized that the enemy of the glass mark was not a sound but a great depression. Pre-depression viewers who are optimistic may be rooted in the ambitious getter they saw their substitution; The depression target group despised him as a person who would probably close his mortgage and cast it into the gutter. Combining the problem of choosing this character is Lloyd's sense of unhappiness. Honesty is, of course, a subjective assessment, but it is undeniable that Lloyd, despite his tragic upbringing, never gets convincing and external. Perhaps it is because he was afraid to return to this country permanently. CAT'S-PAW fails for these reasons, but the revelation of the Lloyd's fascist action plan alone is suffering. Many film scientists believe that Lloyd was asked to do this film because he saw the chairmanship of FDR as a dictatorship that was bent on rich and soft crimes. We should remember that he was not alone in this cognition. DeMille had been organized by the police of the country last year. We should also remember that America was founded by hotheaded tax protesters and are still motivated by those who want to pay nothing for it. TCP suffered because it dealt with fascism in "comedy" and because his release was particularly badly timed, given the events in Germany. The 1934 production code would ultimately reduce the glorification of justice and would affirm the rule of constitutional law that would be cumbersome. An ideal benevolent despot, a good-willed almighty leader who brings utopia that is exempt from control and balance in this universality, is a classic antiquity. For this reason, totalitarian regimes fear laughter, although it acts as a safety valve. Ironically, the mere existence of TCP, a film that demonizes the democratic experience of that country, shows that America's FDR was safe enough to accept criticism. There is no parallel criticism of Hitler in Germany, in the Stalinist USSR or in Mussolini in Italy. But can you laugh with the humor of humor in the ongoing fascism? Lloyd's financial film is inclined to the right and perhaps Dr Goebbels himself wrote if he had a sense of humor. It is an alternative history, where the chosen person restores order and loses the honor, if it is necessary, and does it with good nature and fun. The distant approaching fascism is, of course, Chaplin's Great Dictator. This last film is useful if it is placed in another country and is based on thinly hidden real person and events. LARGE DIKTATOR produces a little laugh today because it underestimates the extent of human evil, but it succeeds despite being an untold and inappropriate speech because it has a particular advantage of being honored with history. However, Lloyd should be counted on two things: first, he did not make any additional Fascist films during the war and did not later produce hypocritical films: second, he never sold TCP to television. The post-1945 world had seen the face of fascism and it was not fun.
