does not mean that this movie is good. I was very disappointed at many levels. this is the tip of the hat for Bukowski. Hey, I read this man in my colleague - let's see what the mat dillon does to him. and i like matte dillon. I thought he was close to looking for a little like fabric, but mostly ruddy cheeks. I have to take care of this character, and there wasn't much care here. I think the time can be cruel to bukowski and it disturbs me a lot, because writing was certain during postculture. hard to sit, scenes that didn't go anywhere, and a soundtrack that made me vomit. i ask very little, i got less.
