It's the eve of the New Year, the police killer (in the form of Laurence Fishburne) reaches the snow-closed area. When people are in a siege, they have to stay in the police to survive. John Carpenter's classic classical transformation just had to add some stupid plot twists, take all the tension and add John Lequizamo to the pain, isn't it? The first film was exciting, sharp and fun to watch. It's more of a Hollywood, clich√© and painful face. The only thing I took for this movie was OCD very annoying ... VERY. The final song is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad. <br /> <br /> My Class: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Additions: Comment Richet, Demonaco, and Jeffrey Silver; Delete scenes with optional comment; 5 minutes of "armed and dangerous" feature film for a weapons expert; 7 and a half minutes behind the back; "Assault Plan"; "Attack Team"; 12 and a half minutes behind the scenes featurette;, "Unleashed", "White Noise,": Chucky Seeds "<br /> <br /> Unpleasant: I got it on Best Buy and was accompanied by a bonus disc including" Cry Wolf " first 2 minutes, 10 minutes first look at "Unleashed", trailer for this movie and Fuzion interview with John Leguizam
