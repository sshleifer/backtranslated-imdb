I rarely give less than 5 estimates, but in that case I have to consider. His books based on books go back to Hombre (Paul Newman), Mr. Majestyk (Bronson) and Out of Sight (Clooney / Lopez). Even if that is the case, the movies have at least some story essence. That, .... it's not just a catalog worth it. <br /> <br /> Action is bad (I don't know why, because they are very capable here) and the story is stupid. The characters have been moved, there is no chemistry, actors and actors are wrongly cast. Because Elmore Leonard is really a great story, I hope that anyone who doesn't know their work would not have read his books, because they saw one of his stories disappointing his handover. <br /> <br /> The story is another Get Shorty. If you haven't seen this movie, don't look at it. If you've seen Get Shorty, don't go on. <br /> <br /> I saw Be Cool a few years ago and tonight is vid. The first time should not have been such a negative impression because I had forgotten how steep it was. They probably thought more. Get Shorty was original and very fun. I almost always like Travolta, but he is so much better at Tarantino Pulp Fiction and before Get Shorty. He was obviously unable to enjoy what was happening here. <br /> <br /> And I hear that Freaky Deaky, the second book by Elmore Leonard, is in production in 2008 before production. Hopefully, they can pull it out. <br /> <br /> Read books. They're almost all big.
