Mickey Rourke (who once was a famous movie star) plays Martin Fallon, an IRA terrorist who accidentally blows up a school bus with kids who are so nasty about their actions, decides to leave the IRA and continue their ride in London <br /> <br /> !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> Opening a movie is quite troublesome because the baby's life ends with a fireball. Such things happened throughout the 1970s and 1980s and in the 1990s in Northern Ireland, which gives PRAYER FISHING a realistic realism. But as soon as Fallon decides to give up violence (what? He is a terrorist and he's never innocent passerby before?), Then realism disappears and clichés and ridiculous screws turn. Martin is working on the London Underworld (Doesn't they have their own strokes?) To hit a blow when he's wearing a uniform "IRA" (never felt like a provocative uniform) in a large daylight cemetery. The IRA uses a bomb placed under the car?) Where has he noticed the priest who recognizes him during the SAS. Hands up, who thinks I'm lying? I'm not and we're in the running times and we have more clichés. It all sounds very stupid, and that's what you expect from Jack Higgins novel? All are clichés, natural and stereotypical, and bits that are not just odd. The critics killed this movie when they came out, especially they said it might have some potential if Bob Hoskins had played gangster Jack Meehan and Alan Bates, who played a SAS soldier who was a priest and if the critics were right. They should also note that the film could have been less terrible when Fallon was played by someone who was capable of Irish accent. Rourke can be hunky and macho (Oh gawd another movie IRA uberhunk), but the accents are not his strong point longer than the character acting. In order to give you an idea of ​​how disappointing PRAYER FOR THE DYING is the director who finished it, there is always a bad sign <br /> <br /> In the footnote, PRAYER's original publication in the UK has been delayed for several months due to "bombing". In November 1987, the Temporary IRA exploded in the center of Enniskilli, where a commemorative day parade, which marks the death of Britain's war, was held. Eleven (11) people were killed and injured more. It was not an accident and no one left the IRA because of it
