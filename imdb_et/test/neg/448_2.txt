Let us describe Larry as an interviewer: a complete miracle, every opportunity. She laughs at all the guests, she asks the most boring questions and she would never dare to resist them. He strikes me as the kind of person who wants ... everyone to love. Friendly, boring, predictable Harry. He probably owes his success as a dream interviewer to celebrities, because they don't bombard what we, people, want to know and know. Let it be: he would interview him as if he were in a red country. 02/10, 2 for guests who come to the show, but everything seems pointless when Larry starts asking for his thoughts on issues like "What's Mom?" followed by the usual answer "Being a mother is the biggest thing that happened to me: it's wonderful but tiring."
