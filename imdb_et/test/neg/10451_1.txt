I thought I saw something good, but ... I'm tired after seeing this movie, I don't know what I hated the most: script, actor, FX, or music. Try taking the worst Power Rangers episode and still be kind. I've seen better FX in FPS games (touching the bone sword or his breath, which makes people disappear on green smoke) is genius and music seems to be from the west of spaghetti. I liked how the women of the car shouted when the "monster" walked around in the car (even if he looked wrong). So give yourself a break and don't look at this thing, at least call someone to see a horror movie with you, trust me to start playing a monopoly for some beatings.
