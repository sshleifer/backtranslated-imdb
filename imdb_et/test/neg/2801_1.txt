This is probably the worst of the worst. I am a big fan of the fear film industry and I believe this movie was allowed. Action was minor and the story was totally idiotic. The work of the camera was also a minor. One scene that comes to mind is outside the store. It's at night and you see the moon, but everyone has characters that are cast on the wall. There was no street light. One character comes from one point, but later succeeds after removing the post. Come on!!! It seemed like I was watching high school playing. I was waiting for the characters to leave the camera and the mouth for their family members. I can only give two positive comments ... it ended and it was a good laugh. Please do not rent this movie !!
