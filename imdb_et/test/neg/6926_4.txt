I waited so much for being a big fan of this book. But when I came out, I remember that it was one of the biggest waste of money and time I've ever spent in the cinema. <br /> <br /> In principle, the actors, the sets and the music were excellent and this is the main reason I appreciate it. 4. <br /> <br /> In this version, Sara is a little sacrifice for my taste. There is no way he would have deliberately lied to Miss Minchin to stop punishing her other girls; in the book he describes that the lie is "not just evil, but vulgar". <br /> <br /> There is too much Disneyfied ending for me too; Sara's father came back from the dead and all went down to the Indian sunset. Although the book is lucky (and critics may say the same is unlikely), you will not be left thinking: "Oh, uh-leeze." <br /> <br /> The only thing true for this book is: <br /> <br /> 1. Sara's father was a soldier 2. The lines between Sara and her father ("Do you learn from me heart?" "I know you with your heart. You are in my heart.") 3. Sara's friendship with Becky and her "acceptance" Lottie (although the latter wasn't developed as much as she could have) 4. Changing her space by adding various luxurious items. This part was great. 5. The core core - a rich girl who is suddenly impoverished into poverty - is there, but that's all that is. <br /> <br /> People can say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience. Possible. All I can say is I have two cousins, aged 7 and 12, who were the big fans of this movie until they read the book. <br /> <br /> If all you want is a "feel good" family movie then it will. If you are looking for a movie that actually talks about A Little Princess (actually, once you've read the book), don't waste time on that substance. It is so ashamed; such pain if they had adhered to at least a basic story that might have been fantastic. <br /> <br /> Do I read this book and read the book for a little too much? Very likely. But if someone tries to customize a book - especially such a classic - they should at least do the same. Preferably more than once.
