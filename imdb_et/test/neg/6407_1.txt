The film starts well, it has a thing. About 1/3 of the film's stuff goes downhill. Carrey starts with number 23 because he sees it everywhere. So what? There is no reason to go to nuts and start writing things on the whole body and walls. <br /> <br /> The one who plays his son is bad. When he hears the obsession of his parents, he jumps from the slogan and is hysterical about it. Absolutely incredible. I hope I will not see this baby again in the movie. <br /> <br /> A waste of time watching this movie. Grab another. Bored ... well. This number kills him? Leave me alone. I do not break the end, but say that it is equally disappointing. <br /> <br /> 3/10
