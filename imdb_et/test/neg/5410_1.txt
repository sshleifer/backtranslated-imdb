My wife and I like bad scientific literature. Some movies are so bad that they are good. Mansquito was one of them. It was bad, but he had some redeeming qualities. It makes you think about how a self-respecting actor approaches lines like "Hey! Mansquito!" <br /> <br /> It is so bad that it has now taken its place for bad standards. It's not just a bad movie, it's really stinking. There was a running run, "india", who drove in a black coat and used SWORD to shout out loud. He dropped a helicopter with an arrow! <br /> <br /> We tried to laugh at this movie, but there were no points where it didn't go too much. We could not develop any redemption function except one. These were the words "The End" <br /> <br /> There seems to be no plot, sign development, and movie idea. Someone in Hollywood needs to be fired.
