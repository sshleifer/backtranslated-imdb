OK, I thought the trailer was pretty good, so this movie was a budding plus with the cast line I was sure it didn't get less than 6 in my books. But I got a bad half hour story ... just when regular movies is good, this movie hit the bottom. <br /> <br /> SPOILER * A man who is trying to help is so caring for other people who are hurt in the middle that he is turning to his colleagues to save the tramp and then lock himself in the armored trucks. Not only is he constantly trying to get the attention of other people with which he endangers more people and a short story that results not only in the death of the tramp, but also in the descent of the police officer and his younger brother ... oh and all 5 his colleagues die in shame deaths. But in the end, he is happy because he has come to his end with half his struggle, so that when all his colleagues are now dead, he is not on the plan and remains a millionaire. This movie was trying to be so politically correct that I was ill! Damaged good story. Shame really.
