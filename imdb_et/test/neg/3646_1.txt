Well there are some things in this movie. Everyone should see it. You see the Iraqi people, as you have never covered this media, and shot from a perspective that most Americans hardly consider where the film has the main audience. But all you have to keep in mind is an overview of some other fact. More than 150 cameras were watched by the Iraqi people looking at the subjugation of the war and the occupation forces as a growing pain to improve their people. And compared to Saddam, it's just a little scratching of the skin. Netflix also announced it as its main distributor before the fun elections we just sent, sending the entire email to see the movie. Many of them, which should be labeled as the opinions of the interviewed Iraqis, are wrong. When looking at the Red Cross's Abu Ghraib torture, Saddam's commanders were not tortured, but it was 80-90% of innocent civilians and 10-20% of those arrested. It was never revealed that any of these 10-20% was a violator of Saddam Henchmen or curfew. In addition, the Arab world has never declared democracy to be one of its opponents, but the US is $ 6 billion a year, our military bases in Saudi Arabia and our interest in oil. I agree that the media is a complete distortion, but this film shows the same distortion. I'm afraid the Iraqi people that this film represents are being edited to speak with Yankee. Yes, it is true that Saddam is a bunny, and his removal looks best. It is true that some Iraqis are actually getting paid. Just as it is true that no Iraqi people control their most precious oil and US companies. Nor is it mentioned that 20,000 civilians have died only because of the US artillery. There are still 15% of the country that once had running water and electricity. Nor is it mentioned that in the period 1993-2003, more than 200,000 Iraqi civilians were killed and sanctioned by the United States Government. Nor is it mentioned that democracy, when people decide on the government, is not a massive war machine that sends the message 'kill or watch'. I am afraid that there must be quite a lot of Iraqis who are not so pleased with the occupation on the floor of the cutting room. Just like most of the world, there was no war. In fact, America, Britain, Spain and the rest of them are not bearers of democracy, they turned behind when they saw their pockets full. Hurray, Saddam is impossible, but I'm afraid no Iraq is still in power. Corporations are in power, the media is in power. Read, do your research and don't let them shut you down.
