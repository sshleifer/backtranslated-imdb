A pretty terrible movie, I'm surprised at Derek Jacob's and Vanessa Redgrave's wish to be in it, like a long-term episode of a bad TV detective. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake must be Vinnie Jones, she just can't act who had a clear idea to lead her when the leading man wants to look into her head if she doesn't put her money on the project? He should catch the thugs, looking for threatening and non-talking! <br /> <br /> Dickens also had central heating, because there were three large radiators behind the table. <br /> <br /> It's no wonder they gave it to the newspaper for free because no one is paying for it.
