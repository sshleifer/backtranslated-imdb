Probably the "Cleopatra 2525" is of little interest if you did not follow the series when it was sent; and I don't think many people did it. But if you are still somewhat interesting, it will be "Buck Rogers 25th Century" room without a spaceship and without budget wardrobes or production design. <br /> <br /> In this case, Buck Rogers (Cleopatra) plays Jennifer Sky. What could be good if Jennifer is very beautiful and very talented; and he has a nice comedy. But a quick look at the promotional material shows that it is somewhat worse when it has a bad discount and a wardrobe for the Savior's Savior. If you remember how Jennifer's pulling during "Xena" was the look of his fine Cleopatra, it's a big disappointment. "Teenage boys want to burn their eyes to the target audience of" hot fetish boys ", it is not a good idea to hero their heroine or the value of their costume, to attract or hate it," Buck Rogers "were the hottest costumes and much better hospitality. The other two elements of exploitation are the two female companions of Cleopatra, Hel (Gina Torres basically) playing her "Firefly" character) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt - the second "Xena" - extremely wooden version of Natasha Henstridge.) Torres does a good job of playing the character of Cleopatra, offering most of the comics in the show. <br / / <br /> Torres sings a song that is somewhat jumbled by the parody of Rick Evans "In 2525 (Exordium and Terminus)" (1969). opens with the words "In 2525, if a person is still alive, if a woman can survive, they can find ..." I suspect they gave her she shared her title so they could d to memorize this memorable little song, although who knows maybe the title is "Buck Rogers" and they thought it would be used later. So, the prerequisite for the exhibition is that aliens who are called Bailies (not one of the WKRPs) have taken over the Earth and people have traveled underground. Our three heroes are fighting against the cash flow with a (probably) female voice that is discriminated against (called "voice"). Unlike Buck Rogers, Kleopatra is a sort of spiritual third stooge that is still puzzled and confused by his cryogenic sleep, or maybe just unpleasantly horrible hair. There are many beautiful close-ups of Sky with wide eyes and confusion. Like "Buck Rogers", running Cleopatra runs on a common 21st century expression and everyone who thinks it is completely deep or completely confusing. Unlike "Firefly", it is rather a hybrid "Xena" garbage that is neither real nor interesting. One good trick is that girls travel around "Spiderman" fashion, a kind of web host that moves through tunnels and shafts in their underground world maze. Strange (or perhaps not budgeting) is just half an hour episodes, and except for one two-part show, there is not enough time for nuances and nuances. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
