This film begins with how each film should begin, with a host of hot babes in the dormitory that walks in their clothing and / or topless. A couple of them take showers. I like it so far! Unfortunately, we meet or the main characters. They're not just very fond of it. Usually in these films the actors do not really act, they give very "natural" performances and they are quite sympathetic, fun and enjoyable. Not here. They have no personality and I don't care much about them. <br /> <br /> Some girls go on a school trip. On the way they stop at the petrol station in the back park and meet the biker. The biker gang should really be out of the movie - it was a cheese before, but now it's just stupid. The main player looks like a middle-aged man dressed for John Bon for Halloween. The girls go to the woods and later they are biker-strong. <br /> <br /> I don't really know what happens after that. There are a number of things in the world that will end because it is the end of the millennium, then some bikers will kill a mysterious Indian guy who will be lost. Someone can eat Lockes Ness Monster's stuff when he's swimming over the lake. Some boy is silly makeup probably Druid and he has to sacrifice some girls to prevent the end of the world. Or maybe cause the end of the world, I'm afraid I didn't pay much attention. First she dresses the girls under the skin of the animals. <br /> <br /> It could have been a really fun cheesy film, but the biker-gang has destroyed the atmosphere and the plot was so scattered that it wasn't even living my Z-class expectations. They would have had to remove half of the ground elements and just focus on one or two things. Instead, it's all over. In general, if you are looking for a late '80 schlock, then I think you could get worse. If you tried really hard. There is a lot of nudity in the beginning, but characters are inconvenient and the plot is too pointless to be even the least satisfactory.
