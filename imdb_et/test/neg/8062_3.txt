Like everyone else who bought it, I was cheated by "20 extreme gore" and "20 banned" or whatever it says in the box. I have to admit that I am a big gore fan and I am always surprised if the films can make it thick and convincing. Tom Savini, Rick Baker and Greg Cannom are the best in the company. The 80s had a revolutionary make-up effect. They are not needed today because everything is done on the computer. But computers cannot be compared to the visual wizard they could have imagined. But I ground. <br /> <br /> Looking fantastic at gory movies like Fulc's gates in hell or even Savin's crowning achievement, on Friday 13th, you can evaluate everything that goes on making a terrifying movie. The difference between reality and magic cannot be said. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine yet another reason someone would see Cannibal Ferox, but the gore that seemingly visible in this movie. If this is the reason you are looking for this movie, then you are wasting your money. As many other reviewers have noted here, most gore is an aftermath. You will not see torture or bloodshed, if this happens, you will see what it looks like after-hours. Well, it's here, but not as much as you could count or expect. A man gets castration and women hang on his breasts but other than these two scenes and one that includes scalping; nothing else for this movie. Gore scenes even mentioned in these three are still quite annoying compared to what you hoped for. Maybe it's just me and my sick and twisted experience in horror and gore, but I waited a little more. Call me sick or twisted, but isn't it the only reason people watch this movie first? I found honestly that I have a lot of boring places. <br /> <br /> Cannibal Ferox is just one movie that tries to exploit the craze of a higher film. Although the Cannibal Holocaust is not a big movie, it is much better than that. If you don't want to buy it for $ 20.00, you will feel deceptive. <br /> <br /> 3/10
