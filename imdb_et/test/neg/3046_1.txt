This movie is bad. Really bad. So bad it made me want to shoot at my forehead. I hated this movie. First, the plot went absolutely anywhere and there was something shocking about the 30s teaser trailer. Secondly, anyone who saw the original in 1979 knows that it was a bad movie and totally unfair. By far the best part of the film is the house where it takes place. What's not really talking about the actual movie. There were parts in the movie when the music is very tense and you are positive that someone is around the corner and turns out to be a maid or a cat, but if someone is really around the corner, it is impossible to be surprised, because you've been waiting for the whole movie. So save yourself money, save time, save headaches and just look at the trailer. There's no point in seeing this movie, not in the theater, not on DVD, not on television, never.
