The worst movie ever! It is neither smart nor funny nor thought. 84 minutes of bad participants do their best with a terrible script. <br /> <br /> Action was so bad that you see dead people breathing. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the writer's / director's combinations were that they were Quentin Tarantino or something (you know you are still not making a cool movie) but failed. I hope the writer will never make another movie ever! Not everyone is a born writer, sometimes we have to count our losses and go back to the bathroom attendant or anything else. <br /> <br /> Please don't watch this movie even when you mute the stereo for 84 minutes.
