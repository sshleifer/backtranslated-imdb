It is disappointing to see both the talented actor and Amitabh Bachchan in such a weak role, especially when she was sensational in BLACK (which I highly recommend). One line of the film says, "Sakar is not just a man, he is a thought and philosophy." Director Ram Gopal Varma credits God as an inspiration for this film, and maybe it's a problem. This seems to be a badly mixed American film in India. The index on the left elbow deals with seven elements of film making - acting, consistency, plot, character development, dialogue, art and product sets - on a scale from 10 to 1, with 5 being the average score. The continuity of the film seems to be high, 8 retaining the violent tone in the drama and using the legal system as a motivation outside the legal system. However, there seems to be no emotion related to the evil of organized crime. Operating rates 4, it seems too weak, even if someone is beaten or murdered, it seems like a hoohum. For example, if one sign has come off the forehead, I find myself wondering if or when he falls. He doesn't do it, and the area Ronald Reagan is in his car, his bleeding face in the area of ​​John F. Kennedy. The price of the plot is an example of American style gangsterism, with a family-based Robinhood overhead. The appearance of the characters seems static and the characters appear to be chess pieces on the abandoned chessboard that serve the 3rd rank. The dialogue seems to be harsh and seems to be forced to fit in with some of Bowery's conversations - dialogue 4. Production patterns seem to be below average - a 4. And artistry is puzzling, too many close-ups, too fast panning and too many group scenes where actors seem surprised - 3. For me, too much camera movement is annoying. The left elbow index averages 4.4 and with a low deduction based on poor derivatization, it moves downwards 4. The film constantly raises two questions: one, why are so many people eating so often: and two, is India not a trademark of its organized crime? Should such films be so dependent on Western cultural examples? As I like Amitabh Bachchan, I can't recommend this movie.
