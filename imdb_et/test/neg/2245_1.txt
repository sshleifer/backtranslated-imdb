Every film in Quentin Tarantino has become increasingly worse. I would like to believe that most people agree with this statement, but if you see that "Inglourious (sic) Basterds (sic)" has more than 100,000 ratings of 8.5 / 10, it doesn't seem to be a common film for the public to have any sense. Even his best work, Reservoir Dogs, was not a "masterpiece". The problem is that you claim that you like Tarantino's work has become a trend. As soon as this happens, you get a boat ride for people who are ready and want to jump to another bandwagon. They ignore ridiculously terrible action and completely self-conscious writing so that they can become part of an exclusive club called "everyone". This movie is so terrible that I swear it must be some kind of twisted joke by Tarantino to see how much torture his fans tolerate and praise him. As another reviewer has already said, "Previous Tarantino films come from a man who is in love with other films. I could no longer agree. This film is nothing more than self-conscious and jokingly spoken about the ability to play in high school. But thanks to the overall film that going public, I'm sure it will still be one of the best films Bravo, Tarantino, you have pulled out one of the best practical jokes all the time.
