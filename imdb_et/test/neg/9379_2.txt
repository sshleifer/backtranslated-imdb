I'm honest and say I gave up looking somewhere in the middle and then pausing a couple. then I came back here and read a lot of comments already made .... <br /> <br /> maybe I and I can't help but this cartoon for North American society seems to be "letting them save themselves" and iraq comes to mind right away. it seems to me that this is a justification or part of another "good intent" invasion. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that it seems to me that this is a self-evident person and, frankly, I am angry with his attempt to regret and "feel" him. even in this case it can never happen because, as the history teacher has already mentioned, I need to know how his family was so abundant above average, able to keep it (if they played both sides?) and send him to Paris! Now, if it had been done after the poor girl's biography, I saw myself with certain emotions. but as it is + the timing of its release it is just a pure propaganda film; Even worse, because this comic is too soft from the soft side, so it can be serious. <br /> <br /> There are also clich√©s associated with gays. Well, a woman struggling to win her rights should not have at least some sympathy for the underdogs of society like her? the message is obviously in itself attractive from the perspective of the ruling class member. <br /> <br /> I only give him 2 stars because of its production and related things. The propaganda film obviously has an interest in manipulating its thoughts and is generally well done against certain visual emotions that I cannot deny.
