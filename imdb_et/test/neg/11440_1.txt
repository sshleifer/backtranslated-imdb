WOW, I hate tuned, but anyone who rated this movie higher than just must be I.Q. which reaches unimaginably low depths that extend beyond time and space and connect to the planet "Hopper-is-a-retard-for-making-movie". WOW this movie STANK. Fred Ward's Haircut Looks SSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPUPPIDIDDD! I actually wrote Fred Ward for money for the unfortunate haircut he had acquired in this terrible movie. Jodie Foster did not, of course, have much work, but still it is terribly managed. Joe Pesci, oh ... Joe Pesci (who is mysteriously not cast) plays the ULTIMATE stereotypical character of Joe Pesc's movie, full of mob killing and constant use of the F-word. You don't believe your eyes. Dean Stockwell, looking at him in this confusion, made me feel bad, because I thought he was in a state of intoxication or slowed down all the time. Jon Turturro must be in a state of intoxication when he agreed, Vincent Price, Bob Dylan and Charlie Sheen. I know what you mean, great! I know and it was a WORST big cast film I've ever seen. Dennis Hopper draws and marks the stars in both fields. How could a man have directed the EASY RIDER and then this is the FAR that is next to my great imagination. The stress of the character of his OUTRAGEOUSLY badly hit person is in front of terrible areas and is just as bad a bad ending. They (Hopper and Foster) are the most uninteresting couple that I believe I've ever encountered in the cinema world, and you rejoice that they lose and then end very well. What exactly do these two things do in this activity? I don't know, but I know if I'll ever meet Dennis Hopper, I'll make him a huge joke about being responsible for this celluloid waste. Join me!
