Slayer begins in South American rainforests, where Captain Hawk (Casper Van Dien) and his men are attacked by a number of vampires, they can barely escape their lives. Six months later, jump forward & Hawk is invited to see Colonel Weaver (Lynda Carter) who informs her that Vampires have yet to be reported and that her ex-husband and her daughter Dr. Laurie Williams (Jennifer O'Dell) has left there for an expedition to explore beetles, worried she asks Hawk to take a team of soldiers back to South America and formally return to Captain Grieves (Kevin Grevioux) & his men at the same time informally seek Laurie and not die of Vampires, who has decided to go out of the caves and civilized world ... <br /> <br /> Kevin VanHook's edited, written and staged is another badly made original Sci-Fi Channel that is by no means very good. The funny script has nothing I would see, it is one of the modern vampire films that decide to choose and choose the rules of the "traditional" vampire film he wants to use, because these vampires can be killed with stakes in the heart and are fangs, but at the same time they get in the sun walk freely and they are not in the casket section. The film is moving at a reasonable pace, but it's all very boring, boring and inanimate. The story is poor and just quite stupid, the character is terrible, the dialogue is forgotten and there are very few suggestions. Slayer is also trying to have some kind of ecological message when head Vampire claims that they will only kill people when they systematically destroy rainforests, where they have lived for centuries in secret, unfortunately there is no conviction. visual line to fill time as a serious statement. The content is not enough and it is a rather unhappy opportunity to spend 90 minutes of your time. Compilers don't do anything with the jungle setup, I didn't expect hell from Predator (1987), but I was hoping a little more than that. <br /> <br /> Director VanHook has made several horror films I've seen, been equally poor, I'm sorry, but he's not doing it here and turning to a pretty forgotten movie. There is no atmosphere or tension, and like real fears forget about it. Gore is restrained, there are some bitten necks and a bit of spraying blood, but that's not something we've ever seen or has a lot of effect on. Finally, the great Vampire monster is a creature, but it doesn't seem impressive and it kills too easily. <br /> <br /> With this estimated budget of about $ 2,000,000, a decent amount of money was actually spent on it, but it's still a waste film, it's pretty well done, but something special and memorable. Nice sucking, I'm sorry, but I saw it that way. <br /> <br /> Slayer is another poor, dumb and dull TV-sci-channel garbage that I just can't recommend. Not to be confused with the subtle one-time British "Video Nasty" gore The Slayer (1982), which is 100 times better than this, so that instead of seeing it.
