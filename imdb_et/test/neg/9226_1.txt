If the following sounds are tempting, first hurry up your local Blockbuster and rent this movie in a hurry: <br /> <br /> 1. 60's hairstyles, from pathetic perms to tirelessness. <br /> <br /> 2. The worst child actor in the world who does nothing but cries and says DADDY is the most annoying voice you can imagine. <br /> <br /> 3. Lots of film footage from alligators and monkeys that aren't connected to the movie. Not at all. <br /> <br /> 4. Stereotypical Indians using buffer buffers and talking about gobbledegooks. Oh, and it goes without saying that they're around the campfire. <br /> <br /> 5. Pleasantly counterfeit airplane mechanics where the cast is actually in the corners of the cardboard box. <br /> <br /> 6. Outside 5 shots that look suspiciously like a toy jet driven around a blue lighted studio. <br /> <br /> 7. The terrible special effect that makes those used in the first Star Trek series is top-notch. (Especially mentioned: the little boy's blond hair glows. Oh dear ..) <br /> <br /> 8. Pleasant editing and continuity, where the background points move between scenes, makes the soundtrack completely without warning, etc. <br /> <br /> 9. Didn't get enough money to hire a professional dancer? Get anyone out of the streets like an idiot! Nobody notices the difference! <br /> <br /> 10. "Exciting" climax that includes pasture, snakes (more stuff from the archive) and tons of fake. Do not forget to forget the foolish "tribe" hearing song! <br /> <br /> The more sensible you are, the wait until this classic TV show is resurrected, and then you can watch it in the spirit it was intended for. Any other enjoyment derived from this mess is unthinkable. So don't even try. 0/10
