"Grande Ecole" is not an artistic study of combined sexuality, but if you need it, an X-rated channel movie. Although I suspect that there is nothing in this film that would enrich the deliberate viewer, the plot is just an excuse for male-female and male-male couplers, which are convincing in the context of the future school directors and competition of the Paris School. a big school for those seeking higher education in the liberal arts. Similarly, there is a cultural collision with a higher status and a lower status of French youth and a social conflict involving local French and Arab immigrants from North Africa. Everything that is missing is a female female coup that is easily arranged with no more than a slight twist. <br /> <br /> Action is somewhat higher than the usual pornographic movie - but "Grande Ecole" is blunt about it, not just an artistic endeavor. I don't mix sex. It's just repetitive and boring for a long time. Where is Hays Office, if you really need it?
