I've never seen others commenting on a movie, so my perspective on this movie is without comparisons. <br /> <br /> I found the film's message as follows: everything is right with the world, everything goes into place, your lovers love you more, your friends respect, and like you, your employers want you more, pay you more and even you kids and parents love you more. <br /> <br /> I think this message is deplorable and totally wrong. <br /> <br /> Kudos is a very funny scene at the end; there is no mother who will not laugh at this scene. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a very disappointing movie. I didn't find myself rooting in this movie. I thought they were all the pathetic self-absorbed individuals I just didn't care about what happened to them, and it's not a movie people want to see.
