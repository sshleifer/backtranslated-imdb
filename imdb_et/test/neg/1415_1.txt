I am quite surprised that this movie even made some cool comments, I found this movie terribly awful. The plot tends to try to decide whether it is a comedy or a thriller, then realizes that it cannot. So it throws in a towel and continues its absurd plot highlighted by an involuntary amusing scene, injecting with Laura Linney, and spilled coffee that leaves the audience clumsily in their seats, looking at each other like it's real? Basically, it is exhausting and frustrating for Robin Williams fans, and it makes you think someone is blackmailing Laura Linney by adding this trash to his otherwise respectable pursuit. I wanted to leave after 10 minutes and I would have, even if I saw it for free, wanted someone to pay me for their wasted time. The computer glitch / twist in this movie was embarrassingly stupid, and eventually you don't care who wins the election. I vote directly on DVD.
