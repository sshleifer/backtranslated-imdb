It is basically your mill's violent biker stroke that includes perfect slang, accidents and music. OK, so just slangs and crashes. It's a slight notch over another MST3K fare, but it's still equivalent to nail guiding in knee protection: slow and painful. My energy would give up the plot, so I just say it is better to skip it.
