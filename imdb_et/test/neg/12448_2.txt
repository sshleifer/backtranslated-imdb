It was pretty bad - bad actions, bad technical details, bad cameras, and bad sound (although I watched a DVD, sometimes they didn't hear what they said, sometimes my speaker blew even when it was the same conversation). The plot was predictable and the characters consisted mainly of incredible neurotics, bi-polar and cartoons. Character development was terrible ... gentle little sister (why did she even write a script?), Nervous mother (again - what purpose?) Tiny girlfriend (why does she lose her long?), "Dark suits" gang (how original - did not think of a better name), a hot dealer of a drug dealer (i need to be a hot latina if you go to LA gangs but really ...) etc. etc. I can't believe I looked at the whole thing.
