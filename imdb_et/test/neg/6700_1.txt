Badland is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Most of the time is good and I can go on with my life, but I feel the need to warn others in this case. As a veteran of the Iraq war, I think it is necessary to say that the story, plot, action, and portrayal of what the soldiers are returning home were pure garbage. It would be like a leader / writer / somebody who ran it with any clich√©s and accompanied it and ran with it and ran for it. It is not mentioned that I imagine there is no research in this film. The "Marine" form seemed to be on the shelf of a fresh store and it was a pattern that wasn't used after the first Iraq war. I'm not going forever, it's a terrible movie. If you are interested in stories of returning soldiers, there are many better alternatives. I suggest you go to your local library.
