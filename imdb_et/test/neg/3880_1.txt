Rs.30 / - is all I paid for a movie on DVD and I believe it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Bollywood leaders think it is funny to show fools? well that's not. Please grow up. <br /> <br /> Here the dialogue goes from -AARAR TUM LADKEE KO IJJK SCHOOL LADKEE TO DUNI APNI IJJAT DEGI. <br /> <br /> The plot is useless, criminals and police alike are running after fools. That is all. BHAGAM BHAG. <br /> <br /> Well, it lived in the title, I have to get out of it. :) I went to Star Movie and watched Alone 2 at home, and I had a good laugh.
