Inglourious Basterds IS is Tarantino's worst film ever made. It is full of its usual ingredient, ie gentle dialogue, brutal and sudden violence, but it all seems to be deja-vu. Leadership is typical of Tarantino and nothing seems to be new. It's almost like he copied his only masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. Nothing new or exciting about the Inglourious Basterds, it's just a war drama that isn't funny or brilliant like Pulp Fiction. Basterds is said to be a tribute to Tarantino on the west coast of Leone's spaghetti, but it seems to be wrongly connected and in place, especially with the continued use and balance of large subcategories with audiences.
