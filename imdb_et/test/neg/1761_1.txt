Jude's law gives Keanu Reeves its money as the most wooden actor, the character of Renee Z is directly from Beverly Hillbillies, and both have about the same amount of chemistry as Darth Vader and Queen Amedala. "Bad guys" is the worst clich√© and there is no fine moment in the movie. It is unbelievable that some critics really liked this movie.
