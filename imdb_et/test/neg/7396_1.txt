The movie is broadcast on television when I write. <br /> <br /> I just forgot how horrible it is in the cinema watching it. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​the movie is wrong. The fact that intelligent Europeans and Americans are left behind in the desert will forget the concept of morality and civilization in a few days. The Lord's madness was no longer in the making. <br /> <br /> The data that is annoying is many. One of them is the only African godless character that mysteriously survives the terrible climate and has done so in the age without losing its mind and seems to have no supply problems. It's ridiculous. So is the guide to rescue, a look like Indiana Jones, whose rescue ends with a tragedy and death within a 5-minute walk. Then there is the choice of Lear, which is put on the band by a guru-like joke. He reminded me of his hippie high school art teacher. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is Lear's choice of Lear. Apparently this is the brain brain fart. How ever it would have gone is never clear to me. <br /> <br /> Positive little and far. It's a beautiful movie, but it's never important. <br /> <br /> High school intellectual. Weird is weird. It's a complete waste of time if you don't like pointless art movies.
