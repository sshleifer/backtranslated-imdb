You may not believe it, but when the credit for this movie rolled, I was looking for the director's name. When I saw it, I burned it in my memory and I never forgot it. This movie is terrible. This makes Ed Wood movies like Orsen Welles. At least B movies are entertaining, it was a close-knit experience. The quality was so bad, I started thinking about who promised. <br /> <br /> I hear that Uwe Boll runs 14 miles a day. This is because, wherever his films are viewed, people have to take him out of the city with flame and rain. The script was terrible, lighting was like a high school football game, and cinema was a bit higher than Roger Patterson's video game. The condemnation of the actors was too shameful to say their ranks reliably. Finally, the film Alan Smithee would not have named his name. From that day I learned to avoid this man despite the circumstances. What I hear is not bad.
