It's a terrible movie. Angie Dickenson is a class action and always does it well, but she no longer has roles and she has to do the movie. By the way, he's on the screen in less than 10 minutes. Oooh, wait, there is one redemption function in this movie: Meg Foster has a small part in this movie. Now, Meg has been on the screen for 35 years and is not very big, but he has terrifying eyes on any actor I've ever seen. By name, you probably don't know her, but one looks at her eyes and you know her. All in all, it is terrible, the story is bad and even filmography is terrible. Every time the director wants to change the scenes, the black screen is quite moral. Look at something else, but even Mr Ed reruns!
