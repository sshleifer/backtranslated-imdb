This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Not only is it a comedy that is not funny, but also a very badly done top-down, full of unnecessary screens and other effects. <br /> <br /> Two "heroes" with their fantasy language are just annoying and confusing to me quite a lot that they constantly touched each other's genitals. But the worst thing that is pointless is the inexpensive attempt to appeal to this film, referring to German history and showing the sensitive aspects of "heroes", which, at its peak, show how Erkan and Stefan treat a mentally ill woman with their "happy" lifestyle (!) . But I didn't expect anything better from Michael "Bully" by Herbig, who also made two non-funny TV shows, not a funny western movie and a pretty funny SF comedy movie. But Erkan and Stefan were a bit better in some of their stand-up programs. For me, the only good movie is Alexandra Neld, who is very beautiful to me.
