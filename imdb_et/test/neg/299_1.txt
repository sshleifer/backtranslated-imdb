"Hood" does not produce goods. This semi-cooked mafia comedy is marked with letters, including Joe Mantegna, Kevin Pollack, Joe Pantoliano, Jennifer Tilly, and Seymour Cassel, as well as several faces familiar to those who watch criminal films, but it really has failed if there ever was one . Writer and director Mark Malone, the most well-known writer for "Winter Death" for Bonnie & Clyde's director Arthur Penn, has put out a boiler with a sick but vengeful boss Louie Martinell (Seymour Cassel) who sends his son Angelo (Joe Carmine DellaRosa, the toughest "House of Games" in Mantegna. The rival mob seems to have bombed one of Pop's warehouse (at the opening) and Martinelli wants profitability. The problem is that no one has a clue who is Carmine DellaRosa. In another mobile comedy, such a complication may be amusing, but here is just plain. Angelo and Wiseguys, including his best palm Rudy (Kevin Pollack, "Deterrence") spend half of the time trying to find out who is Carmine. Neither Rudy nor Angelo want to hit this, so they watch the crazy hit, Charlie (Joe Pantoliano, "Bad Boys"), to make a dirty act. Before they can convince Charlie, they have to find him and Charlie's lousy wife, Mary (Jennifer Tilly, "Bound"), shows that she is at a mental hospital. Our wrong heroes drive to the mental hospital and break Charlie. About half of the film is over before they discover that Carmine is a short pants (Vincent Berry) who is blissful and harmless. Indeed, Carmine is the only decent feature in the film. Because our useless hero heroes out of his house to take care of business, Carmine warns them that they need him to get home or his father kills him. Charlie's trying to get gold, but he can't. Instead, she reconnects her feelings and wants to go back to the mental hospital so she can report good news to the doctor. While Charlie decides not to shoot Carmine, the boy gets his paws on the gun and jumps out of several targeted circles. Angelo and he is fighting for the automatic. The gun slips out of its collective hands and strikes the ground, extinguishes and blows Rudy's chest. Now, remember that Rudy didn't want to shoot the children first and Angelo and he claimed to have made mistakes. So Rudy pushes to the ground with a deadly wound, while Angelo struggles to stop bleeding. Talk about the boring death scene. Angelo is inconsistent with himself because his father ordered to defeat and Angelo fears that his father will do him if he does not execute the orders. About Angelo's father is a setback that teaches him how to handle the handle, giving some insight into Angelo's reluctance to pack the gun. <br /> <br /> Nothing far from redeeming this frustrating comedy that ends. Things get worse and when you run through this 90-minute mess you can see what I mean. Comedy is mostly ridiculous. Good actors are hidden in visual roles that are not even funny. Maybe the director Malone tried to do another comedy like "The Gang, which couldn't shoot straight." When he was, he missed one mile. Big-breasted Jennifer Tilly shows Mantegna in a couple of scenes cracking and strokes, but she does nothing else. He's a stereotypical bitch who doesn't even get naked. Salary is the only way to explain such a talented lie, otherwise this picture will be pathetic from start to finish. Initially, I had hoped that it could be a "red captain attack", where the boy controls the wiseguys nuts, but there is no such happiness here. Of course, the biggest surprise is that they have to kill the child, but this is not a surprise that makes you look at this resolution. <br /> <br /> Did I buy this movie in the Canadian DVD label Seville? And it contains only the most basic features. If you hate previews that give up the plot, don't look at the trailer. If you ever meet Joe Mantegna, one of your first questions should be why he helped produce such a witch. It's not fun or dramatic. There are no quoted lines and no characters distinguish between interesting and compassionate. The Seville DVD presents the film in full-frame without subtitles or captions.
