It's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> I usually have to sit through Van Damme movie when I have to, because they are usually a little laugh and don't need much thinking. It has no redemption functions. <br /> <br /> It has a lack of disability, humor, behavior, direction, etc. A true stinker at all levels. <br /> <br /> I've never been out of the movie ever since I came here. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
