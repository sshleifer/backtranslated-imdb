I'm not surprised that this film worked well at the Hamptons Film Festival. This is a low film that attracts a low person. Two actors who pretend to be relationships who are fighting and looking for a lost dog. The film allegedly examines the relationship dynamics, but the relationship is too small to deserve such an investigation. This couple has one dimension: they fight, bully, then love and fight some more. There is a short moment of tenderness that does not cause any possible reason why the two would be interconnected, given their toxic and volatile relationship. Beautifully shot, great score, but it's not exactly the case with script or character images.
