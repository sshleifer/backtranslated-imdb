First of all, Blythe Danner doesn't look far away, old enough to play Capshawi's daughter (and in fact she's not only ten years). <br /> <br /> I realize that it should be one of those magical Moonstrucki-type supernatural romances, but it's in the dark. Very, very weak in terms of operation, script and direction. <br /> <br /> The only one who really looks here is Ellen DeGeneres, who makes this movie traceable - if not really believable when he is cast into a heterosexual disorder. But still love. In fact, DeGeneres and the young man's Capshaw dallies make it together. But no one can really say whether Capshaw is in love with a young man or not; neither the script nor its behavior pulls it together for us, and we're left wondering how it really feels.
