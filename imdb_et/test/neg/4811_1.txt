Ni√±as Mal is not a movie that is a bad badly designed soap opera bad episode. <br /> <br /> The show is not a little better than the fact that in soap operas, the writer and director have seen too many Mexican soap operas and can't imagine anything far differently. <br /> <br /> Give it up, go back to your soap operas so you can enjoy the audience. <br /> <br /> Stop moving your time and money, and never give the bad name to the glorious Mexican film industry. <br /> <br /> It's not OK or a good movie, it's a mediocre soap opera!
