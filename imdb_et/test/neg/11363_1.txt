This must be the worst film I saw this year. And I look at a lot of cable. The plot is just ridiculous, scenes are thrown to you without any action, no start or end of the scene. It's just a random idiot with a make-up screaming in some plane. "Special effects" (Spielberg laughs at his ass) is terrible, yellow eye contact lenses are cute though. I have to administrate that I couldn't look it up. The scene where Bennett, a great scientist, kept life on the engine body was too much for me. I'm sorry for my bad English .. I'm from Romania (and this is my first post). I had to sign up for commenting on this movie because I just can't believe it's a 2007 movie.
