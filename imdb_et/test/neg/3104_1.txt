the worst movie I've ever seen was not even seeing what I was just sending to Burt and then finally !!! he is the only reason to watch it! I have to admit that I have my own copy because I'm a huge fan of Burt (stop laughing) and needed it for my collection, which I don't care about when this movie came out when I had a nightmare that rented as my local store there were only 2 copies and fans of all the different stars always beat me there, imagine my frustration when i sat down and watched this movie! ATTENTION TO MOVIE IS NOT A REDE QUALITY !!! Absolutely NOT WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT THIS MOVIE !!! this movie became a joke between me and a couple of Burt's worst! Rob Lowe is the Worst Job and My Life
