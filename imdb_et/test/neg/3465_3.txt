Many times I should write the words boring and not funny on this page until I get ten lines. George is the original actor of alfalfa from small Rascals. Although it is probably mild to alfalfa. How many times do I have to sneak into these overpriced players before I find out that there is only one law in the film industry. Take the money and make a movie - even if it's a mess. They spend millions making this movie, but can't look at the end result. And Renee GoAwayZigger should stop taking illicit drugs and seek medical help that he has to deal with. At least I hope his drugs, because he is quite tempting when talking about his mouth. This movie was not funny or dramatic, and these cages should just bang like that. George and Renee, you should be ashamed of yourself and stop harassing the greedy stop.
