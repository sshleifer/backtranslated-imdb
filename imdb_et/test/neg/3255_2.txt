This movie sucks. It's terrible. If someone liked it, they should be controlled. Jackie Mason's character sounds like a retard. The man who tries to kill the gopher is loser and sucks. Although Chevy Chase was in this movie, she wasn't funny. This movie had crude and funny jokes and they didn't have Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, and Bill Murray. Although Jackie Mason's character was Rodney Dangerfield's character, Mason sucks. Rodney Dangerfield was funny! He should have come back! I don't care about Ted Knight, but Bill Murray should have returned. The original Caddyshack was Murray's career opportunity. If he were funny first, he could have been funny the second time. <br /> <br /> Final Comment: I recommend this movie ... NO ONE !!!!!!!! THIS MOVIE SUCKED !! It's sucked, it sucks now and it always sucks !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> 2/10
