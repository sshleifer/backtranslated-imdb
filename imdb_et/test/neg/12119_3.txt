I loved so much of the last Bellocchio movie, the masterpiece "L'Ora di Religione". It was a great scenario, big actors (well, they have to say that Castellitto is so much bigger than others), great use of lights for excellent cinematography. The ridiculous scenarios that break the morale (and we can talk about weeks of politics, you know we are Italians ...). Bad cinematography (it's too simple, representing the dark colors of dark years and dark lights of the 70s, do some effort for more people!). Bad use of music: what is the point of using psychedelic to represent the tragic rationality of Brigate Rosse? ?? "Perhaps the Russian film was bad, but not as bad as it. <br /> <br /> I'm P.E. Don't believe in hype !!!!
