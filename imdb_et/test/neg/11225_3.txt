I found this film to be talkative and unreal. He is trying to be a film that shows the children a fight against the system, but it does not even give a positive solution. I think I didn't really know the kids. I fully understand what their grips are and I know how bad the school situation is, but I found their solution and how it worked outside it to make it a big bunch. If it's on television, don't waste your time. Look short 235 times.
