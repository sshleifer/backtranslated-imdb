I don't understand what a big movie was about this movie. All the horror objects said that this film had all the important elements of the "old American slasher" flick to satisfy your needs. - Although it was similar to the old American slasher flick, my needs were still not satisfied. <br /> <br /> My big problem with this film is that we are now in the 2000s, not in the 1980s. The horror of the 1980s is the past and should be a thing of the past. Horror movies have changed so much that older movies are now cheesy and unreal. Although they are fun to watch, they do not offer the same real blood cancer that the latest films offer. <br /> <br /> Hatchet is cheesy, unrealistic and terrible. If we'd like to watch an old American slasher flick, then I can go back to the 13th of Friday, the Nightmare Elm Street series or the Halloween series. I have to admit that the film is better than some movie films are released, but it is one of the worst. The jokes are not funny and the actors are terrible. <br /> <br /> I personally stayed away from this movie and never look back.
