I've been listening to this movie for the first time and watching it again. I was fifteen and even then I knew it was cheese. It had such a great potential and constantly wrote the script. Capoeira destroyed what could have been a good drama. I loved it being done. Too bad that the characters were underdeveloped. It's like they write the first draft of the script and made a movie right away. In fifteen years I could have written a better script! Some scenes and dialogue seemed to have nothing to come from and you missed many unanswered questions. And was it just me or did Lobo seem to have been sexually minded by his relative? "Elena has grown into a woman!" And how he always touched him. It would be an interesting plot twist, Elena works for her drug cousin, who is also a perv. Too bad they left this sign aside.
