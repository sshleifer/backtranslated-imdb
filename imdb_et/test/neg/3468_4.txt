"Leatherheads" is trying so hard. Trying to have a light heart. Trying to be a comedy. Trying to have a love relationship. Let's see that it's trying to be "His Girl on Friday" by "The Sting" with "It Happened One Night", which was made with ten sports films. Unfortunately, not trying to do this and the film is as powerful as the last game field. <br /> <br /> A fan of the film would look at the great fight between Duluth Bulldogs and some soldiers and realize that the struggles that John Ford has staged in style and entertainment and humor in movies like "The Quiet Man" or "Donovan's Reef" or "The Searchers, may have seemed easy to do, but probably not. I would make George Clooney think that directing John Ford would be easy. How hard it was: masculinity runs amok, punches, bottles that are broken over the head, a smooth piano player ... just put it on the screen with some music. Sorry. The captain is the one who takes the battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Movies are not recommended. Humor is difficult. Romance is hard. Don't let the lost art hit you. <br /> <br /> I read that you never wanted to sit too close to the ballet performance. Something about not wanting to staple a fantastic performance bubble by listening to dancers' feet or lifts. This movie is such ... all the strains and good intentions, beautiful actors, nice sets, but it casts out its pace, not gallops, like the original galloping ghost, the red grange based on the film loosely.
