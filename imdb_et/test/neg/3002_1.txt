Such storytelling as it always uses the same technique: 1) Throw in opaque, unstructured threads to make the audience puzzled. 2) Handle only such big topics as life, death and God. 3) Make it much deeper with life, death, sky, and so on. 4) Depends on the intellectually weak audience to give you some doubts. 5) Finally, laugh until critical recognition. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bold faux intellectual in its most daring way. These filmmakers not only answer questions, but are afraid to ask questions. The movie is held with wisps. The instructions are raised and fallen uncomfortably. Pop culture references are catching up and arbitrary. It is so little to note that not all critical storms go. <br /> <br /> Critics who found the intellectual base for this movie are afraid to admit the truth: they have no idea what the film is. Good news: no filmmakers. Attempts to answer the fundamental questions of human existence are demanding of reason, intellect, poetry, and genius. Unfortunately, this movie shows none of these features.
