Zarkorr is one bad film. It's not as bad as it's good. It's just bad. Between the action (lack) and the special effect, this film sounds all. For starters, the film looks like it was filmed just in empty spaces with a few props thrown to make it good. Then we can act that is so bad that it puts the high school to play as an Oscar candidate. And it's all turned off, there are special effects that are so bad that they look like the amateur pulled them out of their garage. The cities where the monster is said to have crushed look like my nephew. So obviously they were screaming for the viewer. The only good thing about the movie is the monster. It's too bad that they spent their entire budget on it and left something to the rest of the movie. And maybe a decent script would have helped.
