Not as good a thriller of activities as it successfully goes to the same water as the earlier Steven Seagal films, because there is no very good sediment. Steven Seagal plays the same character he has been playing since the law. In my opinion, Keenen's Ivorian performance is wasted in such an average film and it is a much better film. Bob Gunton is the main difficulty. Brian Cox, who is very scary in the role of a murderer, is the best actor in the film. My favorite scenes are fighting scenes with Russian mafia. One of the reasons for the film to see Glimmer Mani (1996) is Nikki Cox, a beautiful and voluptuous. Too bad that he had no more scenes.
