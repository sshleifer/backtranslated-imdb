Some secondary players are really trying hard. And the camera shots in the desert are pretty cute. Otherwise, this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> The character of William Shatner, Harvey, is an amateur script. He is also a psychopath, a man who escapes in a psychiatric hospital. Is the idea of ​​the film that amateur scriptwriters are psychopaths? Harvey does something to read and film his script, even if it means taking hostage to a film crew. Are the amateur scriptwriters ... grovel? Maybe they do. <br /> <br /> Setting the movie too long. We can't reach the point to the other side. In the first half, there are flicks between darts and alternating characters. The dialog does not contain a subtext. No character is believable as a real person. They are all busy drawings that perform "action" in a way similar to cartoon characters. Indeed, the film is basically an adult comic: silly, ugly, birdbrained. <br /> <br /> I understand why some participants are in this movie. They need money or exposure. But what are Shatner and Harry Hamlin here? Maybe Shatner wants more comedy. Is it the best he can do? Is Hamlin desperate for money? He was a formerly respected actor. What happened? <br /> <br /> Although the story should be satire, it's more than pushing amateur scripts. Maybe it was not intent. But this is definitely how the movie can be interpreted. As such, the script was very, very badly written.
