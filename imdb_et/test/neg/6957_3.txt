First of all, this movie leaves you in a senseless mood. You don't know what to feel. So much that you don't feel bad about Caines' character when his son is murdered (which was actually mainly due to poor editing). The script was too sharp. None of these situations is important when you look at them. The soundtrack or its absence (if not good enough to even remember) doesn't help it a bit. Only a good surprise was the film by Andy Serkis. It was par or not better than Caine. The story would probably be better if Serkis had killed him. Because, frankly, you do not feel any salvation at the peak. Just feel the lack of feelings when you feel me. Basically there is no tremendous drawing on this film. Leaving the audience alienate the whole thing.
