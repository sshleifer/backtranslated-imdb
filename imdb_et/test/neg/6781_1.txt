One of the slowest exhibitions. The exhibition would begin with the comments of the intelligent ass to each other, completely out of the wall and without demand. The fat computer was incredible, a bible, a bad ass girl who are these actors? Never heard of them except Cole, who was absolutely unbelievable in this regard. Every time he opened his mouth, you expect to hear, "you see the children ..." Pulling the plug was a merciful death for this terrible show. The stories were as incredible as the actors. Lame would be the best way to describe it. Somehow, this exhibition makes a gap like Ice-T more credible than a policeman, and he wrote the worst song of the police that was ever recorded.
