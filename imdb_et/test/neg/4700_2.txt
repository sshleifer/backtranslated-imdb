It seems incredible that the same decade that brought the Star Wars to the silver screen hit such a tireless ride like this and many other "adventure movies". I am reminded of the same surprise, but equally of the evil "Ashanti", which is described elsewhere. <br /> <br /> No matter what motivated A-list participants are to sign up for such celluloid waste, honestly beyond this writer. They have to be very, very desperate. To be honest, Roger Moore's appearance in every film is a kiss of death. Although her youth is very beautiful, her entire career as an actor has assumed the ability to raise one brow. Every simple emotion from A to B takes place with this simple stratification. He was James Bond's Dog Days. Lee Marvin, on the other hand, has performed on some very valuable trips, perhaps the most memorable "Paint Your Wagon" and "The Dirty Dozen". He has a comic strip, but he's much better than playing it straight. <br /> <br /> Excellent Ian Holm has been thrown away, barely recognizable as a silent Africa. All others simply turned to paid checks. <br /> <br /> The only plausible and observable element is the German driver. It looks like a very big model. But it is incredibly massive and seems authentic - just like his team. The rest is not even hockey. A childish comedy crushes a brutal and violent story that undoubtedly wears out as if the script had too many hits on Lee Marvin's gin. Here's a director who just doesn't know where he's going. There are clues to the "Queen of Africa", "The Pride & The Passion", "Gold" and the hit of one or two other films whose titles aren't easy to remember. <br /> <Strangely enough, I have seen it 3 times, every time it is shown on television when I have a cold or flu. Maybe it affects my decision - but not much. <br /> <br /> Compare it to every Indiana Jones movie and see what I mean. <br /> <br /> I have given him two stars; one on the battleship and the other because it eventually ends, although the sky knows that it takes a long time to do it. <br /> <br /> Time for another Lemsi, I think.
