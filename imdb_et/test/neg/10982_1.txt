It's terrible. <br /> <br /> A pretty brief overview of what I know, but it has been a long time since the film has left me in such a mess - I wondered how this hell would become such a movie. <Br / The last time this happened was turkey "Mission to Mars" in recent years. <br /> <br /> Salvatore Coco is better off with self-conscious videos, endless seminars, and improvement courses. . She lives by phrases expressing these courses. <br /> <br /> He stumbles through a washed nightclub, played by Nikki Bennett, and has an epiphany; his new career is a talent agent - singer as his only customer. <br /> <br /> Financing his gospel song, a paraplegic girlfriend, played by Sasha Horler - she creates a shop and tries to re-launch Nikki's career with catastrophic results. <br /> <br /> Walk the Talk is why Australians are so despicable about Australian cinema. It's badly designed, flat and way too long (111 minutes for comedy, which would barely scratch the 80-minute mark). <br /> <br /> Each scene is too long and very repetitive. The audience is not given the character to understand it; An important ingredient in a movie like the alleged "underworld" that gives it away. <br /> <br /> The excitement and honestly bad end ends with 30-minute most thoughtless dialogue and scenes with this movie being a failure at all levels - it has become worse for the Queensland audience because its liberal and admirable use is different for the Gold Coast / Palm Beach locations; and its ridiculous use in the suburbs of Brisbane such as Norman Park and Caboolture.
