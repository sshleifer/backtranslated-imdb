I live and work in Lexington, Kentucky, where the Zombie Planet was filmed. I heard the film forever for different people who claimed to be a critical part of production. Then I heard something for several years. Imagine your surprise when I found that it was just a rental for a local video store. So, being myself, I've decided to hit these local filmmakers. <br /> <br /> A bad idea. <br /> <br /> Zombie Planet is too long, boring, malfunctioning, unlucky shot - and that's just a good thing. I tried my hardest to enjoy it, which included removing my brain and putting it on the table so it wouldn't be a horrible story. Unfortunately, nothing worked. The Zombie Planet is so bad that it is pathetic. And the very idea that they are planning a sequel, believes that the director and his henchmen have not heard any criticism that I am sure they have heard. Move, you. Please. In fact, be careful not to make a movie. Or participate in some classes of walking, storytelling and well, in the mainstream. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, hang it on God's love.
