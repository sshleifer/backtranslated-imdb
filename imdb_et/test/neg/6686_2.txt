There were many hype from this movie and the ads seemed to be great. Unfortunately, as you bring it to 2, bring it to the shameful original of the 3. The whole film has shameless stereotypes. The lines given to the participants lowered all the film-related competitions. Hayden Panattiere's performance was a subset of both performance and cheerleading. There were several scenes in which I literally grounded because I was cast because the scene (lines, plot, etc.) was just so stupid. My suggestion to any future creator Bring It On Movies is that you should hire good cheerleaders and teach them to act because the cast "acting" was terrible and their cheerleading lack of ability for the film was totally useless. Only great character: Kirresha.
