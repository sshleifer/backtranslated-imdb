Mad Monster starts at Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) laboratory when he completes his discovery of how to make a person a malevolent wound by injecting animal blood into a human subject that happens to be his dull servant Petro (Glenn Strange), apparently he intends to put the serum at the disposal of the war department, who uses it to create an unstoppable army of these monsters, the ultimate soldier! First of all, when Dr. Cameron has his own attractions, some sweet revenge is put on people who have rejected their attempts, forced him to resign and subject him to public ridicule. Cameron puts his plan into action and uses his monstrous creations to murder Professor Blaine (Robert Strange), and at unfortunate events, Dr. Cameron is able to control the beast and is celebrated by a local farmer, Jed Harper (Eddie Holden), who distributes news such as fire, in case of another unfortunate coincidence journalist Tom Gregory (Johnny Downs) creates a wind and begins to investigate, he suspects Dr Cameron and Gregory have their daughter Lenor (Ann Nagel)) he has many opportunities to sniff around ... <br /> <br /> Sam Newfield under the leadership, it's 40-year-old stuff with a low budget, even worse, it's boring unigand for low budget stuff. Fred Myton's script drags an extremely thin assumption to almost 77 minutes, which is too long, the story is not varied and it is basically the same thing. Characters are boring clichés, a crazy scientist who makes meaningless experiments that create a monster, a fragile real daughter, a reporter who plays a hero and a pure coincidence, happens by studying the mysterious deaths that a mad scientist is responsible for and romanticly involving his daughter, stupid a servant, a stupid idiotic police and a stereotypical shotgun who use farmers who are always accused of drunkenness. It was probably a cliché already in 1942! The film boards are moving quite slowly and director Newfield will never be able to maintain or create a lot of excitement or atmosphere that is bad. Technically, the movie is not big, probably the budget was little and the crazy monster itself seems to be flat, similar to the old homeless winole who hasn't shaved for a couple of weeks and has a couple of plastic jokes. Black-and-white cinematography is basic and static, like most of the films from that time, while a good Dr. Cameron lab consists of a sofa and a table with a few unfortunate scientific equipment. Acting is rigid and wood, as Petro looks like he is all over the film, Zucco as a crazy scientist does not convince and is forgotten. Mad Monster is a pretty flat horror movie, there is very little here for entertainment though at least I did it to the end of one session, which when I think it's a bit of a achievement in itself!
