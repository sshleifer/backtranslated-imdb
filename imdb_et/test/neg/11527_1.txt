Indeed, you can put a model plane against a black background and call it a sci-fi, and that's enough to interest me, so if you are, the Black Horizon can at least interest you to look at it. The best part of the movie is when they submit some real shots of the launch. <br /> <br /> The film plays like the Naked Gun series, which violates police dramas and bad behavior with bad clich√©s. Unfortunately, I don't think they were supposed to be funny, the actors are actually made of cardboard, the dialogue really sucks, just so laugh rather than with them. <br /> <br /> A side note is rarely seeing a movie that is taking place in space, half of the earth, and not confused with the expected extraterrestrial and supernatural events. I really do a more real drama based on our space aspirations.
