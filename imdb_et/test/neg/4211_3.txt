I've always been a fan of Chuck Norris, what he's done and his films. Because when I was watching this movie, but for some reason it didn't happen. Obviously I didn't miss much. This must be one of Chuck's worst films. So this driver, Billy Dawes (Augenstein), gives him the opportunity to deliver, but in the way he is exhausted and forced into the city of jerkwater, where the stupid local corrupt judge Trimmings (Murdock), who heads the whole city, has been arrested and forged by him. fees. He denies the charges and runs for it. The local bombs beat him and he disappears. But now his brother JD John Dawes (Norris) is looking for him. Soon he finds that the city is driving to buy a losing judge and that his brother is not anywhere. Not long after he starts beating in almost every city. Meanwhile, the film calls the female CB radio for local drivers and they all rush to demolish the city. LOL there with large platforms. Finally, Norris finds his brother and strikes more beats. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty bad. In fact, it begins with OK and you feel good when some of these local corrupt police in Norris are crushed because of such losers. But there is practically no story, the actor is bad, and ends? The judge has hanged his house with a big rig and you never know what will happen. Does he live? Norris can never spit him. In the meantime, Norris takes some cutthroat at the end. Who cares? Norris also manages to settle in the city, his hands break and kick off and continue fighting. Come on! This film was apparently made to come to CB at the time, why there was one behind me. They even use CB in a movie. In addition, the film seems to be dragging and you don't know why it's not over yet. This movie is bad, but if you're bored and need something to watch, it will take time. He came to Norway to make much better films. 3 out of 10
