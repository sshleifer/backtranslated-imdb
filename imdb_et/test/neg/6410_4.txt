** out of **** stars <br /> <br /> Let's see ... 14 divided by 20 times the square root of 13 is equal to 23, which was my divorced grandmother's favorite number and the year he was born, 23 minutes later 23. hour. Set the number in any way and choose very scared. Be extremely scared when you throw your 23rd brain-dead face, and you have Schumacher's last attempt in the dark stop shooting with number 23. Oh yeah, 23 is my record in Cuervo's 23rd Street Dive as my favorite dive. <br /> <br /> Carrey carries the film about halfway, we lose his eyes, despite a lot. Don't look for any mad expression that came from comedian Carrey, as you have seen The Mask and Me, Myself and Irene. No. Don't wait for the character's embodiment, as he did with Andy Kaufman. This role is sad and peculiar for Jimbo. Where is Riddler when you need him! I know we don't need him. Virginia Madsen, as usual, is not a sufficiently supportive, speculative and peculiar woman. His talent, like Carrey, has been suppressed, and it is almost painful to see him try to save his underdeveloped character from almost anonymity. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of interesting scenes in The Number 23 that provide some very insidious cinematography to provide credit for credit. They are arresting enough independently without being stupid in their inconsistent narrative. I don't know anyone who often reads his novel in a dark, dark basement, or spends his time in the graveyard regularly, as Carrey does in the movie. Schumacher keeps his film in the dark and red and dark and rainy and black, and gloomy and rainy and dull, forward and backward and backward to start. Even Flatliners and The Lost Boys had a little more daylight, and we're talking about death and medical students admitted to teenage vampires. <br /> <br /> If you feel like watching a movie, even if it is just out of curiosity ... make sure you do it with about 23 cafes so you can kill 23 birds with one stone.
