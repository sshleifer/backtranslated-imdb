This movie is its realism, you really get a sense of scriptwriter James Slater has done his homework on downhill skiing, while director Michael Ritchie captures the movie wall in documentary style. But the problem is, if you are not a big fan of sport, that DOWNHILL RACER grabs your attention a lot. <br /> <br /> Before I ask why I was watching it, I did it because it was a big Gene Hackman's early role, but it's not really a good reason to watch it
