I just previewed this movie. There was no documentary film making. Fully absorbed by this object, the film becomes impossible to level any critical comment against Mrs Faye. The only redeeming quality of the film was slipping and cute, its use was the use of dolls (though unsuccessful) to structure a narrative. But the most difficult experience was during the closing credit. Audience rose and praised. As moths on fire, Americans still retreat to worshipers in the 21st century. The misused monster narrative is quite tired.
