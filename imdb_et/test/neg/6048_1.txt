Just saw this .... story, plot, the script makes absolutely no sense! His Samvis is brave part 2 (without RING), its characters appearing in blue (without reason), this Hercule hate everyone (no one knows why), its Leelee Sobiesky shows true talent (two of them), its extraordinary special effects , some good good guys who waste their talents (did I mention two talents of Leele?) ... do I have to say more ??? ITS EFFECTIVE, even for NBC TV standards !!! That's the lowest .... what a waste! by the way: how do you get so many stars in this mini series ????? It's outside of me! Must make 10 lines so this is my last word: OPEN, OPEN if u are considering buying it!
