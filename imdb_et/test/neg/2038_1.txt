Brilliant works, great plot, great special effects! That's what I would say about this movie if I had seen it with a bag of diarrhea for the whole movie. Instead, I suffered a 2-hour crap-o-rama. Our "brilliant" story begins with a few billion people who have nothing better than watching volcanoes in vain, trying to find their happy charms. Instead, he finds a 5'4-man dummy rubber dinosaur suit and some cave folk suits. <br /> <br /> In his infinite wisdom (with his infinite big nose), he decides to go inside this volcano with a "special" team of people to travel to this area, they will fly by plane? No. In the water? No. They use this giant soup with "solid metal" drilling, which I swear at the end. Overall, this film was a faker than .... Oh that's right! It was the vision I have seen! For those who haven't seen it and think about it this Sunday afternoon, if you look at this movie, you should be ready to cut all your pieces of masculinity and give yourself a full frontal lobotomy. <br /> <br /> ECCCHHH !! The rating system only allows minimal I give it -10/10!
