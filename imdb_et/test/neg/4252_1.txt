A few words to the people here at the germ of cinema: the worst cinema ever seen at this venerable cinema. Very bad script, very bad actor and very bad movie. Don't waste your time watching this movie, watch very good "mutant verdes fritos anarquia radioactiva" or some movie commented on by me. Tell me more.
