Humor is a very individual thing and the audience in Wog Boy's hidden preview seemed more than me. I found this to be an anachronistic thing that represented the outdated racial humor of the parents in the 1960s and 1970s. The boy responds to a girl's plot that never lets, because there is a lack of chemistry between Lucy Bell and Nick Giannopoulos when I find that I laugh on the ground. If you want to spend your money on it, wait until it's on video.
