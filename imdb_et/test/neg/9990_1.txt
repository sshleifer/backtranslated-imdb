I saw this movie with a group of 18-year-old friends. This reputation was before that, and although all my friends were adults, I had the courage to enter the video store and rent it alone. We gathered in a house where the parents had left the city at the weekend. Although we were sitting in close proximity to each other, we did not speak or testify in any other way. As it turned out, the movie earned it not worthy of what we felt. It was not disappointing with free content alone, but it was disappointed in any other way. <br /> <br /> Caligula strives to overcome genres by combining a historical epic with a terrifying porn movie. It fails in its ambition by placing the audience in the worst of both worlds. The obvious point of sale of the film is its pornographic aspect, and it really gives much more than its share of the actual graphic sex. But setting this sex in Caligula's spoiled government era gives him the power to act even less than the average adult film. Without contextualization, sexual involvement may be at least involved with adult adults, but the world of Caligula is usually no joy or even consent. It fits into the best newspaper and, at worst, as a tool for sadistic domination. At this time, it is somewhat common to hear words such as "sin" and "insecurity", which are described seemingly to describe acts that are taboo according to some moral or religious views. Caligula takes the viewer beyond vision, depicting real reproach and showing that it is not joy or joy. <br /> <br /> Historical parts not only mean the meaningful contextual change of the sex, but do not reflect, enlighten, intrigue or interest the viewer in any way. They only offer long lasting tedium. Rarely has the film proved so boring. Sex, after the initial shock and surprise, only reduces the overall monotony of the image. <br /> <br /> Violence is not rarely discussed in this film. Although many films that are more violent than Caligula, there are few competing for the value of this shock shock. Apparently, the Caligula emperor was characterized by unreliable barbarism and hyper-lost sexuality. Violence is even less of a heart than a gender. <br /> <br /> Such a review is likely to generate as much curiosity as it does. I understand why someone would want to see this movie; After all, I myself was the same curiosity. I just hope that my review, clearly describing the lack of redemption value, at least gives the potential viewers the knowledge to make an informed decision whether to see it or not. My high school criminal law teacher described police work as "boredom hours that have been swept away only by terrorists." This statement fully describes Caligulat. You have been warned.
