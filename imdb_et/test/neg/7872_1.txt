I rented this movie when my girlfriend was, hoping to see some serious military / professional activities. <br /> <br /> After 10 minutes watching this "movie", I was so scared and terrified and sick of all the quality in this movie that I was ready to destroy a rented plate with a flame thrower. Luckily I couldn't find it. I've seen a lot of bad movies. But it's not even bad, it's a complete garbage, and it's not even worthy of being considered an IMDB movie here. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the people who are totally ashamed of doing this. I hope this wins some Oscars: D.
