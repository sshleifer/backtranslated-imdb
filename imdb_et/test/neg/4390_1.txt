The box is the reason why I chose this movie originally and is why I rent it. But I soon found out I was deceived. I thought this film would be something like Road Trip / Eurotrip / American Pie. But I was wrong. This movie is one of the most stupid I've ever seen. The unrated version tease watching you but is completely disappointing you. The action was terrible and the sound effects were just terrible. It was a very small budget, with the entire layout taking place in the same building. Get out and get a Eurotrip or Road Trip. I can't believe the National Lampoon has named it. DO NOT BUY, DO NOT USE. Don't waste 2 hours of your life.
