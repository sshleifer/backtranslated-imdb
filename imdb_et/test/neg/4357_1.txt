Killjoy 2 just crosses the first movie a bit. Here improved things were actors, Killjoy make-up and story. It is more of a gore fest, he has no supernatural elements as the first one did, Killjoy kills his victims in more conventional ways, he fires them and he doesn't shoot them with the balls that were in his mouth. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was that the end was a little half-assed, in fact it was half-assed, they killed Killjoy in a very cheap way. I would be highly recommended for anyone who likes horror movies.Seriously, the first movie was good but the other is better but the other is better.9 out of 10.
