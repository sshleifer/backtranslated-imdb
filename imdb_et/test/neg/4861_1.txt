I would have wanted to set 0.5 but unfortunately I can't. Who can write such bad scripts (I saw the movie for five seconds and I knew "a bad boy would be Sutherland - need to pay taxes when you see how good he was in Redford's" Normal People "and others! -) Although I don't like it but I had no choice but to see the movie in French, but I know listening to the real votes of Sheen, Sutherland and Hamilton wouldn't have changed anything except maybe making it regrettable. <br /> <br /> What makes me sick is that people earn their lives by doing bad things (I forgot to talk about Mr. Waterson, far from the Woody Allen movies he'd ever played) We got another movie on another French channel: silly James Bond with Brosnan (I'm not talking from real bonds with Connery (please, this is the end of the holidays, wake up!).
