Although the film's premise was unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the movie, it could have stood there and move on with its life. She gets interesting comments and reactions about her topics, but not really enough to add to the film's validity. <br /> <br /> I also felt like he was going overboard with a lot of things. If the boy said a dirty comment, he grabbed it or made him a nasty gesture, I'd say he would go to it, bring him down, he's a pig. But I was disturbed that he walked around revealing clothes and would be surprised when the boys were watching him and giving them hell. <br /> <br /> I think he forgot that attracting other people is part of human sexuality and much of what we are all about. Boys look at beautiful women, especially when they are provocatively dressed, just as women look at men when they wear a tight container or have no shirt at all. <br /> <br /> Some women may hate me for this, but I hope not. I have a lot of respect for women. I raised one. I also come from the Spanish family and we are very matriarchal. My grandmother was the center of my family for many years, but I don't feel that it did anything to help women, and what the filmmaker even said was a little offended by her.
