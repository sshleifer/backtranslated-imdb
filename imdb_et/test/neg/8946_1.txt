** SPOILERS ** I rented "Tesis" (or "Thesis" in English) because of the strength of the later "Other" efforts of Director Alejandro Amenabar. Based on the brilliant dimension and terrifying result of this film, I expected his earlier efforts to be of equivalent quality, and I was pleasantly scared. Instead, I ended up with the most annoying and reluctant lame-brained movie I've seen since the German film "Anatomie" (what it reminded me). <br /> <br /> The plot has potential but will be thrown away in the first 20 minutes. He revolves around the topic of violence on films on Angela (Ana Torrent - Jessica Harper's Death Penalty) student of innocent-n-beautiful psychologists. In a far-fetched situation where he enters here, he strikes a "snuff", where two men torture, distort and kill a new girl for the camera. Angela and her horror-friend Chema (Fele Martinez) are both shocked and intrigued by tape recording and decide to be responsible for who is responsible for it. <br /> <br /> It leads ... well, nothing. <br /> <br /> They never give a reason to explain why they want to find a girl's killers (because they refuse to turn to the police at any event, even if their own lives are in danger), and the mystery itself is as lame as in Graham Norton's room that is full of bunny girls. There is only one right "hint" (camera type used by the used killers) and it is a) really weak and b) rolled out in the first 20 minutes. The rest of the so-called unraveling is simply happening through blind luck, more and more ridiculous plots and terrible, transparent and totally pointless red herring SLEW, which is simply pulled out of runners. <br /> <br /> Seriously, Amenabar may know about his ghost stories, but he has probably never read a detective book in his life. The key to a good competition is the grouping of large potential suspects and their elimination one by one with the progressive detection of smart deductions and increasing evidence before the final twist begins. "Tesis", * POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD * Amateurs "Detectives" think the killer's identity is almost right now and then we get a 100-minute writer who desperately tries to throw the scent until he runs out of ideas, throws his hands up and says, "OK, you you got me, it was his end! " Any kind of logic or motives behind crimes - no such happiness. You look at the wrong movie if it is after that. <br /> <br /> The only thing that pulls Teses down because it's just a stupid, poorly written thriller, is how he actually tries to make some ridiculous, stupid points about film violence. I have no idea what the attitude is to take on this issue, but it seems to have decided to bring in the wrong misleading, confused psychobabul, the rest of the tibia and say, "look at me! I'm political!". The latest scenes where the "point" of the movie is said to have been shot home are so absolutely absurd and embarrassing that they can't help but do not know if Amenabar knows now that he is watching it. If he doesn't, he should definitely. This is the "amateur night for the whole island house" affairs. <br /> <br /> Generally, I can't believe I spent two hours of it (it seemed at least six), but I hope something happens. The city's legend "snus movies" (and that's basically all that, despite how this movie tries to assume they're some criminal phenomenon that sweeps the world!) There is an area that can be so terribly exploited by movies ("Videodrome") anyone?), but it's so easy to step into a child "wouldn't be cool if!" Territory with it (ie: "My Little Eye") ... "Tesis" hits the lower "snuff movie" all the time. At each level, it's better dead and buried. I'll give it to 1 out of 10, nice light, but that's all.
