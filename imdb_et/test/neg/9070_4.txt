The attractive wife and wife writing team Robert Wagner (like Joel Gregory) and Kate Jackson (like Donna Gregory) reach the horrible mansion of the actress "Lorna Love" (actually a quiet movie star Harold Lloyd's house). Mr. Wagner and Mrs Jackson have been signed to write a silent movie star. Wagner has a personal interest in the project because his father was once a famous star lover. Mystical events open up and Jackson has to fight to save his wife in the spirit of a beautiful blonde who is "completely preserved" in the crypt of the estate; Moreover, the evil woman seems to be inclined to own her husband and kill Jackson! <br /> <br /> This is a very "shade of night" variation that represents a real "Dark Shadows" alumni Kate Jackson who knows and plays his part well. Robert Wagner lacks David Selby's intensity. Sylvia Sidney (Mrs. Josephs) leaves Grayson next to Hall. Marianna Hill is not suitable for Lara Parker (or Diana Millay). Bill Macy (like Oscar Payne) is good at what John Karlen (Dan Curtis's production) would have played. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell, John Carradine and Dorothy Lamouri have a lot of smooth. . The transfer of Mrs Lamouri is similar to Joan Bennett, which raises the question: why didn't Aaron Spelling get more original "Dark Shadows" for the producer? Director E.W. Swackhamer was the wife of Bridget Hanley; she worked with Mrs Blondell "Here Brides Coming" and Jackson "The Rookies". "Death in the House of Love" is arguably narrower than the film "Dark Shadows"; it differs from the star of the film; and at the end of his "Father Eternal Fire", it resembles more closely the story of TVseries' 'Laura Phoenix'. <br /> <br /> **** Death at Love House (9/3/76) E.W. Swackhamer ~ Robert Wagner, Kate Jackson, Sylvia Sidney
