As bad as good - not only is the script obvious, it acts not only bad but pathetic. The worst of all is character definition: unrealistic ingenuity, affected reactions, coercion of the camera to look at the superficial aspects presented as the keys to the plot. <br /> <br /> You can't stop smiling if Ultimately, the main character says something like "your daughter plays football and doesn't know cooking". Such a female intelligence offense determines the level of this film. <br /> <br /> Is the film a psychological behavior of another character, its impact on the main characters? to warm up the obvious end? <br /> <br /> Pls do more - I had a good time to guess what goes wrong ...
