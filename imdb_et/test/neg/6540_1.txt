"Puffy's Chair" was the biggest waste of 84 minutes of my life that cannot be searched and spent in a more valuable way (even the "Blair Sorcerer's Project" was a better use of the more precious moments of life). This is called "The Puffy Chair" because only "swollen" chairs could fit extremely "swollen", in itself important brothers who fell out for the public; and obviously they are so full that they have assumed that the public would want to use their drone. The Puffy Chair made The Wooly Boys a masterpiece! "Puppet Valley", "Puppet Valley", "Pink Flamingos", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Living Dead Night", "Urban Cowboy", "Blob", all these are better times to use than "Puffy Tool" viewing. The figurative characters are either too predictable or too incomplete in normal, emotional reflexes that even close ones can be credible or plausible. At one point in the movie, while the stars should be in the same small town, if one closely monitors, one can see that part of the city is probably in the United States and the other half is in Maine. It's some cities, right?
