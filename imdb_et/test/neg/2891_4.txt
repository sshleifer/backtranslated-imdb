In addition, Australia's film, filmed in New South Wales, is problematic for its producers from the outset due to a number of personality conflicts and longer shooting times that use its allocated budget prematurely, and although it is timed. Style is sometimes nicely detailed, below standard post-production finishes and exaggerated cuts. Tom Skerritt plays like Howard Anderson, an American entrepreneur with a passion for construction, who works in the Blue Mountains area to build a tourist hotel but doesn't know that his business partner, Julian Fane (Guy Doleman) has secured an incomplete structure of ten million dollars, much more than his real value, and plans to destroy it due to the usual summer brush fires to collect a beautiful amount of fraud. In line with this illegal scheme, Fane organizes an offender who is an offender, a young man who is also a boy of Anderson's daughter, and at the heart of the future resort is one critical fire safety sector (one scenario of many inexplicable elements), Julian has all the assumptions that his silly design will occur without serious obstacles. As a local insurance company who is a victim of a crime belongs to the majority of fans who are politically skeptical insurers of the policy, Lloyd's of London, investigator George Engels (James Mason) uses to blame the nature of the crime, making death by death, perhaps murder, the insurer (Wendy Hughes), who in the following hints were apparently close to the cause of the arson. The movie setting is a week before Christmas, the summer length at Antipodes, the dramatic background, but the story in the link is not blended smoothly, resulting in the presentation of events, which is quite difficult for the viewer to follow, a problem raised by uneven editing, this heavy cutting and poor sound and picture quality . This twilight sound processing makes the Skerritt semi-command and drone style deadly invalid, but Mason is very effective, as always, and has the best dialogue with Hughes, which is impressive as a too early researcher; Doleman wins with actors who have the advantage of being a malicious Julian Fane.
