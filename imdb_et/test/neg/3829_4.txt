Alice Dodgson, a New York doctor, is suspended when he cures one of his patients with an unapproved drug that results in the patient's death. Unemployed, Alice is forced to go to Jamaica, where she tends to become a wealthy brother of the White Landowner. "Ritual" is a mediocre horror strike. The action is pretty boring, plot twists are stupid and there is no tension. a little trick if someone kills white people with machetes, but not too much. Cinematic art is decent, but acting is really disgraceful.
