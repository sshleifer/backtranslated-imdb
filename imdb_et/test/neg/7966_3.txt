There is no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock was a serious talented director. Many of his films are indisputable classics that have tried over time and are still traceable to this day. This list could include 39 steps, rear window, bottom of the northwest, dial M murder, vertigo, birds, suspected shadow, and some other movie. <br /> <br /> But "suspicion" is not aging at all, and it's really so inconceivable that it seems to me that it was probably a bad film even according to the 1941 standards. A list of scenes that work well can be listed on a color pen with a color table. The script is loose and ridiculous most of the time, but the actor seems to be both forced and wooden and bordered by an amateur that it is almost incredible. Joan Fontaine tries to tilt things on the shore, but he's on a slippery slope and Cary Grant doesn't help much. His behavior is so bad from time to time that I have seen better performances in high school or in college theater experience classes where the chemical engineer works for the first time without formal training. <br /> <br /> After about 30 minutes of watching this movie, you may find that you are coming to a dark DVD sleeve to see if you have accidentally selected any version of a special edition that was linked without editing. <br /> <br /> The theme is serious, but the film has a stupid and subtle feeling that it seems so inappropriate that you become uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> "Doubt" is basically unobtrusive and another very redundant BAD movie.
