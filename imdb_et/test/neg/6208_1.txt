Talk about acting ... !!!! not only Govinda, but also Salman and Lara .... The direction was terrible. For the first half hour you would like to turn off the movie ... because this movie is a real smelly sign (please mark my words. <br /> <br /> I liked Govinda in some o comedy role, like Haseena Maan Jaayegi, Iodine No 1, Akhiyon se Goli Maare and Jis Desh Mein Ganga True Hai and it's not comparable to one of them, and Salman Khan shouldn't do any comedy at all! He sucks, he doesn't know how to do comedy. The only good comedy that he did was Andaz Apna Apnas, what was great about Amir Khani. ever.
