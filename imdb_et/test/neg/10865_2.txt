Okay, so the writer / director Larry Bishop obviously has some important connections, and they know the right people in Hollywood to produce his own movie and perform eye-catching names. Good for him! Now, what he really needs is inspiration and talent to come up with a valuable scenario rather than the superfluous and terrible twisted jazz he put down here. "Hell Ride" is not a movie; it is a passionate and hopelessly intuitive fan-boy who tries to respect the formula of the 60's infamous biker-flicke and the recently revived Grindhouse cinema in general. With "Hell Ride", Larry Bishop is not embarrassing in his structure and has many obvious reasons. He's not a story to say? or at least not very interesting? but it tries to cover it seriously through the numerous twists and turns of the parcels, free and very unwelcome by women, oversized and subtle dialogues that want to be cool and big meaningless violence. Seeing a plot is difficult, but it can actually be put together in one sentence. The ancient brother between two rival gangs rises again with the arrival of a new member; a boy who may or may not have been a long lost son in a double cross that was executed in 1976. All the rest, starting from betrayal from gang members to recruiting old timekeepers with their informative girl, are all pointless and confusing material. Another big problem "Hell Ride" is Larry Bishop's own enormous and seemingly insatiable ego. Certainly, he would not have to reward himself with the leaders of harsh and relentless prosperity, because it is only so incredibly pretentious and narrow-minded; especially if there are so many other, more experienced stars in the movie. Bishop played a couple of real 60's biker-exploiting films (like "The Savage Seven" and "Angel Unchained"), but it was a long time ago and he is not an actor honestly. Perhaps it was just a bishop's lifetime dream to play a character that always crosses its enemies and for which every hot babe sexually craves and wrote around it in a whole scenario. Cast veterans, such as Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen, don't really care for a credible impression and I can't say I blame them. This whole production is flat and pathetic, and I can't recommend myself to anyone, regardless of the many beautiful babes who travel around paradise and naked butts.
