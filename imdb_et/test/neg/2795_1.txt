May contain spoilers. This film was once the worst film. I couldn't even look at it all. This movie is actually worse than a peacemaker killer who says a lot. It was worse than terrorists, at least sometimes funny. Not even the movie was good. Shooting was fake and it was worse. Please do yourself a favor and skip it. If you see it in the rental store, run it differently. There's nothing good about this movie. If you want to see a good peacock movie, check out the night of peacock or pumpkin head. If you want to see a new cheerful movie, check out the scarecrow. I appreciate this movie from 0.2 out of 10. It's so tough this movie actually. MOVIE EVER.
