Has anyone found the plot anywhere in the movie? Perhaps this cinema is missing a different cinema to perform. It is quite surprising that Gordon says "there is nothing about a movie without a plot" ... It is possible that characters have said more to their own Wim Wenders. Did this phrase from the original plot or actor decide to send a hint to the director?
