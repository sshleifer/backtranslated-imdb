How can a movie be a biblical epic? Just by quoting a few Scriptures and using some of your characters in the Bible to name a few? The only thing that was biblical about this epic was the names of the characters. I forgot about three kingdoms, and Israel, Egypt and Sheba were used. Where did King Vidor get his rest of the story? It was certainly not the Bible. It was a complete and complete nonsense. If you want to read Solomon's reign in King Israel, read 1 King 1-11 and 2 Chronicles 1-9. You also experience Adonja 1 and 2 king. The Queen of Seba (who does not appear until King Solomon has been king for about 20 years, which by the way is long after Adonijah and Joab have died) can be found in 1 Kings 10 and 2 Chronicles 9. One of the first things Solomon does is to do affair affinity, taking her daughter. <br /> <br /> Yes, King Solomon was involved in worshiping false gods, and this is why the kingdom was divided after his death, not the destruction of the temple by lightning. I also think that Solomon married too quickly and gave the temples his false gods to 700 women and tended to fight their 300 spouses against Egypt, not to mention the dead brother. <br /> <br /> As I said in this movie, it was totally pointless. If you don't use this story in the Bible, call it something else. That could have been simply called Romeo & Julia or Sid & Nancy. <br /> <br />
