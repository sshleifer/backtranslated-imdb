During this rent, I didn't expect it to be blown away. In fact, I knew it was terrible. It was just to see how terrible it really was. This is what comes with a low budget horror. <br /> <br /> "Snakes on the train", which must not be confused with the serpentine summer strike "Snakes On A Plane" with Samuel L. Jackson, is about a woman who has placed a Mayan curse that causes snakes inside her and eat her from inside. His only hope of survival lies in the shaman who lives across the border, so he and his companion left Los Angeles on the train. Throw some passengers and fun. <br /> <br /> Come to think, but the story is not half bad. It's not half good either. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Sci-Fi Original competitors work, if not worse. Trust me, it's terrible. Snakes were another problem. I think they were supposed to be riders, but most of what you get are mostly harmless garden snakes that don't attack anything and there's that terrible sound effect that really gets annoying. <br /> <br /> Gore effects, on the other hand, though not at Tom Savin's level, were actually pretty good. <br /> <br /> Another thing that makes up for the rest of the movie is to finish. I'm not talking about it here, so you have to rent it and see for yourself.
