Opening to a somewhat reusable "Kit for Cat" footage, "Tweety's S.O.S" doesn't live in this classic comic. Instead, we get an example from the Friz Freleng Tweety and Sylvester series in the most general. Unlike Chuck Jones's Road Runner series, which tried to introduce new jokes with the same joke, Freleng's series seemed to be happy to recycle jokes until the characters were in a different place. "Tweety's S.O.S" is therefore basically "this time put on a boat". This is not a very weak comic. There are some good jokes, mostly involving grandmother's glasses, but they are bigger than the gags you see when you come to the mile (sea sickness routine) and it all relies on the other endings where someone other than Tweety says: punch the putty tat, a joke that has repeatedly worked but whose revenue is decreasing. "Tweety's S.O.S" apparently enjoys children who enjoy practically any comic, but big kids like me, looking for more than the same tired gags, are definitely one to avoid.
