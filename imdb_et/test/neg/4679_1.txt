The use of the term "comedy" as compared to this documentary is an insult to the comedy for art and, worse still, what happens to the viewers of this production. Almost nothing was funny. <br /> <br /> This documentary followed a small group of stand-up comics on the road as they traveled from city to town in small clubs. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that their conversations and behavior on stage and on stage are indistinguishable, but unfortunately equally uneven. <br /> <br /> It is possible to understand yourself, which are great, characterized by "comedians", but it is harder to grab the sounds of laughter heard from their audience. These are the same audiences for a flat sitcoms TV. <br /> <br /> This was probably the worst film I've been watching while watching my 50+ year movie.
