** MAJOR SPOILERS ** Traceable only for action is not a story and does not work "Nature Unleashed: Fire" is one of the longest and most painful end of the history of contemporary cinema. We have a fearless Ranger Jake, Bryan Genesse, who safely takes the trio of hysterical cyclists safely to all speeds with an explosive smoke-mining shaft! It's a fierce forest fire! It seems that Ranger Jake did not know that the mining shaft, which leaks with dangerous and explosive meta-gases, is the last place where all the forests around it are fire! br /> *** POINTS ABOUT THIS POINT *** All this started some time ago when Ranger Jake tried not to save him, so that he could slip through his fingers and fall to his death with a mining shaft. bottom or did it! Even if we were up-to-date with the forest fires in the first half of the movie, it wasn't a surprise at all! As in films such as Tiny, it seemed to be made of tempered steel, something that happened to him, the explosions of fire and digging, could not stop the madman. <br /> <br /> Before Tiny reappeared or resurrected, Ranger Jake was involved in rescuing cyclists Chris Mel Sharon & Marcus, Josh Cohen Melanie Lewis Anastasia Griffith and Ross McCall, who were trapped in the woods, burning everything around. The usual thing is that among Marcus bikers, things do not go as smoothly as Ranger Jake wanted them to go. Marcus not only eggs Chris to make a fool, jump over 10 feet of pile logs on his bike, but either the boy broke his leg. This makes it almost impossible for Ranger Jake to raise Chris's air before fires for him and his compatriots! <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie Ranger Jake, who led himself, makes boner after beating his attempt to save himself and trapped and lost in the forest for cyclists! All this ends with Jake's brilliant idea of ​​hiding in a dangerous and abandoned mining debris, where the rescue party is just a yard, rescuing them if they only stayed and open where the rescue team would find them. <br /> <br /> Although he was supposed to be a party or a movie, Tiny was all in his efforts for a second indestructible superabain, a man who spent too much time in the sun. Tiny's make-up work was so cruel that she looked like she wasn't spaghetti in her head, instead of burning crisp. <br /> <br /> Ranger Jake came very naive or slowed him down in dangerous Tiny, always trying to save a striking psycho who never hid his feelings about what he had to play in Forest Ranger. In fact, Ranger encouraged Jake Tinyi to do both him and his cyclists, showing him how incompetent he was trying to save them. The fact that Ranger Jake was successful was not because he was so smart, but because Tiny was so meaningless despite his indestructibility!
