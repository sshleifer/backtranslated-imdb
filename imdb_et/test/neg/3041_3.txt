It is so superfluous that you want to turn it off after the first 45 minutes. The beginning is very interesting, fair is happening and someone is being killed. This movie would have been better set for this setting. <br /> <br /> So, Jill Johnson is a frustrating sprinter with friends' problems. I don't see any point in adding my break to my boyfriend at any event in the story. <br /> <br /> Because Jill has come home late, she is sending her father to her childbirth for Mandrak. glamorous home in abandoned lake. The kids are sleeping and the maid cleans up, another empty house for the sons who are in college. OK. <br /> <br /> After about half an hour after climbing around his own house, he gets a couple of hangers. Ooh, scary. To where his friend gets to find a few high-level lines of "love" and whatever. A friend leaves and goes to his car. Then he falls off his keys. Uhhh ... then music! DumDumDum ..! He tends to pick them up and gets into his car. Of course it won't start. How clich√© is that ..? So he disappears = D Jill alone. UH. (Most of this movie is with him so there is not much dialogue). Who says they can't help him, but call back if he has more problems. <br /> <br /> So he suspects his boyfriend is calling, or his boyfriend's friends are calling. They've been just once. As it should be much more scary? Oh, and did I mention? His friend is now coming to caller ID and some crappy voices. She goes all out and talks. <br /> <br /> Yes, miss it. He sees the light in the Mandrakis son's house continuing. So he runs through the forest with music as his companion and goes in. Bleheh. <br /> <br /> AH SING BEGIN YOU CONTINUE !!!!!!!!!
