I bought this movie for one dollar and I thought I could never go wrong, my big mistake was to watch it. Enjoying Ice-T and decading, which gave this film many classes from Los Angeles and the world of blinds. There is a boxer who kills one of his attackers and has a career, but he retires because of mental problems from childhood and the killing of another boxer. She will be an employee looking for a bodyguard to protect girls who work with her girls and make sure they are not beaten. This boxer loves his superior girlfriend and starts any kind of problem. It's fun and then it becomes a big laughing comedy.
