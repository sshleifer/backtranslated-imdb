Rarely does anyone deny that Hitchcock is still the most creative, inventive, and fruitful driver at all times, because he is undoubtedly all these things. It takes true genius to scare filmmakers into taking showers and wearing necklaces. However, Saboteur is not creative or fruitful. Rather, Hitchcock presented the soul with the intention of creating a "American Pride" for a movie, a title of arms, a support-of-our-army that was a popular subject of time. With this in mind, Hitchcock significantly reduces other important aspects of the film, including, but not limited to, logical plot, characterization, plausible dialogue, and smooth, current story. <br /> <br /> Usually Hitchcock makes excellent espionage films, but a few years ago, cinematic size was achieved by external commentary and 39 steps, but seemingly lost its pace in the creation of Saboteur and simply re-used the once-exciting story to guide both of his previous excursions easily. Without going into larger depths, there are some movies that have bigger problems: <br /> <br /> 1. Although his face is stained on every American newspaper, the only Kane person is blind. <br /> <br /> 2. During the dinner party, Kane and Patricia do not want to drive in front of the door because bad guys can get them and say they were "gates crashers". Logically, what prevents spies from grabbing them and telling them at any time in the evening? Besides, should anyone recall that Kane is a deliberate terrorist? <br /> <br /> 3. When can the strap cut through the handcuffs? <br /> <br /> 4. No one knows him ... his face is ALL HISTORY! <br /> <br /> 5. Spies reach the ghost town with Kane and expect him to be the man who sent Freeman to work with them ... should he not have any mandate? I know spies don't run around with name tags and photo IDs, but maybe a secret handshake? <br /> <br /> 6. Cop takes Kane out of the Freeman's house, and it seems like no one recognizes this man. <br /> <br /> 7. How exactly does the FBI believe Kane has no evidence? They don't even show Kane talking to the FBI, the scene just disappears and we are forced to assume that everything is now kosher. <br /> <br /> 8. When the police at Carnival Caravan are looking for, how do they know that Kane is now with her? The blind man believed that Kane's story would not have logically reported that his daughter had been lost, kidnapped, or even more important to Kane. Why does this film not use logic? <br /> <br /> This is a current list. The film is not exciting, the plot doesn't make sense, and the world is full of people who want to welcome terrorists to their homes and cars every day because it's not a big deal. Hitchcock fails on this.
