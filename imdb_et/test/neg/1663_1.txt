Some bratty children inadvertently unleash evil that has been lying dormant for the past twenty years and have to get the bad luck that comes with it. Campbell Brothers' movie before that "Midnight Skater" was fun and their picture after "Red Skulls" was all right. So why is "Demon Summer" so bad? I really don't know, it's better than their "Splatter Rampage Wrestling", but not much as the basement works, is worthy and if "horror movie" is as talkative as it is, it's not a good thing. The story is dead in many other better films, so why are you wasting that time? <br /> <br /> My Class: D-
