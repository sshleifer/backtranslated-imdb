What the hell is that? Kelly (jennifer) seems to lose all moral behavior as soon as she arrives on the island. He thinks that Juan P (Manuel) is exotic and exotic, even though he saw his face, which he rightly or wrongly later justifies in the film? These two men are the first to find each other on the island. Kelly is completely lost in every sense, and the big Juan P can catch the fish and build a little house. Mr. Handyman. They seem to have a great time. Then Billy Zane (Jack, Kelly's character's husband) appears, and of course two days without knowing what her husband does with this proud Juan P, she's a little jealous. Billy Z is a rich stereotype and perhaps not the most beautiful man in the world. He doesn't like Juan P (if he strikes his girlfriend who can blame him? He's also arrogant, but he paid a lot of money to rent a ship and Juan P, who is a waiter / everyone who doesn't even get him a beer that's turned on for 20 min. Wouldn't you be upset, but Billy is probably the guy you want to hit your face, but at the same time he suspects he hasn't been accused because he's not accused. friends, how comfortable he just happens to be, regardless of it!). But for a strange reason, Kelly likes the girl who hits Manuel and hates Billy for being jealous. OK, Billy is overreactive, it is certain, but Kelly doesn't do much to convince him. She spends more time with Juan P and even wants her to sleep with them because she was so nice (and though Manuel yelled at her and asked her to ask her some intimate questions about her. But Kelly is so forgiving ...). Yeah, of course. And then he starts to have sex with Juan P.. It has to be said that Kelly and Billy seem to be at least an employment relationship with an island incident, they have a couple of intimate sexes and are talked about like people if they like anything else. Now you may think this scenario is possible. But really, right? Do you cheat your husband two days after the coconut island just because he is jealous and behaves drunk at the bar? (I wouldn't agree if the relationship was really bad, but the driver doesn't give much clues if that is the case). For Christ's sake, Juan P hasn't really shown himself to be a good person. Is fish catching and building a wooden house to get into someone's underpants? Without trying to communicate with Kelly's wife anyway (which would be very easy if they allowed most of the island's time alone, just respect) She doesn't care about her relationship (and Kelly doesn't understand it), she just wants to have sex with Kelly. Kelly's character is not just trustworthy (if he was tempted by Billy and another attractive girl, wouldn't he be upset or?). Or maybe he is? Billy Zane plays not a very nice person and Juan P isn't really much better than you really mean. And the bad Kelly is so confused and believes that having sex with Juan P solves everything because her husband is so strange and so aggressive to poor Juan P? So ... for all of you who read this ... What do you think about it? If you saw Kelly's character, would you consider cheating on your husband, knowing one day that you're back in real life, and maybe Billys might not be such a terrible person. He's just too jealous. And if you're the character of Billysi, what are you saying, is he totally wrong in his behavior? And the character of Juan P, what you really mean to him. One thing is for sure. Existing fuels! Ps ... The thing about Voodoo is completely wrong here! What the hell was that ?! Seriously! Someone tells me?
