The adventures of Sebastian Cole are about a boy named Sebastian (Adrian Grenier), who is becoming a writer at some point because he actually puts an effort into it. This movie is probably the years when it comes to writing your material, for the adventure years, hence the title and the previous quote. In this we experience the very typical advent of very old stories and love, drugs and sex warnings. Yes, it is easy to twist here, which is very interesting, and that is that Sebastian's father (Clark Gregg) makes a very decisive decision to get sex change, which has a big impact on Sebastian's family and his relationship with his step -Dad. <br /> <br /> Clark Gregg plays Hank / Henrietta, the father of Sebastian, and is very good in this respect, very plausible, without being up on what the film could have done quite easily. Fortunately, they didn't. Adrien Grenier, who is only familiar with Entourage, is also very good at Sebastian, and with her and Gregg has a great relationship on the screen. It is always quite interesting to look at these guys (?) In relationships when it develops and is truly heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> And that's the best thing this movie offers. Unfortunately, it brings some mediocre camera work, direction and cinematography. It is not bad, but it is far from good or least memorable. The characters are also thinly written, and it is clear how most of the arches disappear. The only truly fascinating character and through it is Clark Greggi Hank / Henrietta. I have already said that Grenier was working well, but the character of Sebastian is not only involved but is quite unlikely. I don't honestly understand why someone from the audience would direct their character in everything he does. He picks, starves, deceives, lies, and has no other endeavor than a complete skateboarder. Would it be different if he was perhaps a lateral or comic relief, but that he was the main focus and asked to take that character seriously? Come here. <br /> <br /> And I don't want to keep this movie going, but I just want to say ... choose all these movies, Hollywood! Pixies no longer know "Where is my mind", we all know it's a good song, stop using it in every other movie! <br /> <br /> I feel that I could break this film more and more, but frankly I didn't hate it. I just didn't care about it and I don't recommend it to anyone. The adventures of Sebastian Cole are not a bad or boring film, it is not very good or interesting. It is very uneven and the script may have used quite a lot of work. I think the idea of ​​the film is to have an endless look at the writer's life before he did it, and it worked ... when that writer put out fiction that I wouldn't want to read.
