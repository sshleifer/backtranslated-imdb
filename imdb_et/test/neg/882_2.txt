My husband brought this home from a video store, so I could see something at home when I got sick. Such a sick person, where you can never focus on the book, but sorta foolish, light, romantic flick sounds just right (this and the bowl of chicken soup). Well, he thought well. <br /> <br /> My first thought (as some others have posted here) was that the house must be fake ... it is not isolated only on the beach, but placed on the bridges with loose sand and so close to the ocean that the surf waves go straight under the house! It seems so dangerous (in the hurricane country, FALL), so potentially catastrophic, that I was sure the filmmakers were just CGI all the way (or used the magic of the movie to surf the cute B & B). <br /> <br /> But I have to tell you that thanks to "interwebs" I can say that the house, "Serendipity" is very real, is really close to Rodanthe, and except for some window blinds and shrubs, mostly appears in the movie . You can rent it yourself, the season is $ 1,710 a week ($ 3,850 in the summer)! Do it! But ... interestingly, the house has serious problems. Another thing that hit me after "wash" was "what are plumbing / electric? In this surfing?" And "Serendipity" was certainly condemned for the sanitary attack caused by the overflow of the ocean. (They are redevelopment.) <br /> <br /> And the house is not a "civil war". Not to mention that Viola Davis, who plays the "best friend of the cliché black" (the ungrateful role of the admirable actress), is not long enough for her GRANDMOTHER to have built something in the civil war! WELCOME! it was 150 years ago! Try the big one! (In fact, "Serendipity" was built in 1988, ridiculously recently.) <br /> <br /> The main film is built on a typical Nicholas Sparks, which means a lot of coincidence and despises the predictable event. It is also directed at a very distressing path towards "women" - we know our women who love B & Bs, bumpy antiques and tricks ... who dream of romance and boys who look like Richard Gere and moonlight. Don't give us a plot or a thoughtful character; just set up some mechanisms and create love scenes! <br /> <br /> Gere plays a plastic surgeon who lost a woman's patient during a normal surgical operation with a benign cyst. Of course he died because of an anesthesia overdose, so you don't know why the surgeon is guilty, not an anesthesiologist! WELCOME! where is this guy? Why is the wrong doctor guilty? <br /> <br /> Gere has come to rush and confront a wife's wife and stay in a distant B & B ... who should be there, why ONLY OTHER PERSON INN ... Diane Lane! She is a lonely, rotten child, and a former hubby who wants her back. Although he is trying to decide on it, the cliché is the best black friend in his guest house B&B. <br /> <br /> Now, in the real world, once this setting ever happened, the doctor would look like Ernest Borgnine ... and a lonely divorce, like Rosie O'Donnell. He spent his holidays horndogging 22-year-old girls on the beach when he faded and thought about going to a diet. But this is not a real world; The couple confesses everything, in love, hurricane ... they love, fall in love, he has to go, he dies and he cries a lot. End. <br /> <br /> I've saved you there; now you do not have to meet yourself or the men (spouses, boys, boys) through this horror. Someone else asked why Diane Lane, the perfect little woman (to whom the filmmakers love, because she's pretty and thin, that most women would like to see her, but she's 45 and not over, so she's not intimidating) is constantly covered with big hell. It would make sense if he were fat but he wasn't. <br /> <br /> In any case, throw someone in this movie with a beautiful, paisley towel. So we don't have to look at it. Conclusion: Read the book if you are not too ill. Too sick, go to bed.
