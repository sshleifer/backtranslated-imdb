Despite a small handful of beautifully executed scenes, this entry (fourth) feels tired. Toshiharu Ikeda, who led the excellent MERMAID LEGEND and Japanese splatter film EVIL DEAD TRAP, shows little enthusiasm for the exaggerated assumption. <br /> <br /> An error that occurs externally by a conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porn photo shoot. Predictable pursuit, harassment, attack and rape occur. <br /> <br /> Rome porn staple is sex. And sex is mixed with violence. Both are potentially exciting topics to be sure, but not when you make so little effort to make them fresh. The masturbation scene where a woman reaches the pencil in her hole (through a condom) is too late. The complex rain motif continues and the last scene in the movie brings relief.
