First of all, this film is so confused that it is almost impossible to summarize because I did not understand this terrible story. In addition, the unknown cast, led by an actor named Laura Mennell, is simply terrible. The expressions and screams of the Sara Tobias character are ridiculous and ridiculous, confusing grimaces. Last but not least, IMDbis has many favorable comments on this flick as follows: <br /> <br /> - Upper notch - Can't wait to see more directors? the author has only one review in IMDb on September 24, 2004; <br /> <br /> - Incredibly fired, amazingly intense? the author has only one review on IMDb on August 12, 2004; <br /> <br /> - It's not your typical blood and gore, actually better. 7/10? the author has only one review in IMDb on February 13, 2005. <br /> <br /> - as intense as the Asian horror !! - The author has only one review on 14 November 2004 in IMDbis. <br /> <br /> Coincidence? Or are they parents, relatives, friends or people whose production has been employed to advertise it? My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11.11? A Nova Profecia" ("11.11? New Prophet")
