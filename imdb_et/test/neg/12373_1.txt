It's a terrible sci-fi / horror movie from 1957. In fact, despite Ed Wood, Jr. and his terrible films that have made a lot of publicity, this turkey is still as bad as the worst of wood. Now the actor is a bit better than Wood's epic (like PLAN 9 and MONSTER BRIDE), but the special effects were much worse than Wood's! But the bad film enthusiasts are happy to hear that it's so bad that it's still a great watch. Like a movie, it's nice to watch this crap-fest and laugh with your friends. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a scientist who says he is testing his jet. However, there are no UFO tapes away, and his report on the radio is caused by the air force panic. But later they realized that the UFO didn't appear on the radio and they think the scientist is a nut! But when the planes disappear shortly thereafter, they realize that there must be something in his observation. <br /> <br /> So far, the movie is not very big, but it's traceable. But by the time you see a terrible flying monster, you know you're looking at turkey. First, the planes change with the use of films and dirty models in fear of flight alternation. Some may not bother it, but lovers of the plane like I saw that F-80 became F-102 as a F-102 fighter plane, it turned me crazy - especially since the planes didn't look similar. Secondly, through "smart" cinematography, everything that a monster actually sees is a semi-flashing fuzzi ball! It is frustrating and you hope that when you finally see it, you should wait. Well, no such luck! "Monster" looks less realistic or scary than the bull Groucho "You Bet Your Life" TV show !! In fact, it is far less realistic than any giant Japanese monster! In fact, Big Bird from "Sesame Street" is even a bit more frightening and more realistic !!! It is just divine-terrible in every sense and can just be a dumb-out movie monster in history - about as bad (or worse) as monsters in ROBOT MONSTER or TEACHERS AT THE OUTSIDE! The bottom line is that it is an absolutely terrible movie that people don't like. Bad movie fans like me (who's a crazy bunch) love it! All the others ... fear, .... be very scared! <br /> <br /> FYI - You may notice that some of the clips from this movie come from other sci-fi movies! I'm positive that EARTH VS was stolen by a crash scene of Washington Monuments. FLIGHT SAUCERS, but I also saw a couple of other scenes I swear, from other movies. What a hack job!
