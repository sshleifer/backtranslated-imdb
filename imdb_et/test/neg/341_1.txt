We need a deep breath for it ... <br /> <br /> Terrible special effects that tried to reach beyond the budget. The blatant and shameless plagiarism of other sci-fi movies like Pitch Black. Terrible action. Endless slow scene characters running endlessly over the sand dunes. Meandering dialog that does nothing to further this story. Characters wear turtle-necked sweaters on a desert with two suns. "Cargo" ship, equipped with a masking army team (why should you still be a woodpecker in the room?). Some of the worst election choices in history, where film making is not a budget - a steroid-"master" who is more than a muscle beach jock as a trusted leader, and a "convict" who looks and acts as a dangerous rabbit as a rabbit. 70 minutes, of which 35 could have been cut if the director had the concept of "time compression editing" ... <br /> <br /> I will not go further. Suffice it to say that although some of the components of this terrifying film are (and should) forgive because of its low budget; The bad concept, ridiculous holes in the plot and the snarling script are * in every * budget unforgivable. The end result is tedious, boring, a waste of time. Excuse me, boys, I hate to be so harsh about the amateur film, but you are not an excuse for doing this job.
