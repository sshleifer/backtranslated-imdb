The sometimes memorable dialogue between Scenario Frederick Fox and the study of the old professionals cannot save this lukewarm western whites that have deserted by the blood-sensitive Cheyenne Indians band. In addition to its occasionally memorable dialogue, the Fox scenario does not find any surprise about its white-indian mid-invasion. The "Dakota Incident" characters are of little interest, certainly not enough to make them as much as Fox's chosen dialogue. Unfortunately, a good dialogue is only Fox's only bet, because this normal little sagebrusher wears an insecure tip that runs counter to the last 80 minutes. The end result is as easy as they come and lack credibility. Most symbols are sympathetic, but some simply lack common sense. <br /> <br /> Dale Robertson is appropriately harsh and leathery when John Banner is one of the three bank robbers who keep their little - no accounts. Veteran Western character John Doucette (Rick Largo) appreciates the best men, while Skip Homeier is wasted as an insignificant role as Banner's brother, Frank Banner, later dies of an Indian arrow. Doucette tries to arm the Banner at the beginning of his activities, but our left-handed arms hero frustrates his death, then watches Largo and hitting him with Christian Flats. Naturally, Largo bites dust this time, but Banner makes an interesting discovery. One of the passengers from Christian Flats to Laramie was nothing but a banknote from which he stole money. John Carter (John Lund) has not only been looking for a banner, but he also wants his good name with his bank, which has issued the desired posters for his arrest. Apparently, the authorities have erred and expanded Carter's role in robbery. Carter is ready to take Banner to Laramie and give him the right, but Banner has other ideas about Laramie. Banner ideas change when she crosses the road with Amy Clarke (former Twentieth Century Fox beauty Linda Darnell), wearing a bright red dress and still packing pretty. As everyone else mentioned in their comments here, Truecolor Studio brings out all the red, from Darnell's pulling equipment to the blood flowing to the ground. The problem with director Lewis Foster, who handles this mill-oyster, is that it all strikes after stagecoach loses the wheel and our heroes open up in a dry wash to defend themselves against Cheyenne. The good guys and Cheyenne will end up with ammunition, but "Dakota Incident" has never run out of clich√©s. Ward Bond has many interesting moments as a politically correct politician who protects red skin. By the time this 88-minute dust catcher comes to a conclusion, you will feel like you are in the gulch and threatened Cheyenne himself.
