I read a lot of time about Jane Austen and praised several cinema / TV adjustments, but what we just don't need. <br /> <br /> The rating is 2 because I'm not saying it's terrible so boring that you feel you're wasting 90 minutes of your life. An unknown script that even fits with a dull example. I've heard Billie Piper is dr. Whois (no fan so can not be confirmed) but in it he just sucks. There is no chemistry between the stoves. It's Austen, it should be romance! <br /> <br /> Please don't let this go down from Austen or historical dramas. There are many better programs to watch.
