This movie is the standard funny sci-fi price of the 50s. In its favor, the plot can pull a foreign invasion without actually producing aliens. But come now, when foreigners need energy and could absorb it from sources such as hydrogen bombs, why did they come to earth? Why should they not just suck out of STAR? The only reliable reason for the presence of Kronos is the direct attack on Earth's society, not just energy gathering. Nothing like this has even been implied; Kronos can be built with a higher race, but its action on Earth is the most primitive. Finally, the Kronos scholar-hero plan is based not only on a pseudo-scientific giant. It is a "polar reverse" gambit that has been used in so many bad scifiers as it has become a joke. Low and look, this causes our unwanted visitor to get rid of the energy collected. No one in power seems to care about the effect that the release of the energy (which at the end of the film contains, among other things, the total yield of the hydrogen bomb) on the surrounding environment. And unfortunately, at the end of the movie, the neighborhood is in the suburb of Los Angeles. Oops!
