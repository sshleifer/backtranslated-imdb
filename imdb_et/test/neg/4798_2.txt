Just saw Coronado ... Here's the only line they sold, "FX team behind Independence Day". I think it says a lot. We're talking about writers, directors, actors ... <br /> <br /> This is a cute little adventure story set in the Mid America Banana Republic, but the story is thin. <br /> <br /> All the way through the movie I had to think about how much this movie looks like some computer gaming games. Although FXs are good, they are too often visible. Like CG styles like Command'n'Conquer. <br /> <br /> You know almost immediately that this particular truck, background, bridge, castle or jet fighter has never existed. The look is smooth and nice, but not up to the standard we've been waiting for Action Adventures today. The film does not have much obvious on-site filming. <br /> <br /> Functional, less than average, and FXs are nice but not a feature film. I'm not surprised that this thing went straight to video / DVD. <br /> <br />
