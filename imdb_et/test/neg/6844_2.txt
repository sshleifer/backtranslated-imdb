The movie theater, which has a bad history of the recent murders of murders, will reopen. Of course, bloody killings begin again. Written, staged, shot, scanned and edged terrible and imperfect shortage by Rick Sloane (who later embarrassed the celluloid with an absolutely frightening "Hobgoblins"), this intimidating ham-fisted attempt to hit a blow through a somewhat rotten mindset: painfully sleepy silence, painfully static, grainy cinematography (there is an amazing surplus of drab-masterpieces), annoying droning and redundant hum'n'shiver-synthesizer, flat (non) direction, annoyingly talkative and uneven scenario, weak inducing sophomorphic low sense of humor, bloodless murders, pathetically uneven killer (he's just some wrinkled-old men pastas make-up), evenly unpleasant and unpleasant characters, unhappy steep end and lifeless performances noticeably uninspired cast all to ensure that watching this schlocky swill is about as fun and rewarding as eating sour raw eels that have been acidified Ã¤dikas. This crud doesn't have enough raw charm and enjoyable junk. Instead, it is just a spooky, tiring, and curvy rigid that never comes down or even becomes very entertaining from so dirty-su-smoking. Only the nakedness and the ever-trusted presence of Mary Woronov as a snarky, sardonic secretary will give a little bit of anxiety about this mild loser.
