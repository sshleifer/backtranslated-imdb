Radio is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen while one of the worst. It made me laugh in the places where you had to cry, and put me in the moments you had to laugh at. it lacked any character development that is usually important for sentimental flick. Some of the questions why Harris's character under his wing radio is not explained correctly, and I'm sure their relationship (which is the main aspect of the movie) is the most pointless thing ever seen. br /> who continues to give Cuban Gooding youth work, he is a devil actor and should be severely tortured until he takes on another manpower. <br /> <br /> As true stories, it's not that interesting. p.s why I said that this is one of the best films I've ever seen is that, despite being a complete piece of paper, I still enjoyed it. laughing at the script and most of the monos, which is really the work of idiots or someone's very wise, trying to show how easy it is to get rid of the embarrassing movie retard that gets everyone's favorite game. The fact is that Cuba's character is a comedy feed for people watching football matches.
