Warn about the row on the back of the box that promotes a story that includes "over sex". There is no redemption for Carrie 2. The piece is absurd, acting terrible and the end is too predictable. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect a masterpiece, but I was looking forward to it. I wasn't. The only way I could watch this movie was that I was in a relative's house when I was waiting for my car to be fixed. If the same situation is not far from this movie.
