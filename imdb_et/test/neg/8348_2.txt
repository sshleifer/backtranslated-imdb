This movie is a disaster movie. It's full of big scenes that make sense when you throw away the feeling of reality. Let's see the word wise, the stage burns you; steam burns you. You can't stand on the stage. Guideing a small lava flow is difficult, let alone important. Scares me to think that some might really believe in seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> Even worse, a large number of talents went into making this movie. I mean, this is really very good. Impacts are above average. It is hard to believe that someone read the scripts and promised to waste all this talent. I think my suggestion would be that when this movie starts on TV ... look! It's like a train wreck: it's so terrible that if you know what's coming, you just have to look. Take a look and spend your time on more meaningful content.
