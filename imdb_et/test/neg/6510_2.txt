The plot is based on a number of incredibly unlikely coincidences; there is a bouncing theory that would be much more tasty if we didn't know that Seagal would take it all literally; and again, the bad-film multi-millionaire Seagal tells us rich riches. <br /> <br /> Survival of Seagals usually depends on the fact that Bad Guys will never come out of your firearms and you always want to give a little "I'll kill your call" before we blow the man's head. <br /> <br /> Watch it right after the worse fire * Come down * and note how the carpet in Keenen's Cote d'Ivoire apartment is more flammable than the big gasoline cup. <br /> <br /> Oh, and look at the latest struggle for an amazing disappearing forehead wound, which is probably the most interesting thing. film.
