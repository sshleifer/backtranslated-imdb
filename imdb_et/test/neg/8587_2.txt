This noisy, dizzying filmmaker, Oliver Stone, seems to have been cast in everybody - all except William H. Macy, who could have dealt with the role of Mr. Stone, team doctors or "fruitcake" for selling grain. . If you're a fan of evil, there are some great, despicable copies, dragons, raised phrases that you can try with two-face friends and lovers of pretenses. The film is sometimes good as a lively background party atmosphere, especially in the first two hours; it even includes some MTV-style music video scenes. <br /> <br /> ** Every given Sunday (12/16/99) Oliver Stone ~ Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid
