Some movies are simply unexplained fools. This is one of them. Words cannot justify a woody, stupid line and an increasingly predictable result. The only thing that makes this movie halfway is that it has little clad women (and your ladies). The military and the head of Valeria are quite attractive to the eye. But it's about all this movie has done it. <br /> <br /> Some foolish point: One scene when they start driving the Dark Nest, they walk away from the allegedly destroyed land. But we are clearly seeing their New York in the 1980s. About two-thirds of this movie looks like it was filmed in a high school basement. Deadly sock dolls look so frightening as the Sami street monster. I have to agree with Latronic that many of the 1950 trash bins did a better job. The only thing I think it was was the teenagers outside the courtroom.
