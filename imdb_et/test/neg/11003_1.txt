This movie is terrible - honestly. The action is terrible, the script made me brighter, the effects are totally bad (which I usually dislike about older movies, but it was done just two years ago) and all this just irritates me. Some friends go to the Halloween forest and meet a witch and her cannibal son. Of course, before this clich√© "You really believe that ha ha ha, it's just a story" routine out for some time. The witch cannibal son was made a retard (I don't know if it was comedy or it would be horrible, but this movie didn't work for both). It has a minimal whore and nudity that made the bad movie even worse. Heck, the only good thing about this movie is eating the legs, and even what could be better. <br /> <br /> Frankly, don't even waste your time looking at the cable and be sure not to buy or rent it, otherwise you'll be wasting time wasting something more constructive or fun.
