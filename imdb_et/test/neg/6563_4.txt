Star Trek V definitely serves as a dubious distinction as the weakest film in the Star Trek series. Despite the good behavior of the participants, it suffered from the lack of general funding for Paramount Pictures. Paramount Pictures was not enthusiastic about the film from the start. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a business team using their extended shore vacation to recreate the Earth's entire ecological disaster. Nimbus III, the planet of Intergalactic Peace, is disturbed by their shore vacation. Captain Kirk and Enterprise will only reach Nimbus III for their ship to be hijacked by Sybok, Spock's brother. Sybok rinses the company team and puts it on a suicide mission to gather with "God" just along the big barrier in the middle of our galaxy. Captain Kirk then has to find out how to restore his ship's control and displace the clone of the company. William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Laurence Luckinbill and the rest give good results. William Shatner is also doing a good job of managing this film. <br /> <br /> But the film suffers from a lack of enthusiasm and funding. First, Sybok's share was offered to Sean Connery, but he refused. That's how Laurence became part of Luckinbill. Second, many special effects were severely cut ... reducing entertainment. Third, the scene that represents the arrival of a big barrier was much desired. Finally, in this film, the romance between Scotty and Uhura was not at all worthwhile ... considering that such romance has never happened before in the Star Trek universe and never explained how such a romance might suddenly realize Star Treks IV and V. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very weak film. You should probably just skip this movie and move on to Star Trek VI. After all, the majority and the team made part of the Star Trek VI to get out of the attack after Trak V.
