usually, i would say i loved this movie. does not work though it was a script for OK, which was so-so. That's why I would usually have loved this movie for intense activity that begins to go and doesn't stop before the final credit role.but, the problem with this movie, and I felt it was The big problem was terrible CGI.it looks like they run out of money and could not stop the effects of shots. many effects are seen in the lime, which is in their very harsh forms. Because it is obvious that they didn't have enough money to finish the movie, they shouldn't release it. does not care for the consumer to produce a proper final product. If not, I'd give this film a much higher rating.
