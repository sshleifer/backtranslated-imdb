I don't know if I'm wrong or all those who say that this movie is good, sincerely, I just want to serve people who have doubts about seeing it, renting it, or even worse buying (don't really do it!). <br /> <br /> Trailers and very early previews may look funny in some way or another, but not at all funny, you probably fall into the back-scenes that tend to get into really bad jokes, bad bad actions, tasteless scenes, cheesy effects; this movie is everything, everything is wrong, that is. <br /> <br /> Like the last comment, the movie would have been funny because of the basic concept, but I think it's really far from it.
