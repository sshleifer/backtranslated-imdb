This is your typical junk comedy. <br /> <br /> Almost no laugh. There are no real moments. There are no memorable features. There are no scenes where you think "it was smart". Something. The plot is embarrassingly bad. <br /> <br /> It's ugly and boring like hell! There is no substance here. There's nothing in this movie. It doesn't matter if Farely was in it or not. Crap is the one who is involved. <br /> <br /> David Spade is also a terribly unpleasant comedian who ever plays the same terrifying movie / TV show. <br /> <br /> This movie was dead on arrival. There is no life here. Not fun. No intelligence. There are many other "stupid" comedies that are more enjoyable. This film is simply pathetic. <br /> <br /> 2/10
