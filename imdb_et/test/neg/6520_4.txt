Nothing means this movie in terms of what is spiritual or evil. It's just terrible. Unknown is photography --- the stock of the film seems old and faded and washed out. Maybe it was even 16mm blown up to 35mm, dunno. Bored is a script that is annoying and "Jules Pfeiffer" ish. It's a 1960s bossa-nova cocktail party. Like our beatnik, grandparents would have spoken if they were really trying to appear straight. The "slices of life" characters were mostly annoying. True, they were real in life, but hey, if I wanted to see really ordinary people doing the real everyday and the usual thing, I would look at myself. I won't trap the cinema and hit five in four and evening watching someone else do it. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a funny, brilliant rom-com. I liked what two intelligent and moderately talented people, 19 or 20, could produce on their first day with a new camcorder. <br /> <br /> I gave it to 4 out of 10 because it appears that someone tried at least.
