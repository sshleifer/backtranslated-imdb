This miniseries / movie was sometimes so terrible that I almost stopped and turned it off. I am a great fan of the novel, but this film has many problems. The costume is bad and many emotionally charged scenes are blass. The deviations of the novel are poorly chosen, important nuances are skipped or rewritten. <br /> <br />
