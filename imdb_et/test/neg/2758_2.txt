drab morale story high school kid who is pretty much now stereotyped nerd. He's smart, but he doesn't have friends, social skills, or a lazy loser from a man who borrows money from HIM. Pretty girl hits her (she should have known she wants something, she should be smart, right?). He manipulates the poor desperate stupid man by writing his own Shakespeare magazine, which the teacher immediately knows he couldn't write. She loses the trust of her girlfriend (not that she ever was) with her teacher and her college scholarship, all in one fell swoop. <br /> <br /> Marv is so stupid and desperate for love that he decides to rob some heroin dealers running in the store he's doing. Then maybe this trick is a little bitch impressive and wants to marry her. Sad, really sad. Marv is such a pathetic rope (and probably a smart man. I mean, I'm trying to rob drug dealers? Has this boy taken off?) The girl naturally tells her boyfriend about her kidnapped marvist and talks about her and her sons, Marv and the company, to steal money. They try to do it and several people are able to shoot in the process. The cops appear at the same time, and the idiot Marv is pulled away, which is shameful forever. I know that this thing was aimed at teenagers' behavior, showing them the consequences of bad behavior, but all this was truly illustrated by the consequences of stupid behavior. What of course is the premature end of your film career. Well, Marv, we never knew. And thank you for that.
