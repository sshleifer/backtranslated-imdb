This movie is not so good at all. It's pretty stupid, pretty annoying and very badly made. I really just saw this movie because one of my friends said they hated this movie. However, I found it to be a bad movie. The only thing that is far from good is that it was somewhat fun at times, and I also feel that if it were a little better, it would have been just as good. formulated, it would not look like a film festival, and if the script had been repaired, it would have been a good slip film. is not, but what is now, a dirty movie. The show is cruel that I felt like I was watching a couple of teenagers act like a Halloween show or a Thrill ride or something. film itself) and basically everything else is low class. In general, this movie is really bad and you wouldn't miss out if you decided to skip this movie. <br /> <br /> 3.8 out of 10 stars
