What I liked best about this flick was the chance to see Joan Woodbur, who honored me as one of the many ornaments in Charles Boyer's classic "Algiers" leadership role. He also goes well with Rita, an orphan who rises so that it would be a good lady as a superior to crime. His rise to the top reminds me of Joan Crawford's signs, eg. Mildred Pierce, who is realizing his ambition with determination and determination. If you are looking for a movie noir classics, look better elsewhere. In many places it is difficult to know where this story goes. First of all, it had the impression that it covered Rita's plot against revenge against the father and son who beat him to take the rap out of the drunken death committed by his son. But payback was only a small point and a springboard to the somewhat confusing part of the film, where Rita is increasingly involved in urban corruption. Anyway, it's only 72 minutes, so the second look should cancel all the blur. My copy is in the platinum box of "Mobster Movies". The picture quality is good, but the soundtrack sucks, skipping the dialog with fragments. The $ 5.50 box has eight movies that make every movie fair with 69 cents. Look for Anne Archer's father, John Archer, like Bob Rita's childhood friend. Alan Ladd doesn't get much on the screen. This is definitely a picture of Joan Woodbury.
