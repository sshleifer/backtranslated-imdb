If a few days before the film's premiere, he will give up his screenplay and demand that his name be removed from the credits, you know that it is not good. <br /> <br /> The books on which "Wiedzmin" is based have great potential for a lively fantasy movie? "Geralt de Rivia is a witch, his only purpose is to destroy the monsters that cover the world. But not all monsters are looking for evil and not all the righteous are good?" But all that wasn't important when the Polish film crew, who had a low budget and little appreciation for Sapkowski's work, decided to make it a 13-part mini-series. A two-hour movie is a by-product of their activities to maximize profits. <br /> <br /> In this case, it's not difficult to point out what makes this movie bad. Draw (inconsistent, thanks to too many stories) by acting (below average except Zebrowski), adding dialogues (bliss), editing (dirty), special effects (intolerable), and choreography (poor), add up to the overall bad experience of the movie. Only the soundtrack made by Grzegorz Ciechowski highlights the beauty of the "Wiedzmin" world that was never put on the screen. Even Poland's magnificent flora and fauna (with the participation of "The Chronicles of Narnia: Lion, Witch and Wardrobe"), which was an essential element of almost any fantasy film, was not fully utilized. The more I think about this dead loss, the more I do not speak. At least, it is convenient to know that "Wiedzmin" manager Marek Brodzki has since directed only one film (in addition to Germany). <br /> <br /> At the moment, we have missed the top-notch fantasy and fantastic computer RPG (which appeared in 2007), referring to Wiedzmin's books. But I am sure that one day we will be doing justice to the Wiedzmin saga and we will be treated fast enough to adapt to the film.
