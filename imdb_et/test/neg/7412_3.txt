Well, I read other comments. He didn't think it would have been good, but decided to record it anyway. Maybe not so smart to read all the poor comments before watching this movie, because of course I would notice all the same strange things. Using too dark to black out, a few weird camera corners and cross sections that allow you to chat with the same people at different times! But all I was thinking of myself: Well, it would probably be boring if it all happened chronologically. Chats are not so exciting, but mandatory. And, in the case of really short scenes, becoming black will continually worsen so that the story is too interesting. Skipping bored bits. At the end of the movie, it becomes a bit exciting. Will they survive? <br /> <br /> So I really liked this movie? Not really. The director had some interesting ideas on how to keep the audience bored when trying to introduce the characters. But he's over it. It gets annoying and sometimes confusing. It was probably just another film he directed, so he might be studying and doing really good things in the future. And when you sit there (in the future), reading whether the famous movie's second film is worth it. Well, if he's good in the future, look at that crap and wonder how he ever did the third. Otherwise, this movie is not really worth it if you are not very interested in making movies, and you want to see how you can reduce the mandatory boring introductory scene to something traceable.
