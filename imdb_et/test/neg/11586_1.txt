I just hit this Showtime ... ewwwwwww, not even in a fun movie. One of the flattering monsters I've ever seen. In addition, the film's reporter was annoyed by Jerri who had passed the Survivor season. The only fun thing was that the "secret base" was a Fantasy Island house (and a million other movies and TV shows; the place is in the L.A region). I waited for the visitors of Roarke and Tattoo to visit and greet. If the tattoo had been eaten by a snake, it could have been 2, but well. Watching people stands there and screams for five minutes, while Komodo or cobra wore them rather funny, especially because you could really say that they just scream in an empty place where computer animators later paint a monster. I dropped out of my chair almost when they came to the rebound either in beaver or komodo - then in normal size - into an indestructible solid steel container, some of which were drilled with holes. Wasn't the wire drill enough? LOL! You think they can't rent a real como and a cobra. I have to remember that I rent Showtime for my series and not for those movies.
