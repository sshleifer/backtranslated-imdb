I've heard a lot of new bird flu that has killed dozens of people in Southeast Asia over the last three years. Obviously, it is a little stuck to mutate into something very infectious and millions of people are being destroyed during a global pandemic. I thought I'd mention it if you don't want to write your will. <br /> <br /> I also thought I would mention this because I was looking at something that was called CARRIERS tonight. t for naval warfare, but it opens with a scene that is between OUTBREAK and many years of X-episode. I thought I was looking at something that had additional resonance after listening to the risks caused by avian influenza, but after a non-discovering opening, CARRIERS falls into a cheap and joyful TVM and, like every other TVM, you see the leading figures of one of the percussionists, while when the other driver is the mother of young children. Needless to say, too much is a sick child. What irritates the TVM form is that it exceeds the potential that could have been a very good movie for the cinema. There's a pretty gentle scene for someone's blood all over the nurses face and a very impressive jay walker to get a run on the stunt, but these bits are quickly forgotten because the mood falls on the family sentiment because it - And almost every other TVM ever made - was mostly a female audience
