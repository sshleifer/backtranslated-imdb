I've just finished watching this movie and for me .... it takes time to finish because it's so boring ..... and the story is very bad. <br /> <br /> Now ... where should I start .... O .... the movie is called "Japanese drowning" .... yes yes ... it shows Japan is actually sinking, but the action section is very bad. Compare to "Tomorrow after Day" if I rated it at least 8/10. <br /> <br /> "Japanese drowning" doesn't show much about the catastrophe that actually happens to us. eyes. not much excitement ... boring ... i can say ... <br /> <br /> one more point ... i would recommend this movie with a better title ... maybe something like "Japanese drowning romance" because this film has many talks (waste of time ... talking about crap) and the love story is very boring and has dragged too long ... honestly .. I almost get frustrated. <br /> <br /> Generally ... this movie doesn't show enough details about disasters, like many people running like hell to avoid death .. love story part was very touching enough for me. <br /> <br /> But hey ... there is one thing we should appreciate about this movie. it's got good songs!
