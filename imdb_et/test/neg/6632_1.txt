It shouldn't have been a movie. All this was idiotic and I don't think I even smiled once. There were bits and pieces that were okay, but that's it. Many parts were amazingly similar to many other movies that made them much better. There were some famous actors / actors, but nobody did a good job, they just didn't have to take care. This is one of those films that is trying to end the "cute", but it was so idiotic that literally there were no redemptive values. Carrot Top is probably the worst comedian. Make your preference and avoid it! <br /> <br /> Final Decisions: <br /> <br /> Movies: NOOOOO! <br /> <br /> Buy DVD: Absolutely Not! <Br /> <br /> Rent: Only if you have seen everything else and you have a free coupon, but even then it is still not worth it.
