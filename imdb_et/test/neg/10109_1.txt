Well, I start from this: I love horror films, not even the worst plot or the most unpleasant terrible factor destroys the experience until there is a certain amount of gore and intercourse. Secondly; this is the worst film of all time. It even wins the average weapons and killer-tomato attack. And I pay for that respect. <br /> <br /> But inadvertent humor was still funny until half of the movie was over, after which everything was so sad. To my surprise, the reviews were somewhat divided; and you guys who rated it from C-movie-crap 7 and up; I know you are! GOOD ONE !! HAHAHA! Because if there is any reason in the world and we have only a small concept of what quality is; you can't be pretty. <br /> <br /> Everything you need to mention about the content is already well summarized so I leave it. <br /> <br /> MY SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> But a scene where a hidden rubber mask guy pulls a woman back and forth through a dog cell for ten minutes so it's a terrible music score and a mind-blowing dialogue really this for me.
