This is a bad film because its central message is very confusing and the plot seems to be the result of combining several different scripts. As a result, there is no point in making any sense at all, and certainly this film was not proud of it by Miss Dunne or Huston Huston. However, the film is worth watching if you are a fan of "pre-code" movies, because it has an amazingly weak scheme that strongly says that nice girls do it - even if they're not married and even if their partner is IS !! <br /> <br /> The film begins with Miss Dunne as a social worker who helps soldiers who guide Europe to WWI. In the process he meets a scalawa (Bruce Cabot) who finally persuades him to fall asleep. She gets pregnant and then goes to the next malicious woman. But Miss Dunne doesn't want her back because she realizes she's not worth it, but later she dies when she is born. Although all of these very controversial elements of the plot are used, they are always referred to - almost as if they wanted the adults of the audience to know, but they hoped that if they were correctly expressing or filming, the children of the audience failed (after the films were not evaluated and the children could currently participate in any film). <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, it will end the entire plot associated with the dead baby and Cabot. and it is never mentioned or referred to. It would be like filming part of the movie and giving up on it - dealing with another movie. In the second stage of the movie, Miss Dunne unexpectedly starts working in a female prison (although we don't really see her seeing anything). What we are seeing is countless terrible scenes with serious abuse and torture, which are obviously meant to be troubled. And as a result of all this violence, Miss Dunne continues the Crusade to clean the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writer. <br /> <br /> Then another type of film will appear in blue. and women's prison reform business goes aside. Dunne meets a judge (Walter Huston) who is married but desperately wants her. Now the whole movie, Dunne, has been portrayed as a very good girl - although she had a married couple with Cabot (she was more or less disappointed). But now, lonely Irene, who is a tireless reformer and a good lady, starts to fall asleep. She tells her that she and her husband are alienated and are married only under the name, but she never thinks to investigate whether this is true, and with her certainty she will reduce her clothes and they are a child making business! BUT, if she is pregnant with her loving child, she is the accused as a curator. He assures him that he is innocent, but he has been convicted and it is certain he is buggy - using inside information from people who have come before his bench to gather happiness. Then Miss Dunne tries to release the movie in vain at the last moments and allow her to wait with her child until Huston is released. So the movie ends. <br /> <br /> So we have basically three separate movies and a strange early 30s idea of ​​what a nice girl should be. I gathered that she should be a strong-minded girl who will be an idiot right now in her personal relationship! It completely disproves all the positive aspects of Dunne's character and it is really hard to imagine someone who likes the film. A strong defender of women's rights can easily be offended by how weak and poor she is and religious people see her as completely immoral or at least morally suspicious! In the case of a decent rewrite, it could have been a good movie or at least an interesting movie if it was a fun and cheerful movie, but it couldn't remember what he wanted to be and was another dull Pre-Code movie.
