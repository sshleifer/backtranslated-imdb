I read all the other comments that made this movie a great movie. I didn't see anything mentioned in the excellence. I thought it was long and boring. I tried to look at it twice. The first time I went to bed and the second time I did it in six minutes after the end and gave up. I think it was mostly my fault, but I don't think it would have completely ruined my movie. The film was just happier. It had nothing that was remarkable or unique for it. The plot was not half bad, there were no sequences of action, the dialogue was forced and the film just went on forever. I don't recommend seeing this movie.
