This movie was very boring. I laughed a few times. I decided to rent it when I noticed William Shatner's name on the cover. It's all that little boy who always chooses with his classmates. As she travels the streets looking for old lady, she meets a prostitute. He takes him to a club called a playground where he comes in contact with his friends. If Mayor Tony Gold (Shatner) decides to take over the pimp business, Lil 'Pimp has to plan for his home troops. <br /> <br /> Animation is not very good at this. It seems to have been done with Macromedia, which I am sure of. It's not a miracle, it's just a kind of nervous flash animation that people have used in recent years. Its humor is not very good, I didn't think it would be funny.
