I know that so many IMDb comments are extreme, because reviewers either praise the film or tear it partially. I find that neither of these reviews is useful, and so I do not give this film a terrible overview. The film is the scientific literature of the worst artworks dressed as a Hollywood band. Trailers pull you in, showing you what appears to be a single plot, but is actually just a small part of a deliberate series of events that have never been properly resolved. I like movies that challenge the viewer and I don't have to be spoon-fed so my complaint against this movie isn't that it's too high. No - the movie is just terrible. Like a credit roll, you feel a real hatred of wasting your time on Cameron Diaz's wood and distressing plot line. Avoid.
