It's strange, this movie; you get the impression that the makers of this punctuation art spent more time at local bars than at the set. In fact, it is a surprise that Harry Alan does not see the name of the towers on the credits; this is definitely a taste of one of its shelters, but here it seems that the motivation of the project seems to be a long stay for all participants in Provence. Despite the fact that the film should take place across the region, Les Baux and its surroundings are almost all. <br /> <br /> David Birney makes an eye-catching colorless hero - as Michael Lonsdale says at one point, "you are a walking clinic". What Lonsdale does is anybody's guess. For some reason, the most intriguing character played by Rampling has disappeared, while despite the book he would have been a key figure because he probably has the skills to transport the film (which would have been boring, but at least we could have seen something more beautiful) ). <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a pointless thing that is just worth seeing how an actionless action may be.
