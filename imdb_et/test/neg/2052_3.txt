What on earth? Like looking at the neighbors' episode after drinking, two bottles of cough medicine - a nightmare and no idea at all. Waiting for the wise part, where everything fits and saves the movie. Maybe it was there and I just left it or lost me. <br /> <br /> My strongest suspicion is that it is a thin hidden attempt to market a new drug that will hit the streets. I wouldn't say "don't look at it," but I say its pretty poor at every level - as I'm a high def. Create. If you do not drink two bottles of cough syrup. Then it's just dandy.
