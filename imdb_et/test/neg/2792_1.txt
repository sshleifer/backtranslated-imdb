Bad script? Check it out. Amazing effect? Check it out. Terrible actors? Check it out. Lame direction? Check it out. <br /> <br /> After seeing the DVD box in the impact file and as a horror fan, I put my $ 4.28 line and rented this "movie". My girlfriend was out of town and I missed late on Tuesday that I decided it would be the perfect time to watch what appears to be a (horror-based) cover movie. Instead, I got the worst movie. Until then, I had always proclaimed the "Slumber Party Massacre 3" that has ever been made for the worst movie. <br /> <br /> If you are the type that wants to see the movie because you heard how bad it is, it is you. If you don't want to lose your life for 4.00 and $ 80, you should avoid this waste. <br /> <br /> Additional message: I noticed some "participants" coming here and commenting on the bulletin board. How can you be in this movie? You were all terrible. I mean very bad. If there was an American Idol for the actors, all the first episodes would laugh. <br /> <br /> Peace. <br /> <br /> Sutter Cain
