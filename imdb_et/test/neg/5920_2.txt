I thought this movie was terrible. I understand that it was shot with a small budget, but the action was terrible and the film itself was just stupid. The plot was predictable and the central character was an atypical moor. In fact, all the characters were atypical and none of them were fully developed. Audience doesn't touch anyone in the movie. It had to be tense, but if you don't care about the characters, it's hard to get into the movie at all. I felt that a foreign artist was forced to listen to me a stupid story. The end result of all the pieces was a little too much - I smiled when I thought I had to be "shocked". All in all, I thought it was really just a bad movie.
