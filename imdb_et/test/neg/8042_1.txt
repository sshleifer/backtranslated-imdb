Schieder, as President of the United States, points to a semi-credible part, where politically correct Maria Conchita Alonzo is female vice president. The film just stinks. with so many holes in the parcels, it is a miracle that they captured the film. Compared to the recent HBO schedule, this film is not worth it at all. After 10 minutes, you ask yourself why it's written. After 40 minutes, you don't know why you're watching it. Save your efforts and see Hee Hawi or something else. Something better than this clunker.
