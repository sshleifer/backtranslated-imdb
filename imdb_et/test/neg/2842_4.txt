The best thing to say about this porn horror movie is: boobies boobies boobies! <br /> <br /> In addition, the film has been made by some Hindu / Indian boys who have a little background in porn movies or such. <Br / Plot: The Talk-Show host and girlfriend are a hidden psychopath who is angry about the homeless situation and takes it out, you thought, a beautiful realtor ladies! (such movies are the reason why 80s movies sent for misogyia) <br /> <br /> This movie is not really Slasher, but has the same unlikely and stereotypes: stupid-ass police, villain old white man and women is busty babes. <br /> <br /> If you like porn horror, it's your movie, otherwise stay away. (Adrienne fans can see your sagging chest from another or another)
