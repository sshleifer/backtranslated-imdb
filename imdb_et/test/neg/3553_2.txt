I had read the hopes of the previous comments for that, but it was so slow and the plot so fundamental that I thought I would have read the wrong comment. Please, boy meets a neighbor girl at 11 am and both want love and basketball legends. Grow from each other, but look at each other's progress. Guess! Both get a scholarship for the same university and become lovers again until his father has played with a younger woman. Our young hero, who is unable to cope, has ended in court concentration, but some decide to go for pro-drop research and think of what the Lakers have received. Digs the heroine because she wasn't there during the emotional period. So for 5 years they go their way. He returns from Spain, who has lost his game and our hero is getting married in two weeks. Mom tells her she should fight for her love, she knows her ongoing love and challenges her for a basketball shootout. She wins she marries, she wins, she loves her. Well he won, but decides to appeal to his girl to another girl. Endal is a basketball player and has a child-related role. Unfortunately, my high score is. My partner captures 0 soap books for those who read Mills and Boon
