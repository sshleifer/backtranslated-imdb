They make everything in this movie too easy. It reminded me of Indiana Jones, where she hides the outer side of a submarine while crossing the ocean. Everyone knows everything that is happening, it's just really easy to get anywhere you want in the White House. I don't even know why I watched half of it. Because I like Charlie Sheen and Donald Sutherland. I hope we can remove bullets from any angle and be able to drive faster than a motorcycle (usually faster than a car in a garage or allyway). Mostly it was stupid, and I didn't even know that there was a ten-storey elevator in the White House. Anyway, something conspiracy is always interesting.
