Oh dear, oh dear, dear. My lifetime was drastic because of this stench. I'd squeeze my hand down when I watch this movie again. Painful story, painful characters and painful for two hours. <br /> <br /> The best way to describe this movie is as follows: - I'd rather stick my eyes and cut my brain out when I look for a second. Tip is to stay well clear and let your local dustman benefit from removing this garbage. <br /> <br /> Lin, you said it was good !!! ! <br /> <br /> Goodaleebyeload.
