At what point is the film so bad that it is good? Darkhunter's eyes are conspicuous as c ** p a brilliant example of cinematography, and this is probably worthy of a prize. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the age-old battle of heaven and hell for the souls of recently dead people. In Darkhunter, the good and evil representatives, unlike a cat shepherd, appear in the form of a hood, Grim Reaper, whose face is a flashing flame, similar to a coal effect, Philip Marlowe-a-like, seriously bad manicure and a female psychologist who seems to have been released from Kwik-Save daily . <br /> <br /> The main rivals compete for the soul of a newly-dead teacher who spends most of the film running out of the fog and odd onboard aircraft trying to avoid their catchers. <br /> <br /> The spread of the plot is thinner than a dieter sandwich, which has no character and does not try to create a relationship. The actor is ridiculous, comparable to a school game - though it would be an insult to many educational institutions. And the dialogue .......... oh how my parties hurt! If dead tribes have not asked the soul demon for "life as unwanted cornices," you do not know if hell is really McDonald's. <br /> <br /> But is it convincing that you just look at how bad it can be - just over 80 minutes, it's worth the time it has taken by accident.
