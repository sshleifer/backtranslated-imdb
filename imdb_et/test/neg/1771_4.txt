This is a species that has already hatched as a beautiful model (Mathilda May). Pleasant baby who wants to kiss and kill! <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a strong start and gets infected with the drill virus from the middle to the end. <br /> <br /> The weakest spot is a basic piece / story presentation. As you should have compared it, the Natasha Henstridge species got the same plot, but adds a lot of interesting side plot and does not mention good activities or a strong cynical end. <br /> <br /> This explains why Patrick Stewart joins the company fleet at Star Trek Next Generation; he wanted to find more models in a glass cage floating inside Halley-Comet. <br /> <br /> Must see scientists for fans.
