One hundred seventy five million dollars is a lot of money to spend even on the biggest summer break. Not even Michael Bay had a big budget for Transformers, so exactly how Universal Pictures spent so much money that Evan Almighty is a mystery. They certainly didn't spend it on a single script, because the movie is not so classic comedy that it is a Christian flag that casts and bar one or two silent women, you will probably spend the time thinking about where the budget went or why Steve Carrell felt the need slip it firmly into the middle movie exactly at the moment when its star profile has begun to rise. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey's Comedy Bruce Almighty's sequel to former supportive Evan Baxter (Carrell), which moves above the ladder. The story opens with her, leaving the newsletter as a public official and moving to Washington with her husband and three general sons (a little weird primary school mop, a spirited high school student and a sumpy teenager). However, Evan's desire to change politics through politics gets the wrench of work when God (Morgan Freeman) appears and asks him to build an Ark. <br /> <br /> In other words, this is an update to the old Genesis story Evan is fighting with cynicism and naysayer to build a huge boat. Unfortunately, although the assumption is quite promising, it unfortunately does not make much laugh. At the beginning, when Evan's straightforward member of parliament tries to encourage public service demands with unwanted packages that follow her, and the beard, which is resistant to all shaving experiments, Evan's straight-forward member of parliament tries to juggle. when he accepts his divine mission, the film takes a film. <br /> <br /> From that moment on it will become a message movie. Evan begins to announce alarmingly, and Morgan Freeman turns himself on offering a kind of wisdom, but gently prodding in his chosen direction. Even though Evan's resistance wouldn't be, the only comedy trace would be just a few trash jokes and John Michael Higgin's role in Evan's upset right. Higgins could show the same rich comic potential he had made in previously arrested development, but his enthusiasm could not save a drowning ship, especially when Carrell had it all, but he put his enormous healing skill back into the burner. <br /> <br /> In a sense, it is a bit like the passion of Christ, but unlike Mel Gibson's film, which encouraged everyone to believe in God by hiring and firing blood, Evan seeks a more lenient approach to Almighty. The film simply tells us that we should believe in God because He believes in us. Unfortunately, this movie is likely to laugh when it comes to passion. Carrell is on autopilot, no jokes and Wanda Sykes proposes to become the most annoying person on the planet. It may be sweet but nobody just scored $ 175,000,000 overboard.
