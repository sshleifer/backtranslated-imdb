Ever watched something so terrible that you just have to look to be sure it really is as bad as it seems? This is one of those movies. Critics accused it of being released, also because of its way of funding. I tried it yesterday on television and gave it curiosity. <br /> <br /> If it speaks in the box, no more or less: low humor, fine, very much. Carry ... vein, but "adult" language. Indeed, it is hacking back to the 60's UK porn industry in the 1970s, who cheat on redheads, promising real sex and not giving (a nipple on the spot?) This whole tawdry era is loved here, but with modern cinematography. <br /> <br /> It is for Mackenzie Crook (Office, Pirates of the Caribbean and much more) and Johnny Vegas. The chip shop girl is really sexy. Apart from these unexpected positive results, it leaves me wondering what happened to England. Junk food, low wage work, councils, desperate lives. As a bonus, there are some nice leaves in Birmingham. Foreigners can find it about British attitudes and aspirations. All in all, I still feel unbelievable that I sat through it.
