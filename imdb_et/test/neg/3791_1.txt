Terrible writing, leadership and action! The writer / director has depicted Southerners, especially southern law enforcement as an unknown, backwood, homophobic and racist (very popular but unknown stereotype that the film industry likes to stay on). Action (or excessive action) and writing were both amateur and small. The plot's line is the same old obsolete Hollywood story of "racist and homophobic traces that ultimately destroyed enlightened people from" Newwww Yoke Ceety ". <br /> <br /> I was brought up in a small town in Louisiana when this movie was filmed and waiting to see the movie, but it was immediately disappointed in the first few minutes of the film. At the beginning of the movie, there is a gay bar in Louisiana's "swamps". How a ridiculous concept! There are many gays and gay bars in South Louisiana, but there are no gays in Louisiana's marshes or small towns. Then we will be introduced to the sheriff, who uses the phrase "homuh-sex'l" most often in southern drawings and superfluous performances. Then there is a place where the local police monitors the mission at the police station. I could go ahead with terrible cheerfulness or hidden stereotypes or ridiculous scenes. <br /> <br /> This director and his team welcomed this small friendly city and showed true southern hospitality. The cities of Lake Arthur and the states of Louisiana had to insult and disparage in their final editing. The good people of Lake Arthur were excited and in love with the "Hollywood" city, who didn't know that they were ultimately portrayed in a low budget amateur film that went straight to the DVD. My advice: skip it or watch it late in the Cinemax if it ever spins.
