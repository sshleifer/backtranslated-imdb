Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen) brings a group of people to the mountains to help find her missing daughter (Erica Durance). What they don't know is that he was killed with sasquatch (Taras Kostyuk) and it's still there ... waiting for them. <br /> <br /> It was late at night when I appeared on my DVD. player. I really wish I could go back in time and stop me. Most people will tell you that movies like "Death House" or "S.I.C.K: Serial Insain Clown Killers" are the movies you have never seen before. Wrong. That's it. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of nonsense, but that's the only crap that haunts me. How do I wish I never saw it! Actually, doing so is not so bad. It's just writing and managing and the pace and everything! I'm actually a fan of Sasquatch movies. But not that. <br /> <br /> Please listen to my warning. Don't look at it!
