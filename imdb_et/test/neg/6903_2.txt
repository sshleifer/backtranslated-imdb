It was so OFF! There is no plot! Basically, the Lion King shake is mixed with animal husbandry. Again, there is no plot. Terrible! Worst and one and a half years of my life! I had to leave the theater in a few minutes to ease! I could smile twice. All the semi-funny parts are previewed. I hate such movies. Yes, there is a lot to suck the movie. I don't know how he got such good ratings and comments. NOT PLOT OR STORYLINE! If you watch this movie, bring a pillow or girlfriend / boyfriend to keep you out. Awful. I don't think I've ever been to a movie or liked that much. It was good that the tickets cost only five dollars because I would be mad if I paid $ 7.50 for this mess.
