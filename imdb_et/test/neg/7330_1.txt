well, there is not much to say about this movie. its just a trash. very bad performance, bad script and flat story .... well, the actress, (i don't even know my name) who played the main role (not the blond but the latin one) worked well but the blonde who played the friend of the main friend , its level of action is like a school school game, so most other film participants. There are also zombies, very bad. and, the story itself does not make sense at all. well, if you are really bored and you have nothing to do but want to kill somehow, maybe you want to watch this movie, but there are millions of better B movies than this. a waste of time and money.
