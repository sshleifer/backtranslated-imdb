Rop Chopra wrote this film 40 years ago, wanted to cast Dilip Kumar lead. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the movie was written and it was made in 2003, so the topic seems to be outdated and sometimes too superficial. <br /> <br /> Like Amitabh-Hema alone, it's too superficial to even see youth, is too bad as Gulshan AVTAAR. <br /> <br /> The message is fine, but things have been said with clich√©s The character of Salman is the worst, looks straight from the storyteller, while the Bachchan climax is good and the finale of the sons' forgiveness is good <br /> > Treatment Chopra does a good job The music is decent, Bachchan's sung songs stand out <br /> <br /> Amitabh is as usual, he has played the father of older parents before, but here he plays the victim and portrays it well. His last speech is great Hema is good for his part Aman Verma is different from Samir Soni's order, Naseer and the rest of the sons and women are decent, though Divya Dutta stands out Salman Khan's fa Ke, Mahima's okay Paresh and Lillete are loved
