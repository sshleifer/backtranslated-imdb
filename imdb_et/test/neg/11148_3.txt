I felt the movie was rushed and the actor was full of holes. Arnold was good, but the main girl was stupid, and the devil was terrible. The story was confusing and idiotic. The film didn't make sense and it was incredible. The film is not the worst film, but it is not too far away. Overall, I was terribly disappointed, it could have been much better. My score is 3 out of 10
