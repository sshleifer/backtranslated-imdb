Oh boy .. This movie is so mediocre that I don't know what to write about it. <br /> <br /> I think it's easier to write what it is not: <br /> <br /> It's not very fun. It's not the original. And there is no sign in the whole movie that I take care of. <br /> <br /> I am reminded of a reality TV show on MTV, but without interest. It just drags on and I barely wait until it ends. The only thing that kept me from turning it off was Jennifer Lyons (c: <br /> <br /> I thought there was a lot of time for this movie to find one good thing about it. (as Holly did when she accused Nicole) of earning it instead of 2 out of 10.
