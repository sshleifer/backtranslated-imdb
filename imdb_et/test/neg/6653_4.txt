I really wanted to see this movie - I thought the plot was truly unique and intriguing. Police (Andy Garcia) is a son who dies and needs bone marrow replacement. The only game is the convicted serum killer who escapes from prison. To save his son, he must follow the killer. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton plays a convict in one of the many disappointments in the movie. Keaton is sometimes a great actor, but here he is quite bored. It's over the top where you just stop caring. <br /> <br /> Garcia is better but tries too many movies that are not par. Barbet Schroeder (at the same time as a promising director with films like "Barfly", which was quite a lot in the American market) directs well enough - I honestly thought the script was the culprit ... it's just a big mess. film /> <br /> The film ultimately destroys many good materials, good actors and a good director - all because of a faulty script. What should have been a tense and thought-provoking film is just Hollywood action.
