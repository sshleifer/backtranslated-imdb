Yes, there is a "sleeping place" that looks at Sleeper Cell and it was me. After reading the "24" comparisons (like the DVD cover), I was expecting quick action. But hurry this series easily. I think my groggy half-awake: "He's going to ..." and if that happens ... "Guess that van is ..." and he's going. <br /> <br /> And so on. <br /> <br /> And why would Darwyn have a baby in an extra deep lid? Maybe you can offer a little R&D? Hey, it works for me, so four stars, not three. <br /> <br /> This show is not "24". I watched "24". Sleeper Cell, you're not "24".
