I rented a copy of it from Netflix - a big mistake. The DVD version, titled "One Armed Swordsmen", was prepared by madmen who thought that the ranking sequences would be better judged together as one major chapter as part of a consistent and sequential story. Part of the story remained in separate chapters, which you can select from the main menu, but the DVD is still confusing. Don't try or buy it. Not that the story of the original was a wonderful, absurdly complicated mess. Much as I liked Wang Yu to see his prime minister after these years, it is a waste of time. I have had dishwashing detergents that made a better film. The chopped DVD version tells us that no matter how silly the Chinese script can be, you need to see a story to take care of how the fighting sequences turn out. <br /> <br /> But One-Armed Swordsmen offers you the chance to see both Wang and Shaw Brothers stalwart Lo Lieh, who beat up the ridiculous real boy David Chian. Lo plays a different frog with a string here and is a great example of why some people need orthodoxy. The film is also honored by the participation of the Taiwanese actor Chang Yi as a judge. Another comment mentioned above mentions the obligatory struggle with the entrance (in fact there are two) where Wang and Chiang are attacking a comic barbaric package using one that looks like cavemen weapons. Bruce Lee's noise as they fight. None of this makes any sense, but it's okay if you don't expect any clarity or reason. Anyway, it was fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Another feature of this production is that there are no significant women. There are a couple of female roles there, but they have no serious role in the action or plot. <br /> <br /> If you find a copy of the original Shaw Brothers One-Armed Swordsman movie that explains why he has only one hand and why he uses a broken sword, go for it.
