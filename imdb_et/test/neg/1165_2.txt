I just saw this movie and it turns out to be pretty flat, as other users commented, and one thing that most annoyed me was the southern accent, some of which were in Wisconsin, not in the south. As mentioned in other reviews, Ed Geine was not a big guy, so why did Jason and Leatherface play the show? <br /> <br /> I quickly transmitted most of the slower parts. <br /> <br /> Hopefully someone will do their homework for Ed Geine and the city and make a more accurate movie
