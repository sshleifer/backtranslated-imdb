This film is perfect for any writer, actor, or director of any desired screen. Looking at this movie, you can see all the things that are wrong with the film industry today. There are so many clichés that I had to sit through the movie. Nothing about this is original, and every line you talk about has hanged from the movies we saw in the 90s. Though she has some cheap laughs, she is wrong at all. I was so bored and the film was so predictable and pathetic that I noticed how much make-up was hidden on Tara Reid's face to hide those massive bags and wrinkles at her endless party. Seriously, he suffered so many foundations that you could literally cut off and fill the entire bottle. <br /> <br /> It was shocking to me that so many talented and popular luminaires sign up for this entry in junk. And I do not know how I sat through the terrible scream that Ashton Kutcher does, you know if he is like angry or something and he screams his words in this annoying way? Ashton's terrible "talks", Tara's face was ten darker, like a stunned owl, a script that seemed to work for three years ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, my whole life hasn't been a movie I watched wouldn't be in any way, no matter how bad it was. It deserves a prize for being the first. BAD BAD BAD ... I don't think the English dictionary has one word that can describe this trashy movie. Today I tried to look at it again, but I had to turn it off like ten minutes, because I started crying a lot of clichés. <br /> <br /> Don't even bother to rent your blocker, it's not worth the penny, because I'm really willing to pay someone to consider watching this movie so they can do something about their life.
