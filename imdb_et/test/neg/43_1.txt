I was completely black, melodramatic with this film for no apparent reason. Every thing becomes so serious and people swear by really foolish expressions. Then there is a row of Killer who can probably kill one person to get a series of Killer titles. Well series Killer likes butterflies and have illustrated sound effects you can hear the dream sequence of the most modern movies, <br /> <br /> why oh why? I have no clue. It really wants to be scary, but I think that in this universe scared the whole bunch equals and adds dark ambient noise. True filmmakers today have to do their homework before making "horror films" or at least calling the movie "horror" a movie. it makes me say (too literally ironically) "acolytes, you take forever to say."
