The man arrives at the psychiatric Dr. Sammael (Joan Severance) office, claiming that he is a demon of Asmodeus (Kane Hodder), a 13th-level tormenter of hell, and would like to say strange things. He says he had agreed to a lucifer to become human again. She should knock her virgin sister Mary Elizabeth (Alison Brie) on the day their mother died, and she should kill six people and give Anti-Christ, and then escape from the well and was born again. When Mary Elizabeth gets pregnant, her stressful and abusive sister Catherine (Denise Crosby) does not believe she is a virgin, but their father and former obstetrician Albert Martino (James Callahan) examines her daughter and sees her intact hymen. Meanwhile, the church discovers the truth about Mary Elizabeth's pregnancy and sends the priest and former military father Anthony (Eddie Velez) to spy on Mary Elizabeth. He dominates the fetus and is forced to kill the truck driver, Lars (Jorg Sirtl), who is his lover and lover Jennifer (Azalea Davila) and Jennifer, and eats his hearts and drink blood but believes he has nightmares. But during ultrasound, he understands that he has a monster and asks his father to stop pregnancy. But it's too late. <br /> <br /> The terrible "Born" is a B movie (actually a Z movie) that believes it's a great movie. The result is a pretentious and disappointing production that has an inconsistent and absurd story without humor and terrible action and direction. The plot is a complete mess: a priest who has hit a man and a former soldier; demon in existential crisis that goes into psychiatric; a father who is investigating the innocence of his daughter; two female demons (succubus?) that stand naked like a statue and both hands cover their sex; a sign that is a bitch, and exists only to expose a beautiful body. There are many scenes with free and cheap nudity. But the worst is acting: the unknown leading actor Alison Brie is hysterical, ridiculous voices and grimaces. I'm sorry, Mrs Alison Brie, but I hated your tedious results. I have not recognized Joan Severance, who has a good result because I still had a picture of my youth. Denise Crosby fills a hateful character and, like everyone, she got older, but she's still a good actor. I believe that if a writer and director had added dark humor and assumed that this film was a B movie, the story would have been better and better. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Anti-Cristo" ("Anti-Christ")
