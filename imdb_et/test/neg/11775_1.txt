There's nothing to watch here. It's all done before (and better). Who cares about this woman - inadequately in every sense - as a mother and wife? At one point, if he could have taken the highway - he jumped back into dependency with both feet and held his breath - not for a better reason than me! If he wasn't a beautiful and young person he depicted on the screen, it seemed like a real human wreck, represented by our family members, neighbors, and friends who really suffer from the additions that we would make in the nanosecond of the channel. /> <br /> This movie starts from below and goes downhill. There is no redemption, no lessons - no exaggeration. No major character makes compassion, let alone empathy. (Well, maybe a snake.) I'd have been more fun when I shut my hand door. Who needs this generation?
