I hated it. I hate self-conscious pretentious inanity that masks art. This film is either stupidly ugly or inanely stupid. After the first half hour I got a DVD version and saw the same young shennanigan over and over again. I was angry that I had spent money on a sophomoric clap trap. Sepia or blue tinting does nothing to film, let alone art.
