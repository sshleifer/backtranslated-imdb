The dominant conflict is between a couple of fine players (Huppert and Dutronc) and a scary script. Obviously, the participants lost, as director / screenwriter Claude Chabrol eventually forced the leading couple to follow this precious piece of hurt imagination. Luckily, Huppert and Dutronc's powerful productions dramatically improve the overall quality of the film, which wonderfully proves the depth and humor. As for Chabrol's persistence in keeping the blessing and the illogicalness of the film, it reaches the peak of the final scene, which is so incredibly bad that you don't know what tablets he took for his own direction.
