I went to the movie, waiting for a little bit of action, mixed with a strong story line. I understand that changes between written works and films have to be done ... for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> Changing the relationship between the scientists (they were the father-daughter of the book) The director of CERN was eliminated by changing the scene between Carmelengo and the director to lead Carmelengo and the Swiss guard at the papal office. <br /> <br /> Ron Howard made his father's inserted cardinal hayseed accent, but missed all the insignia. Both Lagdon and Carmelengo stepped into the sky of a helicopter, where Hanks had reached the river, and the priest landed in a chapel described as Christ. <br /> <br /> At some point, this movie must work again with the director who is on the job
