I know if I was a small budget filmmaker who would probably have checked this page to find out what people were saying about it. So I really hope the film's creators actually read it! I think you should find a way to repay me half a year and a half. Please stop making movies about what you probably imagined. Just stop making movies together ... you're one of the reasons it's so hard for Indie filmmakers to do. Make the world a favor and get McDonalds or something so you can do something productive in your life! I feel like I call my husband to complain that they actually spent that movie in their shop.
