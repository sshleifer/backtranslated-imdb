This film talks about a young man's painful journey to discover his sexuality. <br /> <br /> The film is raw and modest. This is not based on attracting viewers to steamy sex elements. Although the plot may seem inconsistent and occasionally disconnected and some events have not been properly explained. I understand this because this movie is a collection of memories that is very personal to the director. His sister and mother's sub-block is unlikely to exist in the film, but I can surely imagine that they are very important events in his life. <br /> <br /> The film's low budget is clearly visible. It is a pity that the sound effects are bad. Narration and some dialogue (especially with a French teacher in the classroom) have so many echoes, so it's hard to say what is being said. The surrounding ambient noise, significant traffic noise, is also present throughout the film. When the scene intersects another, the level of traffic noise changes. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably not entertaining, but it definitely works for a young man's journey to adopt his sexuality.
