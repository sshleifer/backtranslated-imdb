Unfortunately, combining Pontypool's best bits and 28 days, they managed to ignore them. Although they are shamelessly copied. (If that makes sense?) Pontypool was different and gradually became tight, it just smelled. Radio DJ, "we have to stay in the air," does not spend time effectively in the air. He sits at the bottom and looks at the TV for news. This is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie. Is there one person in the US or the world who doesn't know what a zombie is? Or have you ever heard the word "zombie"? Well, at the 50th minute, this number of confusions still call zombies, "infected" or "rabies". The word "Zombie" can later be visited by guests, I could care less. if you need to pay for certain words? Like a Bluetooth headset, the so-called ear thing, I don't do it! No plots for completion + no action = nobody cares. A waste of time, shameless, badly executed rip-off.
