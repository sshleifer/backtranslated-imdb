I've been a fan of carpenters for a long time, I read a biography, watched special offers and saw the story of Karen Carpenter. This movie didn't show the real Karen Carpenter. The film seems to be shy and quite a big part of the individual (except one girl). The real Karen Carpenter was a lot different. He was outgoing and friendly. He had many friends, especially Olive Newton-John. The film does not even show Karen's attempts at solo album and his meeting with Phil Ramone and his wife Itchy "Karen". Itchy knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York. When Karen was in New York, he saw a psychologist, but it was voluntary and once a day, and then he left his hotel room. Karen also took pills to increase the thyroid gland so that he could lose weight but stopped taking it because the psychologist advised him not. Bob Knight, the wife of Karen, is also called in the movie, but in real life he was named Tom Burris. Karen was not separated from Tom but divorced. Karen had to sign the divorce documents the day he died. Agnes also found Karen naked in the consciousness, unlike the movie where she was white. The music was very good. That was the only thing I would like to see.
