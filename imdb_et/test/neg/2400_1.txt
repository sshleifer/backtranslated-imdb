The filmmakers ignored the combination of points, ie the sequence of events and choices that led Charlie Wilson and anti-Soviet mojaheda to Al-Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden and finally to September 9th. Of course, filmmakers leave us clear about why the councils in Afghanistan were? - but this shortcoming, compared to their inability to reveal that the support of the Islamist extremists in Afghanistan for ultimate rage-communism ultimately strengthened Western forces and was a major factor in today's confusion (11 September, terrorist networks, long-term war in Afghanistan, etc.). As these consequences are not spelled out, the film leaves to the viewer Wilson (hey, look at your latest projects on the internet) instead of seeing him as an individual whose activities were in conflict with his country's interests and in the West as a whole.
