I was waiting for this movie because the lost world came out. It didn't bother me that the lost world was not as intellectual as the original, and here I was hoping for a good monster movie. It was all about "Dinosaurs eating people." But it was even disappointing at this level. <br /> <br /> There was not enough food for beginners, and while I keep it secret, as many people eat, it was not enough. Although there was no dinosaur in the dinosaur community, dinosaurs were almost "inadequate". And many dinosaurs, like the spikey-back-and-has-a-club-on-the-tail-parturus, just made cameos and didn't do much to consider how cool they are. <br /> <br /> (START SPOILERS) Then were Pterodactyls. The figures I read put about 15 pounds of body weight, while the film saw them closer to 300. Worse, they couldn't eat, or even crush them, rocking them up. There was no end to the film, it was just a sudden credit. (END SPOILERS) I've been wondering if the edition I saw was missing a 40 minute movie. <br /> <br /> My only conclusion may be that they taught Pterodactyls their long bunches in their pockets and get your $ 7. at least you don't have to be disappointed.
