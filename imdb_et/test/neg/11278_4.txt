For this movie based on television and the serious final. I thought it was a difficult way to stop serious. "M * A * S * H ​​Goodbye, Goodbye and Amen" was pretty good, but not that. If you really don't like the series (like me), skip this movie. <br /> <br /> I was a loyal fan of Even Stevens, but the plot was too tricky and Dave Coulier, the man, wasn't. t done anything good ... well. They shouldn't have used Tim Meadows, he's a great actor, but he was too good for the script. <br /> <br /> I thought the film was pure cheese. I would give it 4.5 / 10
