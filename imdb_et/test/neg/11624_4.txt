I was disappointed with Swan's princess. I see what they're trying to do, show how married life was for Odette and Derek, but the story wasn't interesting enough to draw my attention and it seemed to cover the same basics as the original. <Br /> <br /> It's not funny. The only bit I found was when Jean-Bob turned into a prince and then a frog and no one saw it and tried to convince them that it really did. <br /> <br /> The villain is garbage and the animation is not as impressive as the first movie. <br /> <br /> The queen is very irritating and instead of saving her mother with Derek, you hope that the villain will spell her spell to stop talking. <br /> <br /> It is a disgrace because I really liked the first movie, but it didn't meet my expectations.
