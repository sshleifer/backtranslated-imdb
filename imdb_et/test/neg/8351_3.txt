"Volcano" is at best a B-film and in the worst case it is a more disaster that it should portray. To be fair, you must be prepared for every movie to stop the disbelief in one big concept. "Volcano" asks you to stop the disbelief in science, human communication, and the whole sense. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones is going to be an emergency management agency that is still sensitive in the 1990s, and it is good if he is not stuck with the stupid dialogue that the script offers. But Anne Heche gives an astonishingly bad result as a smart ass geologist who turns to Roark's love of interest (when the city burns, natch). Gaby Hoffman goes to Dream of Dreams and American President Jones for a whore, poor and lifelong daughter. Don Cheadle can sit in a truly enclosed office and take Jones's phone calls by working out what Roark should do and what should be done. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film begins to sink into the air of the stage as they enter the subway lines at the beginning of the Heche geological partner. It speeds up the speed at which Jones assumes that they will use the downstream stream of buses on the streets, Heche geologist (who loves to talk to everyone about Geology science) is obviously aware that the stage is hot and it melts metal and stone, and the dead bus is unlikely to be much impact. It really starts to suck when the film introduces Rodney King's racial tension between two bad actors dressed in the police, and an angry black man who doesn't understand why the fire station is occupied by this great flowing lava river. But hey, finally, three of them work together to build a K-rail oak to stop lava eating in their neighborhood, although the dam is built in the wrong direction and the material used does not stop lava anyway. Besides, the K-rails are hardly waterproof, but I think the stage does not think it will blow its head through the cracks, not when Tommy Lee Jones stands out. Don't let me start on a chained subway car where the hot lava tunnel is down, but strangely it's not too hot to try to save, it's not too smoky to see and no poisonous gases to breathe. It must be LA Lava or Lava Lite. You know, it eats cars, but it's environmentally friendly. <br /> <br /> Here are the moments where there is just a camp that almost makes you wonder whether it was supposed to be a comedy. For example, two Hieronymus Bosch painters offer a completely meaningless and fictitious conversation in conversation, and finally, Roark / Jones little boy will not save everyone seeing the same ashes covered with ashes when it rains and cleans up everything - and then the sun comes out and Heche says something like aw, shucks, roark. <br /> <br /> Volcano almost achieves Battlefield Earth status, but with the exception of Heche, no one makes Travolta look bad and the technical aspects are pretty well addressed. If you're in the LA area like me, it's funny to think of a lava flow that wipes out Wilshire's boulevard. I gave it the three effects and the tension you send.
