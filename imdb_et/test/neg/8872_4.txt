Thousands of films I've seen so far are the first to make me think of "wasted talents". I've never seen so many fine actors who gave such terrible performances (Frédéric Pierrot, Elsa Zylberstein and so on). The "aging" make-up is quite terrible and is widely illuminated to make it worse. Using music (eg love at first sight for young aide de camp) is sometimes so caricatural that I feel most of the spectators smile clumsily. So far, Antoine de Caunes has been a pretty good actor, but I see this and "les morsures de l'aube" that she should start giving up. Please Antoine, give up this master of balantree project; I doubt you deserve it.
