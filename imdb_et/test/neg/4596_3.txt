Hired from my local Blockbuster titled SPECK - this may be the way to look for it if you still feel it after this review. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> Who killed several nurses in Chicago in the sixties. When watching a movie, it feels like it follows the crimes in the letter. Unfortunately, it doesn't make a good movie. <br /> <br /> Another problem I had was almost constant music that let us know it was SCARY MOVIE, and some godly stories that tell us what motivates Speck. The action was average for this type of film; to give credit for credit, the film has been captured very nicely for my taste. Your mileage may vary. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the subject, it may be worth your time.
