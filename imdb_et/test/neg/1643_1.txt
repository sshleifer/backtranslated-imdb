Yes, this film is probably trying to be Barbarian Conan and what amazes me is the sequel (people demanded another?). The first part of Flick is the original. What I saw is not worth seeing (and probably Ator always kills a big doll in his films). Well now Ator lives on the ends of the earth with his silent thong. The girl is looking for help when this evil crap is in her custody. Let me just say that this bad guy is extremely patient, because the old boy is constantly fooling and just endless. The bad guy is waiting for the end of the movie and finally hitting the old guy, leaving you thinking, "What took it so long to snap?" Meanwhile, Ator and his sidekick and gal go through another adventure. They are fighting with cavemen, invisible soldiers (not asking), renting bars and people who worship. Ator also fights with a giant snake doll and hanging slides (ask again). All the time you think Conan is going to hit Ator's ass.
