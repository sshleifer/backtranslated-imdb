I saw this movie for the first time on NBC Friday 11-29-02. It was a pretty good movie, but I don't think it's a Muppet movie that Jim Henson does. I mean first, Pepe ', using the word "sexy" every time and then Pepe, saying, "Is it a miracle?" And I know that Jim Henson does not allow Kermit to shout: "I want I never been!" 13 times a minute. This movie is not like the classic Muppet movie. Of course, I understand that Nicky Holiday steals a baseball from The Great Muppet Caper, but a business entrepreneur who deceives Muppet in his theater contract to make it a smoker's nightclub. When Jim Henson was here today, he hated this movie!
