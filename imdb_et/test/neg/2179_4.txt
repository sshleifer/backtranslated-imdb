Maybe it was * Important movie * and that's why people respect it so much, but to be honest, it's not very good. Afterwards, it is easy to see that Chaplin (probably all of Hollywood) was surprisingly na√Øve about what actually happened in the ghettos, so you can't spoil him too much for the interruption that affects the modern viewer, but the disconnection remains. <br /> <br /> A more disappointing movie is just junk; as Chaplin had no idea that films had evolved from a quiet time. Sets that include both Jewish hairdressers and dictators do not flow into each other; they just sit there as stand-alone tracks into pieces that progress in matching and beginning, moving SOMEWHERE, but never reaching a resolution. Some are funny, some less. <br /> <br /> What a movie's charm is strictly for a Chaplin person. His parodies about Hitler's speeches were the best part of the whole thing and he could not deny that he had a physical grace that was pleasant to watch. But almost everything he surrounded was ANNOYING. Hannah was TOO DAMN America. Storm Troopers was TOO DAMN American. <br /> <br /> Oooh! Oooh! One more thing! I do not know what purpose served when the garbage is the source of evil under the throne. It almost seems that the film says that if it were not for malignant effects like garbage, Hynckle would not be a bad guy.
