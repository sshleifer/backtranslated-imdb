What did I mean when I rented it? What did the distributor think when he copied the tape and sent it to the Netherlands? The fact that someone really wanted it s ***?!? <br /> <br /> That means some astronauts get into space (a kickback of Apollo 13, but never in the shadow of this fine movie) and they want to return home. If you act in such a movie, you should be glad that you are moving as far as possible on earth! <br /> <br /> It wants to surf the wave of small space films after 1998. Impact and Armageddon) and it fails everywhere. Deep Impact and Armageddon were not perfect (far from it), but they were at least once worthwhile (and maybe once more when we're all old). They gave fun. Max Q is not. It is irritating. All right. This is a TV movie, but does it mean that you are allowed to get out of such a mess? <br /> <br /> If you have not finally vomited (all cheap in drama and worthless) during the dialogue, you must die by wasting this time. <br /> <br /> It's going to get worse at the end when a space shuttle lands ... No, I can't ruin it "(IMDb instructions forbid). So you have to see yourself. NO! DO NOT TAKE (sorry), but rent a movie worth renting (like Battlefield Earth ... just kidding!) <br /> <br /> Probably the worst I've ever seen.
