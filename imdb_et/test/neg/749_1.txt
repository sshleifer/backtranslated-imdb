My mother, my cousins, and I are pretty big fans of Jane Austen. We know all the words of the 1995 Pride and Prejudice masterpiece, and we have been watching Gwyneth Paltrow Emma's embarrassing number of times. I have read all the books and I have sometimes sat through the mind and sensitivity and persuasion. So my mother and I thought it would be nice to see the Northanger monastery on film. <br /> <br /> Bad idea! This is almost the worst film I've ever seen. It's even worse than the 1998 version of Alice's review glass, or 1939's Nancy Drew movie I bought for Wal-Mart for $ 1 (my previous worst films.). is that the "heroine" Catherine has a terrible and strange imagination inspired by tricky novels not touched by Jane Austen's heroine. Throughout the novel, he has dreams (day and night), where he is carried by some dirty man who has a greasy wig that is pulled out of his head, heading to God for everything, and suddenly rescued by the embarrassing guy White horse. <br /> <br /> Another thing that every movie viewer instantly notices is high-level charm and saxophone music, which should be a soundtrack. There's no nice classical music here or English! It's almost obvious at first glance that Catherine's chosen actor (for lack of a better word) is completely out of the question. First of all, he is quite unpleasant and is even more affected by his behavior. His looks and movements are just nervous! Plus, they are completely affected and incredible. <br /> <br /> This sad lack of action skills affects a lot of the film's participants. Even Mr. Tilney, the supposed young man, is decent. <br /> <br /> As more and more characters are introduced, the filmmakers have a strange taste. The enormous, Marie Antoinette-style headrests come into contact (mostly) with properly designed empire bathrobes. A French woman, probably General Tilney's friend, is made up of black, like some ancient Goth nightmare - she has a striking resemblance to Michael Jackson's black dress. His appearance has even changed the face of a big crescent with his cheek. I also had to think that almost all women were shining with the historical accuracy of red lipstick. <br /> <br /> Another anomaly that kept my mom and I laughing for about ten minutes was the "swimming" scene. The first thing we noticed was that men and women swam together in large saunas - probably not likely in the early 1800s. Then we saw that all women seemed to be wearing big Chinese or plastic plates, wearing strings around their neck. Plates floated horizontally in the water, containing some mysterious pieces ... nothing. We thought it was soap, then aromatic herbs, and finally, when the mysterious substance began to disappear between the frames, we concluded that it was food. But I'm still not sure. <br /> <br /> And that's not half of what is wrong with Northanger Abbey. My warning to anyone considering renting this movie: leave your hand. And if anyone is considering buying it - I don't even know what to say. <br /> <br /> You would think that if the actors and others who make this movie got about 1/4 of the way, they would understand what the monster they are creating and stopping. Unfortunately they didn't, and the Norther's monastery was released to the world.
