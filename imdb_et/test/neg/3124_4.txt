(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> Make sure it's based on Moby Dick. Totally obsessed and he destroys him. This is total stupidity. The film starts pretty well, but at the end of the movie, everyone else is destroyed and the main thing is empty. <br /> <br /> The alleged half-sister is never convincing. Some very bad light effects. Music is interesting. But little. It took me over a month to finish. I think if you like to be John Malkovich, you might like it. But if BJM was a great movie that I just didn't want to look at again, the Pola X movie I just hate high hell. The only possible thrill of the film is the sexual sexual scene at the end of the film. (Hopefully Catherine will not think.) <br /> <br /> This movie is seriously boring, frustrating and poorly targeted. Not particularly recommended. If you want French movies. (see Crimson Rivers instead) <br /> <br /> 4/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 1/10 Replayable: 0/10
