This is a friendly and delicate Cyborg movie with a love story. Awww. It's not as bad as it sounds. The action, if any, is decent and Jack Palance, Elias Koteas and Angelina Jolie are always reliable. This is the fact that this is another terrifying film by Jean Claude Van Damme, or is it the captain of the masters of the universe trilogy? I'm still confused about it. In both cases, this movie is not really needed. What was the need? Angelina Jolie. He can play an assassin robot that could explode sexual intercourse, but how to go, and although it is his first film, he still has a presence that made him a winner.
