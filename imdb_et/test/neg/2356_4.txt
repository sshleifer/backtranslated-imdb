Saboteur was one of the few Hitchcocks I still discovered and I was less than half overloaded. The French title "La Cinqui√®me colonne" (ie, the fifth column, a highly fictitious phrase for underground spyware and sabotage organizations) set my expectations quite high, as did the finals of the Liberty column. <br /> <br /> As a matter of principle, Saboteur is as enthusiastic as 39 steps (note that this is another memorable phrase, even McGuff as a title), but it lacks most humor (so the characters are more on the ground) and this is definitely not so fast paced. Like the United States from LA to NY, Saboteur pulls his feet from sequence to sequence. The queue of the scarecrow cute ranch? Lovely ranch, cute villain, but pretty tame all, it really doesn't give anything. Meeting with the blind, mixing with circus people, Soda city sequence, NY ball sequence? They fall flat, bringing more characters with very little added value. <br /> <br /> One big problem I can point out is the relationship between Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, which is not structured like Robert Donat and Madeleine Caroll at 39 levels. Thus, the entire narrative structure is floating, depending on adding new scenes. And the new scenes will only bring us closer to the end, because it is not clear whether the hook is the hero's escape from the police, the villains or his actions to stop the drawn sabotage. At 39 levels it was clearly written as 1 / fleeing from the police (so you know that the hero cannot just go to the police), then 2 runs his life and after the villains, to prove his innocence. <br /> If you want Hitchcock better than the 40s war propaganda, I would recommend you choose a foreign correspondent for Saboteur. They're both chasing movies with a nice finale, really thrilling, and not just the sights of the organizer, as well as very effective scenes (umbrella, columns of tulips, strange mills ...).
