Bled is a very good title for you If you look at it, you feel your life is bleeding for you. The horror clich√© is about people who do exactly what they shouldn't (to go to the basement or to the attic). Then the problems arise. So don't look at this movie. road Stop clear Don't enter .And if you need more stimulus for this movie? is as bad as the worst Uwe Boll movie that is dead in a bad house. I have often thought about reviewing the movie I.M.D.B. and after looking at some of the comments, I discovered that I think everyone has their own opinion. Please trust me
