Not as bad as some people say ... This is an unofficial Bond movie and a "Thunderball" remake written by Kevin McClory (co-produced by Thunderball). Well, it's very interesting, Maria Brandauer is a big Bond-wooler, Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera are like "original" Bond-girls, as well as Rowan Atkinson and a truly great Edward Fox who sees a truly refreshing "M" role. In fact, the whole film is refreshing and gives new impulses. Sean Connery makes it once more confident and charming, except that she looks a little too old. But right, he is the original bond and it was nice to see him again in this role. Locations are also typical - Bahamas, France, etc. The only thing that really doesn't work is the music score, the song "Never say never again" is O.K. but the song's song is just missing. Together, nice to try to make comic and silly Roger Moore movies like "Moonraker". Only when there was another story, "Thunderball" was a great movie, and it doesn't really need it again
