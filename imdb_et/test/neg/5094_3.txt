A good example of the opposite, politically correct racism, in which white men are presented as meaningless brides who are only where they are being killed and those of their indigenous peoples are noble heroes who are better both in appearance and in power. Apart from being too empty, it also prevents the neutral viewer from being on one side or the other - it's just too easy. The recurring score is incredibly annoying (as well as the votes), the characters lack the depths, and the viewer will soon lose those questions like "who is this sign" and "what the hell would it mean". However, photography is wonderful and there is a lot of atmosphere there, but pictures of a nice landscape alone do not save this movie. Kiefer Sutherland is used as an eye-catcher in the DVD box. In fact, someone else could have played his character because it is basically just an empty shell (like most non-Maori characters) and disappears halfway through the movie. But if you want to see Jack Bauer in the shed, it's your movie.
