I've seen most of John Waters movies. With the exception of several of his early unavailable, I have seen almost all of them, so it's clear that I'm a big fan and I'm sure I have a big and terrifying film in my movies. . Although I was up and nasty, I honored her TROUBLE and POLYESTER - two monumental respects for bad tastes and redundant movies that are really funny movies. So I'm not really nervous and I get most of what Waters offers. PINK IN FLAMINGOS, however, has created such a repulsive film, so inconvenient and so offensive that I couldn't even hold it. In other films he did before he got into mainstream, they were funny. But there is no sense of humor here, because it seems that the aim is to let the viewers be shocked and in no way attracted. I'm glad that after this movie was created, Waters' sense of humor improved because divine consuming dog faeces (like this film) are shocking, but not the least fun. My advice is to skip this movie and just pretend it's never happened, and then watch your infinitely better 70s and 80s movies.
