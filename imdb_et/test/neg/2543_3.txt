Due to the rather dubious tectonics, Japan starts to slip into the sea. Preliminary predictions say it will take about 40 years before the country is drowned, but a rogue scientist will add some more suspicious sciences and decide that it will actually take less than 1 year! The government thinks he is bursting, but the evidence will soon begin to bear his theory. <br /> <br /> This big budget catastrophe follows a set of Hollywood films of the 90s (I assume you haven't seen anything) from the scale of disasters and tragedies that lead to noble heroism of the human (Japanese) spirit and in the acts of sacrifice and proving the power of love or something. that is, it is the same naive in your psychology as it is in geology ... we all know that half the population would be rape and looting in a minute when they thought the police were turning back, and the other half would just be panic and useless. /> <br /> The film has some very special special effects, but it's not as slippery or expensive as equivalent Hollywood production. It is at least the same nationalist, humorous, and incomplete self-awareness that Hollywood's film would be, and probably even worse. It has a hot bad chick on Battle Royale as one of the leading ... but it's not even a little bad and is therefore much less hot. <br /> <br /> The movie is too long, 132 minutes, and gets worse and worse when it comes to the conclusion that is at risk with me. Certainly, I wasn't interested in anything, whether Japan sank or not in half, and before the end I tried to think about how to speed up the process if I were realistic about this situation. <Br / But it has beautiful special effects, and Kou Shibasaki is still quite hot, so I give it ... 3/10.
