I bought this movie for 99 cents on K-mart several years ago (with "Hawken's breed"), which made something worthy of Gabriel Byrne and Amanda Donahoe. It wasn't. The "Dark Obsession" (the title I bought it) was at the height of the "Hawken breed" (estimated IMBD value 2.4), but not enough to allow me to even keep it in the house. I threw both movies in the trash. <br /> <br /> This thing doesn't succeed on so many levels that it's hard to narrow down, but let's just say it's dry, incredible, boring, hedonistic, confusing, and even after 100 minutes. I love it too long. <br /> <br /> I love Byrne as an actor, but this schlock seems really bad in my CV.
