For years I saw this movie as a ninja movie, but after studying this culture, I can only think it's just another karate movie. Black shinobi and some guns don't do ninja, that's much more. Ninja is Japan's most dangerous warrior because they are trained in every aspect of life to survive. This movie is not about a ninja warrior, but a clown who tries to be something he can't even understand.
