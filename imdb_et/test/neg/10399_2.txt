I was surprised to discover that Michael Moore or Bill Maher did not participate in this "movie". The American Left Washers list of axes that are crushed and have a clear sense of democracy. Mao Zedong and Karl Marx did not appear in hell, but Ronald Reagan is in the same room as Hitler? Maybe we have to wait for these California spin doctors butchers at Paradiso to show all of their pet ideological politicians. <br /> <br /> Cheap pictures of religion, right-wing politicians, corporations and their lobbyists. Fox News, even SUVs. All of the radical left-wing points were over-covered - while noting the references to the wrong side, so as not to be a conscious effort. The one-time exception I noticed within one and a half hours is JFK's sexual Marilyn Monroe eternity: symbolic engagement in these propaganda pieces in a pathetic attempt to appear as a party.
