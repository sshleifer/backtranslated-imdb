Adela is a rebellious teenager in the attitude that she is right and everyone else is wrong. He must be the center of attention and he fools to do it. With his attitude, he is sent to the magic training. <br /> <br /> There, he meets the typical characters of contemporary cinema; nerd, clumsy, stepford housewife and sexual minority. Things happen and, finally, Adela learns her lesson. The purpose of the plot is a deeper meaning for the state of Adela, but it cannot offer it completely (at least I did not buy it). So what you are left with is superficial interaction within the same stereotypes you've seen in a million movies. In addition, the director seems to have a chest fixation, Adela flashes a few times too much, at least I don't see that they are relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> So the movie is OK, but if you're like me and don't want to look at teenage pissing people and make a behavioral U-turn in a moment I found very unbelievable, think twice before watching.
