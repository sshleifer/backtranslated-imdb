This movie is something terrible. I laughed all the time. I was forced to stop in some scenes because my mother thought it was not polite to laugh when people died, but even death in this movie is ridiculous. Especially when Tornado Tommy is sucked into one tornado. <br /> <br /> Explosions of cars occupied by wind energy in buildings look like the old school-side scrolling game called R-Type. The dialogues are very bad and I am interested in how they managed to play some of the participants in this movie. It's just amazing how such a bad movie gets on TV. <br /> <br /> Only the real reason for watching this movie is pointless and absurd.
