The film uses motifs that could be plagiarized by "Wait Until Dark" (1967), a much better film by Terence Young, starring Audrey Hepburn. "Dead Silent" is a pale paraphrase. There is nothing new here - a hidden object of a doll, bad men, a bad guy who is a good man. There was a shortage, however: Audrey Hepburn didn't see the child talking. But both stories depend on the trees. When an unbearable relationship was built in "Wait in the Dark", "Dead Silent" allows you to guess that it is such a stereotype.
