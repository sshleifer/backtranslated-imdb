New Year's Day. On the day after mixing too many vodka Martin and Cosmopolitans, who were stirring overnight with a bubble, I discovered my husband and I that the local cable company offers free digital special channels in January. We had a choice - do we use freebie channels or do we look at the X-Files eight-season DVD we got from our daughter for Christmas? <br /> <br /> We chose digital freebie because the DVD doesn't go anywhere and we need something ten to twelve hours a day to watch all the end of X-Files. The Drive-In channel offered the fear of the classic three-movie marathon: Asylum (1972), Damned House (1996) and The Pit and Pendulum (1961). The shelter is well reviewed here and Pit and Pendulum were too late for us to look, which meant that we could really be just for a critically exhausted house. <br /> <br /> Frankly, we tried to be serious about the movie because its stars are relatively good actors - Greg Evigan (William Shatner's overwritten Tekwars) and Alexandra Paul (the only Baywatch babe who could act, though he has ten years boy's body). Unfortunately, we soon got rid of the hair of small dogs because we worshiped the names of the films that this dog borrowed from their scenes: Poltergeist, The Shining, Hell House, The House On Haunted Hill, Ghost Busters! <br /> <br /> Especially Evigan's actual daughter's behavior was not too bad, given the foolish script they had to work with. CGI, 1996, was fun - in the last scene, if it had to be the most terrible, it was so bad as my wife and I laughed. <br /> <br /> Generally: Acting 4/5, Script 2/5, SFX 0/5
