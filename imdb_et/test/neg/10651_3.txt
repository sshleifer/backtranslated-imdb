Do not forget the serious logic gaps, do not forget to tend to the clich√© character images, do not forget about random writing and you like this movie. The main character, Alyssa, was supposed to be a loving, heroine, who you are drinking to save him (or save yourself). But he just grabs it and makes one wonder if all the pro ballerinas are really so stupid? His generation's mother was obviously only needed to further spread the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters who are ready to catch their poor, innocent, young girls, a persistent, biting artistic leader / frog. And cliche! He not only becomes anorexic, bulemic, counter and pathological liars, but all within a few months. It is like a writer who read every horror he could cast from a ballet and decided to see how much he could capture for two hours (ads). <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, but I'm a dancer. Such anorexia and "uprising" or "revival" of complications are not present in all the dance schools I have attended. In fact, teachers are so scared to even say that a girl can get a few pounds more easily, most dancers in my classes are actually considered overweight. I'm not saying that eating disorders never happen, but not as much as it was shown on the film. <br /> <br /> Another annoying problem with this movie was typing. Her again, again, a boyfriend was probably all half an hour on the entire screen, all in the first half. Other supporting characters were props, ornaments to further develop this story. Given the right dialogue, it would have been a very complex study of the psychic problem. As it is, it becomes one female exhibition and Kimberly McCullough does not have a chutzpahit to pull it out. <br /> <br /> For a non-dancer, this film would be an "understanding" of what really goes behind a closed door in a ballet company. For the dancer, this is a very offensive film that depicts ballerinas as stupid and older than stupid and poorly informed. These adjectives more accurately describe the people who got it. 3/10
