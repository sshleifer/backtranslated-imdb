This is a rip-off from Cellular. <br /> <br /> Poor pouring ... <br /> <br /> Poor direction ... <br /> <br /> Poor music ... <br /> <br /> And the list goes on ... <br /> <br /> well, because the direction, scenes and settings were pulled out of other movies. <br /> <br /> Even the combat sequence is copied. One with the mace was Kill Bill and the other with the fire hose was either Jet Li or Jackie Chan (I can't remember the name of this movie) ... <br /> <br /> Stay away from this cheap imitation thing ... <br /> <br /> You can't wait for something original from any Bhat!
