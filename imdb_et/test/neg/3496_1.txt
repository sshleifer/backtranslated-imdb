With a 2-hour drive, Crash charts the emotional anxiety of his 10th paired ensemble when faced with sometimes blatant and sometimes hidden forms of American society. It and the emotional anxiety of one of the audiences who is sitting in front and trying desperately to understand which films have changed these days. <br /> <br /> The time we live has become so complicated. Not only do we not contribute to modernism, even postmodernism, which has tried to destroy all these ideas, always put off a non-enthusiastic flag of postmodern ideas, all of which are not very destructive. the idea of ​​these great thinkers. But I ground. It has nothing to do with what the film is about, but rather what the film is about. <br /> <br /> Of course, it seems difficult to earn a living in Hollywood, which must satisfy a market that is so post-post everything that cynicism has become more than just a motto of life. It has become part of everything we do, and part of what we think, whether we like it or not. So a new studio product was born! Indie films that were once energetic and idealistic with their faithful experimentalism now seem to be as steadfast as the Hollywood movies that they sell to indie film markets. The Indie movie has to be sold at Sundance before 'recognition'. And that's not easy anymore. Even what constitutes a good movie becomes so obscure. In the past, filmmakers made people just entertained and have a good story - and in these seemingly simplistic attempts, the biggest film - filmmakers today have to make films that are first and foremost good; movies need people to think, be meaningful, be provocative, raise questions, yadda yadda yadda. Whatever it is, the Hollywood movie system is submissive, but this subversion seems strangely similar to the formal similarity of Hollywood movies, the innumerable ways to essentially differ from the same product. <br /> <br /> And I haven't started the movie yet. Maybe I've become too selective for the movies I've seen these days. Perhaps it is because my primary need to be entertained rather than being tried is to watch the movie. But hell, this movie is one big mess. Not only does this film not only allow it to follow the T-character, how to make a good guide to the Good 101 film, and it is as funny as they have given to God's speech. it raises issues of life against racism and racism in America; it has "touching" moments where everyone discovers more about themselves and others; not to mention that when you hear a female / new age soundtrack singing in high-level registers in foreign languages, you know that you are with all the above features. <br /> <br /> The above-mentioned point - that it raises questions about immediate issues such as racism - pisses me for a long time. As with all post-post post post-post all the movies, it is not just a message about this topic. Because our audience is much more intelligent about these post-post-post-worlds these days. Our audience wants us to make them think we don't want to make things so easy (and then they go into existential crap and say) because life itself is not easy. Ha ha ha. What other joint exercise we have here, the audience must think about problems rather than eating them. Okay, okay and okay. So the film changes it to listen to the non-message audience and because they are not exactly the message, it is so decisively fine and subtle good right? So we beat it with a well-written nuance of rhetorical prose fiction again and again. And, as irony is not steep enough, we have a funny character, the only sign that doesn't seriously see all these bulls in the racism debate, being "around" one of those irritatingly meaningful characters, where he finally learns, giving meaningful looks and breaks where viewers should also "learn something for themselves". Yes Yes. How I wanted to see an incredibly racist film right after that guy. <br /> <br /> For a long short cut, I think I wouldn't have received a movie if it wasn't that swollen self. The whole angst that made up the movie seemed more than a white boy who was the real Spike Lee-ish anger. It's both Tim Robbins and Sean Penn, the type that wants to fly under the humanistic flag when the only thing they don't understand is the flag they're casting in their holes. In the post-post-post world it is so trendy that it is completely subtle. Nothing is easy anymore. In his best efforts to actually be good, provocative and ultimately human, this imho, just one indie crap, comes from an indie director who wants to give himself a name as a reliable indie filmmaker. Now at least Hollywood's manipulation is easier and more sincere.
