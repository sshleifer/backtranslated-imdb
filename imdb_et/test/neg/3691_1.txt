After watching the movie, I decided it was so awful to have to join IMDb and write a review to warn other people about renting / buying this movie. To make the film fair, there is only one good part of this film and that is the reason for the final credit, then you know that this mess is well and truly over. I looked at it to the end in the hope that I would enjoy the film a bit of joy. Just tunnel more tunnels and an old man who speaks for himself (if you watch this movie too much time, then). Like Val, when he chooses such films, he can also say goodbye to his acting career. There is no point in even writing about what has already been done on the film. Keep your money and peace of mind and keep it well.
