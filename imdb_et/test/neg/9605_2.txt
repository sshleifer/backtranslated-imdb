I usually don't bother wasting my time writing such junk comments that I forget almost as soon as I see it, but since I saw this movie just yesterday on a Comcast Showtime channel (346, I think), I decided to be the exception. <br /> <br /> In addition to enjoying Carol Alt's viewing, I can't give any rational reason why I looked at it until the end of the movie. I am always surprised that good-looking women are ready to appear in such horrible movies, but I think she thought this film would bring something better. I hope he was right for him. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's a totally too typical direct-video-laughing attack, or just one trash, depending on your point of view. Although there are some decent moments in this movie, they don't quite fit the story as it is. <br /> <br /> The setting, as you remember, was the housewife Carol Alt depressed, who believes her husband, a policeman, is deceiving her. There was also something their child died of in an accident, and he accused him of that, but before that all went where he shot and killed. <br /> <br /> On the same fateful night, a wounded stranger will come to his door and he will tease him, and almost immediately his house will be the siege of government officials and mercenaries on the intention of capturing a stranger who appears to be almost supernatural fighting skills. <br /> <br /> This same type of material has provided a good deal of entertainment many times before, especially in Matt Damon's Bourne identity, and it could have been done this time, but this particular film was left under bad product values ​​and a poor script. <br /> <br /> This movie ends in the end when a mysterious stranger turns out to be a cyber (!) who was programmed as a policeman and discovered that Carol Alt killed his wife, he was trying to kill him! The film wasn't very good so far, but the ending really does end with its destruction, trying to make the enchanting activating thriller a charming Terminator / Robocop wannabe. <br /> <br /> I also thought that the violence at the end of the movie was a bit excessive, because the demented cyber went out of the poor Carol Alt before it finally came out of dust. What was that? What was in that matter what was in this movie? My attention and entertainment was about an hour until it reminded me I didn't watch a first-rate film. It wasn't even a secondary film. <br /> <br /> Final scenes seem to be a hasty sequel, which I don't think ever happened, even though I've not carefully checked the web. Needless to say, I'm not in a hurry to follow that movie.
