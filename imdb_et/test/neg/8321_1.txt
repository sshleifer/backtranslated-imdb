Are we serious? I mean wow ... just, wow. I think I saw this flick in the old War Journal. It is pathetic, originality is completely dead, instead of trying to formulate a new idea of ​​what we get, the state of drunkenness of the old plot, and "we change", we just change the gender or race of the original character. moronic and everyone should be sick and tired of seeing it ... but I think this is just a temptation and will probably fall on deaf ears to get into the second peat sound that hits the toilet water like the best 3:10. Yumale ... (wait) ... 3:10 Yumale! Thank you to Hollywood for killing the movie in the form of art and making this commercial float junk and blatant slowdown ... wonderful !!!
