Bathebo, you're a big dope. <br /> <br /> It's a WORST piece I've seen for a long time. I had just stumbled upon the television just late at night and is hurt watching. Really hurt. How do you get something like that? Terrible, terrible, terrible! OOOOOO ..... Toilet rinses again! A scary toilet! A scary toilet! A scary toilet! 1992 does not seem so beautiful to me, but looking at it, it seems to be in 1952. Please do not waste your time on the generation! <br /> <br /> A frightening old black man who says they don't build a pool in the yard. Scary! Scary! How does this stuff MADE ???
