Numbers' murder is one of the films you expect on TV but not. Considering the only actor, Bullock (although Michael Pitt seems to be moving to bigger and better things), it is not surprising that this film hides the memory quickly to replace the most important things. Like ... reminding you to close your door when you go out. Or, when the outfit comes out of the dress, the clothes are back. <br /> <br /> Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather, a personal policeman (not all). Together with his new partner (wet-looking Ben Chaplin), he is invited to investigate the murder of a young woman. Nothing is unusual except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think they have planned and executed a perfect murder. As the investigation continues, Cassie and the main suspect, Richie Haywood (Ryan Gosling), will have a battle of wills. <br /> <br /> The complex issue is that these two cases are hopeless. Bullock, though he is very nice to look at, is as confident as the hardened cynical police role, like Rodney Dangerfield (he would actually be better!). Chaplin, for his sins, is a complete non-economic entity and I am sorry he has to put this film in his CV when he tries to break into Hollywood. At least Gosling and Pitt, who are suspected suspects, are free enough. As if the vicious leaders were not bad enough, the story that sent someone to sleep and an extremely predictable (but illogical) ending, hit the head of this movie before it had the chance to drive. <br /> <br /> "Numbers' murder does nothing about it, even Bullock's nonsense naked scene does not redeem it. Well, just a little bit, but still not enough to save it. Forgettable, predictable and redundant - this is one movie, As Cassie probably says about his next incident, there's nothing to see here. Move, move on ...
