First of all, this movie is not nearly complete, in my opinion, that someone actually bothering the script for theft of every other page. <br /> <br /> The film has a strange time for unannounced, contradictory dialogues, wrong details, no bad music at all, no wrong places, and moreover, the volume moves up and down between different tracks. The cutting space was actually working and it says a lot. However, unsupported sound effects will damage the tension. <br /> <br /> Luke Perry does what he does best, just worried, and sometimes coughing hell out of hell. <br /> <br /> I really appreciate this movie for the worst year of 2007 and I've seen some bad things. Don't spend money on it, it's not so bad that it's laugh, it's worse. Ratings of more than 1 letter should show the blacklist of IMDbis because it is wrong.
