It is the bottom of the B-film type, which originates from one line of poverty in the studio, the Monogram, in the mid-40s, one that filled the double bill. <br /> <br /> The only reason I looked was to see what JACKIE MORAN was in a leading role as a kid boy in a radio station trying to solve the murder. He played Phil Meade with GONE WITH WIND only two years earlier and was one of his last teen roles. He's not Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> The script is as unhappy as the product values ​​and is full of clichés-filled situations where there are uniformly untalented individuals. WANDA McKAY is a girl in an electric cabinet discovered by a radio manufacturer and SIDNEY MILLER is a heroic friend of the hero who is afraid of his shadow. <br /> <br /> It's happy to be gone after an hour when the murder is resolved after the suspect's rounding. JON GILBREATH gave Texas, a cowboy alone, the only silent performance, but he bites dust after a too short look. <br /> <br /> There are several songs, but all of them are forgotten, just like flat jokes and dialogue.
