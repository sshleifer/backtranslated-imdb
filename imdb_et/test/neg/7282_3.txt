So, it has come to this. In this top-notch commentary on the flick, someone says "Nishi is a respectable man". Really? This is the man who kills and film people in the movie. He takes a short break to bank robbery. Dear Sir? How would you like your children to go to school for a child who calls it honorable? Wait, there's more! The person also says, "We can say he is constantly thinking." How can we do that? Well, do you know that the joke "How can you tell when is the CEO / Politician / Attorney?" ... "His lips are moving." Nishi's lips never move, so I think it means he's thinking. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is existentialism to warm the hearts of the sacrifice cult. Existentialism argues that the individual is responsible for the consequences of his actions. Not Nishi. Get the money from Yakuza. What, they want it back? Kill them. Police officers find it. Kill yourself and your wife. <br /> <br /> Really respectful.
