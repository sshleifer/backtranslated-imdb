How bad was it to make an almost Oscar-compatible movie! MOSTHLY MARTHA is much better, has depth, fineness and so on and mainly: excellent and talented actor in the leading role (Martina Gedeck). It's funny and ugly with the beautiful Aaron and the whole atmosphere ... again a ridiculous effort from Hollywood. More and more, remake and movies are full of schemes. Can't anyone create a good and just script? Or is it a secure solution to make redesigned or filmed images of well-tried cartoon characters? Movies are much less interesting today. Oh yes: If you want to see a really good movie, check out the original. It's definitely worth it.
