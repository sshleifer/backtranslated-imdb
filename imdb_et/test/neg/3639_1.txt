Shopping, sunny sky, beaches, a rich teenage boarding house and a very happy ending. Welcome to Zoey Brooks and his friends. Zoey Brooks is a self-proclaimed actress, proclaimed by Jamie Lynn Spears, who became the younger sister of the international celebrity Britney Spears. Her cute blonde wig in the first season and an attempt to hide her monotonous state accent, this confirms that Nickelodeon has really gone to dogs with nepotism. When Kristina Herrera, an actor who depicted Dana Cruz in the first season, left the show, all hopes hoped she was the only decent actor. Female casting is a complete shame, but male pain is a potential for teen media. If they continue as Jamie Lynn Spears' perfection image, many people will have to lower their standards. Hopefully, they will soon find that you can't do a career. Jamie Lynn Spears is for action, singing, and everything else she's trying to do with the falling spiral she calls for a career. No wonder why he has himself declared the actor. Critics would surely proclaim something other than that.
