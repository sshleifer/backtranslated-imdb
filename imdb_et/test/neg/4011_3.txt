I watched it last night at Sundance. Altman must be the leader forever. This exhibition, despite its "star power", is completely ineffective and its political knowledge - which I am not proud of by the liberals - is low and nervous, and the US seems to have been ripping the headlines today, despite the fact that it has come out of the mouth, like Mr Mario Cuomo. Drama as such is not very dramatic and comedy is not funny. The only points of interest are really how to live your life in New York, and the cast and team loyalty to revive an exhibition that continues to demand is a cult from 1988. Sometimes it seems that Altman's only contribution to the cinema has been the art in which all of his actors speak at once, with the result that it feels frustrating as they are at a foreign wedding.
