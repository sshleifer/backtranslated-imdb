Breaker! Breaker! is Chuck Norris as a truck driver and captain of karate, talked about two different careers. He puts a burden on him, which he can't deliver to his younger brother, Michael Augenstein, and when a young man doesn't show up, Chuck looks for him. <br /> <br /> What young Augenstein himself has become a speed trap, led by Judge George Murdock, from Roy Beane Law School. Of course Norris is doing the usual Chuck Norris tea, and when she gets in trouble, the call goes to the CB so that all the drivers come and help her good friend. This speed trap, known as Texas City, has a bad reputation and drivers are just too happy to help on the palm. <br /> <br /> Chuck is of course quite younger and has no facial hair. He has a dirty look for a man who understands that the Academy is not looking at this pill. George Murdock is extremely dreadful as judge Roy Bean wannabe. <br /> <br /> This is strictly for Chuck Norris fans.
