This small budget indie movie redefines the word "blah". The most surprising is that this word can actually be found in a dictionary defined as "nonsense ... uninteresting, boring, lifeless". The film redefines the word because I should add to the four words "PC crap", "pretentious pathetic" and "meaningless". <br /> <br /> The film tries to be so hard to be "hip" and "contact" with modern beautiful people fighting-for-je-ne-sais-quoi behavior and "thinking" (do they think?). There is almost no plot to talk about, although there is one sleep. The most funny and politically correct things are how a white woman with her big friends is a young, black stud, a black street-sax player who is confident of oh-so wise councils and advice, and a greasy black psyche. Isn't it nice how the races will eventually arrive? ... Ahhhh ... Finally, the woman reads "poetry" which is nothing more than one of her boring "expensive diaries". He gets a steady assignment (!!!), though in real life his listeners would probably have gone into deep sleep. But this film has little to do with real life, although this is where it should happen. In real life his reading of "poetry" would only have been made if he had a sense of adding a juicy, sexual detail. "And then I rubbed my big penis against my sweaty, impatient pink small vagina ..." Cheers! What's worse is that the lead actress has a dozen scenes in which she either buzzes or screws, but they never have the point of showing their breasts, which was clearly the only thing that saved her confusion. <br /> <br /> Black boy and blonde, separated by about a meter: they look like the cheap variations of Rodman and Madonna (as the last two aren't already cheap enough). Nicole Eggert, mentioned by Howard Stern in her "Miss America" ​​book, is blonde. Stern writes about Eggert that he took his implants out. But I believe that when they took the implants, they also suckled most of the flesh and muscle, because he looks hungry here. <br /> <br /> A scenes player in one scene develops angel wings; She looks like Al Roker advertising angel food cakes.
