I've just given 10 Thieves Highway, I will mention it for two reasons: prove that I am not a git who only gives bad comments, but 2 because the subject of the movie is the same thread, namely falling in love with a woman we all know that The real woman is a chick flick, but you can't avoid them all, they will get you finally. A beautiful woman does two things for me, two terrible terrible things, firstly, a prostitution as a career similar to that of a dancer, you know with absolutely amazing friends, a lot of leg warmers who lend to each other. You see a Pretty Woman in Pretty Woman and this is a street walker. The prostitute we are talking about here is a wonderful life, he is only happy with a random whip to explain his difficulties. My feeling is that this "happy Hooker" -type main character is a lot more tasty than even the almost realistic character, which for me raises the question of whether you make a movie of a human type, but you are too chicken to scare that player. familiar, why then? If I made a movie of a chef, but didn't want to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat, then why cook together? Trying out and turning a whore into a respectable dancer type, this story will completely capture and therefore never give any moral or social issues that it might have, which policeman, really very flat. Secondly, "Pretty Woman" insults romance itself, Edward Lewis, played by Richard Gere, has no idea how to "seduce" a lady who is without her plastic friend, seduce or romance. especially if you are a costume that does not imagine. Of 10 of his romantic moments, there are 8 or other money squirting, even when he first meets, this is Lotus Esprit turbo, which does all the work, necklaces here diamonds there limits, money money, where is the charm? Where is charisma, do not mention this piano sample please. <br /> <br /> Girls who like this movie are also girls who like more than most. The boys who like this film have not even realized that the old Edd has less potency than the calculator, because they probably are not that they have not registered it. More importantly, the one who loves this film hates the wonderful story of "Thieves Highway", which part is based on the same subject. <br /> <br /> Quit the song: <br /> <br /> Pretty woman hanging around the street Pretty woman, I like a pretty woman, I don't believe you You are not the truth No one can spend as much as you Mercy <br /> <br /> Pretty woman, you don't give me grace, pretty woman, I couldn't see, but see a real woman, and you look cute if you don't have imagination just like me <br /> > Pretty woman, shop nice woman. If a real woman, sell me your smile Pretty woman, yes, yes, yes Pretty woman, look at my way Pretty woman, tell me you stay with me ... and I'll pay you ..
