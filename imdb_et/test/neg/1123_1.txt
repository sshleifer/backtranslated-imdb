National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin's Eddie Island Adventure (2003) Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, Dana Barron, Jake Thomas, Sung Hi Lee, Eric Idle, Fred Willard, Ed Asner, D: Nick Marck. The embarrassing direct-video-flop is Opus Cousin Eddie and the family in the South Pacific on paid vacation by his boss, hoping that the dunce will not be able to meet his company after it has been smarter with the bitter lab! An idiotic spin off cannot measure some holiday movies (even a European holiday!), Asking if the filmmakers thought the script was actually funny. Even Quaid, Willard or Asner can't do it remotely. 83 min., Not rated. *
