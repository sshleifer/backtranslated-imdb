I should have learned more about this movie before renting it. It was one of those films where you watch it because it has to heal. When it ends, you feel stupid that you have wasted valuable time in life that you can never get back to. Ice-T did his bad dude and well, it was the highlight of the evening. Shuttle images look like it was made inside a small toy inside the box and space scenes were funny because they saw room costumes. There was no script and the chase of the car, where the man was bleeding and unconscious, was incredible because he was driving better than I would have been on one of my best days. All in all, I've seen worse, but it's not sure what I would like or would like to remember.
