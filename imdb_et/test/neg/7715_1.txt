I worked in a video store. I saw this title in horror and I rented this one night free home. <br /> <br /> This movie was really terrible, there's no redemption for it, because it actually captures the movie and just goes to destroy it. If the first movie wasn't small enough, this movie really takes a cookie that is (mostly) housed indoors and at night, thus avoiding the cost of the first film. Within the first 5 minutes of this film, college faculty crashes comically over an attractive student. Instead of condemning him, the professor apologizes half-heartedly and the girl mentions that, despite being thrown over the car hood (he pulled up when he approached), there is nothing to worry about ... after what he attacks him with the crowbar and kills him it! If it is not strange enough, she wants to try her, bringing her back from the dead and feeling the need to remove her clothes. <br /> <br /> Soft core female nakedness (and pubic hair) is rampant across the film and, frankly, the only real thing to keep the average male viewers interested ... as in the new scene in the first movie ... but even saying that this is a movie that gets worse off with its bad character, crappy dialogue and absurd plot reversal .... why introduce a central character who has survived for 29 days from a zombie attack to kill them in 10 minutes ... but just great bad movie
