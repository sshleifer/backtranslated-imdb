I watched it after I saw the "tunnel of death" (this is undoubtedly the worst film I've ever seen in my life) so you can understand that I looked a bit around to see cinematographic heritage leaders and producers responsible for it for. First, I thought the director and producer were the same man. They are both Kid Rock meets Dawg Bounty Hunter. I watched the TAPS study and I'm not a skeptic - I think TAPS is the closest one ever comes to a scientific methodology. It was cool and plausible - I believe they are haunting. <br /> <br /> But it's like a reviewer like the tour. Okay, nice, but "investigators" and "group leaders" seemed to be a pretty penny and they have financial investments on whether he's haunted or not, so if they have fantastic stories, I have to use this dance teaspoon. As someone else mentioned, I can point out what they wanted me to see about 50% of the time in the picture. For the rest of the time I couldn't do anything. Also without photos - time, camera type, room humidity, dust particles (which are 75% orbits), weather and other factors - I can't receive them. Also, I cannot help thinking that some may have a PhD. <br /> <br /> Why should this band keep numbers from the door? Vandalism? They also tried to complain about the death certificates of their sisters during the TAPS investigation - and they found only one that was "random" (people did not want to officially declare suicide). But when one of the guides mentioned it, he said "yes and its marked suicide." In October, it seemed like heads of haunted houses. <br /> <br /> However, I liked the interviews with old hospital and old hospital staff who really gave him many perspectives and personal touches. I am also glad that they mentioned that the employees had the best intentions and that they were not some ghoulish guards. They were not the best methods, but all they had. They were desperate to stop the disease.
