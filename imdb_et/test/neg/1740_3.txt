This weak attempt to spend more horrible craze on his usual cool Japanese horror movie was not the ammunition needed for the viewer to participate. Uzumaki, translated into Vortex, is just this - irrational and redundant respect for a strange downward spiral, something that has apparently enchanted the small town's dementia into obsessed ransom. Although this will certainly make the b-film enjoyable, it is traditionally a tiring act, direction and script for everyone except the Asian horror shock, shaking his head with his head. What could have been harshly interpreted by the Japanese equivalent to David Lynch's piece, rather than being a spiral trick before he even has the chance to explain what is not, of course. In addition to some intelligent techniques used, the film rarely combines a dull theme and a dull script that ultimately reaches the low-cost exploitation of the golden genre by replacing hollow images for a real substance. When the movie was over, there was hardly anything that came from any interaction to save a few scenes or pictures that climbed over one notebook. I at least commend the authors for trying to take the genre more into supernatural, metaphysical areas, and to understand the missing mistakes in the translation, but with zero content to pull it back, it can probably fall to twilight fans. - parked basements.
