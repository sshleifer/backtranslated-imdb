First of all, let me explain that I am a big bad sci-fi fan, especially when it involves gigantic, urban-shaped monsters. But it's so fantastic that I can't even be bad. They probably didn't shave enough money on the budget because they looked at the props (the only proportion we'd have to note as the size of an alien girl is the oversized novel pen available in Spencer's gifts for about fifteen bucks), they chose not to conceptualize or plot. In my opinion, the monster is OK, but it does not have enough communication with backgrounds, i.e. not enough destruction to best suit fans of the genre. The general rule of giant monster movies is: If you don't have many buildings with counterfeiting to crack, it would be better to have another counterfeit monster. This movie does not. I can not give my final complaint about the film without giving an end, but it is enough to say the origin of the monster and the method that was found to get rid of it simply does not hold water. Not even most of these movies. Skip it.
