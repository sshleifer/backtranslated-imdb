<br /> <br /> Clich√©d. <br /> <br /> Overdose with style to compensate for poor writing. <br /> <br /> Remember when MTV actually used music videos and other shows. Reality? Aeon Flux (2005) based on one such exhibition? cartoon from the mid 90s? The black-latex garment is a supernatural female protagonist. Aeon, who in this adaptation was played by cute Charlize Theron, is a cold divorced rebel who is as meaningful as a dancer and as deadly as a viper snake. He must be when he hopes to hit the front of a totalitarian government. <br /> <br /> I love science literature, but I hate suddenly the inflow of semi-overdosed movies of futuristic dystopia technology, like the island, and Equilibrium (2002) (bottom of the pile). Aeon Fluxil is all these problems in the movies, but amplified. That is, there is nothing shown to show that they would compensate for this delicious style that Matrix (1999) catalyzed. Private effects are therefore sensational in Aeon Flux, which earn some points, but scratch the surface and there is literally nothing. <br /> <br /> To make things worse, all the performances of this movie are cruel, and some actually seemed to watch me. Charlize Theron's character Aeon Flux is intertwined with the most cheesy hard chick schtick and it seems that director Karyn Kusama can't really decide where to go next? should she make her more open or emotional? He doesn't know! Let's go to both sides! Imagine you take a shotgun, download it with a different kind of character development, and come up with a random mess. This is the character of Aeon Flux. <br /> <br /> Film Aeon Flux presents all "obligatory" ideas in a dystopian society - individual vs. society, nature vs. science, emotion vs. cold cause, and so on. You've seen it before and done it better. Read Orwell, Bradbury or Huxley or even see Logan Run (1976) or Blade Runner (1982) ... nothing! Avoid this fake cheese party as long as possible. <br /> <br /> 3/10
