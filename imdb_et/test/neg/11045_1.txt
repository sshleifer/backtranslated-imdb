Please don't blame Korea for this bad movie. I'm in Korea (please excuse the bad English). I was sad to see those films that make Korea look like blood and sex. I was even more sorry to see the killings of the animals and hear the Americans say it's Korean. We do not eat live animals! So please stop the movie for your crime, saying it is culture! There are scenes where a person eats live animals and non-Koreans think it is normal. No, it's nasty for us. The director is wrong, sick person with family detention and killing. I want America and France to end this bad person who is ridiculous in his country. Please see any other movie from Korea that gives you ideas on how artistic we really are. This movie is garbage.
