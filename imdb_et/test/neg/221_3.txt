I'm so angry at the point I usually put down to make a spoiler review, but in that case I make an exception. The first scenes of this movie are weak and when they reach the movie meat and potatoes. This is one movie whose roots were bad guys, because the Captain-Salvation Day was incredible and had nothing to do with it or anything that you liked. The leading actor gave the weakest result and Laurence Fishburne or Matt Dillon couldn't even record that movie. Sometimes the film has eye openers or great moments that may not be so great. If you are looking for a movie in the meantime, but don't care, don't pick it up.
