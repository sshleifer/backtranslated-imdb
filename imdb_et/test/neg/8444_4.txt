Of course, "Piranha" is not led by Joe Dante and directed by Roger Corman. It wasn't as obvious as I bought the DVD for just $ 2.95, because the DVD cover art matched the Corman comedy / horror "Piranha", even the DVD menu (of course, no features) fit the cover. Looking at this odd movie, I half-watched my girlfriend and I wondered where PIRANHAS was? When the movie reached its peak, we realized that we had to watch the wrong movie because we had seen that a trailer with a completely different film material had an obstacle on the back of the DVD that didn't match our viewing and credits (actors, producer, director) were also completely different . Instead, we got some jungle melodrama girls and two men looking for diamonds and facing a cruel animal keeper. This teaser, the thriller of exploitation is boring and pointless, and is only gently fun in the old school, at the camp. Strangely enough, a DVD can be made with the wrong film, but I think it's a simple mistake to make vision as if they were both B-class movies with the same name in the 70's. When I read other posts on this movie, I noticed that I'm not the only one who has the wrong movie on the DVD. How could this be an international mistake? Maybe there is a DVD phenomenon where unsuccessful movies try to recognize the wrong DVDs? WHAT'S GOING ON???
