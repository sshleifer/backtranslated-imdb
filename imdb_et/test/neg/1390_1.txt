This is a great example of what happened in Comedy Central after Dave Chapelle left. Here's the problem with Carlos Mencia. First, his birth name is Ned Holness and he was known until he was 18 when he changed his name to Ned Arnel Menciaks. He was born in Honduras, although he is acting like Mexico. He also grew up in the United States. <br /> <br /> Maybe I can get all this nonsense, but ... <br /> <br /> He's been trying to steal other people's material. Joe Rogan has thus been his most vocal critic. The Stereotype Olympics were an idea he broke into a couple of DJs in Miami. He has stolen Bill Cosby's jokes. He stole George Lopez's material in his special HBO (13 minutes). <br /> <br /> He thinks what he is doing is so original, but Dave Chapelle and Lisa Lampanelli have been robbing the idiot many years ago. (other young people). <br /> <br /> This example disappears and burns. The word Beaner can't last long before it gets older. He hasn't done anything after the first episode. <br /> <br /> "Want to hear jokes? Beaner who jumps in the fence! It's funny for 3 seasons!" No it is not. <br /> <br /> Acute.
