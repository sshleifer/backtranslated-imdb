I have to say that only desserts are one of the worst films I've ever seen. The action was terrible and even the plot line was ridiculous. I gave it to 3 out of 10, because I enjoy ridiculous movies. My expectations were not great to get started, but it turned out to be bigger than I expected. I thought it might not all be as bad as it started, but as soon as the name of the competition - The Golden Whisk - came, I started to change my thoughts. Everything went downhill from there. The only thing that I liked about this movie, except the wilderness of this absurd plot and dialogue, was the chef. However, being a craft shop, there were minimal scenes where they actually cooked something. I would recommend watching this cooking channel instead of the movie. You see more food that is made, and you do not pity the pathetic one-liners. However, if you enjoy fun love stories that are sometimes fun, check out.
