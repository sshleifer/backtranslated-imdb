The only thing he has to offer is Tru and Jack's interesting opposites, their choices and views, and the philosophical issues that it raises. Tru finds that he helps people who do not have to die, and Jack feels they should die, and he is confused with a plan of destiny or a plan of the universe or the like. > But he is obviously able to change things, so there is clearly no such thing as fate in the series's metaphysics. Jack has no reason to believe he exists. And very comfortably, Tru doesn't ask him the right questions. Nobody does it. Obviously it proves that the series makers have no answer. <br /> <br /> Just no plot! <br /> <br /> Instead, they leave the series to be able to continue their boring girl, only temporarily interrupting the Tru and Jack competitions against the unknowns ... <br /> <br /> out there is nothing. Teen's pop series, pretending to be something else. <br /> <br /> Your time is better spent sleeping.
