Let us not be a child, this cruelty is not Nine or Cat Women. It's a bad period! The performances vary from the drama school (Marla English) to the "don't care less" (Tom Conway). Photography (even good print) is so obscure that sometimes it's hard to see what's going on. The real problem, however, is pointless, pointless, almost plot less story and cordless, quiet. After 77 minutes, it still seems endless. <br /> <br /> The scenario is particularly intuitive. There are two stories that only intersect at the end of the picture. Tom Conway tries to create a super race using voodoo and modern science (although there is little evidence) that he can telepathically control. He keeps his wife in jail (for no apparent reason). Meanwhile, a couple of small and white hunter's instructions are trying to find the village where he works, gold and jewels. When they finally arrive, Tom Conway decides that one of them, a woman, is the ideal subject for his trials. He has become a monster, kills Conway (natch!) And then turns back. He sees a golden shape sinking towards the golden pool, trying to take it down and falling into the water and probably sinking. The white hunter rescues the woman. On the final image we see the allegedly drowned woman again in the monster; threatening a sequel (now that it's a really scary idea!). <br /> <br /> The AIP producer Samuel Z Arkoff's DVD lecture boasts of celebrating teen niche markets and satisfying brilliant low budget films. However, it is hard to see how anyone might think that this messy mix would satisfy any audience. What kind of complaint do they think they might have? The monster appears so rarely that it can hardly be called a horror movie. Jungle action is lukewarm and tedious. There are no teenagers and young people who could be expected to be identified. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers showed a 77-minute movie, but they didn't make a movie. This is a trick and Arkoff should shame his engagement with it.
