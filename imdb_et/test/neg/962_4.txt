Rudolph Mat√©'s film from the 1950s is renewed to the 80s, Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid) is a university lecturer who had previously successfully written a career but now went down with marriage. The original exposition looks at the viewers in the mind that everyone has something against him, so if the revelation turns out to be poisoned, we are not as surprised as, of course, it doesn't know the original. Dexter, after being told that he has less than 48 hours to live, decides to follow his steps with the help of one of his pupils, Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan), but they find they have many obstacles. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a promising black and white, because Dexter strikes the local police station, where he wants to report the murder ... his own, but the Huey Lewis style 80's, which accompanies this scene, is just a tension and tells the viewer that it will be pretty bad, its only question how bad? Of course, we'll soon have to use the old flashback media, but now it's the full technical color of the movie. There are some short tributes to Noire, because the adopted couple stand in front of the front blind, but there is nothing to suggest that the performances are terrible, especially by Ryan's usual dizzy blonde with a cutesy pie smile routine. The film is a lazy attempt to put some unnecessary oops on a fine film room, obviously trying to transfer money to one Body Heat audience, the seeming results are undoubtedly aimed at teenagers and they are sure to be welcome. 4/10
