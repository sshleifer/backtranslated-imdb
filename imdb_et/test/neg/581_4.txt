"Could Include Spoilers" Unfortunately, Lou Costello's latest film distinguishes slightly better than Abbott & Costello's latest film "Dance With Me Henry". This movie is not at all terrible, it is a failure of a fun career. Dorothy Provine is nice to watch and the film is somewhat tolerable. You can't blame Lou Costello because the big studio released it, which meant that someone had to give it a "green" light. In my opinion, Lou Costello had for a few years been losing his son and unreasonably attacking the IRS. If you look at the latest 3-4 Abbott & Costello films, you may notice that magic was gone. Check out "Dance With Me Henry", which is now a painful film.
