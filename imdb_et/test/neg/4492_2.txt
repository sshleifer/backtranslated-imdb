May contain spoiler. <br /> <br /> Innocent trailer park or perhaps "Compton" LA white boy witnesses terrible childhood abuse and drug abuse. Unprofessional but committed police partners are trying to bring down a "complex" top-of-the-range club of drugs, which drug owners can trigger and chew by senior lawyers. The thickening of the plot increases as more people return to look for revenge and justice with a predictable end. The only memorable part was Ron Jeremy walks. <br /> <br /> If I was in the cinema, I would have asked for refunds. I'm sorry for the poor players in this movie. It was just a terrible and painful look. The worst part was cinematography, where the director had to blink the same scene so that the sound would not be even. And NO, it was not a codec or DVD problem, but a deliberate technique. Ughh. Two stars.
