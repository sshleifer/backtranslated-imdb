This is definitely a "less known" comedy that has been short since the 1920s. The only reason I saw it was because it was on a DVD on Kino Films, which contained short short pants from Ollie and non-Laurel and Hardy. These are interesting and historically important, but also mean and average of the style film. Compared to the short of Chaplin, Keaton, Arbuckle and Lloyd, they are definitely a step below quality and humor. The accompanying music was pretty bad according to the standards of other silent DVDs. Finally, I turned off the sound because the music was in the wrong mood. But despite that, they are still worth it. <br /> <br /> I have to be honest about this short. It was the last of 8 on this DVD, and by that time I was bored because eight short shorts were on average central. So it is possible that the film can be LITTLE better than 4 - but definitely, if it is, it's not better than 5! The film is quite common for short incompetent bellboy. Something particularly interesting and there are definitely much better quiet shorts.
