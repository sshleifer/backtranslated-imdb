I've just written a comment to "ACES HIGH" (1976) and remind me of the movie I watched when I released my child; since then, I've only been watching it once and it was more than enough. As Kevin says well, "it's a waste of time". In addition to the dog battles that are well done, the rest of the scenes are poorly placed, where participants fight the bad script and equally weak directions. I don't remember the stupid German accents that Kevin mentioned in his commentary, but this is another pathetic mistake; when Corman tried to convince the German pilots more convincingly, why didn't he use German actors and duplicate those parts? On the other hand, it is a good example of the astonishing Hollywood style of filmmaking, the "villain" of which is so clearly recognizable, not only with brutal acts, but also with grotesque accents. <br /> <br /> Speaking of "cruel action", the ridiculous scene was the murder of Lieutenant Hermann Goering. During an aircraft-based attack, English nurses are an absolutely disgusting piece of propaganda that has been made "historical behind". If you want to see a factual, moving, well-functioning, and directed film during the war war "ACES HIGH" (1976) or the wonderful classic "The DAWN PATROL" (1938), you won't be disappointed.
