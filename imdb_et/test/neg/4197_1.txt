This is the most stupid film ever produced in front of the camera. I can't believe I was pulled enough to rent that junk. I've seen some bad movies, but it takes a cake .... Ice cream ,,, and chips too. Omg, I still can't get over how bad this thing was. It was Joke .... Plot wasn't permanent ... and the camera was supposed to be a 3-year-old child. I've never seen a movie long enough to go anywhere. I mean, the whole movie could have been under 30 minutes. I think this man had extra time on his hands. (Like 3 hours.) And another 60 bucks in your wallet and decided one night ... (Hey .. Let go of the stupid movie ever made). ) And they did just that. Give me a break. I'm going back to the video store right now to get my money back. Anyone who has looked at this trash should do the same.
