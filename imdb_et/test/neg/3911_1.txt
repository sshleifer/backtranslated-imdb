Only one word describes this movie: BAD !! I have no idea why this movie was even made, or how they mark Dennis Hopper with this movie. Stuart Gordon is a better leader than this and Hopper is a much better actor. The film is an ordinary stupid. I liked the idea of ​​"square pigs" and there was an interesting scene of love that included cyber, except to avoid this movie at all costs.
