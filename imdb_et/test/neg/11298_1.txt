Hannibal must be the most divine-horrible film I've ever seen. Actually, I want my money back. What a waste of time. There is no graph, minimal character development, questionable motive, bad dialogue, non-standard action. What else to say? If you haven't seen it, don't worry. I wouldn't even have rented a video and if you came to the TV ... change the channel. The only reason someone should see this movie would be to see if the free gloomy violence lived the whole leap (which, frankly, is why they added it). If you want to see a gug who eats your brain, move on. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of this movie? It's like someone just asked, "I don't know what Hannibal is these days" and we just went on a ride. He's free at the beginning and he's free at the end. Meanwhile, Anthony Hopkins and filmmakers have a lot of self-awareness. Julianne Moore is bravely trying to inject some life into her Clarice, but they gave her a non-standard script and as much as I am worried she was put to failure. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is just a very bad story in every sense. The only reason he made so much money was due to pointless violence that they added, which at the end of the day leaves you with more disdain than you should know. <br /> <br /> I give her a big fat RASPBERRY!
