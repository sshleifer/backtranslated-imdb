If PUFFY CHAIR sounds, beware of your soft, colored padding. <br /> <br /> The film starts pretty well. Josh (Mark Duplass) and Emily (Kathryn Aselton) are a couple of boyfriends who have some time with their relationship. The statement is one night and, in order to restore, Josh Emily asks her father's house, where Josh is going to offer a dashing LazyBoy lounger for her father's birthday. Emily accepts, and along the way, Joshi's flying brother Rhett (Rhett Wilkins), an Amish-style colleague who is more involved with other people's lives than his own. Josh and Emily, but also the bitter feeling of Puffy's board (initially very dirty and decomposed, until Josh "confirms" the original owner to upgrade it). Rhett quickly determines that all Emily and Joshi's problems are caused by LazyBoy and put it in a torch overnight ... <br /> <br /> And this is the last we listen to in the chair, though there are a few minutes left in the movie. <br /> <br /> The big problem is that the movie's title is The Puffy Chair, if it's not the board at all. This is Josh's and Emily's disastrous relationship and how he made his feelings against each other. Once the chair is destroyed, it has never been mentioned, although they reach Joshi's parents' birthday without a gift. Josh does not mention the board or his father. There is no connection between this and the lives of these people. Why call the film "Puffy Chair" and why is there no connection at the end? Bad script. Another annoying thing is that Mark Duplas brother Jay Duplass is not only a director, but also an operator (and not very good). Almost every scene has fast zooming characters that go grainy and not in focus before the camera's autofocus reaches and the rights itself are. Initially, it took on a peculiar and artistic feeling but quickly became intolerable. <br /> <br /> Playing a movie is accessible and fun. All the actors / actors did a good job. However, poor product quality, a prone end, and a lack of title with the title caused too many problems with this flick.
