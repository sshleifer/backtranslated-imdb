The book of revelation begins very well. Three masked women are abducted, attacked, attacked and sexually raped by Daniel, a egomanian dancer. <br /> <br /> After that, nothing else will happen. There are some clues about rediscovery, but the film does not give or explain or the real end. Daniel's reactions after abuse are very simple. She gives up dancing, interferes with every woman and finally starts communicating with a very simple and ordinary woman. <br /> <br /> I have seen a good part of the works of art, but there is something missing. <br /> <br /> The main wires are good; but some signs don't seem to be fully defined.
