and i still don't know where the fuck is this movie? I really mean what this film is? Does it show Sean Connery's total lack of Arabic? Does it show that if he could play the role of Moroccan warlord he was natural that he would play the role of Ramirez in the highlands? Why was Teddy Roosevelt even in this movie? Why was so much sand used so little? Where were so many rebounds? Why did Teddy ignore the Japanese guy with whom he shot archery? Did he realize that the man was Japanese? Why did Connery's accent fail to give any reliable excuse? At least Jean Claude Van Damme has an excuse for his French accent, whether it is raised by French nuns in Hong Kong (Double Impact), raised by Louisiana (Universal Soldier) bay or who has a French mother and grown in Indochina (I don't even remember the name of this movie) )? Does anyone explain it?
