The populist approach of the Altiocle is manifested in all its titles, the worst and the best. He doesn't care (or has a clue) about art, everything he cares about is that people think they have a gang, watching his movies. The problem is that the efforts are too obvious, and if the events open up with all their meaningless exaggeration, the effort will not work badly. <br /> <br /> On this "Turkish" movie (who knows where the original or originals were made, because it seemed to me very Hollywood), Altioklar tries to be a Tarantino. (Mr Tarantino, if you read it, look at the film for his best comedy of life!) He doesn't use it to do it, everything he does is to use extreme things and it becomes unbearably absurd and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Levent Koolymy as a cow-lined hair forensic man is just fun. I hope to meet him personally and ask him how he felt about this movie. Because I found him an offensive role for him. Demet Evgar, who kept his genitals, was not asked and did nothing but a fake one. Another idiotic aspect of this movie was the 100% faulty pace setting. When things need to be done slowly, the scenes flow sharply. And at other times, it's sleepy to look slowly at the ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If Altioklar is so in love with Hollywood's superficiality, he should instead use Michael Sixarrows. Even such a move would not be half-ridiculous than what he has done with this film. He should first learn not to imitate directors whose level he would never approach, he understands that he is not in Hollywood, and then take a private lesson from Zeki Demirkubuz or Reha Erdem about how the idea flows. This useless movie would not even be able to record them, but maybe he could take steps to watch movies in the future. <br /> <br /> By the way, I've seen some infamous errors like Propaganda and Otostop, and I still can't say it's the worst movie in Turkey.
