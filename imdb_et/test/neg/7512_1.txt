If you like to see it, you can see it in your school history class or something, try to convince your teacher to see something else. believe me, something better than this movie. it's slow paced, confused, boring, poorly built, gory, gringy, do i have to go? This is a good message, but I've seen that they have been better addressed in many other films. Operation is not even good. This movie is just uncomfortable because it starts funny (not intense) because it is a surreal story, when finally, just becomes uncomfortable to watch. <br /> <br /> I feel honest that 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life have been kidnapped. Why would anybody see that girls would describe the triplets for 10 minutes when watching them for 20 minutes through a traffic jam, listening to the hippie who can see the sheep, witnessing some rape when seeing her leadership role in her husband. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie deserves something, just 1/10. And if you are not satisfied with my preview, I am a serious open minder and I like movies that protest through symbolism, but this movie was just terrible. excuse me to avoid this movie.
