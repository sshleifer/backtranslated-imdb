Okay, so I cool down in my room when my mother knocks at the door. I open the door and what do I see in her hand? "SLEEPY HOLLOW HIGH". I think it must be an older horror movie, because now someone can be stupid enough to name a movie that after The Blockbuster hit "Sleepy Hollow" starring Johnny Deppi. But to my surprise, the film is at least two years older than the original. That alone should have stopped me V.C.R. But I didn't have a chance to take it, I had to believe that this film might have one little hop. Little do I know that the radiation where you can't see it is the first, the story is so ridiculous that it is probably true in some countries. Two, actors seem more like people who are real people who just happen when the director screams cut. Three, the director of almost every film, is always terrible. But the funny thing is that this is another movie directed by Kevin Summerfield. I'm starting to rely on my film to bring me to the floor with a laugh. <br /> <br /> Where to start with this movie? I know, let's start with a runner in the woods. The camera's lighting was so bad that I believe the jogger was standing and the camera man ran. I love how a woman stops eating a candy bar. I mean, it's almost in the dark, or almost in the light, who could say with the camera light. And he finishes eating a candy bar, I mean CANDY BAR, HELL. So, because of the stupidity, she gets the first victim, and I'm ready to break the tape, find the director, burn my small hands. <br /> <br /> Then some men don't want to try to repair a car that is probably broken for a few years. Then the fake Mack 10 and the very real prostitute come from our main charter. <br /> <br /> Some movies relate to a group of kids who all get into trouble. And they are given the opportunity to choose Sleepy Hollow Park to stop the trash or face forever. There, one of the teachers (Mr.E or a.k.a. Kevin Summfield) was sent to the woods who think they are watching them and making sure that everything goes right. The funniest thing is how the buildings are developed. I mean what is counterfeit with Mack 10 and who has ever heard of a hacker trying to kill himself. And some of the pupils' attitude towards teacher E before all this community service had even come. However, the school still thought they had a good idea to let him go. There's also one student named J who wants to keep the movie open to the audience, trying to jump into the audience when everything he actually does adds to the cheapness of the movie. The sound was so terrible in this movie. I mean, there was one when two men were fighting, and the boy strikes another stomach and the sound effect that sounds like someone who punches the tree out of T.V. It started terribly and ended dangerously stupid, even to my taste. I say this, however, the music made upside down made the scenes somewhat acceptable. But not so much tolerated. My conclusion is that if you want to leave another movie that Kevin Summfield was serious about buying "Sleepy Hollow High. <br /> <br /> I still have to think of myself taking pictures to remove these fake Mack images. 10. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
