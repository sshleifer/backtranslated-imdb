I watched this movie a while ago and the only thing I remember about the movie is how terribly bad it was definitely in my 5 worst films I've ever seen. And I think I have to convince my companions to get this movie in a video store, my image is photographed because of this movie because my mates trust me again? I doubt they will always say that they do not understand anything under this cover, they were right when I saw the cover of the skins / gang guys, I thought it would look good because it was a load of leather heads on the front panel, where riots with metal bars run. Don't watch this movie. I don't think anything else to say that acting is a bad story is bad, it's just bad.
