The only reason I checked this film was getting to know "early" Kim Bassinger. That and the fact that my TV guide said it was a "thrilling stop", and it was rated three stars. The rating has to come from who wrote this generation, because the only relationship in this movie was whether I finish it or not. Robert Culp turns on, which must be his "police" catastrophe disaster, which is not even plausible. At one point, ALL is a suspect, including a weak old woman. If you want to deliberately anticipate watching a badly written, poorly managed, poorly-acting movie, go to it. Maybe you appreciate it for great movies. I wish I had this hour and thirty-six minutes ago.
