The narrative was clear and concise, but in general the film was no longer interesting and unrecognizable. Ghengi Khan had a historically very interesting / epic life, but the film couldn't beat it, but focused on the small attacks on the young and the love story I think I've seen hidden on other movies. I never knew compassion or empathy for the leaders - yes, he had to overcome slavery, but it seemed easy for him to ride with khan-robbery, killing and double-shifting. The quality was redeemed by photography - landscapes definitely helped the dark atmosphere of the film, unfortunately with the darkness of the story - I left motionless and frustrated.
