OK, imagine that every US has every country exactly the same tree and grown foliage. Imagine that the monkey-trap camp, which has turned so far from the road, had to make a beautiful asphalt in the first half of the river, a perfectly straight path that reaches it. Imagine a world where you have to wear full biological safety clothing to collect floppy disks, just put it in a ziploc bag and put it in your pocket without precaution as soon as you get back to the office. A world where two nine-year-old girls are happy to give a lot of blood without filing a complaint. This is the world where this movie is set up. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is one of the most clich√© excavations that has been my witness for many years as a failure. <br /> I liked it. :)
