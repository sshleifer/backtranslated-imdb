This movie wins all there. Well, it depends on what you are looking for ... it can be on a 10 or 1 scale. This movie is in its own league. I don't think any film could come close to it. I'm not sure what the director was going to do ... thriller or comedy. When he thinks he's a thriller, he has created one of the best Bollywood comedies with a hit of luck all the time. You have to believe it ... matrix + terminator + a number of other films that have been rolled into one, with a storyline from the 1980s Hindi movies with a icchadhar nail (a mythical snake that can become a human) <br /> <br /> It's an ideal movie when you sit with your friends with alcohol on the side, planning to laugh at the movie! I'm not sure whether to give him 1 or 10.
