The New York Family is the latest in its neighborhood to get a TV that almost destroys David Niven's marriage to Mitzi Gaynor. In the bedroom comedy, which rarely sleeps in the bedroom (and there is nothing sexy happens). Gaynor as an actor is about as much as an oven - he turns on, he turns off. The only reward of the movie is the perky Patty Duke, the pre- "Miracle Worker", as Niven's daughter. He's wonderful; There is no "many anniversary". * from ****
