George Sluizer THE VANISHING of Celebrity (He did both a strange European original and a Hollywood remake) towards CRIMETIME. He should not blame this confusing poor movie because all the problems are in Brendan Somers' script. It is badly focused and cleverly written. For example, a killer is attacking a nightclub that is waiting for the victim, any victim, and starts talking to a teenage girl. Cut to the next scene where he talks to the criminal: "I'll tell you everything about yourself, tell me about your life?" Unfortunately, the girl has told baddie the story of her life and is a terrible example that the screenwriter is unable to bring a character to life through dialogue. I know that how bloody it is is that the writer who produced it should have tried harder. <br /> <br /> It's hard to explain the film's message. At some points it feels like he is trying to be a British natural scourge who gets into media voyeurism with a crime (maybe it even affected the notorious video game MANHUNT), but the script isn't funny enough to do that. If you have a sex scene that does not promote a plot or characters or clues about the subtext, then you have a poorly written script and CRIMETIME is a poorly written script
