"Tart" is a good example of the old Yogi Berra, saying, "If you don't know where you are going, you will probably come elsewhere". Writer / Director Christina Waye (in her first role) has managed to make a $ 3 million movie that reaches the rest. "Tart" is either an age story that has no characters that a rational person can connect, a black comedy without humor or a sexploitation film that has nothing special about sexy. <br /> <br /> Unlike the Swain standard, "Tart" actually works as a competent and experienced production designer. Good enough to offer two extremely nice shots: Swain's and Barton's scene, which takes together with the whirlpool and in the Swain Park Park, where there is a nice "Alice in Wonderland" sculpture installation. The emblems incorporated into these elements support the possibility that Waye (despite linear logic or tone unity) actually has some visionary talents and aspirations to make a quality film. <br /> <br /> It is even possible that Waye was trying to blend somewhat the expressionist "Metropolitan" and the classic "Cruel Intentions", which also deal with Manhattan's top class. There are many camera shots in framing windows and doors, but there are few faces and eyes. The first technique that implies symbolism and the last of deliberate separation from the characters and their motivation. "Tart" seemed at least twice in the camp and it would have been advisable to continue in that direction. First of all, there was a scene where they tried to let the seemingly dead Swain trash. Then there is all of his father about the Jew (he played the same extremes as Joel Gray dances with the Jewish Guerrilla "Cabaret"). <br /> <br /> In other films, Swain's exemplary technique is all the scenes in which she appears (add the chewing of the landscape here), but in "Tartis" she actually shows the ability to limit her. This is the best result of his career. It also gives some clues about his physical deterioration from willowy super cute "Girl" to "Pumpkin". This transformation was about half the time he made "Tart"; so the destruction of time goes by. <br /> <br /> Mischa Barton ("Sixth Sense" I feel better as a girl ") and Lacey Chabet have excellent supportive roles, the rest are simply horrible, although some should blame for the Waye script and direction.
