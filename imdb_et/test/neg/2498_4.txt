Well, because it is called the Porno Holocaust and directed by Joe D'Amato, I went to this movie while waiting to hit ... and although I got it somewhat, the Porn Holocaust was a massive disappointment because it was just so sad. The title suggests that the film has porn, and it is not wrong - the porn holocaust is pretty porn, and most of it is the same thing over and over again. The first sex scene is between two women, and it got my hopes up, but after that it just goes back to normal porn and the rest of the movie (first hour!) Consists of talking and you can imagine how much fun it is to sit! The plot focuses on an abandoned island where, believe it or not, something strange happens. Of course, it is not long before a group of men, consisting of a few men and some scientists, all of whom are sexy women on the island. They have sex a few times and some strange things happen, then over an hour later they attack a mutant zombie creature whose eyes are ... <br /> <br /> It was a good idea for the original porn - a zombie who loves to get it but surprisingly it doesn't work at all. The film's watches are only ten minutes away from two hours and it is too long for such a movie. I have no idea why the Holocaust of Porn is as long as it is; if they were just one minute from each sex scene, the film would have been under ninety minutes and it would have made it much more acceptable! Zombie takes what appears to be an eternity (it's quite a long time before the sexual break is long enough for them to actually travel to the island), and when it finally appears, it's a big disappointment! I understand that this is a low budget B-movie trash, but D'Amato could certainly have been a little harder to try and get something better than that! I don't even want to tell an actor, the atmosphere, etc., It makes no sense. Porno Holocaust is basically your average dull porn with a mild horror, and I can't recommend it!
