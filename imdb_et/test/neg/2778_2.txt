Every time a film plays a dwarf or dwarf, the odds 10 to 1, which the director threw at him, because he didn't know what else to do to keep the movie interesting. In this case, this little boy is not so bad - he manages to keep his dignity for most of his scenes (except for the part where he pulls the leading man down into the cave), but the film itself uses it as a dog kitten. <br /> <br /> The problem here is normal, with low budget movies - here's the germ of a good idea, but the director and scriptwriter don't know how to develop it. A good director would take a variety of stories - brain transplants, crazy doctors with secret and dungeon, car chasing, fist fighting, twilight monsters Frankenstein style assistant, mind control, betrayal and conspiracy, etc. exciting, engaging movies full of cheap excitement and fun. Instead of what we get here, there are a number of people who stumble in a doctor's lab, a chewing operation where the patient bleeds the tempura color, followed by some of the same people who stumble and claim more in the doctor's lab, followed by another subgroup of the original group, who rides around and has an accident, followed by a cave escape scene, mostly a woman who puts her shoes back, followed by a roofing tile (actual high point), followed by a series of confusing events where all the people in the movie get away from everyone else , followed by a lovely walk in the countryside, where everybody pursues, falls, attacks or flees from all others, followed by good, not much else. <br /> <br /> Somewhere here is a scary peroxide blonde, dressed in a white, well-meaning heroic type, a kind of shyly good-looking, three-leg lab assistant, a big bun with a melted rubber mass pasted on one side of her face, child, who wonders in the middle of the movie to give more "frankenstein factor", a brunette who falls in love with a hero without a visible reason, and a crazy doctor himself, who must be the happiest man in the history of the super-villains of evil, because nothing goes but it still works for him ... and all because he reminded me that an electrode was transplanted into one brain at an operating point. . <br /> <br /> It wasn't the worst film I've ever seen, or even the worst used film I've ever seen, or even the worst film I've ever seen, but it's just there everywhere is cheap and attentive to the details, and there is no real reason to even look at the bad movie enthusiasts.
