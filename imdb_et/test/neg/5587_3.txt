I'm sorry ELO fans, but I was disappointed with this concert at Los Angeles CBS Television City. It's a decent music, but the presentation is just boring. Most of the songs sound the same and singer-writer Jeff Lynne is about as animated as a shop mannequin. She has a nice voice, but she's not much to watch. He's standing in one place and sings for an hour and 40 minutes. The songs all sound in the 1970s - 1980s. The fountains of the fountains of the years: pleasant but not exciting. The only song - 23 of the excitement is the last: "Over Beethoven". Now that only a few of the other 22 songs gave them excitement, it could have been a much better concert DVD.
