Artist Daniel King (Chris John) and his companion Laura Peters (Lara Clancy) are invited to move to an old house in Cornwall, UK, with his childhood rich friend Natasha Carlton (Carol Kentish). Natasha is against Daniel, a vague man in his sentimental life. At home alone, strange things happen and Laura is surprised and frightened. When Laura meets on the roads of the old mad priest Gabriel Norton (Brian Blessed), he is advised to leave the house immediately because he lived there. But the couple remains and faces tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> What a filthy scenario and terrible and cheesy movie this "Devil's Harvest" is! Cinematography and camera work are not entirely bad, but Chris John and Carol's Kentish amateur performances and James Shanks' direction and terrible story, ridiculous situations and dialogues make this movie one of the worst I've ever seen in the genre. I have sometimes seen some cinematic college shorts on YouTube that are better and better than the pointless and terrible "Devil's Harvest". Finally, it is not a fear film, but a horror of the film. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Colheita do Diabo" ("Fucking Catch")
