I saw this movie came out and couldn't wait to see it. I must say that I was very disappointed with it. It would have been better than the mini series. The whole show seemed very rushed. They didn't explain things very clearly. Finally, they showed John Paul II, alive and well, and the next scene was dead. Never explained what happened. (We all know what happened in real life) I think ABC dropped something that could have been great for a long time. I think this movie was blurry. It seemed like a drunken monkey jumping from one point in the life of John Paul to another point that never explained how or why things happened. As his older brother leaves, it was never explained that his brother was a doctor and therefore he left home. Even when his father dies, all we see is his father lying and that was it. I was very disappointed with the whole movie.
