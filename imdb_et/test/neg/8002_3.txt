Mockney Comes to Brighton; Despite having written this bad reception in the British press and in the state-funded British cinema, I was hoping to get a bit of a grimy, heavily wrecked Graham Greene Sea. /> <br /> It doesn't even want it. These clones nip the trailers directly by Chary Ritchie types. The format looks more like a British TV series than a film (Brighton is a gold stone that has been wasted with the work of a plastic studio). he's a bit slippery for this business, his big-screen uninterrupted brand, mostly part of blockers like Deep Rising. Search (even a role!) The search continues. The circus is boring. 3/10
