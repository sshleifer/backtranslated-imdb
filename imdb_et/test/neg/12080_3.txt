<br /> <br /> This film was produced and published as a descendant - albeit quite popular - for the embarrassing Coastal Comedy of California, called Hardbodies, but it has little or no connection with the previous film, and it is better to fully appreciate its right. It's definitely better than Hardbodies I, and it's more closely related to movies like Venus and Summer Lovers, which were filmed in the summer on the Greek islands. The combination of blissful beaches of blue bays with beautiful bare sides makes for a seductive look, but (except for those that are just for the next vacation planning), even such films need a good story if they want the attention of viewers for more than a few minutes. Venus was supported by the legend of the transformation of the goddess, and in the summer, the subject was "Trojan". In my opinion, both films were much more successful than Hardbodies II, which has a very weak story and which depends too much on simple half-length comedy. Rapid use quickly becomes tedious, usually leading to a series of very short stand-alone portable sequences that are difficult to integrate into the current line. Mel Brooks excelled it with Silent Movie, but few other films have succeeded in the same way, and unfortunately, Hardbodies II does not. The problem is also that the slapstick sequences are not happy with the idyllic and peaceful scenario in which the film is set. The final airports were undoubtedly meant to be a fun ending for this movie, but I think these are examples of the worst type of overpriced slapst-pseudo-comedy. They are also extremely long, so I left in the cinema with a bad taste that was left in my mouth. It is a film that could have been a lot more successful in the sequence of a stronger story and most of its slapstes. Because it was released, it certainly does not guarantee the ratings of the viewers higher than 3. <br /> <br /> The actor has little to remember but the cast does its best to limit the narrow story and the bad direction - there is an error in these latter areas. <br /> <br />
