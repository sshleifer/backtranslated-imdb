Like the aforementioned poster, I was able to burn the headline thinking that I got the other Piranha ... This movie is everything that the poster mentioned above is and what is worse ... <br /> <br /> Poor camera, weak performance and just terrible story ... <br /> <br /> There was very little here, even worth seeing ... How this movie is even released is over. <br /> <br /> Make sure the movie you are buying is what you want ... and not that. <br /> <br /> The movie you bought was labeled "Piranha" and not "Piranha, Piranha!" what it really is ... This is the only way they sold this movie at all. <br /> <br /> Peace.
