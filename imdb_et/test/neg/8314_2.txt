"Death Machines" takes a fairly good prerequisite for an action movie (killing unstoppable martial arts for machines sent to eliminate criminals) and makes it an unobtrusive confusion. I have rarely seen the hustle and bustle that consisted of tiny budgets, bad and inconsistent scripts, published as a "movie". It's just the worst martial arts / action-oriented film I've seen in years, even reflecting the "Ninja Holocaust" (which had at least some good energetic struggle). <br /> <br /> The real "star" of the movie is the white "Death Machine" (this is basically his vehicle) so he is highlighted in many other scenes than his two cohorts. He's in good shape and he's not bad, but as an actor, he's hardly there - think of Chuck Norris in the "eight corner" without any energy or emotion. This is obviously a deliberate choice of actor and director. .. but you have to be Arnold to pull such a thing, and this man is not Arnold. <br /> <br /> Film (and director) doesn't look like a time (or budget). ) to shoot scenes that answered original questions such as: Who was a shady indicator that gave marble-to-mouth Asian lady orders? How did the "power talk" end? Why did an Asian female lady decide that her zombie assassins were killed? And what the hell happened that left her husband dead and she suffered a katana like a bones? <br /> <br /> However, it is time to shoot a completely unfamiliar bar battle where the sailors (well, he looked like Popeye) destroyed the bar because the juke box didn't work. It is only related to the rest of the movie, because in the process he is also a KO movie "hero", a barman / karate student who was the victim of "Death Machines" first major challenge (he got his hand cut when they killed his teacher). It follows that the hero and his girlfriend I have ever watched are one of the most called "love scenes". Segue does not make sense - at the end of the bar-fight he is grimming over his sliding limp body and the next thing they are "tasteful" in assembling the shadow of sex and love, which looks like it comes from the Hallmark card. BTW, we never see a seaman again. <br /> <br /> And wait until you see a showdown between the murder detective and his captain - it plays as if the director and the scriptwriter ever saw a movie scene in a police station, but had heard of them and decided to add some without they actually knew how they worked. <br /> <br /> Film is a textbook case for poor casting and community theater actors who fly without proper guidance. The three "death machines" are exposed to fractures; "hero" knows his rows but can't wear a movie because his character is ineffective wimp; his girlfriend is a charisma vacuum; and all the other smaller parts are hardly traceable. All of this makes it a pretty bad movie, but the "dragon lady" makes the movie smell more than anyone else. He looks ridiculous; his tiny, expressive face is struck by his t-o-hair skyscraper wig, he wears his red silk dress like a bathrobe, and he speaks with a terrible mush-mouth delivery that shouts "need time with a dialog box". Poor lady - she obviously stepped out of her element and when I knew it never appeared in the movie. <br /> <br /> Add a low-budget one synthesizer soundtrack that will never turn off and never play anything appropriate or interesting; filthy movie and lighting; to fight choreography that is strictly hungry; and a general hesitation and lack of energy in blocking and arming ... and you have one flat film. <br /> <br /> As part of this, I got 50 movies from DVD compilation, so it would probably cost around 50 cents to watch it. It wasn't worth it. Feh!
