There is not much to say about this, except that this is probably the worst early destruction of zombie films (I can see another, ZOMBIES REVOLT [1936], before the end of the month). For all the stars of John Carradine's intentions to build with them a third army of Reich, they don't see much at all! James Baskett (Uncle Remus SOUTH!) Plays with his leader, who also acts as a Carradine servant. Black comedian Mantan Moreland reproduces his role as "mad cat" driver of the King of ZOMBIES (1941), as well as exoticly named Madame Sul-Te-Wan as the housekeeper of Carradine. Unfortunately, was his ultimate achievement for Carradine? zombizing his wife? brings him all sorts of trouble: not only his relatives turn to his remote residence / good to study his unexpected death (which means he has to falsify the funeral service!), but he actually proves disobedient and indignant, finally "convince" his zombies to rise up against your master! There is also a cowboy star Bob Steele (still best known for his bit on Howard Hawks' THE BIG SLEEP [1946]) who plays a US secret agent who is a Nazi Sheriff! Fortunately, the director Sekely would be much better for his next genre, TRIFFID DAY (1962).
