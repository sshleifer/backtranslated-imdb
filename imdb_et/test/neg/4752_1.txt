The value of AvP2 output can be described with one adjective: AWFUL <br /> <br /> The script is ridiculous even in the fictional area of ​​AVP: What are the Facedugger Predator ships? Why does Predator clear all the signs of its influence and waste valuable time by presenting an insignificant and even marginal human body? Why is Predator Alone? Why does Predator equip itself only on the earth, but on its home planet? Why does Predator work so calmly as trying to hunt aliens, not bombing the entire countryside, as people finally do? Why Predator falls more and more of his few weapons instead of collecting them to keep them together afterwards. Finally, he even falls off his gun before fighting with Predaliene to fight: the first final fight between predators between Arny and Predator. Predator's gestures are so exaggerated that the Japanese sumo moves rather than a highly qualified extraterrestrial safari hunter. As you can see right now, the whole story is confusing. But it gets even worse because this botched-up job is filled with boring patchless nonsense interludes like a long pizza ordering episode or some detailed details of a criminal past by two brothers (Dallas & Ricky). The Sheriff is, of course, the friend of the two criminals whom he regularly places behind bars. (not convincing and totally redundant for the plot). <br /> <br /> In addition, casting actors is terrible. Compared to the former aliens or high-ranking directors and actors of Predator films, AvP2 is embarrassingly nonsense. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film's action is very bad. There is no uniform struggle for the audience to see the whole set. Every struggle is filmed with short and shaky breaks near the darkness. This results in a frightening experience for the audience, as they usually see nothing other than a dark shaking screen. <br /> <br /> I suggest that two leading brothers, Strauss, buy themselves with a stabilizer and learn a lesson in the modern CG that the next film contains visible vision requirements and may not hide their bad leadership skills in this way. first or original alien or original film Predator, but don't be disappointed if you waste your valuable time in case of failure.
