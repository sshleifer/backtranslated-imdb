Not even two years after this movie was first seen, and yet, I can't remember anything about this movie. Needless to say, I found it very forgotten. What I remember does not distinguish anything particularly well. A talented cast is wasted in what I think it was supposed to be a dark comedy, but if it is, it is not unhappy. At best, this film is somewhat interesting. In the worst case scenario, seemingly everywhere in the cloud is more interesting than the story. If you like watching movies, if it always looks damp and cool, you might think you might like something in this picture. Just try to ignore what's going on, because it's hardly traceable.
