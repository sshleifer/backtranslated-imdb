I'm sorry, but for a movie that has been so semi-classical and scary, but seriously, I think that if a director is inadvertently laughing, it's not good. The characters in this movie were just as up and incredible. I just couldn't laugh with Issac's voice, it was like a high-bright British voice. Not to mention Malicai's dramatic paste on his butt character. <br /> <br /> Corn's children are about a city where all children have killed adults and worship God, who tells them to sacrifice 20-year-olds. If a couple has a bad car accident, they will help the city, but of course they will catch the child and sacrifice! But Malicai has other intentions when he is ill after completing Issac orders. <br /> <br /> The kids in the corn could have been very good, but they became bad about the top film that you could easily joke about. As much as I love Stephen King, I'm sure it's not what he intended, and it was a pretty flat story, or at least the actors destroyed it. As I said to laugh, look at it, but I warn you, it is quite pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3/10
