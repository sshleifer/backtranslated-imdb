This movie is really so bad and I am usually a sucker of bad movies, but it was too much. Its vision is like OD'ing on pure SUCK. Now you may think you've seen the bottom of the barrel. You may have passed the full title Full Moon and Troma, all Edward D. Wood's Jr, Uwe Boll, Albert Pyun films, and direct DVD clips from the lost men. You may even have seen Death Tunnel, Ghost Lake and a wide range of movies covered by MST3K, but in their original form. But you don't know the really terrible filmmaking before you've seen Darkhunter. And if you don't, you shouldn't. Do not worry. Not only has this film been amazingly poorly written, staged, photographed, edited, acted, and split with cheap crude oil. First, it's a terrible mess. But not good, Greenaway or Lynch-style pretentious or fun filthy siinenbach or early Waters fashion. This is the kind of pretentiousness that comes when someone feels incredibly silly that they are something incredibly smart. Similar to M. Night Shaymalan (sp?), Only this person seems to be on this train attack (and it comes from the rampant Shaymalan angry) freak messiah. It's also boring. It is not difficult to go on-type boring, which is okay if the film carries your patience. Darkhunters doesn't do that. It's boring "Oh my fu (King God, when I see another picture of a cat set to an uncomfortable sound, I'm going to fu (the king kills myself!) - so." Anyone who claims to like this movie is cruelly chosen A liar and anyone who claims that this film is complex or deep knows what their mother is in bed.
