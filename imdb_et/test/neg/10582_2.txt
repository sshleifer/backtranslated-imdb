Superhero Movie (2008) is the last long line of "parody" movie films that I am so desperate about. I want this movie to be a genre of death, but I know it's not terrible to put the nail in a coffin. <br /> <br /> When the Spartans meet, it is held at the bottom of the barrel for Hollywood films, the Superhero movie is likely to be near the top. Unfortunately, the Spartans actually met miles below the barrel and this film just bothered it. <br /> <br /> The Superhero movie has decent C-list celebrities. It has Drake Bell (Disney's Drake and Josh's child), Leslie Nielson (plane!), Tracy Morgan (SNL and 30 Rock) and some others. Although the film has a 40-volt bulb, the film does not use any humor. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 80 minutes long, most of which are dedicated to Spiderman's plot and no joke is funny. I didn't laugh or smiled or smiled all the time. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. Don't even think about it. For cinema love, just skip it and maybe they won't come out with others. <br /> <br /> Am I kidding? They will probably come out in the second autumn.
