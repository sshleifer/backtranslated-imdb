It would be promising if it were a student film. It never seems to know where it goes, as if they decided on each of the next scenes when they made the movie. As a result, there are many repetitions and deadly pace. There is a completely confusing procedure by which ghosts affect the people of this world: it includes the Internet, phone calls, computer science experiment, suspicious graduate students, canceled behavior, red spaces, dark stains and suicides. Happiness described the connections or if the character is still a ghost or just strangely. The characters are hardly outlined, which may be OK, but they are completely uninteresting. It is too long and ends just when it reaches a promising scenario, although the conclusion is pointless. The weakest moment: when the "boss" sits to give some inconsistent advice.
