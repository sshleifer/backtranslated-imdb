It was so scattered - it seemed that jumping from place to place - and "thief" was obvious. It was a "less than zero" poor man (not to mention high school). I'd be sending this movie because it's very little to add. So many questions remain unresolved and that's okay - but the fact that it jumps around at a point where you don't know what's going on is terrible. Voting is necessary because the film does not work independently. Avoid this movie and see something about rich teens. I'm sure there are many more. Don't waste your time with it.
