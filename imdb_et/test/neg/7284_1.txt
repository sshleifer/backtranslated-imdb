The only reason why this exhibition was not available is 0 because one is not available. This exhibition has gone from informative news to a sensational claptrap. I tried to support this example in my fall because I like human interests and Primetime had some great things. Unfortunately, on April 21, this exhibition and the unethical news artists involved in it have changed forever. In fact, ABC registered a brutal case of child abuse and then refused to show it before the limitation period expired and the parents could not be held in charge of these charges. The worse was how ABC wiped out the entire interim incident; Instead of taking responsibility for these disturbed persons and seeking genuine professional help, they had some pop psychologists who sent the only warnings to the COMPETITION, how they should not judge those poor angels too harshly. I was really sick. I hope that this review will prevent one person from looking at this exploratory trash in the future. If so, I'm happy. These days, all of what Diane Sawyer and Primetime Live expect from good people is the A-list sessions with celebrities and crimes that are celebrated and praised. Don't waste your life hours; you'd better look at the old sitcom on Nick's Nite.
