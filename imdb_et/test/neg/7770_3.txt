Being heroes, I liked this exhibition and watch it regularly, but now (thanks to God!) I don't understand why I watched it. Sex and the city are one of the most meaningless and offensive TV shows I've ever seen. I really don't get the point of this show, despite trying. People say sex and the city are funny. In what way? Ripening all the time talking about vibrators and penis size? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> I don't understand the plot: we have four girls trying to find the perfect man to sleep with every dork who comes around. And this exhibition is about four corrupted chicks sleeping with every man in town, but finally they admit that the best pleasure comes from penis vibrators. And yes ... the show is trying to tell us that sex is the most important thing in every relationship. If you have a good sex, you are a good husband. It doesn't matter if you want to have a loyal and good heart. Size is important. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is bad action. The four main actors (Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattral, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis) are so bad and convincing that it makes me hurt. Parker shouts and complains all the time, Cattral shows his old breasts and says "f-word" all the time, Davis offers his smile (and nothing else) and Nixon acts like he's forever bored. And yes ... men are a hungry pig in this show. But, according to this exhibition, women are not much better. This show is offensive to men and women. Women are as primitive and emotional as they have no hearts, but hunger for sex. It is offensive to everyone. <br /> <br /> Sex and the city are one of the worst TV shows and I am glad that this show ended because it offers bad shows and meaningless stories. The whole world is not about sex and vibrators.
