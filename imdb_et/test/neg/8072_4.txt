Cuore Sacro combines shiny film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired. With the script that screen-writers "touched in Angel" can be over if too impuissant, Ozpetek still keeps us interested from time to time. In fact, I wanted to focus on the positives, but I found the last thing so amazingly odd and terrible that I think a couple who jumped from their deaths at the beginning could have been happy. <br /> <br /> This movie is a story close to the heart that is built with great twisting. Such a weak foundation can bring tremendous success, such as the Una Pura Formalità of the Tornatore, or the godly rubbish like the films of M. Night Shyamalan. Cuore Sacro is somewhat closer to the latter. I found that cinema is generally above average. Irene's surveillance shots, carefully carrying their quotes around the pool, were very impressive, like the atmosphere inside the mother's house. For me, the grotesque parody of Michelangelo Pieta was a bit of a stretch when Giancarlo came from anger and Irene. One big issue I looked at in this movie was the Ozpetek method just to turn the camera directly to its main character and to record the recorded emotions. It did a fantastic effect with seeing Windows, but working here, it seems that Bubolova is not Mezzogiorno. In fact, aside from the ridiculous story, the main problem with this film is the milquete performance of the main game. This made the final distribution even worse. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Ozpetek continues its crusade against our company-led societies, calling us to be more spiritual (not necessarily religious) and altruistic. And while I am definitely the one who feels very sympathetic to this position, I felt that the audience would have hit the head with a blunt object. Are the characters no longer two-dimensional? I found this movie very delightful and breathless. Was the "bad" aunt Eleonora more than a caricature? This also applies to the "right" people, such as "good" aunt Maria Clara and the elderly doorman Aurelio. And just when we had missed Ozpetek's mind, he decided to dress his opposing forces into his taxes. <br /> <br /> It brings me an interesting point about using the director's color. She dresses up with an open pair who is briefly flying all black, as well as Irene (when we first meet her and after her life conversion), the evil aunt Eleonora, and of course the good but confused Padre Carras. Black is a color that refers to a particular course, the mind of the bearer is set and unknown. This is the choice of color for today's armor, the business. It is also a mourning color, such as funeral items with a suicide duel. Finally, black is the color of divinity, like the simple clothes of priests and nuns, which Irene emulates on the other side of the film. Another basic color and a very suitable choice for a movie related to the holy heart is red. It is a color that has an extremely characteristic emotional component. The red carrier is bold, emotional, receptive to new ideas and enjoyable. Red is a risky color nowadays; it challenges our perception of the user and at the same time makes the user vulnerable. But red bears immense historical and mysticism, because the first members of Cro-Magnon were buried in his dead red ocher and indeed the first man named Torah, Adam, is named after the Hebrew red word. The red is also an anachronistic taste, looking back to the past where the red (and less confident attitude towards life) was more accepted. So when we meet a red-filled room (mysterious frieze-covered walls equipped with red-colored menorah and red magician Irene's mother), the good characters Maria Clara and Aurelio wear red colored clothes and Finally we see Irene's mother painting in a red dress with Ozpeteki sympathies lie. <br /> <br /> A word or two audio tracks, I found the original music themes perfectly suitable for the story. The nice-baroque theme, which celebrated Irene, was a great monotony and a feeling of peaceful paralysis (such an absolute best use of a constantly repeating Baroque theme should be in Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, whose masterful repetitions are the 8-bar Saraband assigned to Handel). One absolutely inspired choice was a few seconds from the opera aria we hear when power flashes, while Irene returns Benny through the house. This is the famous aria "in that? ... Ne andrò lontano" from Catalan's opera "La Wally". Araia sings the soprano, who leaves home forever. Since Irene's mother was a dramatic soprano, we might think that this is the recording of her song and that she will say goodbye to her daughter, as Irene will soon be forced to see Benny alive. I just have one little soundtrack question, why add the famous tango Yo Soy Maria? I love this song and personally I heard it all the time, but it didn't fit here.
