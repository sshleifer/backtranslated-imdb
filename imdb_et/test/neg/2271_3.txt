Usually, when the BBC issues a TV series, it will be used as a guarantee of some satisfaction. Usually the TV series is great, even if the story is boring, you can trust that the actor is worth it. When I met, Persuasion, in this local library I waited for a happy evening because I read the story. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to read the story first, otherwise I wouldn't think so much. In addition, I relieved that the date of production of this TV series had been since 1971, as I thought the BBC had lost it by that time. It is really bad and should be used in showrooms as a horror film. <br /> <br /> The only positive idea I have about this series is that people in this movie aren't likely to appear or participate in any BBC or other product of this century, except for young Muslim sisters who apparently took action and significantly well in a given direction.
