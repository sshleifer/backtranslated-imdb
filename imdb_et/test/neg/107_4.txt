Low budget horror movie. If you don't raise your expectations too high, you'll probably enjoy that little color. The beginning and the end are pretty good, the middle drags at times and they don't seem to go long if we look at the despair that adds to the atmosphere, but doesn't transmit the plot. Quite a bit. I enjoyed Bill McGhee's performance, which he was quite credible with such a low-budget design, he was able to wear the film if nothing seemed to be. Sister Charlotte Beale, played by Jesse Lee, played her character well to be willing to want her at the end! She makes some really foolish mistakes, but that makes these low budget movies so good! I would have been out of this place and left the country before he even found that it might be a good idea to leave! When you enjoy this movie, try to commit yourself since 1988, which is basically crowding out this movie.
