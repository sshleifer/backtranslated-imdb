I don't care what someone says, this movie was nonsense. The only thing he had done was the camera's work, which was very well done. As for the dialogue I've heard so many people are talking about ... it sucks too. Yes, it was honest and viable, but what, then, I hear someone who speaks on it on the street or in a fast food joint. What changed the dialogue in films such as Pulp Fiction and Gosford Park was that it is a WRITTEN dialogue that takes time to think. The other thing was that the director shouldn't have put himself in the picture. I believe that the male character could have been much stronger, but it seemed weak. In fact, the film seemed to turn around the male character, and then it disappeared completely over the last twenty minutes. The girl in the movie found completely modest, not appearance, but her poor poor ways. Saying he's in love with a guy and actually getting him the next day jealous of what's in the mess. The final thing: the sound was terrible, and I hope it was just something that plagued my theater, not actually the final section of the movie. During several scenes, there was a constant buzzing sound and it was actually away from talking. Another good thing was Blood's work as a DP, but the main actor who played his former girlfriend also did a great job. These two things couldn't save the terrible movie that I refuse to call the movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
