Frankly, I'm not the one who impresses it, it's not a bad movie, but it's not great either. There is a story to say, but it is very inconsistent to say what type it loses its full meaning and intrigue. This movie can be made in other ways, with great results, the story is just so interesting, but somehow I'm not intrigued while watching it. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not an amateur movie, but the opposite and some scenes are truly emotional. Actors and actors do a good job, and so do the director, but the whole movie is just something unfinished that I can't put my finger on. Perhaps, if you had felt that these characters were more evil, then all the "mess" would have been more clearly explained and more "actions" because it was slow from time to time.
