John Madden's film interpretation of Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome is unable to make great literature. While the story has survived, the elements that give the short story their breath, incline and all disappear in the film. Madden does not transmit the innocence and general tragedy of Ethan's and Mattie's relationship instead of making it a moral story. Labeling skips and loses additional information and bad dialogue. The Zeena (Zenobia) book is almost an antagonist, the least sympathetic book, where it can almost be fooled in the film, although it is the stretch you feel about the sick woman being deceived. The book describes Zena's tyrannical control over the house and Ethan. The movie just marked me out. Adding Fox was pointless, but also a scene where Mattie tried to kill himself. It was just badly interpreted and done. Film Mistakes: Ethan's Difficulty in Church Dance, Communicating with Denis Eady, Adding a Love Scene, Fox Scene, Storing a Scene, Saying His Plans Allowed, Missing Ethan's Inner Emotions and Thoughts, Introducing the Priest to a Nasty Engineer where the novice reader never knows what Zeena thinks or is aware of. Too many mistakes and bad management decisions.
