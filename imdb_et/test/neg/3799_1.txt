An uncomfortable catastrophe has a team of attackers who come over the roll over S. Poseidon, hoping it will be good before. The sequel to Irwin Allen's 1972 bombing "Poseidon adventure" came to theaters SEVEN YEAR! Don't forget that no one cares anymore about giving us such a merciful product full of twilight characters and confusing actors, but to throw away your biggest hit memory? Sometimes it may seem that Michael Caine, Sally Field, Peter Boyle, Jack Warden, Karl Malden, and Shirley Jones were not lost at sea (good for some stray laughter). There is a moment when St. Jones is tempting to take his treasures and he starts to fill his pockets, which is an involuntary hoot. The film was a career player for all involved, especially Allen, who never got it. * from ****
