When I saw 6.0 on IMDb, I was quite impressed and excited to watch this movie because there should be some fun for 6 horror movies. First of all, I thought it was somewhat worrying, invisible to the evil forces (who hadn't read the book) to scare the audience, but it turned out to be a daily - killer plant. Regardless, I am a fairly open thinker for the film, so I thought the film could bring some breakthrough to spin carnivores. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was unable to meet my expectations of the excessive amount of cliché and lack of originality. Up, the woman's leading character irritates her with her stupidity. If a movie is not a deliberately bad B-rated movie, which is entertaining in malice, no movie should ever be the main character who is annoying you when you expect the viewer to take care of its character. Such roles should be reserved for secondary characters. The characters were developed, the monsters (in this case the plants) remained unexplained and the clichés dropped. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is somewhat effective is some bloody / gory scenes, though gore pales compared to movies like High Tension or Ichi The Killer. Consistently unsuccessful logic (for example, why doesn't a character who looks at the top of the rope during another attempt to drop the ruins, if it just broke and almost kill someone), even if it is small, the viewers still remain. The film may have been recorded using signs or a piece of equipment to loot or redeem idiot writers who simply did something stupid (or at least let the character identify or regret their mistakes). However, in order to continue to lead the idiot, it will definitely cause the audience to give up all the care for the character, in turn, would take the film into fear. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a badly made movie. An example of a well-made movie that includes quite a few twenty kills is the Texas Chainsaw Massacre Remake (and also the prequel), which certainly made fear and had much less logical logical errors. All in all, if you have a lot of time to kill, check it out if there's nothing else. Otherwise, don't waste your time with this minimum parameter and go to see something that is scary and very satisfying, like The Hills Have Eyes remake.
