I saw this movie as a hidden preview before opening Venice at the Telluride Film Festival. Your reaction to this greatly depends on your attitude towards respect for Shakespeare's text. On the plus side: Pacino gives a very good result like Shylock; Lynn Collins is a good Portia; and the film has a gorgeous look. <br /> <br /> Negatives are predictable. The "Venetian merchant" is by far the most difficult of all Shakespeare's performances today, mainly because we look at it through the twisting lens of the 20th century. The romantic plot with Bassanio and Portia is not a problem. Shylock's character does, because we don't have the original framework of Elizabeth's audience. At the same time, Shylock is a human character and a person with human qualities and a ruthless quality of old law. When he says, "There are no Jewish eyes?" he is character; when he declares, "I have my bond!" he is an abstraction. The long passage to music and cosmic harmony in the last scene (here moved and cut into laces) is the key to the game because it restores universal harmony after the disturbing and evil (test scene Shylock) power. out. The character of Shylock can be done psychologically, showing his progressive madness and becoming a monomanic for the time the judgment is turned around - the key is that he must now be sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Pacino's performance almost does, but not quite. The film cannot really make its point - on the one hand, Shylock's character is the right movement, and on the other hand there are a lot of deviations from the Jews who are abused, and Venetian whores are rouged with nipples (undoubtedly shown by Antonio et al). Shakespeare did not write a social drama like Ibsen; he wrote a comedy that followed the symbol of the interruption of the classical social order and the restoration of social order, symbolized by marriage, love and law in the middle of the Shylock plot. <br /> <br /> In this sense, the movie is travesty - Radford's operation due to game and direction forces us to stay away from what the game really means. (The beginning of the final scene, most of the cutting and its movement before the test site is the most extreme example.) There are other important difficulties. Exquisite actor Jeremy Irons plays Antonio as if he were overdosing sedatives. Joseph Fiennes is beautiful but low as Bassanio. Most of the actors, except Collins, Pacino, and the actor who play in Duke's trial, mumble their dialogue. <br /> <br /> Final decision? A beautiful movie with some decent performances. It's not Shakespeare, it's a bad interpretation. Not quite worth your time or money - although Lynn Collins redeems it.
