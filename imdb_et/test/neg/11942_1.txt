I remember years ago, Michael Douglas wanted his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones to be in a romantic movie because she felt her husband had all the goods. No doubt he does this, but not in this movie. A colossal waste of time, story, character development, chemistry, nada. It was not the vehicle we all hoped would be a dull and enormous disappointment. Also, not watching the whole movie, torture. Catherine Zeta-Jones was apparently trained to work in the kitchen, move around, put on a plate, but it was not a food network, nothing was learned here, and when her colleague appeared, she was alleged to be a romantic brewer with chemistry. The poor slip on the second floor of his building tries to combine all the ploys and there is no character there. His sister's loss was badly played, because who knew there was closeness. The sister's daughter was right here and there she put something that had to bring you in, NO. Just a waste of movie time. The project promoters definitely did their job to put this lacking-shiny film on all the networks that attract you to any attraction. Sorry to say, don't spend a dime.
