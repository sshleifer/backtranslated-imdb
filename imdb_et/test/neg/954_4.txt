This mobder revenge story is not just very interesting, even though Ed McMahon is ripe as a headmaster in a difficult role. Jim Brown strikes the ass efficiently, Gloria Hendry proves once again that she can bring life to even the poorest roles, and Brock Peters is decent as The Cop, who plays with the book. It is still boring and poorly constructed, and even the print on the cable has now reached the James Brown score.
