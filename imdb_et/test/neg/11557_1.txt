I think I can say with certainty (without actually giving up anything) that there were no robots on this film. The boys in "Robot" costumes did not act or speak as such, and the evil unit behind the "plot" is not a robot. <br /> <br /> The whole thing looks like it's made in a city park somewhere, photos fell in the background when the director needed a custom set. I can't even use words to describe actors ... <br /> <br /> It couldn't even offer the "Star Crystal" a fun ending. In short, it is clearly one of the worst sci-fi movies of the 80s and I would be so brave to say "all the time".
