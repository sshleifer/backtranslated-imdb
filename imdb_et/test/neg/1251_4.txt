Many believe Stu Ungar is the biggest poker / gin player of all time - an extraordinary natural destruction force - small in nature, but a huge heart for the game. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a Hallmark movie about the dangers of gambling. Of course, he wins, he loses, he blows all the sex, drugs and more gambling we get, but where is the real game - where it made him the biggest card player of all time. <br /> <br /> Much too flat, and frankly boring places, it gets four, because we can learn something from Stu man, but Stu card player, nada. <br /> <br /> Nice pictures were taken and filmed until it was a great example of how not to make a movie on the cards: frankly, ESPN's World Series coverage is more observable than it is. <br /> <br /> Losing a great opportunity.
