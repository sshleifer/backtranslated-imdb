I didn't care much about it, it seemed too natural for a documentary. The filmmakers also seemed to guide me towards certain characters, but still I was completely offensive to the protagonist because they chose to show him. <br /> <br /> This movie deceived me because the story and people were interesting, but the film remained flat thanks to gentle editing that didn't allow the viewer enough time to understand each scene. The developments in the story were glossed over to show men the boxers or other things that accompanied the story they were talking about. <br /> <br /> I would advise you to skip this and just read this story.
