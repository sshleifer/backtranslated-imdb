This exhibition was rushed and largely based on the surprising cuts in advertising (when it came back commercially, noise or "surprise" was something simple like a mouse). This is the Ghost Hunters pure hanging and it is trying to go "outside of them, and fails. What's with the directors' log? Is that the star a trek? It just destroys the novelty of the show that was quick. The only reason being tracked is that people want to laugh at its clean climatic nature, they never find anything and probably never. Funny, they always draw attention to what they "hunt" and think about what ?! which flashes red!
