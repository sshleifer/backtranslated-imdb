I'm surprised who likes this movie. I never drive out of films, but my friend had to physically stop me from leaving the theater during an offensive disaster. White characters are sacred and Asian characters are practically non-existent and worthless for the story. they exist only as objects, as a surprise. The characters of other races are much better. revolutions were ridiculous and predictable. but if you read it, you know it already. Paul Haggis has a cage. Hollywood can't even do multicultural movies. do yourself a favor and look more honestly at race relations, Harold and Kumar Mine in the White Castle!
