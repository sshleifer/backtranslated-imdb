George and Mildred is a truly unforgettable movie. This attempt to translate successful TV series into a big screen was a frustrating error, as it happens so often. <br /> <br /> Smart and smart single liners on TV channels are gone. The plot is a typical confusing English farce of characters and false identities, which is not funny or strange to provoke many decent smiles. <br /> <br /> Die-hard George and Mildred fans can see this last episode of a couple of productions (Mildred died of hepatitis before release), but others should invest more time wisely.
