The remake of George Sluizer's own - superior film - is a complete waste of time. Why was it even tried? Kiefer Sutherland plays Jeff Harriman, whose friend (Sandra Bullock, who only has a small screen time) is kidnapped at Barney Cousins ​​(Jeff Bridges). Now, Barney is depicted as no one trusts on Sunday - he talks like a Frankenstein monster, but without sympathy, and bridging is absolutely terrible. Sutherland is a little better when her character becomes a detective of new love with Rita Baker (Nancy Travis). <br /> <br /> The big problem with this version of Vanishing is its obvious need to satisfy the Hollywood audience, avoiding the fine ending of the original text. Here the end is happy, which seems to be forced and unbelievable and completely breaks the story. But by then, it is a pity that Jeff Bridges makes a bad woman a huge laugh.
