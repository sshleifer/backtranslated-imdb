This story of Ted Brice, an American pilot who crashes in January 1944 as an alliance with the Belgian Alliance, is pretty much confusing. The title would lead you to think that this is mainly a story of Belgian armed resistance movements, but it seems to be just a background to support Ted and Claire, Ted's wife Ted and Claire. Claire's husband Henri is a committed member of the resistance, but Claire decides to give Ted a refuge in the absence of Henry and his wishes. <br /> <br /> Significant plot details are not reasonable. At the heart of the story is downloading the recorder in a lowered plane containing navigation codes and target positions. But in the opening plan, we see the Belgians who abduct the plane, the members of their resistance. Why didn't they find valuable items at that time instead of waiting for the Nazis to come and plane? And the whole thing that went out of the Ted region was done with secret instructions and code words if the deal could just have been a simple change. Amazing music is trying, but not able to give it a compelling effort. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous part of the movie is how the love relationship between Ted and Claire develops. First of all, Claire is committed to death near Ted's care, and when Ted recovers, they are physically involved (while Henri is conveniently in business management). Julie Ormond does a satisfactory job for Claire, but she publishes a French accent that I often couldn't understand. His answers seemed somewhat weak from time to time - when he was informed of the hanging deaths of several members of the city, he responded as if he had just said that the local grocery store was out of peaches. As Ted looks like, Bill Paxton just looks out of his lines; his performance is so unforgettable that it is embarrassing. A true American pilot can prove such an apartment, but it does not make the cinema convincing. I didn't know any chemistry between these expected lovers. <br /> <br /> The most idiotic thing is how Ted and Claire work for holiday travelers. Perhaps the sexual release from such difficult situations is understandable, but it is difficult to understand the total disregard for the gravity of the situation. At first Ted was sent to the attic and Claire was worried that she had even come to the house. But when things develop, he doesn't just come to the house, dances with Claire's loud music, enters the neighboring pond to play baseball with a local boy, and ultimately goes to Claire with a nearby city to drive. br /> <br /> A young boy seems to be most committed to his role, but the script damages him. He has an unpleasant ability to be decisive at events without notice. And if he supplies such features as: <br /> <br /> "Have you ever seen someone hang. They look like dancing, but they can't find the floor." <br /> <br /> You think it's a screenwriter and not a thirteen-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> And by the way, there are scenes showing that the Nazis are pretty bad guys. <br /> <br /> Comparing this film with brilliant "Ashes and Diamonds" for Polish resistance, or equally for the French resistance of the letter "Lacombe, Lucien", is understood to be a truly shameful thing.
