For some reason I just didn't like it at all, and I felt embarrassed about how bad it was after I bought it and looked at it with my family. We all hated it with passion. It's a nice enough child's film, maybe a year when she came out. But think about it: an outdated children's movie? What's the point? Children do not usually want to watch such old films, and I don't see what adults should go out of this movie at all. <br /> <br /> Some kids' movies (such as Mary Poppins or Wizard of Oz) can be enjoyed right now, but Time Bandits are completely out of date. Your reference and I think it is applicable in this case, nor did I like Dr Strangelove or Spinal Tap. So, if you disagree with me about these obsolete movies, you might also like Time Bandits. <br /> <br /> It is also a terrible case to recall "bad guys". Think of two foolish "bad pirates" in C. movie pirates, except for Time Bandits, they're not even far away. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I warned you, that's all I can do. People who appreciate this movie must have liked it for years. If you haven't seen it before, don't bother now.
