This movie was a big disappointment. The Anime series ended with a relatively stupid plot twist and pretty flat cable deployment, but I was expecting Shamballa to force all open ends together. Unfortunately, it wasn't. This added more plot holes than it solved and mixed more than it explained. Animation and voice action were a great, but idiotic plot, a boring setting (most of the film doesn't even happen in the dull world war, not in the world of Alchemy), and the disappointing end (Ed is useless for him) on days where there is no alchemy, and he dives Winry? ), it was quite weak. Take your preference - ignore the last side of the anime and this movie and read the manga.
