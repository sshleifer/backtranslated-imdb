While the new Pride & Prejudice movie is wonderful and the soundtrack is lovely, we don't see Jane Austen's pride and prejudice. For some reason, the film has been rejected in the early 1790s, not in the regency period in which the novel is set because scientists have long shown. Bennets Longbourne Manor is crushed and looks like a Cold Comfort Farm. At the same time, the novel Bennet is a gentry class; they have a farm, but the pig does not pass through the house, nor does the manure farm or chicken faeces flank home. Scenes are updated from the novel and we do not forget that Jane Austen put scenes in certain places for a reason. For example, the film puts the scene of the great Darcy proposal in the storm in front of the neoclassical temple, as opposed to Collins' pastoralism: Why did Jane make Austen pastor? Because when Lizzy and Darcy talk together, if you dare to brave one another in this scene, the colleges have never shared an honest word. Why a rain and outdoor proposal? Jane Eyre seems to meet Rochester! And when Elizabeth walks out of the breeze to stand on the rock and look at the panorama, she waits for her to cry, "Heathcliffe" every moment! Austen is brewed! Judy Dench is a big actor, but Lady Catherine should be long and striking. Petite Tom Hollander is a brilliant actor, but the novel describes Collins with such high and heavy views that suggest that his terrible dance with poor Lizzy is an elephant. Matthew MacFayden is my second favorite of MI-5 in A&E; In P&P, however, he is younger than Heathcliffs, never smiling - although Austen is in the novel that Darcy is smiling for Lizzy, and he understands when he sees his wonderful portrait in Pemberley - a portrait that for some reason has been replaced with a sculptured marble bust . And many Austen dialogues are transformed into modern speech. Mr. Bingley has become a clown that wonder why Darcy would be her friend and why Jane Bennet would love her. The bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and listen to, it is so different from Jane Austen's novel that not all students who think they can read can fail!
