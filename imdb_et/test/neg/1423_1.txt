Jerry Lewis was a little funny when he didn't write his material and had a good director like Frank Tashlin. When he began to write and direct his films, his peasant overshadowed his egomania. When his films in the American market (and served in France) earned, Lewis always blamed everyone and everything except himself; for example, he blamed this film for failing, as Lewis said it appeared on a double bill with a "Deep Throat" porn feature. If anyone had to complain about this situation, he would have had to be "deep throat" producers. It is an absolutely idiotic "comedy" for the world's richest man (Lewis), rejected by military service during World War II, and decides to equip a special "crew" to go to Germany and capture Hitler himself. In addition to the many flaws this film has (the script is unevenly uneven, the Lewis "direction" is non-existent, there is a cheap home movie on the film), Lewis obviously thought he was surrounded by talent, all in all - Borscht Belts comics like Jan Murray and Sidney Miller were a good idea ; he had to think they would be so bad that they would look good at him. He was half better; they are embarrassingly bad, but it goes even worse than they do. For "comedy", the Lewis character is angry and tiring; The way he violates his humiliation makes you wonder why they would follow such a tempting jerk as a dangerous mission, as Hitler tries to defeat. The fact that this film has taken money is amazing. This is by far the worst Jerry Lewis movie I've ever seen - I've heard that "Slapstick" is even more pathetic, but I can't see if it's true or not - and all possible costs must be avoided.
