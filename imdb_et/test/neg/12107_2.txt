In the confusion of such a film, it is surprisingly surprising and entertaining for some of the migrants that people have given it. The biggest problem seems to be the director's inability to make his thoughts, whether it is a black comedy, a farce or a combination of both. It refers to the whole place, looking for direction and having somewhat embarrassing performances that could be worse. What a shame to see the talented Dianne Wiest comic talents and the amazing Jane Birkin is so upset that it is more cumbersome than usual. <br /> <br /> Perhaps there is a lot of positive criticism of the "exotic French" movie - that's why it is labeled "smart" or "genius." It is not a bad fright that leaves a rather dirty aftertaste Merchant-Ivory should stick to serious things because they definitely don't have comedy.
