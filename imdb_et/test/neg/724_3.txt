This is one of four films from the 1970s TV writer Lane Slate about the sensational murders of small towns. They like TV personalities like police chiefs and peculiar characters in the city on a regular basis, including the interests of light touch. Others are: they only kill their masters (James Garner, 1972); and Girl in empty tomb and deadly game (both Andy Griffith, 1977). <br /> <br /> Alda is set near Vermont ("Mount Angel" next to "Horse Creek"); others in California, Garner Sea ("Eden Landing") and Griffith's Mountains ("Jasper Lake"). Everyone is trying to capture the feeling of a small town, move at a peaceful pace among comfortable characters and talk about a mystery that has at least some complicated twists or turns to it. At this level, they are somewhat entertaining (that they were often re-directed, suggesting they have some complaints). However, they suffer from general thin stories and dialogue, silent pace, delicate settings, flat or exaggerated characters, and color or humor, forced trials (often minors or crude oil). <br /> <br /> Alda and Garner are the most serious story, characters, pace and tone. They have the best support, even though Alda is better off; Griffith complains pale. Alda's is the best director. <br /> <br /> "Shocking" is some surprises and drama. The killer method is inventive. The tone is more even and the dialogue is more natural than Griffith's. The Alda movie does not suffer like other city-wide city transplants or hockey, exaggerated local characters, both exposed to Hollywood scriptwriter figures, not as genuine (the worst culprit is Griffith's films). Mormitating Mr Whit, who was told to us, tried to seize the Jeep to a temporary bank trailer by pulling the police ship dock, stealing the tomatoes from the hoist only stolen them and filling out the $ 11 "Spiro T. Babylis" extract, which only the teller discovered. Happily, Griffith's films lack a dirty, heavy-handed, repetitive-style dialogue ("Are you going to lunch?" "I'll take the boat out." "You take the boat for lunch?" "" I'm not going to lunch in the boat? ";" There's no fish in this lake "Why are you fishing here?" "It's illegal on the horse hill." "Here it's posted, you break the law." "Some laws. There's no fish in this lake." "Then why are you fishing here?" I told you it was illegal in Horse Mountain. "" Please call me Lloyd. My name is Lloyd. "" Okay, Lloyd ... "Call me Lloyd. It's my name. My name is Lloyd.") <br / > <br /> But Alda is too low a key and unimpressive, which must be taken seriously even as a small police chief, certainly not a red-hot lawyer demanded by a rival city. Slate has admitted the character as much as it arrives late as a result of accidental naming. Instead of discovering or exploring , Barnes blinds emotional denial. His secretary, Lasser, feeds him with a key ("Why didn't I think of it," he says!). Embarrassing funeral, plus plot competition, brings another gift. <br /> <br /> Even worse, Barnes is more interested in removing the military police helmets from the county to help him (Deadly Game also suggests Kiltkil has something to do with the military than to guide them or their men effectively. He promises a delayed murder if Barnes promises that the killer will escape his car repeatedly when he escapes from one crime position without pulling or controlling the weapon. Again, he is ineffective and almost died in the weather that is due to a number of errors that are partly due Unique Northeast Accent Affected by Alda Doesn't Help Faith. <br /> <br /> There are holes in the plot. Why does the killer strike after all these years? And leaving the first two murders without traces seems incredible. don't compare to them later - a couple together, a shop owner during their working hours, a fully dressed deputy who sits in her office and incredibly her dog! <br /> <br /> Alda's film is also patient with some of the insulting elements that Slate injects into all movies. Barnes first appears in the motel secretary's bed. He then treats irreversibly and insults and tries to avoid his children. This and we are talking about a female doctor, a dirty raw, medium of enthusiasm (Garner's film has been described as "slippery", including a scene where she and her deputy laugh, how the girl in the back of the Griffith in the back of the car was ersatz Ropers' routine, where the woman embarrassed strives for a man's "delivery cabinet", a free dressing room - a free .space-type exchange with a deputy to discuss the death of a young man's accident ("Did you take him out?" "I took it one time."); a reference to "Bernice" as "swollen at times" and "stuck" for her and "hate" and shooting secretary "Maude" because she was "too hairy", a female doctor's practice description as "two tables and flashlight", a humiliating scene where Fran Ryan tells Griffith who offers "some" home-grown ", and an offensive subheading where a woman headed by a deputy seems to be nervous," seems to be sleeping "). <br /> <br /> Finally, Alda's film is a dark, bleached, colorless, lifeless look and feeling. Only Louise Lasser adds sparks. At least other films had a spirit, a landscape and pleasant music; Griffith got to the mountain, to the lake and even to the big city. You will feel more than a Masters or Empty Grave than Shocking.
