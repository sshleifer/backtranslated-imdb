This film creates as much thinking as the "Ozzie & Harriet" or "Father knows best" episode. An old reader digest copy (about 1962) would give a better insight into modern life or the relationship between father and daughter than this strange finish. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by Diane Keaton. He seems to run through the film. (Given the title of the film, I understand that his role was supportive, but even Martin Short had a clear and supportive character.) <br /> <br /> I understand the attractiveness of the imaginary world created by good romantic comedy. But this movie is the prozac version of the imaginary world. I'm afraid someone could enjoy it even as a pure fantasy.
