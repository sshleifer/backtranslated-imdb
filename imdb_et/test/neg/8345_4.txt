Volcano is located in Los Angeles, where a small earthquake has hit, O.E.M. (Emergency Management Agency) Mike Roark (Tommy Lee Jones) decides to shorten his leave and go when he sees that everything is fine, but then drops down to an epicenter with seven underground workers killed in fire or intense heat. Mike is not sure what to think that he will bring geologist Dr Amy Barnes (Anne Heche) to try and explain. Unfortunately, La Brea Tar is the great underground river of the lava devastated after sending the lace. a stage that casts into the streets of the city something that burns and touches it in the flames. Mike, her husbands and emergency services have cut her job trying to stop the stage river and save as many lives as possible ... <br /> <br /> Under Mick Jackson's leadership, this was another big budget disaster, reversing the idea of ​​erupting Volcano During 1997, with Dante's Peak (1997) released just two months or so before Volcano was and while Dante's peak is hardly any masterpiece at least it's a little better and more credible than Volcano's. The script here is full of nonsense and not based on reality at all, the underground rivers of the stage, which appear to appear and then disappear as quickly as possible, are different in character, standing on the customs stage of the river, which is not affected by heat (when this man on the train is molten metal around him, melted, but it stays perfectly as far as I know that human skin is not as hot as metal, is it?) And it happens constantly, helicopters fly ash (cloud) reality would be impossible), stopping one simple block at the end of the street flowing lava (which is down from other streets and other directions?) being able to blow the perfect ditch on the street and then blowing a huge building until it makes a massive dam and when Kelly sees the direction of his car, he goes out like everyone, but then stands for some reason there and watching that two firefighters are burning death and waiting for his father to rescue him, even though at this stage his leg is fire, despite all these concrete blocks, m is placed in less than twenty minutes to make a barrier, the boy does so much work that no molten stage can get through and overloads the huge building that falls on Tommy Lee and his daughter. then both are later. The characters are also terrible, although Tommy Lee & Anne Heche and the minimal city officer trying to close Tommy Lee & Anne Heche before the event were not as usual as they were. There are some badly written and sometimes embarrassing moral moments when Los Angeles pulls together, a black man and a semi-racial policeman who warm up each other and eventually each other want each other well and that little boy at the end when he says. Everyone looks the same - it's worth it and is definitely a ham-fisted attempt and trying to tell what color we are, being human beings and we can all come together during the crisis because it brings people together. Having said that I think Volcano is one of those bad films, it attracts and moves along a decent pace, but simply does not expect something that is in reality or in human drama. <br /> <br /> I think a movie like Volcano could be seen as an update to the 70's disaster films, such as Poseidon Adventure (1972) or Earthquake (1974), but with a huge budget with modern effects. Talking about the effects they're doing, but none of them seem to be surprisingly forgotten about the many & set-pieces, there are certainly a couple of impressive explosions and a few OK lava rivers that flow through Los Angeles effects, but little. In general, Volcano is simply not very exciting, and although sometimes inadvertently funny and completely ridiculous, it does not really work as the makers predict it. <br /> <br /> The estimated budget is about $ 90,000,000, which was opened just under $ 15,000,000 at the ticket office, seems to be fine and there is a lot of fire, but nothing looks like & Volcano is a pretty forgotten movie. Filmed in Los Angeles I think most of the places here were in their real residence. The cast moves through a terrifying dialogue and ridiculous equipment to fight, Tommy Lee Jones deserves better than this. <br /> <br /> Volcano is a bit of a disaster in both minds, a catastrophic film that ended with a bit of a catastrophe. It deserves to be laughed by some unintentional laughter and all of it ridiculous, but it's not great and I doubt I'd ever see it.
