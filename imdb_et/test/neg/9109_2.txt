** May include spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Ok, this movie can be finished in one word: bad. Two words? Really bad. Now, why do I think that? Let me explain. <br /> <br /> Guttenberg manages a four-man team of professionals to recover a deadly virus after stealing some of the weapons from a laboratory. They do this by attacking hand-dealers in the middle of the flight and somehow winning back after some struggles. However, doubts arise about Guttenberg because one terrorist knew his name. After receiving the summary, the crew members will be attacked by unknown persons and everyone will suspect that everyone else is involved. After deciding that they can't trust their bosses, they decide to steal the virus again and try to attract potential attackers. <br /> <br /> In theory, this is a plot that could have worked on a low-budget movie, which is simply intended to be broadcast on television. However, the plot is under threat and the film is destroyed on multiple accounts. First, the plot is completely predictable and it is not fun to know how the film will end after three minutes. Secondly. The action is really bad, or the actors are directed to the dummy. There are not many emotions, facial expressions at all, etc. I was particularly disappointed in Guttenberg that I believe that much more can be done, but I cannot fully try to be a harsh action-hero. In addition, although I am by no means an expert in this field, I absolutely believe that I can put together a better hidden team by winning five strangers and training them for a week. It seems to be the subject of the film to make things as stupid and unprofessional as possible. It also goes for good boys, bad boys and bystanders. Then I sincerely doubt the scientific and technical consultants of the film, if any. For example, I've poured liquid nitrogen over my hand and I didn't break it instantly. <br /> <br /> I don't know how to really stop it, but says that this movie has a predictable plot, bad performance, and they seem to be amateurs. Sorry, it can't be nicer. Don't look at this movie, it's not so bad that it's funny. 2/10
