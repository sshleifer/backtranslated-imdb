It was a very mortgaged movie before it was released but turned out to be a dud. I never talked to one person who ever liked this movie. I agree: I didn't like it either. Perhaps there was one big reason why it was not a box office success, was that the story was nothing but unappealing. <br /> <br /> For a while there - I don't know if it's still true - I wasn't. t a movie in which Laura Linney or Dylan Walsh played something but annoying signs. <br /> <br /> This and stupid story makes this movie a great disappointment, especially considering this great gathering. Did the filmmakers in the dialogue with this dialogue really think it would be hit?
