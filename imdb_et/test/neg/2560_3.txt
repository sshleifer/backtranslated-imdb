This is indeed a kung fu popularized in the 1970s. However, if it has ever had any excitement or even a semi-interesting plot, it does not seem very well aged. <br /> <br /> Short story: Extremely drawn, slow moving, confusing plot with choreography of the grinder, usually annoying and exaggerated whip plates with every stroke and impact, and a constant "twist on the plot" that never ends. By the time the film reached its emotional climax, I had a long time when all the wind was pulled out of the wind to really care. <br /> <br /> Look at your historical value as a milestone in the Chinese kung fu cinema - just leave your expectations on the door, or you're bitterly disappointed. <br /> <br /> Only for hardcore fans.
