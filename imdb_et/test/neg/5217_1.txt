Bored, unruly, some of the worst directions I've ever encountered, a man's action and a terrible clich√©. The film ends with one of the main characters that awakens from the dream. WHAT IS IT? Even JR Dallas could not survive this flat wrong. <br /> <br /> You only have what you can describe as an inappropriate relationship that develops between the main owner and the young girl who is apparently a father, but that is perverse. You have the special effects of a college community college movie school with Kimberly Hole sizes. It's like corn children meet Christ's passion for the endless eye of a non-governmental administration training video - at the end, if you are not going to end it, you don't have the brain. > Don't worry.
