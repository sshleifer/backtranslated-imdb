Any way to see Katharine Hepburn's something I haven't seen or her early film career is a treatment, and at this level the movie is amusing, but she's terrible than Billy. His famous New England pronunciation slips out, making lines like: "I would like some of Vittles to be repressed" pretty ridiculous. She is so beautiful and so young? it almost goes beyond that big mistake. The story is an old-fashioned melodrama, and therefore the younger generation may think it is a pretty horny thing, but it was America's main entertainment in the 1940s. It has its moments, but it may be necessary to evaluate it.
