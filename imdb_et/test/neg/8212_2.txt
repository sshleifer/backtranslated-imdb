The main idea behind Harrow's Dungeon is not all bad. Action is bad, however. Lighting is bad. The music is bad. Torture scenes are without emotions. There's not really much to recommend this movie. You know what kind of movie you are when "Special Guest Star" says credit and list someone you have never heard of. You can also say "Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln." because there is no one in this movie that you can identify. There are one or two decent moments, mostly to the end, and I think the basic figure may contain an original idea, but alone is not enough to keep you awake through it, otherwise it will fail.
