I watched the last film of Atoll K-Laurel and Hardy together and felt in those countries where Utopia-on-Archive is hoping to see some additional material as the IA version was 2 hours and 21 minutes. It turns out that this is basically the same version I previously looked at from a good basement VHS tape from Goodtimes Home Video, which ran for an hour and 23 minutes (unless the bottle of wine showed no Welch grape juice label) for the rest of the rundown blind. Although Stan looks like he may soon die, he still fills with Ollie's great physical comedy for the first 45 minutes. Then, with a competing rider and sailor who had no country, not to mention a charming French singer who also arrives on an unforgettable island, they can all take over with any complications that comedy has. down and never recover, despite Ollie's familiar ending, saying last time to Stan: "Here's another nice mess you are with me!" before Stan starts uncontrollably before fade out. In other words, if you're a deadly Laurel and Hardy fan, we recommend that you see this movie at least once. Anyone who wants to get to know this classic comedy team should look for their earlier work for Hal Roach from the 1920s to 1940s, when they finished their final Roach movie, Saps at Sea. Think about it, even some L&H Fox flip-flops (not two more for MGM) are better than the 40's ... Update-8/29/09: Just look at the missing scenes that appeared on YouTube in Italian version. Cherie sings in one and talks to the captain. In another, the captain's wife pulls a weapon at Cherie. Another, explains Giovanni, why he left his country. Stan is a high pitch here!
