I was ready to love "Where is Poppa," the link between Normal Lear's actors in the sitcom character, who, when I grew up, felt like an extended member of my rusty-sized crushed nuclear family. How fun would be to see censorship free Barnard Hughes, Vincent Garden, Ron Liebman, Rob Reiner and pre-SNL Garret Morris. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Where is Poppa". It is claustrophobic and explosive and interrupts the cardinal rules of the farce, the lightness of the mood and the fast pace. <br /> <br /> The plot includes the efforts of a lawyer (George Segal) to get rid of his overflowing Jewish mother living in her gigantic New York apartment. Along the way are ridiculous characters and situations: the comedy group, which repeatedly hears the brother of the main game, the rape of a policeman, which includes a gorilla suit and homosexual love, Ruth Gorden pulls Segal's pants down and bites him in the ass when he serves his dinner. Why doesn't it work? Part of the explanation is that the cause of evil, dark interior and antique furniture is the doom. I am eating New York cinematography during this time, but when I was watching this movie, I felt like I was in a dark bus stop from a police magazine. <br /> <br /> The main reason is slow pace. Modern MTV-style fast cuts have changed what cinematic people feel is a convenient pace of editing, but even taking this into account, camera shots are kept for too long. Land developments are also very slow. This is one of the situations where it works: the strange love song George Segal sings quietly, very close to his face for Trish Van Devere and for an extraordinarily long time. It reminded me of the eye-catching extended shots of the British version of The Office, where you find yourself clipping with a mental twist and at the same time you can't stop searching. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most movies are "faster" than "can't watch". It made me wonder if there is a black comedy that is also a farce. The dilemma is that the gravity of black comedy themes tend to weigh the farce of the farce. Movies like Robert Altman's "M * A * S * H" and Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" prove that this can be achieved. They do it not only through speed but also through entertaining sub-blocks, something "Where is Poppa" ignored. <br /> <br /> Although the film has several stereotypically funny characters, almost all of them are directly related to the central drama of dealing with a deliberate mother. The scenes with Garret Morris and Central Park tubs are as close as the viewer can break the mental. Following the tradition of commune ne'er-d0 wells, the tubers seemed almost Shakespeare. If the rest of "Where Poppa" had been a little closer to the traditional tradition, it would have been a better film. Edgier is not always better. Just like all these talented actors and director Carl Reiner, they took little time before the creation of the 70s. <br /> <br /> Random Remarks: After Ron Liebman's clothes, the muggers, Cornel Wilde, mentioned "The Naked Prey" (1966), a great action film that was a stylish predecessor to the "Apeside Planet" of 1968. <br /> <br /> Politically wrong, as he was, is alarming to learn about the hero's death as daunting as Charleton Heston. Linda Harrison, who played "Novat", told Taylor's mouth companion that James Fransicus, the successor, seemed cute and small compared to Heston.
