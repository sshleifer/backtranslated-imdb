It's really bad, the characters were insignificant, the story was boring and there was no sex. What's more, he has no drama, the conflict is minimal, so it's a very slow pace. Nothing happens in this movie, you wait for a sex scene, but they just have a kiss. The plot revolves around three characters, a man, a woman, and a stranger they pick up from the high way. The couple calls a stranger to stay with them because he is homeless. Here you would expect a stranger to have sex with a woman? No, they just kiss and it is. Nor does this film contain any action, no comedy, no drama or even intercourse. You think the studio didn't even read this script !!
