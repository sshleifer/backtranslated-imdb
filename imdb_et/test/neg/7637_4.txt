It could have been the role of Valeria Golino's burst, but the film decided to focus it on another region. The film is about a woman Grazia (Golino), married to a fisherman and three mothers. He is a free spirit and inclined to outbreaks, so the rest of the village and his family decide he should be sent to Milan and go to the doctor. The story goes out of Sicily on the island of Lampedusa and it shows everyday life with teenage boys competing with gangs and trying to find something to do with sun-baked rock. Grazia's oldest son, Pasquale (Francesco Casisa), loves her and always tries to protect her during depression. Daughter Marinella (Veronica D'Agostino) is a flourishing young girl admired by a local policeman and the youngest son, Filippo (Filippo Pucillo), is very dirty and mocking the police. When you learn to be sent to Milan, Grazia runs away and Pasquale helps her hide her cave when everyone is looking for her. Indeed, this film could have been more influential if it could have focused on Grazia. For our part, we see some outbreaks and irrational behavior, but tracking these scenes is not their follow-up. Nothing comes out of it. The film looks good and is beautifully photographed to give the director Emanuele Criales credit for this, but the story that needs to be focused on something more important. The film does a good job of showing us what life is on this island and what is happening in the lives of these three children as they grow up. Their idea is to speculate that the character of Golino is a hint that it is a mermaid-like creature, which makes it difficult to land. I also feel that the island itself expects its inhabitants to behave in a certain way and if you do not, you may be subjected to the harsh real conditions of the rules. All the speculation, but I think the attention of the films could have been on Grazia's character. After she hides in the cave, she has nothing to do. In a sense, this character becomes stagnant. I wish Golino had done more because I always liked him and when he is on the screen, you just can't take his eyes off. He's a lot of rage, passion and raw energy! What a shame Criales didn't write for him a more complete role when the film was working. When a movie ends your left feeling for an incomplete story.
