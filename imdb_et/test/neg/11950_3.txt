Go to the video store and get the original. I don't understand why Hollywood needs to make a perfect foreign movie and do it again. "Mostly Martha" or "Bella Martha" is much better. Starting from the heroine Martina Gedeck, who convinced me much more of a work-fixed perfectionist than the most famous Catherine Zeta Jones, the Italian chef and niece suddenly took away from the mother and forced to live aunt, not suitable for raising a child. <br /> <br /> The American version of the movie is in many ways a German original. They exchanged participants easily. But they also changed the story because it would have been difficult and not particularly believable that the father would have given birth in the American context. <br /> <br /> I thought about it. Perhaps his father would have been Puerto Rica or Cuba or Mexico. Well, there are so many "guest workers" in the US. But I doubt that any of them would have shown responsibility, as the Italian father did in the original. That's why the American film leaves this part, but keeps the Italian chef. And doing this will change the whole story. In the original "Martha", it has been so removed from the reality that he thinks it is possible to send his niece abroad to a stranger. <br /> <br /> American "Martha" is softer and therefore the film is sweeter and has no German film on this edge. <br /> <br /> In the original, "Italian" chef is not so good looking, but more charming, a little girl is more brat, but much more credible and "Martha" is more of a career woman's representative. In today's world, what is presented in the American version is. And the whole opera music in the American version was very annoying. I loved Italian songs in the original and bought a CD. <br /> <br /> Hollywood admitted that "mostly Martha" was a great movie. Perhaps distribution companies should have put it more into theaters, or it should have been shown in English without subtitles. In any case, the original is so much better. By the way, it reminds me of another remake. "We Dance" is one of my favorites in the original Japanese version and in the American version completely forgotten.
