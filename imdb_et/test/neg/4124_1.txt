In short, skip this movie, it's so bad. In short, this film is a gun factory where secret weapons are being developed. Because they do bad things, they are not so popular. The task of the new female board chairperson is to clean things and improve the company's reputation. It does this by leaking confidential company information to the press ... Do you believe it? In addition, he starts shooting people he has never seen. Incredible uh? The pacifist group is trying to destroy the company's mainframe because there is a plan for their secret weapons. This mainframe is located at the bottom of the building, hidden in some kind of deposit. Of course, the film would not be complete without a mad scientist and robot who is the ultimate killer, similar to foreigners' foreigners. A crazy scientist loves a female CEO. <br /> <br /> A crazy scientist instructs the robot to kill everything and protects his work, the rise of the chain of command, and the movie. The pacifists are with the CEO and another board member to get out of the robot. Continuing this line, they agree that this bad computer's mainframe will blow up while avoiding the robot. They also discover that the factory developed a part of the man, partly machine soldier. They can delete people's memory and replace it with a veteran soldier. One of the pacifists is a soldier and kills a killer robot. I think the crazy scientist also wrote the script for this movie. This superhero looks and works much like Robocop, though not so funny. <br /> <br /> It will fall. People run, kill killer robot, hurt him, but they don't seem to worry that after a little breakdown and of course the woman's chief executive is the leading character of this movie and can't kill it, ie survive every attack, explosion, you call that. I'm not bothering to chase you, let's go to the end. They have many weapons, including pacifists, and they know how to use them. If they are on the roof of the building, they will cancel all the weapons on the killer robot. They step into the elevator, which is used to clean the exterior windows. And then the female CEO also knows the magic, she complained on the roof that she was out of the balls and like the magic, the weapon was reloaded. In this way, he can take off the cables and let the lift hit the 70 squares and let him stop directly from the ground pulling the brake. And all out, waiting for the police. The robot jumps after them and kills the cops. Funny no? The robot pursues those vaults where the mainframe is, and when the robot is so close that it can touch / kill it, it stops. Because the crazy scientist didn't want to kill him. A better name for this man would be an idiot scientist. Although he is the one who made this movie traceable. At this point, I already pulled the killer robot to stop all of them, so the movie ended. <br /> <br /> I can't believe this movie appreciates this high and that's why I wrote this comment. Avoid this movie like a plague. It's a monster and I'm not talking about the death machine.
