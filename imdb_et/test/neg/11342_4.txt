Thunder Alley finds Fabian banned from NASCAR stories after the death of another driver. Stanley Adams may have wanted to put him in the team of his competitors, but other drivers do not have to let him down. <br /> <br /> To desperate, Fabian grabs the car's stunt actor Jan Murray, who pays for him and tries to take advantage of Fabian's bad rep. He has to take it, but Annette Funicello, the daughter of Murray, gives another reason to stay around. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is Fabian's fight to return to NASCAR circulation and at the same time Annette juggles and her current girlfriend Diane McBain. I would have personally taken McBain, he is with all of Annette. <br /> <br /> Thunder Alley is helpful for taking pictures of NASCAR's southern roads and NASCAR racing. This is not a very silly story that differs from the real cause of Fabian's problems and his rather unrealistic recovery. <br /> <br /> NASCAR fans can still do this.
