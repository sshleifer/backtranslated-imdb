I was looking forward to it on the basis of the reviews and a fairly good assessment. It was a big disappointment. It does not hold candles for modern zombie clips such as Shaun's day of the dead, the day of the dead, dead lands, and so on. The fear clamps will take some time to go, you will have to build some characters with some empathy to build your characters, but even with a full 45-minute session before you, dead body, looking at the bad soap opera, something interesting or relevant and If you are to see it for the first time, you will be able to watch it in 45 minutes, you will not miss anything. When things go, it's all very low. Some are killing and forming well, others are badly done, there is no consistency here, and there are some really shocking continuity bugs and some of the most woody actions I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It may all be satisfactory if you really believed it all happened on the plane, but the weapons are fired, fires are released, pilots in a violent storm in the cockpit, but the plane remains in the air, c'mon, we are not all simpletons . <br /> <br /> Oh, and do you really take a minute to destroy a fighter missile plane a few hundred meters away. I know this zombie film and you have to stretch things, but this movie, along with the other major shortcomings above, was unreliable. One misses.
