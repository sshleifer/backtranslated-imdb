I'm a fan of big sci-fi movies. So when I saw this movie on EPG, I thought I was a pleasant night out. What a disappointment! Such a bad display of "special" effects that I couldn't imagine in 1980, but in 2005? Come on, why would you do the special effects of a helicopter flying in the desert if you can really shoot at a much lower price (I think)? And those killer "muppets" ... well, I got a few hours in the garage to do better. You can expect the film to have a small budget, but I don't think it's reasonable if there is a small film on the budget. As far as the star of the film is concerned (today I use a lot of quotes ...), Lou Diamond Philips is not far from being an actor. Maybe he should have been in martial arts movies. All in all, it's a terrible movie. Maybe I'm in a bad mood tonight. Then again, maybe not. Sincere 1 out of 10.
