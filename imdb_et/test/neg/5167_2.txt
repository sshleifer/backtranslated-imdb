It was like looking up and the trailer of the future movie, except that the movie didn't come. The film is so unhappy and probably unfinished to be almost ridiculous. The subject of this movie is in a very short time and, frankly, nothing will actually happen within 90 minutes of a few minutes. I was hoping for the ultimate Australian movie about our soldiers during World War II and how they fought against incredible odds under terrible conditions. <br /> <br /> Having said that, action was great and the locations were authentic. It would have been a simple film that gave much more money and time, but it is not even mediocre, and I cannot recommend it at all.
