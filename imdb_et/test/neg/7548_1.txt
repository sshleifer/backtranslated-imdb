Bottom seems to have gone through Fawlty Towers! But Ade Edmonson & Rik Mayall has managed to create a film that barely raises the title. Ten years ago, Rik Mayall's crazy and Ade idiots were funny, now they're just annoying. <br /> <br /> The film had a promise, though Britain's most terrible hotel is not a new idea -. Sustainable scars were competent performances by Simon (Spaced, Big Train) Pegg and Helene Mathieu and the film is only 90 minutes long. Sorry, guys, but you've really hit the bottom
