This is undoubtedly the worst film for the Hamiltonian saga and the worst actor for Carl Hamilton. He may be good at making killers and psychotic maniacs like "Fargo" or "8mm", but in such roles he is simply useless. <br /> <br /> Lena's presence didn't use this movie. He couldn't save it because it is: an American copy of big budget movies like "Goldeneye", "Die Hard 3", "Broken Arrow", etc. There's nothing like this in this movie, but the actors. It's clear that some Norweag directors with McTiernan have shown it as a leader. br /> <br /> Mark Hamill's presence is only ridiculous. 2 out of 10
