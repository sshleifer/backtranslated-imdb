I love Das Boot. I was hoping for something in a similar way - a realistic war film that depicts both sides as true human soloists and civilians, both for joy and pain. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Stalingrad seems to have been written by a third-grade student and led by a fifth-grade student. The main pieces of the film seem to have disappeared, leaving it completely scattered. The dialogue in translation is ridiculous, but it seems that the mother tongue is not better; You only have to look at the faces of the actors during the bad moments of the dialogue to understand how bad this film is.
