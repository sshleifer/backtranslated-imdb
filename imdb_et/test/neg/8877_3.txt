I also recommend putting it "skipped". I liked the somewhat irritated idea when my groom rented it and a little excited when I saw Milos Forman leading it. Ah, well ..... <br /> <br /> Costumes were nice, definitely, but they were typical. There was nothing about them saying they were everywhere but in any of the larger Hollywood studio's Period Costume department. There was no difference between Spain, Britain and France - all dresses like the Versailles court. Sets in some way did not create the characteristics of the settings - the prison did not feel in prison, the estates did not know the housing, and the external scenes saw that they were filmed on the back because they were probably practical places. <br /> <br /> The result was far less than it could have been. I've been a fan of movie results since I was young, noticing, appreciating, and gathering those I mean more than John Williams. My groom is a professional filmmaker, a prize winner who has done his job at Lincoln Center and a rising industry star. At the beginning of the movie we had great hopes and it really started nicely. It deteriorated quickly and at several points, including the release of prisoners, and it was actually outrageous. I came down to reduce the volume on the remote control. The result was never more than the most obvious choice to tune into a particular scene and did not integrate into the "soul" (think of Babel's music and you have an idea what I mean). It never achieved the generosity he wanted, but it didn't make the film. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem, as talented, was terrible. For the first part of the film, his admonitions are so confusing that he takes over his performance. On the other side, everything in his first half had been, disappeared, replaced with completely other annoying motifs, and he looked like Keith Richards and Stuart Townshend Lestat's love children. I never got the idea that he would care about the role (that is, the character took care of his life and deeds), or that the writers have ever drawn more than an opportunist who for some reason Natalie Portman was very good, although his performance was not between the liberation from prison and the madness at the end of Lorenzo's hand. that I should have called it a truly effective result. The character of Alicia was never defined enough to really differentiate, and if it wasn't an excellent makeup for her eyes and cheeks, someone who saw the beginning and the end of the film didn't know they weren't the same character. Prosthetic teeth were terrible, artificial, and distracting, but that is not Mrs Portman's beating. <br /> <br /> Stellan Skarsg√•rd was good as Goya. Not Oscar-worthy, but usable and generally credible. I don't know much about Goya's life or his deafness, but it seemed that the film was treated as a requirement for biographical information, not something that was used in the film. I am sure that this has influenced Goya's life much more than just the need for an interpreter, but you never know about it. For the record, words and sounds can only be interpreted correctly by almost 30% of the time through reading the lips. <br /> <br /> Don't start with Randy Quaid. At least he was small in nature. <br /> <br /> The script looks like one of my "own adventure choices", which I read as a child: many times you can make many results through the movie, and none of the previous actions gives you any certainty as to how the movie actually plays. Ironically, the film is also predictable, especially with its little experiments in the mood of humor through small humor. A joke about your hands? Perhaps this is because I paint (not well) a hobby and know what PITA's hands are drawing / dyeing, but I saw a joke at a joke, as well as on the other side. Was the child there for any reason other than Ines? There may also be bread cracks. <br /> <br /> Fraud.
