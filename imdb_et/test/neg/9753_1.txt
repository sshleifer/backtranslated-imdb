participants cannot act. all the dialogs suffered with bad accents and loss of character. Channing Tatum doesn't move his lips or change his facial expressions ... EVER. <br /> <br /> The story is nothing new. some street kids participate in the dance professional world and it changes her life around. that which, together with the incident with the little child, has been taken directly from earned and saved from the last dance (I am not saying that these films were also good, but it means that this movie didn't bring anything new to the table)). <br /> <br /> And Dancing ... ONLY 3 Dance Corrections In The Full Movie And 2 Of Them In The Trading Area. maybe I'm too critical because I'm a dancer, but maybe that's what's going to be heard. Channing Tatum is by no means a b-boy. his little solo parking lot had little style, technique or any other factor that was part of the street dancer criteria. All the film jazz and ballet had nothing to offer except the bad technique and some acceptable twists, but nothing else. grande finale left me thinking "... OK, now they get serious", to the end when I realized it would never happen. <br /> <br /> I admit that it is hard to make a good dance movie, but Step up is no exception. You could earn, except for the contradictions with street dance culture, at least in the aspect of dance. Save the last dance was garbage, and so almost all of the music of the last 10 years (though I was impressed by Moulin Rouge) ... see the center stage for ballet, see Beat on hip-hop
