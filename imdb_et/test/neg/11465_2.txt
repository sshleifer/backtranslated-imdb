I just saw it in the cinema. I haven't read books. There is nothing new about this movie. <br /> <br /> Bad guys seem to be dying with a few slashes, no matter how many times our hero is caught up in a bigger sword, which he continues in the same way (ish)! There are several activities, but they are very counterfeit. filmmakers seem to have the impression that if they are not able to choreograph effortlessly, the scenes they just move will move quickly and turn the music up ......... This will leave me imitated again. <br /> <br /> I admire them, trying to solve a dark story without normal Hollywood cheese, but I'm sorry that filmmakers have failed. The characters are two-dimensional. We don't know them at all or know them at all. The cook has a charming accent of farmers oo arrr ..... though it doesn't seem to have much to say ... <br /> <br /> Do not bother looking at it if you are not bored and are not in favor of blocking the price.
