This film supports self-confidence! It gives freedom to the black man who killed the men who raped their daughter and finally they become meaningless! There's enough marriage in this movie, if it can be. The Connaughey character has Bullock-like hoods and the film has some sample stereotypes (such as important news that has been sent to the court in timing) that make every aesthetically demanding film as sick! I really can't believe that someone liked this junk. It is such a bad film and false ideals that I cannot put my criticism nicely in the pleasures. When the Americans wake up and find that they are being manipulated 24/7 on films that make reality into some BS, where there is justice for everyone, if they only take it. This cowboy attitude makes me sick and in my eyes it represents everything that is wrong in America!
