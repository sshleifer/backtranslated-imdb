... I usually hate punches, but it seems to be the only suitable summary for "Barnyard". I suspect I'm not the first. And I'm sure many, many of the comments focus on the idiotic bull of bulls. Certainly, I immediately banned me from the bat. But this film is much more wrong than the basic lack of knowledge about the work of mammals. <br /> <br /> Personally, when I was older, I would have been irritated by a violent turn that will end. with coyote. (Although this is at least a small activity for me.) And from the usual screen writing perspective, you might assume that coyotes play a greater role in the conflict (Gee - you have a "widow" cow ... maybe his "wife" was killed by coyotes? No. .. there is a lot of dumber explanation.) And what kind of farm is it? Otis promises to protect all animals from damage, but it seems that people are not at risk. They suggest that the farmer is vegan, but what does he grow? In all the children's stories - Babe, Charlotte's Web - you call it ... at least the reality of farming is being dealt with. Perhaps our friendly farmer is working as a refuge for some kind of rescue (some references refer to it, but it has never been explained.) But in return, all farmers receive a horse abuse scene that should be funny, but I seriously thought that he was going to bury him behind a sheep in a low grave. And what the hell is to deal with "Wild Mike"? It was like a Gimp scene in Pulp Fiction without a bullet-gag. <br /> <br /> Add some really terrible experiments to emotional scenes, almost no laugh, and THOSE UDDERS, and you have the worst childhood I've ever seen. As a rule, I only post to IMDb to highlight a movie that is not so well-known to not capture the current # 2 box. But this movie was annoyed by me. It was a space in my local theater, a room that could have been used to show something valuable. There have been many good family entertainment this summer - there were at least two children's clips with the same multiplex. But I can't see anything "Little Miss Sunshine" so Viacom can cheat families for $ 30 for fraud. At least I had a free gear. <br /> <br /> I know that this film is not designed for children with 35 years of age. But in the Pixar era, there is no such lazy, terrible child movie as "Barnyard". "Ice Age" films missed, but they didn't fret me like "Barnyard". "Shark Tale" was a weak test for street climbing but he laughed. That's why you could turn Nickelodeon at any time of the day and see something more fun and intelligent - that's why they should shame on their name. <br /> <br /> Giving him 2 out of 10 just because Pip Mouse was a casual amusement and Maria Bamford had some fun features like a farmer's wife. Well, not the farmer's wife. Some other farmers. They didn't explain who he was. They didn't explain many things. Especially not because Sam Elliot - the ultimate "male man" - was there uder. Creepy.
