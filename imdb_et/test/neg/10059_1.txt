I've never seen so much talent and money that I would have made so bad throughout my life! As was said in other comments, those who are talented, such as Christopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway, Donald Sutherland, and many other films that are not recognizable as the story of Agatha Christie, were thrown away. I continue to think about how it could be the same pain, the right way. The film has even less intimacy than Christopher Reeves's 'Superman' films. Due to the large casting layer, sliding production is even less effective than in these films because there is not enough time to get to know anyone. Dave Brubeck's progressive jazz sound had me wondering if the rental store had the wrong video in that case. Music became increasingly offensive when the plot progressed. It is difficult to say whether the sound or disturbing technique used to replay information from previous scenes was offensive. Someone who has seen all of Christie's films (that's what attracted me to this was one of the few I didn't see) missed it. This is not Agatha Christie's film. Golan-Globus is more suited to a long-time wrestling rather than an English mysterious atmosphere.
