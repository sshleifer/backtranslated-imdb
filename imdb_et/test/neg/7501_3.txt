The prerequisite for this film is the fantasy of every woman: a vagina that kills and eats men. At least this is a fantasy for every woman who has ever won against a man. What is it, 99.9999% of women? But don't worry that it's not men's eating. It's rather a comic slurping, like a drain cap. There is no blood or parts left behind. So for the blood, guts and gore fans, forget this movie, not a lot of gore here. <br /> <br /> The two main characters in the movie are somewhat unrealistic. Helen is a good girl to become a prostitute. In the meantime, Dennis is a nice boy who hides Helen. <br /> <br /> This story is a bit stupid, but then they are thrown into two more equally foolish subpages that just send the bad B-movie territory of this movie. The first new story from Dennis is finding a new love pair with mated twins; and then one of them is murdered and becomes a flying banker. Another new story is that Helen is looking for new love with a nice policeman who saved her from a bad day with prostitution and decided she wanted to marry her. At the end of the movie, Dennis and Helen will meet in a totally unbelievable situation and magically will heal Helen's murderous vagina!
