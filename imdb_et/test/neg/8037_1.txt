I repeat - what a stupid scenario. <br /> <br /> Is there anything new inside? I don't know who wrote it. But I believe this guy has been watching all the Hollywood child-families-the-teens movies that have ever been made ... all the scenes and dilouges u see everywhere. Why do people make this movie? children like adults? they love money for gold cars ... and are they positive? they are happy ... and of course emotions ... without it. o Young actors - wow :-). I like when the camera focuses on its nice face? What is nonsense ... there are 90% better movies what it is! It's not a creative or funny movie. It's not just something. <br /> <br /> D.
