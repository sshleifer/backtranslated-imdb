This movie is not worth the descent overview, it just made me decide that I wouldn't go to the next Tarantino movie. I loved the Tarantino movies. <br /> <br /> Not artistic, not fun, not witty, not funny, nothing, just dull and stupid. If this film was first in Tarantino, it would have been his last. <br /> <br /> Tarantino has to grab himself, otherwise his next film is a 3-hour pointless, boring and poor dialogue. He seems to be in love with his dialogue - and his love is blind. <br /> <br /> After popcorn finishes, there's no reason to sit in the theater any more.
