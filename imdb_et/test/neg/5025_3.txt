Rossini described the works of the rival composer Wagner as "wonderful moments ... and some terrible quarters". Inuyasha seems to have been described in this way. It has many great episodes, but there are countless execution episodes between them. The whole series consists of about 175 episodes, of which at least 125 are a filler or a sub-block (I didn't count and I wouldn't be surprised if that number was actually bigger) Some of these episodes of fillers are actually quite enjoyable, though many are pretty stupid or dull. Nonetheless, after the first season, the continuous decline begins to run thin, as the plot begins to move forward with labor-intensive indexing for most series. Also, the development of character slows down significantly and in later seasons, the majority has become quite unchanged, resulting in increasingly obsolete jokes (especially those concerning the monk who are ironic lines that start so lightly humorous but grow tiring than the associated jokes) appear repeatedly). <br /> <br /> But that doesn't mean that Inuyasha is a bad series. It is not just a great series about how Neon Genesis Evangelion is generally considered. Like anything to look at at the end of a hard day, it's great, but it can never be confused with high art.
