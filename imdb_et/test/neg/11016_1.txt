I'm glad I didn't pay to see The Wog Boy. <br /> <br /> I was hoping there to wait for something original and / or funny. <br /> <br /> It reminded me a lot about these predictable English comedies of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> I'm not worried about plot plot summaries, I suggest you do something for 90 minutes <br /> <br />
