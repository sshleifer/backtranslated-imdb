When I was flying back from London, I looked at him as a man; apparently, Air Canada is a political film. Maybe it's not the best way to review this movie. Amanda Bynes plays a girl who loves football so much that she pretends to be a twin brother to reach the team all over the school. Even if you look at your mind at the door (on a 6 hour flight), the story is incredible and ridiculous. Basically, there are some moments of humor, mostly comedian David Cross, but the complicated angles of love do not inspire emotions, although it is cleverly mixed (with a meaningless warning of credibility). The end is just as ridiculously meaningless as the rest. I think if I were a 12-year-old girl, I would have really enjoyed it.
