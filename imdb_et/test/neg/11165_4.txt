I've recently found this movie on one of my husband's VHS tapes (an empty variety that he uses to store things for the TV). The film looks like it was last shown in the eighties and I don't remember it since. It is not published on my (DVD) or VHS, though I did, for the copy. <br /> <br /> The film speaks of three youngsters: two girls, one on the edge of puberty. and another much younger, and a young boy who lives with his mother's brother and his young Israeli wife. His wife also has two brothers who live with them. The Uncle of Children is an unpleasant control freak that forces his young woman to wear a silver collar while she looks at her and her brothers' puppets in their toy. <br /> <br /> The eldest girl and one of the Irish men (younger) develop love for each other when they live in the same house. The girl helps the aunt out of the shop while her brother helps her to do things with the workshop. <br /> <br /> The movie has many very disturbing elements. Uncle is treating her husband in some (literally) possession (as illustrated by the collar), while Irish pampering dances, drunk and somehow banned in love. However, it is interesting that I have seen many clearer topics that are played in films made today in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Think about whether the British film industry and the BBC have some sort of hidden action plan. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it is not a children's film, it has many playful, magical moments, and one Irish man makes beautiful landscapes.
