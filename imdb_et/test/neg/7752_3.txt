Albert Pyun presents his vision of the lost city of Atlantis - and this vision is full of claustrophobic settings, marvelous costumes and noisy, "puppy" little characters that one thing is certain: you want to get out of hell right now (unfortunately, it's about 80 minutes). A story similar to "Alice in Wonderland" is prone and uninteresting, and there were probably no actors in the world who could have changed this good movie, even though Kathy Ireland is making a tempting (annoying voice and all) test.
