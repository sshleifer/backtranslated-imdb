Let's take one thing straight; It was BAD! So, Putrid, that doesn't even qualify for printing someone's memories. <br /> <br /> An ever-recurring story (who is constantly not only joking, but the story and the appearance of character). ; Sue (mother) opens an episode that cites how she loves her childhood, but smells awful (like it's not old! Har-de-bloody-har!), Some Australian quasi-national "bogan" seems to say how she thinks he is fantastic because he is ozzie, while everyone / everyone else who is not sucking before the rest of the episode disappears. (Little Grace) <br /> <br /> The rest of the plot is rotating around the father (Gary), getting into disagreement with Sue and with each other to talk to his band members about how to solve it. <br /> <br /> The phrase "words fail me" is old, but it is the place where it is most true. It's so incredibly bad! So, HORRIBLE, I would like all the traces of existence that are sent to the lowest depths and lives of the North Sea to continue. <br /> <br /> But I'm sad to see someone like Sally Bretton (good actor, I like to do it, practice myself, Ardal O Hanlon (next to my hero) has the ability to be pretty funny - but not here - and Ben Elton, who differs so much from good things, can do it ... the thing comedy is in very serious trouble!
