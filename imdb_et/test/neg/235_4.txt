First of all, I wasn't sure who this movie was aimed at - it seemed like a story for kids, but it had things kids didn't understand and find boring. There wasn't really much to it, Bruce Willis wasn't an actor. He glanced at this with a smile if you were not his big fan, so I wouldn't worry. And if this is a story you are interested in (a boy who seems to be all but has no emotional teachings taught childishly), I would look at A boy. It has all this missing film, humor, sadness and reality.
