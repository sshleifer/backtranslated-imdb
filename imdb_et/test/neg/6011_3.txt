I managed to avoid reading Hemingway in college. From what I can say with reductive verbiagia, he offered a reductive story. This transformation of the AF2A movie into a simple, frightening, belabored narrative does not make me suspicious: a man who hardly sees action on the European battlefield (Hudson) gets into a nurse (Jones) and they agree to spend time together. Hemingway's great contribution to the narrative was a romantic travel book? Who knows what these two lovers have in common? They are so general. The film will never even bring the ultimate irresponsibility needed to give up the adventure of lovers. Two are in the season in the Alps, directly from the J. Crew directory. Several of the better scenes undermine the common melodrama that has spread elsewhere. The film adheres to small, unlikely inaccurate details that struggle against epic treatment. The desolate hospital where Miss Barkley is working is virtually empty, so no other plot line might be unevenly disruptive to the main story. Complex, not. <br /> <br /> Camera performance is better than average, with some amazing location photography. Directed by Charles Vidor (or maybe Huston?), He does outstanding things in the first hour with the on-site wide-screen camera. Vidor has large panoramic tables, pans over hundreds of soldiers riding through the mountains; and then, with the camera's 90 degree turn, Hudson's ambulance gets to her. <br /> <br /> Hudson looks great. He's a better actor when he gets credit, but with such a shape he can become very mechanical. Mercedes McCambridge plays one-dimensional hair. Jennifer Jones is a pure and insecure female female. The film is best when it is off the screen. Love scenes affect coffee trade.
