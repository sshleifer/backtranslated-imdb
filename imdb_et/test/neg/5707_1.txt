The main character is a tiny, irresponsible survey of how to repent. He loses it in the slump, acts pathetically, is schizophrenic, and continued to think about why he could not understand on Earth why those "friends" had not called him for three years. (Get the clue, sister - you're a minor confusion!) I couldn't stand for her or friends. I never knew any characters. To make the whole film even more unbearable, someone went a long way to put the world's most boring crocheted and woven hats to exist for the whole film (this alone should guarantee a trial period for someone's decade of clothing)! <br /> <br /> It wasn't terrible, but also not really plausible, and finally the only thing I care about was two hours, which I was never going to get back. Don't waste your time - go to a dentist meeting!
