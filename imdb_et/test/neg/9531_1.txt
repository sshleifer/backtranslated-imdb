I am one of those people who respect the achievement of every filmmaker, I watch every film I usually respect (although I admit that I choose carefully) and feel what it is. Not anymore. It's really one of the worst scripts I've seen in the movie ... so much that I felt compelled to warn others about it. The dialogue was truly incredible, the main protagonist was the last person I would like to know more about. The scene was a friend of an old school "says, as it is" made me laugh just because it was a pathetic attempt to expose a plot of already signed plot. The direction is the best and the number one in the worst film making. Comparing this film with the majestic five-piece film atmosphere is travesty.
