This film has some good features, but looking at Dillon less than a masterful Rourke impersonation, I just missed this original. I like Marisa Tomei, but she's not Faye Dunaway. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, one of the rules of the film is one of the leading characters. You may not love this character, but you should take care of what happens to him. This is accomplished in Barfly, with a fun running stroke of barman Eddie's struggles. The main struggle in Factotum is when he is completely unaware that he hides the character of Lily Taylor at the bar, hitting him on the floor and calling him whore. <br /> <br /> The whole thing just didn't work. Again, some great lines - some laugh-out-loud funny - but the movie in general it has failed. A mediocre attempt to rediscover something that was brilliant, and you can't miss it. Next? Let's examine breakfast with Tiffany's Kate Hudson.
