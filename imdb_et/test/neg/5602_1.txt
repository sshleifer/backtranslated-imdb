DeCoteau must be one of the worst "directors" who work in all genres today and have nothing to do with films that usually contain homoerotism and whose boys run on their own boxers. Remember that anyone with tight black underwear is satanic and evil and wants to suck their blood / soul ... this deep symbolism here). I just sat down with Sisterhood to give her my fair shakes, I try to watch every horror movie I get, and it was Barbara (BEYOND, RE-ANIMATOR) in Crampton (I was previously sucked into the DeCoteau world) by Linnea Quigleele, Adrienne Barbeau and many other actors like me. <br /> <br /> Lemme tells you what Sisterhood ... As the other reviewer said, the expected plot includes lesbian vampires on college campus. . But there is never a parade of hot young babes ("actresses" if you want) running around dressed bras, panties and bikinis been so boring. The film has no plot, no gore, no nudity, and the dialogue is ridiculous and they seem to have missed it. Some parts are moved slowly and repeated several times to push up the working time. About ten minutes of it are characters who just go to campus (oh, excitement!) And acting is the absolute worst. The only thing these girls do well is lean forward and bend to show their body. The cast was so talented that I would be shocked to see that some of them will get to Passion in one day. You guys know. Yes, in DeCoteau's press, there are more hot boys in the underwear ... Boys who should be in a K-Mart brochure. Do these people really have to listen or just show in Dave's office and take their clothes off? I think the answer is obvious. <br /> <br /> I am ready to give any movie a chance if 1.) it is intelligently written, well-managed, original and professionally (or hell, even ambitious and stylish). Or 2.) it is full of gore, nudity, choices and / or inadvertently fun. David DeCoteau's films do not offer this and they do it for better-than-normal product values ​​for direct video clips. What waste! What's the appeal, especially with soft and hard core porn that is easily accessible to everyone on your computer? I just can't answer that. <br /> <br /> DeCoteau is a gay horror director and can use his resources to put a unique spin on the genre. Instead, it produces peace of mind with no talent or intelligence. Ironically, when you think about it, his films are nothing but PRO-gay. They actually make homosexuality sensitive, secret and sinful. Obviously homosexual characters in their films always try to corrupt, attract and / or kill innocent, sexually confused leaders. There is no shadow here to make things interesting. The main characters are naive and rarely turn out to be strong, confident or confident. I understand this drawing when Jerry Falwell, Fred Phelps or Dr. Laura start making a direct-video horror film, but from a gay director, it just shows that he almost doesn't think about these beef cheeses.
