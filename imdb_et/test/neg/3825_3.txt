This film was one of the first genres of 70's female prison films. This film was incredibly violent, with many sadistic torture being inflicted on prisoners. The film takes place in Phillipines, which looks like a terribly ugly country. There is no doubt that the producers used this factor as their advantage, emphasizing the steadfast situation in which the prisoners were. <br /> <br /> Queen Blaxploitation's Queen Pam Grier plays a major role in this film. He plays Blossom, a renegade who is thrown into a whistle in a female prison for charges. His boy, played by Sid Haig, is trying to save Blossom. He and Blossom are part of a political guerrilla group and Blossom's imprisonment was organized by a corrupt Phillipino government. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier and Sid Haig, who are otherwise in the dark. The film itself put too much emphasis on violence against prisoners. Their prisoners used them only as objects of their own sadism. It was really fast. This film could have used more interesting plot features and sophistication. It's not one of Roger's Corman's better pictures. Many women in prison movies that followed it were much better. I recommend Big Bird Cage to fans of Pam Grier only.
