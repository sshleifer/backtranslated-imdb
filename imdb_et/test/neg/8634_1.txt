I know that Americans find it difficult to find European films on video / DVD, especially in the 1980s, but please look for the original version of Vanishing's Spoorloo (1988) and see why the Hollywood version of The Vanishing screws I am very pleased with Sandra Bullock, Kiefer Sutherland and especially Jeff Bridges, but it's pretty flat compared to the original. What do they think? Can you imagine Seven happily ending with Gwyneth Paltrow, who is happily running into Brad Pitt's finals? The whole point, with its original international success, was a shocking final. So why do you agree with such a shameless rewriting? Really, avoid it and SEND ORIGINAL.
