I think the cards were stacked against Webmaster, because right from the start it was a itchy feeling like something was wrong, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Then it hit me. Duplicated. After a while, they managed most of the rows, either with a voice or off, but with some clues here and there until it became painful. This is a kind of duplication that nudes on the nerve, but nothing even funny. I hate dubbing, but at least misplaced martial arts tend to feel humor about it. <br /> <br /> What I wanted was a movie about a hacker doing real hacking and such things. . Perhaps as the back of the Hackers table (being the person who tries them instead of entering people). I got some badly written, meaningless mysteries of murders with a series of bad chases, allegedly inert hackers castrated without his little ego, and a director who probably didn't know how to handle the camera. I just wanted to get in there, grab the camera and finish it myself. Editing wasn't much better. Acting? Well, I think if the wizard hadn't got a bad script to work it would be at least traceable. The main bad guy was also OK, but everyone else was kidding. Duplication did not help, but this factor was even bad considering this. <br /> <br /> Before I get worse, we'll bring some good things. Well, one or two. Regardless of the original graphics, I enjoyed the cybercrime things that were scarcely there, and I would rather have watched the film mostly about it, and around it, as a rare environment outside the "real world". The fake thumbprint seemed cool, but it was quite useless in the case chart. The heartwalker, which reminded me of Guillermo Del Toro Cronos, was interesting, although the device of the plot that hung directly from the New York Escape pages was terrible in the long run. There is one point where a bad man is unconscious and our hero is there. So why didn't he try to print a bad man's thumb (since the heart was activated by the thumb)? Nonetheless, there are interesting gadgets and cyber-things if only they could have been better used. <br /> <br /> Now, who's here to compare this movie to Blade Runner? Both films sometimes take place in the future and there is some sort of look that is romantic in both movies. There's an investigation into the murder, but I've seen a lot of movie in the middle of a murder that's not like Blade Runner or Webmaster. Identity, for example. This is where the similarities end. Period. There is no comparison like Blade Runner and Hackers would not. Ridley Scott is a great director who has a great mood in the art and knows some of the basics of filmmaking, such as camera placement. The webmaster is cheap, not just for budget reasons. It is cheap because of poor writing and because it takes more than just out (like writing in a symbol that barely appeared for the first time to save the girl to get to B without Hero so she could do her thing. Very comfortable. Or He's trying to be hip, trying to be exploitative, even trying to twist, which is not the least surprising, and trying to be exciting. Identical tracking sequences, poor writing, editing, terrible hitting, bad performance, etc. are not an exciting movie.
