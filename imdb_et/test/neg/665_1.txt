After watching this movie, I have nothing but contempt for who participated in making this abysmal movie. For one, the general remark was that the stories were literally incredible and full of incredible clich√©s. The same is true of the dialogue with the lowest common denominator and able to offer absolutely unpredictable original features to zero. It was also terrible because Kane showed up to 3 different and different emotions throughout the film. Even the use of modern special effects failed because each proportion was easily distinguishable from its actual life. In general, I wouldn't even recommend thinking about viewing this feature because it will certainly destroy your life for 83 (not even 90) minutes.
