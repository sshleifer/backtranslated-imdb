I feel that this film is contradictory - it is one of the most beautiful films I've seen, and provides a careful look at the lost culture. The men of the cap and the mustache were sitting at the table early, where the woman served and played an accordion that brought tears to my eyes, just because she was alive, which must be incomprehensible to many. today. It shows the lives of the characters, which are inextricably linked to the life of the village, the second lost concept in the modern world. Symbolism is always fun, but it seemed a bit outdated. The deadly shortcomings of the film were the lack of dramatic driving and a complete lack of humor. I never felt that I knew any symbols beyond the basic universal things, such as the loss of a loved one, and so on. People were natural disasters, war, etc. in the director's tables. a tragic scene after another, without the narrative thread being involved and not humanity. As a result, it seemed very abstract, irrelevant to the lives of real people. Finally, I was too boring to watch it.
