I can't help but forget that the incredible scene in Alien, when the extra ground burst is one of the men's breasts. Or even in Predator, when the invisible monster fell into confused soldiers and cut them into pieces. Both films expressed interesting ideas about the mill's creation function. Return the road to cheese in the B movie era and see the big men in fake suits parading about people in small towns. Now realize that the two above-mentioned films have been revolutionized by this genre. Cave doesn't fix anything. It doesn't catch anything new and worst, the cave is not even a good gore. Shame on them, shame them all. <br /> <br /> Sexy spandex switching is one-dimensional characters in the cave. Everyone seems careless when they know the death of their colleagues. They just walked through the evil creature in the darkness. The plot is very easy to understand. So you have two brothers, a black boy and a sexy female scientist. The rest (the rest I mean all of them meet terribly) are even more unexplored than others. We have a Korean helper, a risky outdoor chick, a Russian scientist and two divers who have no emotion and are stupid enough to migrate themselves. This film goes beyond the cliché because everything except the black boy, one of the brothers and female scientists, is over. It also seems that only Americans can survive fear because of the death of Russian and Korean. Don't insult me ​​when I give away the details. Anyway, there is no real surprise. <br /> <br /> To make them straight, they find this cave. They're going to the cave. They stay in the cave. They're going to die in the caves. One of them infects the cave. More to die in the cave. They get out of the cave; just to find out that one of them has a parasite that makes them a strange monster that really doesn't seem to bother them. This is the simplicity of the empty plot. It doesn't even try to be original. He even has a part where they decide that their leader is not capable and divided. We saw just as many times before. <br /> <br /> I know in a movie that people don't care about performances, but it's worth mentioning how bad they were. Everyone is just that tough. Cole Hauser was particularly difficult and didn't get me to Eddie Cibrian, who is often much better. Morris Chestnut is the best thing in the movie. His power is actually decent. He depicts a man who calms everyone. All other participants are at best average. In such an exhibition it is not really bad. <br /> <br /> Now that we're going into this movie genre; of course. I'm sorry this action was boring. The scenes of death are all boring, the whole film of hell. There's little blood at all. This is whether they disappear and find later or attack and die without bruising. Seeing a Korean man's death was the only exciting activity I found. <br /> <br /> It's pretty amazing. Bad things overshadow most things that are good. A good example is to say that the special effects were well done, what they were. The only mistake is that because everything is in the cave, it's dark. I found it very difficult to distinguish between cave walls and monsters. Thus, viewing the creatures was quite difficult. Although I liked the special effects, there was nothing original about the monster. They were all like each other and they weren't scary at all. <br /> <br /> Cave stands for Bruce Hunt's director debut. I don't see what he was trying to do when making this movie. He probably made a big mistake. Almost everything about this movie, like a stink bomb. The smell of bombs is probably even more pleasurable than watching this mess again. It's only forgiving for the most forgiving cinema. I gave up all hope in the middle of the movie when I heard the phrase "what the hell was it" for the third time.
