The best thing about "Prey" is the label line ... "It's not human and has an ax"! The film itself is a padded stinkaroo .... endless insects and wildlife shots make the viewer die! This kind of garbage doesn't like any fan ..... Follow "Friday 13" again. and burn a copy of this movie! <br /> <br /> It's also rated as one of the 25 worst movies ever made!
