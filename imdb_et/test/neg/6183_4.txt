I've read all the free posts in this confusing half-poison and I'm amazed at what seems to be a brutal late-RKO assembly product in the 2007 brutal light. All of this endless documentary about fish, waves, fish, waves has little to do with the central conflict and just raises working time. Editing is completely negligent: scenes will end and they will be followed by other scenes with little to do with what preceded them. The dialogue carries the fine traces of Odets: high-metaphoric metaphors that would never have received the limited imagination of their workforce. But what is surprising is how terribly the triangle is everywhere. I love Stanwycki, but he screams and quarrels and lashes wildly - unreasonable performance, which is under the standard. Douglas, who plays lovingly, then goes to a murderous robber and, like hammy, like Ryan, yells and shouts most unnaturally. The less interesting second pair gives at least a recognizable human behavior: Keith Andes, whose character is today's Neanderthal, is still smooth and convincing when Stanwycki (much younger, one assumes) brother and Marilyn Monroe, if his girlfriend is natural and unaffected . The Monterey Windmill (and all that Monterey's footage, though largely irrelevant, is interesting as what the city looks like), all these in the midst of overheated hysteria, are the two islands of peace of mind. Final Point and Spoiler: Maybe Breen Office authorized it, but does anyone believe in a happy ending for another? Stanwyck may temporarily retreat to a obedient woman, but I give a marriage for six.
