The Time Machine version of 2002 is just the most frightening disappointment in the Hollywood remake that comes face to face, despite the extravagant special effects. <br /> <br /> What a lush, unspired bland story, without imagination. Why so completely rewrite such a wonderful sci-fi class? Is today's movie viewer H.G. The 1960 version of George Pal spoke a lot more of a pleasant story, even with low budget effects, with Eloi and Morlocks looking for a beach night, which looked like Smurfs on steroids. The 2002 version has to be in HG Wells' turn to his grave: <br /> <br /> 1. The idea that the timekeeper is motivated by the desire to change the past and the paradox of time is an old sci-fi cliché. It completely disturbs the love associated with Mara (what happened to Weena?), Which made the 1960 version so pleasant. It puts an early, unfortunate and disturbing tone that makes the whole movie shine. If the character of Guy Pearce were so brilliant, would he or his friend Einstein have understood the dilemma of the paradox of time? Don't have to shoot it 800,000 years in the future? no less than Morlock, Doh !! What's wrong with traveling for fun and adventure and curiosity - as is the case in the 1960s? <br /> <br /> 2. Only when you saw the first movie, would you ever understand what Pearce did with the timer when I first saw it. George Pal's film carefully explains the strange idea of ​​"traveling", though it is a 4th dimension. <br /> <br /> 3. The director leaves his way to make Pearce's character look like a geeky, old-fashioned stereotype of old scientists. In the 1960s, Rod Taylor was too small (at least around Weena) but managed to be funny, playful and charming. <br /> <br /> 4. Among the main themes of the 60s - giving up remake - is the idea that endless war leads to human bifurcation. Blowing the moon to destroy humanity is pointless - and it doesn't do much for science literacy. The moon has suffered a more powerful asteroid effect over four billion years, changing the look of a nuclear weapon like parsley. Yes, science fiction needs an artistic license, but it's just plain and pointless. <br /> <br /> 5. Destruction of a Time Machine is also stupid. Obviously, our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to amplify this thing. Breaking the machine to kill Morlocks is a kind of machine ex machina. Disappointed, Pearce will never come back to the 1800s to tell his story to his incredible friends who are the main part of Wells' story. week goes by and far. <br /> <br /> 6. Since Morlocks runs around the day, it completely destroys H.G. Wells is a marvelous horrible image that depicts them as shady beings at night. The real kinematic opportunity was lost. Wells also depicted Eloi as weak and childlike. These guys in the movie saw they could take Morlocks if they weren't such big baby products. <br /> <br /> 7. One wise Morlock? a sort of bleached Star Wars Evil Emperor - had the potential, but he is so flat and aside that he tells Pearce that he's going to get his machine and go home? Boy, that is a dramatic high point! In the book, Morlock steals the machine because they are so fascinated and struggling to keep it. <br /> <br /> 8. Sandstone Hologram N.Y. there is too much public library. It illuminates the idea of ​​human cannibalism. The 1960s version had just "tongue rings" that gave mankind a coolly frightening eulogy. Non-tracked evolution is a serious thing. <br /> <br /> The sad wonderful effect of this movie can never compensate for the tired, processed clunker of the script. Save the cost of a ticket and popcorn and go out for a DVD when it comes out (undoubtedly soon), at least you can think back and forth about stupid parts like our traveler.
