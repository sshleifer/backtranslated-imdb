With Pep Squad averaging 4.7 IMDb.com, it is no wonder that Steve Balderson is devastating this website. However, the fact is that Pep Squad is a badly designed "black" comedy (both words in quotation marks for a reason). This is a movie full of super-active (Cherry, Beth's Mother) with a couple of lethal performances (Beth and Julie's boy). A movie where you can track cars at twenty feet away in a terrible red Jeep and never notice it. A movie full of non-so-appalling splits and nudges that make you think, "Does the director think it's funny? Or smart?" Most importantly, the characters are both paper-thin and poorly developed, so the film becomes quite unpredictable, but probably not expedient. Pep Squad can't decide whether to be a comedy, drama or satire (patriotic music, I'll get it ...). The film is not serious, because the idea that a school position (that is, Prom Queen) kills, goes beyond the madness (not to mention flag burning and riding pictures, a bad attempt to be controversial and sharp) and can't be comedy for all forced and clumsy jokes (big ass, "funky" black main and excessive bullying, which the main form has poorly delivered). Watching the documentary "Wamego: Making Films Everywhere" made this film more respectable, thanks to ... the director and director's father praised it hmmmmmm. Not a black comedy or anything on this issue. I think Kansas must wait.
