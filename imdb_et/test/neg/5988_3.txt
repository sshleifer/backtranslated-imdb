SHRIEKER is a full moon production. I knew what to expect (very low quality), but I didn't expect it to be as painful as SHRIEKER had to look at. <br /> <br /> It's just terrible. Bad behavior, confusing script and direction. Annoying signs I wanted to kill. The whole thing was probably done in one week. I've seen CHARMED episodes that were more complicated and convincing than cheaper. It was a chore to look, and I felt my mind turn darker and darker for a minute. Watching a movie shouldn't be that hard work.
