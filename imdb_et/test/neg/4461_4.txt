The idea of ​​bringing Dracula to modern times is not bad - it can finally bring the series a little bit again by injecting a new story into a series of elements that Hammer has all but exhausted, long series of amazing movies in general. As it was tough at the beginning of the 1970s, the results were pretty stupid and seemed like LOVE AT FIRST BITE (deliberate comedy). Seeing Christopher Lee in the 70's hip-lingo and electric guitars and ridiculous rock music just seemed stupid. What's even worse is that the action here is much higher than the "intensive and silly performance" by Johnny Alucard. I also thought it was really funny that Van Helsing's granddaughter noticed that "Alucard" was "Dracula" written upside down - no one thought of it! Oh, what crazy! <br /> <br /> So since so much movie was bad, why did he still earn almost a respectable score 4? Well, when the story came to the expected display between Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) and Drac (Christopher Lee), it was exciting and ended very well. In addition, and I know it sounds very sexist, but if I had to watch a bad movie, at least in Stephanie Beacham's character, she wore some really nice clothes that showed her a lot ... "talents", so to speak. So it was at least nice to watch the movie. By the way, the movie ends with the phrase "he can rest in peace in peace," although it was not the final Hammer Dracula film with Lee. He returned to "Dracula Satanic Rituals" only in a short time and it was even worse in many ways than the monster movie.
