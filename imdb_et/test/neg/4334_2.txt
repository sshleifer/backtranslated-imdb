The evil bikie gang in this film was called Savages, so the title, but the small inconveniences would have been a better name for the weak participants who were trying to look dangerous. When they wanted to kill someone, they rode their bicycles very slowly so their victims could easily avoid them or push them out of their bikes. Their leader was bad, but he thought he could take and win the hero. As for Karen Black, she didn't know where she was for most of the film.
