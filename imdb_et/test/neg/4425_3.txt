As many have described in detail here, I find it funny, it's not *: <br /> <br /> A FILM. (cue dramatic music) <br /> <br /> It's just so bad, it's good, totally surreal, Jackie Chan's stunt-for-all. Women's fighters are completely shocked and Jackie is definitely placed over her. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you want to see with good friends on Sunday afternoon - surrounded by munches, ready to laugh, laugh with good guys, against bad guys, and constantly yelling, "WHAT?" if something totally odd happens. Fun!!
