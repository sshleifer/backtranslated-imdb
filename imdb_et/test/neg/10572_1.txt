I went to some of my friends and one of my mother's mothers, thinking that it would be a good opportunity to start the spring break, but the film turned out to be terrible. We all agree we shouldn't have had PG-13. Similar to R material. A lot of sexual dialogue related to the parts of boys and girls (below the waist). No time or money. We strongly advise you not to go and rent if it comes out. When you finally reach, do not take smaller children. Not a family-type movie! If you have curious content, check out the tips on the content of the IMDb Superhero movie page. Most funny content was extremely crude. Especially when they make fun of Steven Hawking.
