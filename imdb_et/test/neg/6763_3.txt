Jeff Morrow is Leslie Gaskell, Barbara Laurence is Vera Hunter and John Emory is Hubbel Eliot. Together with other air force personnel and comic geek, they are responsible for the super-secret underground lab on the west coast. Morrow is excited about discovering the meteor passing through the atmosphere, but not over if the meteor decides to sink to the Pacific Ocean and will create an excellent machine off the Mexican coast. , the blocking structure is. Obviously, this is a kind of carpentry because it is all made at a right angle, with a bald sphere halfway. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the machine, crowned in Kronos, is on a remote planet and has been sent here to abduct energy. You see, here on earth, we have learned how to transform the substance into energy, but on the planet of Kronos they have found the other side of the equation - how to make energy into matter. And now they have run out of energy on another planet. Have you taken any notes on this? Good. <br /> <br /> You may be able to fill in some of the scientific questions raised by the Kronos mission. For example, if Kronos builders can convert energy and vice versa, why don't they just convert little of their free material into energy, instead of sending complex machines to delete LA lights? But it is doubtful that writers could explain it. Reversing the polarity of the two antennas is described as "anthropogenic transformation", which means "interpersonal change" that does not make sense. But it does not seem that any science would make sense for this issue. The chart that Morrow brings to the table is in the wrong direction, from positive to negative. <br /> <br /> The Kronos movement is also a problem. He travels along the coast, threatening "inhabited areas" (read in Southern California), but it does not have two or three feet joints. These stumps just dragged slowly up and down, pushing some people. The film does not do a lot of these crushed people. They are shown as peasants in Mexico, so they may not read too much. USAF disappears a hydrogen bomb to Kronos - while it is in Mexico, think about you. Nobody raises the brow. <br /> <br /> Not much action is required and not much. Jeff Morrow has a clear and resonant voice that is great for radio or TV voice transmissions. His face is less expressive. He has only one expression, no matter what the situation is - a tight smile, as if he had photographed at Universal Studios Tour. Barbara Laurence had a good, golden quality of "street without name" a few years earlier. She was thin seventeen as a wife of Richard Widmark. Here, his care and behavior reduces him to the level of the B-film actor, although he is still beautiful. It is always good to see Morris Anchor in one of these films. He has done so much, I get confused. <br /> <br /> All over the place, I'm afraid. (However, there are some nice B-47 shots on the flight.) Sets show a small budget company. This is not bad in itself, but it is not possible to make up for the harsh settings. A little bit of tension in the script, there is no display of the productions or little effort made by the performances. <br /> <br /> Maybe you can get out of it - relaxed high - because it's clearly undisputed. It's just that there are so many better movies.
