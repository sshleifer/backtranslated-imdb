There was a time when Joel Schumacher was pretty high on my list of favorite drivers. In the late 80s and early 90s, when his name was added to several big films, such as "The Lost Boys", "Flatliners" and "Falling Down", he was truly one of Hollywood's most talented directors. The unfortunate results of "Batman" then came and then it seemed that any potentially overwhelming scenario would become a huge mess in Schumacher's hands. Both "8MM" and "Phone Booth" could have been much better films, and even the incredibly glamorous "Number 23" should have been processed into a somewhat more convincing and fun movie. From the beginning to the end of the word, "The Number 23" is desperate and mysterious thriller, and therefore uses all the harsh clich√©s from the great cinema history book, including hard-to-tell stories, setbacks, irregular structure, multi-plural characters that grow increasingly absurd and sinister asylum provisions. However, nothing helps simply because of the mood of the basic formula and the involvement of the cast and the team clearly unbiased. As much as you try to relate to a leader figure and be open to crazy theories, it is still two-digit and two-digit numbers are not scary. Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey's Rare Non-Comic Role) is a boring animal trap whose wife, Agatha, gives her a strange book on her birthday. The book talks about all the devilish theories and strange coincidences associated with number 23. Walter almost immediately identifies the main character of the book (a buggy detective who investigates grievous suicides) and begins to find many examples of 23 mysteries in his personal life. I did some research with Google and Wikipedia, and apparently this nonsense of all 23 numerology really exists and some people honestly believe that most of the disasters and accidents are directly related to this evil number. Well, is it just ?? crazy! But hey, I'm not here to evaluate people's beliefs and fears, no matter how they are demented, and I can only share my humble opinion of a film based on challenging cunning. "Number 23" is not seemingly, despite a number of gloomy pieces and unpleasant effects of makeup, and you will never be able to think about the role of numbers in your life at one point. All the cast members have their usual abilities down, but it was a pleasure to see that beautiful Mrs Virginia Madsen was again in a relatively big production. It is definitely not advisable if you are looking for a thriller and horrible evening of the thriller in a fun but lasting way and not completely without merit.
