It was obviously a pretty low budget, but the cast was fairly decent, the main premise was a promise, and it could have done more, but the script wasn't that big - the plot is inconsistent and looks almost random and the dialogue is dirty and terrible. <br /> <br /> In principle, the girl's father has been attacked by other gangsters, and later he becomes a kidnapper and wants to get his death off and then the mob attack involving corrupt politicians. <br /> <br /> Alan Ladd gets the most bills, but she has a really small role. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I find this to be an entertaining hokiness in my archaic class B, but it's really dirty and pathetic.
