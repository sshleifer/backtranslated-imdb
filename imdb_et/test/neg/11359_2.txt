This movie is really bad, trying to create scientific explanations about zombies always by taking the credibility of the film's history. There are so many things I could mention about the film so I could almost write a book about how much the movie sucks. For example, there were 50 people on the plane, they killed 100, and they came on, probably "virus" will cause liver complications because everyone had yellow eyes. only regenerates the tissue, because it also gives supernatural strength, not to mention that this virus breaks human hair. It is also important to note that if you release someone with a gun (probably only on airplanes), this person will be thrown back into the air. Remember, when you send a prisoner on an airplane and you lose him, always look at the size of the bottle inside the drawers and cabinets, you never know where these bastards are hiding. And if you can, in any case, land a mountain full of zombies and survive (happen all the time), after killing dozens of people, just walk on the plane, watching the sunrise and making a flight of getting to know the fun of flying. :)
