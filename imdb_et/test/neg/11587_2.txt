Laughing would be a good concept to describe this movie. But since this film does not deserve any good, I use the term "god-terrible". <br /> <br /> Environmentalists' adventures exploring the vicious acts of the military in a semi-tropical island show a lack of a quick budget. Michael Pare (real actor! But only in the sense that Pinocchio was a real boy ...) guides stupid attacks through the monster-and-gobble-unhappy victim scene. Pseudo-science has some vague attempts to explain the existence of giant reptiles, but it persuades the spectator both the actor and the actors. <br /> <br /> As if the viewer was not offensive enough, the film also has what I call "endless ammunition weapons". I never saw Mickey Parrot or his female balloon clips at all during the movie, but I can report positively that they are at least 40 rounds everywhere they need to shoot their weapon. Forty rounds may not seem so much, but we're talking about standard weapons here. Figure 15 is a round clip, tops. And remember that they don't change clips or even see any additional AMMOs. <br /> <br /> This is like the one that sends the films to the celluloid hell for an eternal fire and rightly so. The third rate CGI does not help things and works best to laugh, otherwise you start to cry. Why SciFi Channel has repeatedly broken that someone has guessed it. <br /> <br /> My advice .... give it a wide width ... a very wide bed!
