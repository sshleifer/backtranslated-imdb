Bad editing, bad product values, poor consistency, incredible, bad dialogue ... this movie is bad, bad, bad. But if you want to have a movie (la MST3000), this is your movie. I don't want to spend a lot of money on this, but when you see this movie, make sure it's with lots of smart, like-minded friends.
