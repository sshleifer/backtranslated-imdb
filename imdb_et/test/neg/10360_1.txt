Yes, I admire this independent spirit, but it's like a Road Trip with a bad cast and not a budget. <br /> <br /> I'm laughing when I look at American comedies, I'm not laughing. This movie made me laugh, but only because of the obvious attempts to simulate a high-budget American high school / pot-flick. <br /> <br /> If you want a good independent American comedy with a pot reference, look at Kevin Smith or Richard Linklater tends to or something. Don't waste your time on this movie piece. <br /> <br /> I mean, how can these comments be taken seriously when most people complain about a sign that fails to punch! And by the way: in Norway it is called "the guy with my pot"!
