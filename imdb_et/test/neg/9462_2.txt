** Spoiler * This gives a very insignificant end ** <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this movie, the gore film master was H.G. Lewis brief introduction to the gore world. He talked about how this film was lost and then found years after the director's death. He also talked about how gore films were measured by the amount of asthma used in it. Blood Feast had 2 gallons, 10,000 maniacs were 5 gallons. But then he goes and claims that Dr. Gore was 15 gallons. I want to know where half of the 15 gallons went. When I watched the film, I saw very little close to 15 gallons. It was agreed that the blood was quite large but not close to 15 gallons. Some splitting scenes were certainly pretty nice and realistic, meat structures and everything, but I wouldn't say 15 gallons. <br /> <br /> "END !!! ENNNNNNNNDDDD !!!" Does it seem familiar? It should have been said near the last half of this movie. After the Igor character was introduced into the acid bath, the film slowed down for painful indexing. There was no coordinated end because it didn't fit within 90 minutes before it came out. He drove in a car where there was a stranger, BIG DEAL! This happens when you keep an individual (I don't say a person because he doesn't qualify as a person) who is very innocent of the world around him. The doctor teaches the girl that the man must be loved so that everyone he meets loves him. <br /> <br /> Although HG Lewis told us at the beginning of the film that we may not work, management, or even gore ... I'm going with options A and B. It was enough to give me bad dreams of cut editing and people who had a one-time talk. But I made it through the film and came stronger. Too bad I couldn't do the same after finishing ROBO C.H.I.C.i. <br /> <br /> It was a BAD movie. Usually I can take my vinegar doses in a good step, but every time you get it, you get a movie that bites. I think this movie pulled a hand or a leg (haha ... * sigh *). I testified that I enjoyed the wonderful scenes where a good doctor looked at his future victims and opened his eyes really wide and looked easily. It was very similar to Fuad Ramseys in Blood Feast when she looked at this woman in her catering house and didn't use her power after that. I think this movie will rise where Fuadi's powers were gone. <br /> <br /> * Final Judgment * Movie should be lost. Good day <br /> <br />
