No, * Hitch * is definitely not a romantic comedy about the former left-bundle-turned-reactive-dwarfs Christopher Hitchens, although it would certainly have made for a more fun movie. A tiny little english, teeth were smeared from cigarettes and from Guinness to blacks, asking for advice - and an acerbic political comment - to gracious men: "Look at his EYES when you talk to him, nutter! And remember: calling someone's" neo "- conservative de facto anti-Semitic! Don't you get any straight, liberal pantyhose? "<br /> <br /> Well, instead, we'll get Will Smith, whose continuing success is at least a mystery to me. a more powerful man: Americans just can't throw him money.
