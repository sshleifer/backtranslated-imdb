Was the drug cast and team members started before filming? There was a hole in the plot ... so big ... nothing could have done it. From the first scene, when the co-star is late for dinner, there were doubts about where he was and what he was doing? The break was over. Now it went 85 minutes before the mind was solved. I have to admit that the biggest hole in the plot kept me awake, wondering how the scriptwriter, director Chrisian Slater, Molly Parker and Stephen Rea might have at least explained how our murderer, who was not a lawyer or a cop, could go to jail in a locked cell, kill your other victim and bind him out of the ghost to look like suicide? I was still wondering if I had fallen asleep from eternal boredom and how it happened. If anyone can explain this to me, please ... and then why, for God's sake, did he kill the third victim? Nothing was sensible ... and yet, someone thought that this film was worthy of being the official choice for a film festival. Maybe it was a comedy and I couldn't laugh.
