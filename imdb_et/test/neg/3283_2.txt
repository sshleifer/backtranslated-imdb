If you haven't seen the "Civil War", let me tell you what you are missing. It shows ethnic diversity and sexuality that could only have been nervous and funny in the 60s. If America has grown by accepting race, sexual preferences, religion, etc., it seems that this show is progressing. This is a retrograde step back into American evolution. <br /> <br /> For example, one of the current jokes is that a WHITE daughter is a BLACK boy at school. It's obviously fun to see how you don't see this type of relationship in any of the shopping centers in America. I've been living in small towns and big cities, so don't give me some sort of red state, blue country apology. It's not just a joke, but a father who is said not to be racist finds it distracting and asks his daughter to repeatedly break with his boy, which is against his "he may seem like a racist, but he's just stupid". <br /> <br /> If this is not enough, the second running joke is that one of the sons and soon the subway sexual is unclear in his sexual orientation. Audience learns over and over again that he is not gay, but his father is not convinced that he is constantly avoiding his son, fearing that his son will hit him, because all gay men are nymphomaniac savages who can control their will. The Father has always accepted his son once, during the exhibition, but he usually continues to do so in the next episode. <br /> <br /> The only way to treat this show in my eyes is when the constant contact to open these "unnatural events" slightly open up the father's eyes, but it may be too much to ask - and more like those jokes like I, I am sure we have fun episodes - Episode 13, "Father Votes Against Voters of Women" and Episode 14 "My Muslim Neighbor is a Terror". <br /> <br /> Please push this show, FOX. We live in a different world when your death increased.
