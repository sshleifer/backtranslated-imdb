NBC should be ashamed. I don't allow my children to see it. I would definitely say to my church. This film is evidence of why NBC has always been a tertiary network. Producers, actors and writers should look for their knees and ask God for forgiveness for making this fiction. There were no pirates. Noah's wife does not parade the ship deck. The ship had no deck of NR. Lot wasn't born even when this event happened. Does anyone involved in this project try to read the Bible? More than two animals were taken from each type. Read the story of Genesis. How could anyone bring it to any screen, small or big!
