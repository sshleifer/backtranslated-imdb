This movie is ridiculous. "American Film" is a boring document that tells a bored man so common that you can find equivalent things from almost every angle in America. It will take a long time, a hard look at the man who has failed for almost any independent film making. If his failures were other than his own selfish exercises or they were in the name of real art, then the film could have been. There are many better stories in America. It should be rinsed and many critics have a shame to be ashamed. Two thumbs really!
