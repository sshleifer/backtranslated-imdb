Man, I went to this movie because of a big preview. It seemed to have a great story and nice special effects. <br /> <br /> My boy was wrong. I wanted to quit the theater because of their terrible special effects. Cartoon dino, cardboard would do even better work. The story was good if it was taken by a big movie producer. Who would have more money to make more impact on life. The only thing I liked about this film is where plants grow everywhere. <br /> <br /> Even worse, cars in one scene run 2 characters on the street. If you look at these cars, you can see a taxi, a car, a motorcycle, a tri-pod, a big bus. And about 4 times in a row! <br /> <br /> And then there is a "butterfly death" that would make all "evolutionary changes" move on. If this guy hasn't stepped into the butterfly, the next dino would have eaten it! So it's an absolute bull. Then, when you change something in the past, the future is different at the same time. Not in the "waves of time" they did. But hey, if the future changed in a second, the film would be even worse, but more realistic. This is just one of those movies you should see if you want to laugh. I spend a lot of money on this movie in the theater. And then they tell me that the budget for this movie was $ 80 million. WHERE ARE NO MONEY GO?
