There are many secrets in life. For example: Why does someone other than Carrot Top agree to appear in this movie? Why did someone spread this movie? Why did someone pay the money to see it? I think no one of these questions can ever be answered, but one thing I know for sure is the film, which is one of the worst with a big budget. It would be bad, but adding Carrot Topi's "humor" makes it even worse. The only entertainment that could be obtained from this movie is to burn it, crush it or otherwise destroy it amusingly. If you had sorted out every movie you made, it would be right between "Troubled Child" and "Biodome". Sufficiently said.
