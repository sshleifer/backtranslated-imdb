A disappointing movie with Walter Pidgeon as a hunter who goes to Germany to kill Hitler. When he is discovered, he is forced to sign a document stating that he was acting on orders from England. His refusal to sign a document leads us to the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> Pidgeon is back in England by the evil George Sanders and his cohort John Carradine, who speaks little, but again as always, the embodiment of personalized divinity. <br /> <br /> Pidgeon meets along the road along Joan Bennett, the latter showing a wonderful cocktail accent. <br /> <br /> The story goes down somewhat when love develops between the two, but again, when we approach the 11th World War, realism becomes a daily object. <br /> <br /> A short-ended scene between Sanders and Pidgeon is beautifully realized, but we know where that arrow is going. <br /> <br /> It's very interesting that although Pidgeon escapes from Nazi Germany, he meets again with the new Roddy McDowall, one of Pidgeon's many stars this year. memorable "How green was in my valley." When was green a "man hunt?"
