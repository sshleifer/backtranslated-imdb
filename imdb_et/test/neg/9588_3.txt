This film tries to hide the studio time in Hollywood and the morals of the 1950s. Guy Stone is designed to be a Rock Hudson type, but both script and actor Matt Letscher, instead, direct George Hamilton's smarmy, cruel, baritone-like version that changes the unpleasant character. <br /> <br /> Guy Stone is such a deplorable person that the audience has trouble wasting human skin. Unlike Hudson, who was sweetly brilliant, Stone is an angry person who consciously uses and then throws away sweet, beautiful young men who share their beds every few hours. <br /> <br /> Driver. Cartwright is very good, but the director doesn't know what to do with him. The mistake lies in a dialogue that is a bit clumsy, and the film suffers for it. <br /> <br /> Carrie Preston Sally owes more to Ellen Greene's "Little Shop of Horror". As written, Preston Sally has a good laugh but little. The new player Adam Greer will disappear for this movie. She can't act and she seems to have been cast because of her hot body and good looks. <br /> <br /> Like many recent films, "Straight-Jacket" is a "dramatic" comedy film that shakes up about two-thirds of the way through the movie to confuse drama. And like almost all drivers, "Straight-Jacket" fails unhappy. <br /> <br /> Despite the costly services of Skywalker Sound, the sound quality of the film leaves much to be desired. Overuse of the musical soundtrack also creates cluttering clues. <br /> <br /> The film failed to satirize anything in the 1950s. Unlike "Singin in the Rain", which occupies a great deal of Hollywood ambivalence with both sound creation and studio mentality about formula films, "Straight-Jacket" is not capable of portraying Hollywood at all in the 1950s. The same can be said about the general practices, social trends and fads of the 1950s. Compare the transformation of Guy's home into the home of the 1950s "The Shop of Small Horrors." There is no comparison; "The small shop" hits the nail on the head, while "Straight -Jacket "doesn't even know that there is a nail. <br /> <br /> Motivational seems to be random. Rick Foster should be a fundamental liberal, but he almost falls for materialistic Schmuck, like Guy Stone. Guy has a good status for several months, but when it comes time to go to Italy, he is in contradiction for completely unclear reasons. i Sally seems to be in love with Freddie during the party, it just disappears after a few minutes without comment. Rick comes out as a gay man of the 1990s, not gay in the 1950s. Indeed, today's moral creates this film - what it shouldn't be if it were a truly satirical look at homophobia in the 1950s in Hollywood. Saul repeatedly says that he is going to Freddie Stevens over to the federals, but never does - promising Freddie out of Guy. The graph "in" by Jerry and Saul has never made any sense, nor has Sally's sudden decision to blame. And while Guy has admitted that he is homosexual, it is probably not important and he will in any case reach a famous star and playwright. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the product values ​​can save this movie. Michael Pinkey cinematography is a pedestrian. Sometimes the film seems to be filmed as a game rather than a film (especially in the Saul office). Everything is limited to an average frame and the film is incredibly static. Chris Conlee's editing doesn't help the movie. Long scenes that could benefit from adding close-ups or viewing the perspective will not be cut. Whether this is due to lack of coverage or poor editing, is not clear, but the overall effect is to create a lethargy feeling. <br /> <br /> The film is largely based on Guy's home CGI effect, created by the visual effect of designer Thomas Dickens. But the CGI seems clumsy and hokey, and it is very noticeably amateurish. <br /> <br /> My general impression of this movie is that the jokes are cheap and simple, the plot is confusing, the testimonials are contradictory, and the note is distant, the satire is non-existent, the performances move over and the label is left out and the comic timing is gone. It's almost an amateur movie. It would be like someone in high school production and $ 10 million.
