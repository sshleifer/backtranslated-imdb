Hey, remember when Hal Hartley was great? What was the time. I would say that the book of life was when things really started to go downhill, but I say at least he went uphill. A film that looks like it was filmed with someone's mobile phone should not be a bad thing if it differs from an interesting story and dialogue, but unfortunately they are missing with Hartley's free, peculiar dialogue. Their spot is a tedious exposition of Christian times and a story of a modern Jesus packed in a holy-hip-modern world where everyone looks like someone from Hal Hartley's film. Although it rises slightly in the second half, it is never enjoyable or particularly sensible. What the hell happened to you, Hartley?
