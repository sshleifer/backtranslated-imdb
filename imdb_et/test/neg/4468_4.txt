Previews were so funny that I couldn't see this movie. I just got home and I have to say that I would not have been embarrassed with this movie anymore. Yes, there were times when jokes were funny, but stereotypical roles were painful. Joan Plowright is a beautiful actor, but the "negative mental" scene was just a bad taste. Needless to say, the laughs were small and far between the white crowds (I was one of the very small blacks).
