Fearsome acting with the worst special f / x I've ever witnessed. It is bad enough that I wasted $ 3 to watch this lean pike, but it is an hour and a half when I lost that I could do something like getting a root canal or volunteering at the jury. Drunk drunk couldn't even help this video. <br /> <br /> Indeed, I sincerely believe that I lost some IQ points with this idiotic reminder of "working"! Maybe I should have followed my advice this time. Never wait for a decent movie if it is written, staged, and produced by the same person, and is never expected to be worth anything from Jeff Fahey.
