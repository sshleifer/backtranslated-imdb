I bought this movie for nearly $ 2.5 on a local flea market. I thought the cast in this movie (Ice-T, Rob Lowe and Mario Van Peebles are all right) would be pretty good. Boy, I was wrong. This movie bothered me about hell. Almost every scene drags too long. The scene where Rob Lowe sings this girl and dances in the bar will last forever! It was one of the worst scenes I've ever seen in the movie. The rest is not a picknick. I think when they finished the movie, they only had a 30-minute movie, so they did everything 3x longer. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The current 1.9 rating here in imdb is on the money. It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Watch this color dry for 1.5 hours instead of watching it! <br /> <br /> If you would like to see better films from this director, check out "Mean Guns" (with Christopher Lambert & Ice-T) or "Postmortem" (with Charlie Sheen).
