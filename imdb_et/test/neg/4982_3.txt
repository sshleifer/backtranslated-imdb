Good things out of the first way: <br /> <br /> Underdog's voice was FINE. But Jason Lee himself is fantastic, not really surprising. He was partially acting shockingly well. And also Patrick Warburton, moronic assistant. Now it was an idiotic character, but he did so well, I really liked this character better than the main characters. His lines were childish, but wise. <br /> <br /> But. Alex Neuberger did terribly and hopes he will not act again. His "Scream" was so counterfeitly fake. Childhood. Childhood. "aaahhhhhhh". In the scene where he hears the dog talking, "oh no, impossible!" would have been sufficient instead of a pathetic false blow. <br /> <br /> And then there was a girl and her female dog who followed the Patrick character Cad on the roof. At first it makes sense, he is "Reporter". School reporter, but still questionable in mind. But why, why did HELL carry her dog? It was worthless and the fucking dog didn't say anything other than heartless "oh, underdog!" His presence was extremely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Generally, the script was pathetic. The only reason I give this film a 3 is the voice of Barsinister, his help and the underworld.
