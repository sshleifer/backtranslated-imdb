Well, some people can go see it to see the trashy rubber and the pvc-clad bisexual vampire assassin. If that's what you want and wear hidden clothes, put your teeth on the dots and think that the name Lilith Silver is cool, you can see a fine film. <br /> <br /> If, like most people, a balm dressed in a tattered rubber with huge cracking, thick makeup and bad fangs will make you laugh, this is one of the best comedies. I laughed so hard that I almost cried. Ridiculous action, dialogue, and drawing will help make it better than Dracula, dead and loving. Even the captivated lesbian scene is funny (how * did he make these boots out of it? They were stuck * here * ...) <br /> <br /> Don't look at it if you want good movies. See if you like terrible movies and want to laugh until you fall over ... It's not good, it's just bad.
