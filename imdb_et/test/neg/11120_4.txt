Apparently, at the beginning of 2005, the SciFi Channel threatened to publish the accusing photographs they had of John Rhys-Davies and said, "We have to mark you with another SciFi Original." The frightening thing is that he's really fucking in the movie. It really is something to say, because it is a silly SciF creature function; you have to feel it to be well-behaved. Unfortunately, nobody else is doing it. It's your stereotypical "moster-run-amok" movie on a cruise ship. Cryptozoologist wants to keep the creature alive, Navy SEALs think they have everything under control, but they don't know what they are doing, and they all die, the girl jumps Rhys movie "sexpot" Davies' daughter and the creature sinks about 100 people. What this film has done is very fast and lively; you are never bored or waiting to kill you. Moreover, it does nothing to differentiate itself, and it is stupid that this thing climbs over the ceilings and cannot be wounded by naval SEAL weapons, but it can be karat-kicked by Rhys-Davies daughter. Kinda went on and gave it to the bad boy 5, but for the above stupidity I give him 4.
