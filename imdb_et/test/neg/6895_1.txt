In about 1980, the name Godfrey Ho was associated with a series of small comedy films featuring the unlikely name of Elton Chong. â€œAlthough there are no masterpieces of the genre, they remain surprisingly entertaining for those who have stupidity. <br /> <br /> It is quite unclear why Ho (or whom) wants to make a film that would attack Jackie Chan's drunken movie, a film that legitimized comedy film making in Hong Kong. this is a wild attack on Chan's film (Chan's imitation, which marks the star of this film, learns to make his opponents laugh to death - a pointless trick in any genre). <br /> <br /> The shortcomings expected of Godfrey Ho's film - not continuity, no motivation, incomprehensible plot line, irrelevant and incredible signs - are all due to all this period, and the film suffers from two unforgivable flaws that make it unnoticeable: fighting scenes stink and comedy not t funny. <br /> <br /> Nonsense.
