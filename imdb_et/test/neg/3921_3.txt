Obviously, Pal's 'Destination Moon' and Lippert 'Rocketship X-M' affect the success it just doesn't do. Limited special effects, thin story lead to output that even semi-finished cast can not save. Just here is no credibility. No one seems to be surprised that we can meet the Martian, much like land, etc.
