When I saw Alien vs Predator a few years ago, I have to say as stupid as the sequel, but it was somewhat enjoyable. Now, in the theater, recently there were no good films in the theater, so my boyfriend and we just decided to go ahead and see what AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem was. So we saw it a couple of nights ago and I have to say that there was no excitement in this horror. The first AVP movie was completely different, it is not a bad idea that they took Alien and Predator and put them in the upper class neighborhoods, but the first idea that explained their existing reasons was just an average and predictable horror. Not to mention a story that keeps new scenes for every scene where I wasn't sure who to keep in mind, who was the main character and why, so I wasn't able to hold that story. <br /> <br /> What I have gathered is Predator and Alien, of course, in space, where they have to deal with typical neighbors, they just fire out and decide why not? Go ahead and take it out with some of the crops. So they break up and Alien takes over the suburbia utopia. But teenagers, including an anxious couple who look like Ken and Barbie, a female sea and her daughter, are going to make a room in the back, that is, the predator doesn't get there first. Since he is marked with an alien, I think the party without him starts, lol, just kidding, actually killing some of his friends. <br /> <br /> AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem is not the worst movie according to any standard, it's pretty cool how many visual effects there are, and the races between Alien and Predator are so cool to watch. Like the first Alien vs Predator queue, the cast film that destroys the film and it seems they are not well developed, I know it is horror, but the original foreigners and Predator films had characters you care about and wanted to win. But it was a semi-decent sequel, which I would say is worth looking for some fun, especially for Ken and Barbie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
