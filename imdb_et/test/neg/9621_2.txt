"MirrorMask" was a terrible disappointment for me. I had been waiting for a lot of Jim Henson's production, and I found favorable reviews compared to "The Labyrinth" and "Alice In Wonderland". Unfortunately, the film came to one of these "style over substance" film flocks. While most children dream of staying away from home with a circus, Helena is a child who has grown up in a circus (child labor, someone?) Who wants to join Real Life. Helena wants her mother to die, which is a bad move in a kidnapped brat with a princess complex in a children's fantasy film. The next thing you know, Helena's mother is floping and for some reason she is being shipped to another world. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I felt like I was being blown away by a blurry sepia-tinted glass with a contemporary art museum. <br /> <br /> The presentation of creatures and backgrounds created by CGI was first of all interesting and I liked the Orbiting Giants. After a few minutes it was still too tiring, and I felt my mind misleading ... <br /> <br /> Without narrative and MTV-style clips and soundtrack (sphinx reminds me of Basement Jaxx) Where's your head ‚Äù), I did not feel attached to the difficulties of the protagonist and was also disappointed when we waited for the film's management, wherever he wanted, hopefully towards the exit signs of the theater ...
