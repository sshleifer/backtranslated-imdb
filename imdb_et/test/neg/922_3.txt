A big band cast, but unfortunately, a number of undeveloped ideas make the movie drag and drop. Finally, it seems that he has not completed any conclusion, closure, or at least ironic twisting. <br /> <br /> It was a familiar "Curb" feeling that did not dare to say it, Larry as a tedious polar opposite. The music was there, the scenes of the show "show about nothing" appear, but without common threads or arbitration - it stops as a solo project that ended with a budget. <br /> <br /> Spoilers: The movie's title speaks cheese, but it prefers a rice bottle. Is cheese a better sales title than a rice bottle? It only prefers any junk food, regardless of the date of sale. Maybe I would like someone to eat pirate furniture "cheese-dogs" or ice cream would at least have linked some scenes together. <br /> <br /> Marty: It's not just funny and redundant. People just don't care about the show. The paddle station is more fun for the goblins. <br /> <br /> If you are not a big fan, save your time and eat cheese. It doesn't even have to be with anyone.
