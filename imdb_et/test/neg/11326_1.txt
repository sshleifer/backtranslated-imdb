Years ago I deliberately looked at bad movies. Somehow I miss it. No gesture is true. Facial expression is not suitable for a scene or action. I've never heard such inappropriate music on film. In the last scene, I was rooted in a car to ride on this ridiculous child, one of the worst child caregivers. <br /> <br /> Only one name in what I ever heard - Wilford Brimley. He must be very hungry to take this part. <br /> <br /> DON'T MAKE ANYTHING WHAT IS THIS GAME !!! You have warned !!!
