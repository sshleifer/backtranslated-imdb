A couple with financial problems will get a box on their door. When they press the button, they get a million dollars, but someone they don't know will die. Do they push the button? <br /> <br /> This is a strange film based on Richard Matheson's short stage with some chills but mostly a messy thing. The problem is that so much happens when the writer's director Richard Kelly doesn't know what kind of movie he's doing. Is it a straightforward horror movie with supernatural recordings? Sometimes it seems like talking about moral choices, death, and succession. Is this a science fiction? There may be many questions about the Mars project. And what are the odd prospects that people seem like a big conspiracy? Is it an invasion or demonic film of body wear? Don't know, maybe. And this is a problem with many questions, most of them intriguing, but there are too many. The little seems to have been clarified and when we reach the end of the film, it seems to stop more than the end (even at the open end). I want to make movies that are rich in themes and dots, but writer Kelly just fills her script too much so that director Kelly can't cope or do it so that every thread or plot gets her ten minutes of screen time and protocols holds the court before it is expelled. It made me crazy. (I can't get into two shades, Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, who aren't very good or probably don't know what to do in such ever-changing material) <br /> <br /> It's a tiring mix that doesn't work (there's finally too many holes). I finished and suddenly realized I had no idea what I just saw. I really did not like it, but it is more that it is not good because it just goes rather bypass. I'd take a passport or wait for a cable where it won't cost you anything
