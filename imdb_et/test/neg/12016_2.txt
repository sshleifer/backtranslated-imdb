Seriously! You just have to see this movie to understand what's wrong with it. It appeared at a time when everyone was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy (The Little rascals; Mr. Nanny, etc.), but he didn't have any charisma or enthusiasm. Every character in the film is driven by rage, except for Trixie's mother, who only shows the aggravation and fatigue, although the film is a tired clich√©. Simply put, the biggest mistake in the film was not action or filming, but above all writing. The lines are reminiscent of Disney's classics, although this film has not been able to pull out the whole heart of IL 'Walt. The junior's father (John Ritter) makes you crazy without doing anything, just because he allows the Junior to run unattended and only gives him a stern warning when he hits a 200-pound wolf on a chalkboard. <br /> <br /> Junior's grandfather is also particularly embarrassing. Those who saw the first found it nausea, and so did not see another, "Big Ben Healy", as he refers to in this film, is still a full shower. He is basically a barrier without calling John Ritter's house, living in a Junior room, though he says he hates juniors and does not basically do anything to speed up the film or support the film in any way. Rather, he hits the audience, being a lazy free loader. <br /> <br /> Finally, we introduce a variety of new characters, such as the cunning, unpleasant, Trixie, who carries the dynamite of his backpacks, which he illuminates for the first time, then the hands of a junior who just looks at his wide eyes. Gilbert Gottfried also returns to this movie, playing this reluctant principal at Junior Junior School this time. If Gilbert Gottfried isn't enough to get the point, I'll just put it on: This movie will be back! <br /> <br /> 2/10 stars because the actor's beliefs shine through the film, even though the script sucks.
