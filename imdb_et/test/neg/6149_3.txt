But then again, what is it? I found it in my local 99-inch shop, you thought it was 99 cents (plus taxes). I remember seeing this video as a teenager and thinking it was a cool flick. Too bad film and my memories do not fit. Regardless of the fact that it is not too terrible for a couple of hours to blow, and it's clean to see some vintage Bill Paxton and Mark Hamill. Blah .... Blah .... Blah .... Man, oh man, I can't say anything about this flick ... (Just fill the space to fill ten lines of the rule ...) Good golly is it pathetic how bad is the film that I would say the best about it, was there a way to text? So, ten lines of text, right? Hmmm, ten lines are hard to reach if you don't remember the squat you just watched.
