If I knew nothing better, I would have thought that the resurrection was done in the late 80s or early 90s as a crap sold in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why people like Christopher Lambert. He speaks as he shoots smart cards and becomes a fountain. He was just the weakest aspect of the film. The other participants were fine, something terrible. <br /> <br /> It's easy to see where most of the budget went: special effects. The killings seem quite professional, but barely do not reflect the boredom of the film. <br /> <br /> I don't go so far as to say that resurrection is a carbon copy of Se7, but it certainly has some similarity. By focusing on the religious murderer during the modern Crusade, the detective investigators must rely on Bible passages and Christian history to gather the killer puzzle. The resurrection, however, is se7enite wise storytelling, cinematography, acting ... well, everything that makes it good. Instead, the resurrection lies in the audience and uses the method of Scooby Doo's mystery to surprise it. <br /> <br /> To sum up, the resurrection was about as bad as I expected. I feel almost bad at criticizing this movie because I knew it would be bad, but ... dig me.
