*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS DOWN *** <br /> <br /> What a long and mostly uninteresting movie! Who were these characters? Why didn't I care about them? If I watch the movie for two hours, I'd like to take care of someone or something. <br /> <br /> We know that Salvatore dreamed of the wealth of the new world. Nonetheless, we learned very little about our family's hopes, fears, etc. because they started out without knowing the adventure. <br /> <br /> And why was Lucy even in this movie? He said little; we knew little about him or what he did (whether he was forced to serve men in return for boarding a ship?) or what his plans were when he arrived in New York. To those who might assume that he needs to emphasize the point that no woman who has been cultivated could escape to this country alone, I say that this is not a sufficient reason to give him so much time on the screen. This point could have been made in five minutes when Lucy was for a moment. <br /> <br /> More questions: Why wasn't the twin brother in a boat meeting with the family? We heard from the brother and some closure on this issue would have been helpful in making the film coherent. How long did you travel from Italy to New York? Given the conditions of the ship, the viewer is different if the trip took five or ten or 50 days. (Someone said something I saw a "week" at one point, but I think it was when they were already on the route.) I needed this type of detail to better understand what they were going through. <br /> <br /> The only scene I really liked was when a ship full of passengers left the dock. <br /> <br /> If you decide to rent this movie, do it remotely; You may want the Fast Forward button to be comfortable. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would recommend that you give the right information about the times and circumstances of immigrants, especially paintings, people walking, and so on. - This film can be an interesting public documentary.
