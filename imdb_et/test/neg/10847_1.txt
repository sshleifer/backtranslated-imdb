There is no reason to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Why? Many reasons. First, the actor is terrible. There is hardly a line that has not been misinterpreted, but it is not surprising given the dialogue that participants are asked to mouth, banal, stupid and repetitive. It is terribly written. One of the most annoying script-related things is that writers seem to be aware of just one way to talk about their characters for a particular point, and that means repeating the most important words in the previous character. "Repeat?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, they repeat it. For the whole movie." <br /> <br /> "The whole movie?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, the whole movie." <br /> <br /> Etc. In such films you usually know who are the bad guys and what they are after. (All good guys usually have to do to stop the bad guys. Good "Mwahahaha! Creating X at my disposal I rule the Universe!" The villain is the first stop on any cheap SF plot) but in this turkey? - You tell me. <br /> <br /> As I understand, our "heros" is the mass destruction that was sent to the past for a Dirty Dozen mission. The fascist totalitarian state sends them to stop some of the other massacres who do not change the course of history. The new history would not include the rise of totalitarianism and the war that kills 30 billion people and leaves the Earth's dead planet (we all know it because one of those handy long screen situations just before the action started) tells you who and who that is, what producers think their target audience is, that it is narrated and displayed on the screen - just to save the audience from charging their brains too much, doing so much reading.) So who should we take here? I think we are asked to believe that our hero carries some kind of journey from totalitarianism to love, peace, and understanding while photographing human burdens, but it doesn't work as an arc, because we have shown that he is a human (ish) person at the beginning when he tries Rescue all civilians in rebel stations. <br /> <br /> I think the makers have become more sophisticated than usual in this movie, but they just came up with an unhealthy mess with more plot holes and logical contradictions than ten of your average SF movies. <br /> <br /> The opening credit was nice.
