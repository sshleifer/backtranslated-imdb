Well, after the hype surrounding the film and after marking Suryat's film PATH-BREAKING, I went to the theater, waiting for something big. The boy was disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all, movie testimonials are so weird! What woman does what Kundhavi (Jyothika) did? Idiot, coo-coo one? And what was the moment of her childhood (Baby Shreya) standing after she and her husband fought? What was the purpose of this scene anyway? To start the vulgar shooting "Maaja Hunters"? The song was not only aesthetically preserved but simply not necessary in the scenario. NO OR ALL! Secondly, there was practically NO STORY in the first half. The whole first half was dragging FREAKING. In the first half of the film, there was absolutely no importance to the actual story of the film. And how did Aishwarya (Bhoomika Chawla) change so radically so radically? And how did the Gautham (Surya) and Kundhavi ways live together for six years, even though they were so happy to marry each other? And if Gautham loved Aishwarya as he claimed, why did he even marry Kundhavi, even if he was the desire of his uncle's death? WHY? This is the question you ask while watching a movie! And how fair is the end to Aishwary? After all, was he the first woman in Gautham? The film director Krishna claimed that she had been working on this film for two years, but her script is full of errors and leaves the audience completely irritated! Third, Krishna's peaceful imagination of Rahman's fantastic is disappointing. Surprisingly, Anthony's editing (usually great) "New York Nagarami" sings! The whole song looked like it was a slide show made on Microsoft Power Point! "Munbe Vaa" Rangoli's bark was wasted, showing Gautham playing! Who wants to see that this beautiful cream is a striking guy playing football?!? What's more, the whole film needed only two songs. Munbe Vaa and Kummi Adi. The other "Machakari", "Maaja Maaja", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kaadhal" songs are just not needed. Rahman's fine efforts are simply wasted on a stupid film headed by an amateur director! Rahman fans, you ask why Rahman moves to Bollywood. When you look at how his songs were captured in Kollywood, why did he want to stay here? Even more irritating is that after Knanana decided to add Machakar to the movie, it was cut to a song that was really and annoying. and packing so-and-so. His expressions related to all the songs are not as good as the singer sings. Did Jyothika even act in the movie? All he did was CRY! Would you call it all that cry? One of his worst performances! What's more, her new hairstyle doesn't fit her. Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadus saw him better. His costumes "New York Nagarami" during the song are far away. Bhoomika Chawla is great at the time of the film and plays a role. Comedy comedy is ANNOYING. If someone follows him, he wants them to hit the face. This is Santhanam, who is a stealer during comedy scenes. And why the devil Sukanya even agrees to do such a small role that only someone could have done? And why is he as hard as he has a perfect complexion? Music A.R. Rahman is just awesome. "Machakari", "Munbe Vaa", "New York" and "Jilluna Oru Kaadhal" deserve a special reputation. R.D. Rajasekhari's cinematic art is OK and not as good as his previous films, although "Kummi Adi" during the song deserves a special reputation. Anthony's editing is really disappointing. The film is just so striking and can be severely cut. <br /> <br /> The Krishna direction just sucks. Dialogues (A.C. Durai and Kishnanaa) are sort of superfluous to distinguish in particular the part where Bhomics knows love for Surya. The scenario and the script (Krishna) are terrible. The film is moving at an increasingly interesting pace. And the Kishnaripta script is just full of inexplicable subfields. <br /> <br /> And for goodness, why was there so much advertising in the movie? Pepsi, Maggi, Suzuki, you name it. Was the producer of the film (K.E. Gnanavel) low or just desperate for the budget? In general, Jillunu Oru Kaadhal is a damp rock. Such a title could be expected to be a warm-hearted and cool love story, but what you are finally feeling is a painfully loved story. Really, really disappointing.
