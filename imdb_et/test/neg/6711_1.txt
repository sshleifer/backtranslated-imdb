Two things have changed since then. First I am no longer a child, and secondly, most of the new Seagal movies are just terrible. This is, in my opinion, the worst film ever made by Derailed marked by Jean Claude Van Damme. There's no plot in this movie, the plot is just an excuse to shoot some terrible action scenes which is a painful look.I love action movies, but it is not an action movie .... It's not a movie ... it's not a movie ... it's a group of irritating scenes that are connected to a tedious way to kill viewers for love against movies. I'm sorry, but I have no respect for anyone who liked this movie. Seagal will make good movies in the future. Good luck to him!
