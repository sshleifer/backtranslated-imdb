I really loved the millennium series played by Lance Henriksen, so I bought the movie. Apparently it was a level of error. Mutant / monster movies are usually very bad and this movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> The basic idea itself is not a complete failure (although this film would never have been successful, even with a good director) and actors), but how it turns out is just a B-class movie. Scenes that should be scary seem more fun to me and the critic is not at all plausible. <br /> <br /> But watching this movie with friends in a peaceful mood makes this movie as it is so involuntarily fun.
