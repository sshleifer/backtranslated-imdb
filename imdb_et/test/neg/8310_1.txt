The residents of Bay Area are likely to remember Paul from The Diamond Center, an uncomfortable late night, who created light credits and cheap stones in the late 1980s and 90s on television. I just mention him because Death Machines is an actress who sees JUST LIKE HIM as the owner of an Italian restaurant. He appears in the best scene of this positively terrible and intact criminal drama with a dragonfly (Mari Honjo, who wisely hung up his film) who controls the local syndicate. Our hero (we call him not Paul's diamond center) is playing in the restaurant all the nuances of the Simpsons' Luigi ("you lika da spaghetti?") And it seems that one of his patrons feeds the food choices. No, there is no soup or hair in the sauce: there is a red Buddha paste, a business card for a murderous boss who sends a statue to each of his future victims. Death mechanisms are bad for any measure and pretty boring, which is even worse offense.
