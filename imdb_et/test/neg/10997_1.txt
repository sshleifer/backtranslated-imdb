I saw this cable. Someone had to lose their job to illuminate it. Just because the movie is done does not mean that it has to be shown! The Savage Instinct should be shown in all film classes. This is the perfect template for not making a movie. Editing alone is so confusing that you think it has been gathered by a trained (badly) monkey team who drove over the unbridled canyon behind the jeep, with eyes closed and drunk. Sound is often not readable. Acting? I can't name anything I saw here. Reciting? Hmmm. It cannot be called. Fail? It works. That's all said ... It's terrible! I cannot emphasize enough that in this "film" there is no other redeemable factor apart from the fun that comes from his own incredible injustice. Fun, strictly masochistic way. Look at this ... if you dare.
