36/100. It must not be confused with decent Arachnophobia, this film is a very small budget and the cheap destruction of this film. It is so bad that this level actually has some entertaining value. There are many unwanted (I think) laugh loud scenes. I didn't expect much from the movie, and it was actually worse than I thought it would be. <br /> <br /> This is a cliche that is driven and predicted directly on video disorder. Fortunately, it doesn't take too seriously. As expected, action is not a real Oscal caliber. Special effects are bad, worse than I would have thought they were. Poorly edited and the score is intrusive.
