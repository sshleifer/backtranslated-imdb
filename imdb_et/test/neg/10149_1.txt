I thought Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie until I saw this monster. My friends and we went to our local block and spent about an hour and a half looking for a movie. We couldn't find it because we've seen almost every movie we've created. We decided to look at the horror of low budget. We were looking for the most attractive cover with few clad women. Finally we decided in the last half, THE. We made a mistake. This film seems to have been filmed with the cheapest camera found in K-Mart. The actors were picked up by the Salvation Army and Steven Tyler. We just leave it to the imagination. The plot of this movie was ridiculous. SPOILER ALERT There is no shutdown at all when watching a movie. You will find out that all the events were just a dream. This film should also have been about 30 minutes. If all the cameras are still zooming in on the walls and extracts, it would be much shorter. All I can say is glad there was no sequel.
