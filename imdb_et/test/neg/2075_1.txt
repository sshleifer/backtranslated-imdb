This film has promoted a huge advertising campaign everywhere in Spain, after you have seen it, you realize that someone has stolen your money. Paz Vega is terrible because Carmen, she is not at all natural and she looks like she is doing a fashion magazine in all the shots ("the best" is when she is an Andalusian woman ... ... can speak Basque and smoothly, Leonardo Sbaraglia is much better than her than Jose, but the story is very slow, the plot is not working and the scenario is really very bad ... I think Penelope Cruz (the movie was written for her) would have been much more reliable and sexy Carmen. <br /> <br /> What a waste of time and money
