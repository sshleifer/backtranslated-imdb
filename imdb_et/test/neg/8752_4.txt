I love this movie. Although I appreciated it with "4", it is because the actors, plots and budget were all before the "movie" was released in the "B" universe. But that's OK! It's a fun movie that has a lot to offer! I remember what Leonard Maltin was saying about the "9th Space Plan": a bad film that is great! UFO - In the absence of an alien plot, it is based on the fact that this story speaks of supernatural (divination, buried head that looks for this body, hypnosis, etc.). Acting is classy, ​​the camera works in another class and the settings are limited, but the boy! what movie! This movie is available in the bootleg market. If you find a copy, buy it!
