Since it came from HBO and the IMDb rating, I looked at the first season of this series which waste. The characters are sometimes interesting but mostly comic. The range of action extends from a good average talent when the latter is highlighted. Not only the prisoners, but also the viewers should leave all hope for the cell door that this story is plausible; Violence, like most story developments, is a titrant and no matter what the morale is supposed to be delivered. If your idea of ​​a great TV includes writing, performance, and general product quality seen by SOPRANOS, DEADWOOD, or SIX FEET UNDER, avoid OZ. If you want to see the Disneyland of illiterate hare, see OZ. Such things give a bad name.
