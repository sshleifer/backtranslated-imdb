I was hoping for the best, but it just didn't happen. Financed in a very non-Dutch language, we still look great with style and pace, very similar to Hollywood. What I do not understand is how all these great advantages - the director, the writer, the producer - were still able to make this movie a very terrible picture. Filled with bad jokes, cheap nudity and actors who just can't speak [act] in English. Kudo is pulling it out, but what did that man think!
