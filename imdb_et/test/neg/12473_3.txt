At least for me. I've been following Mr. Almdovar's career since the beginning and I wasn't crazy about this movie. I think Penelope Cruz was unsuccessful, this type of woman she depicts does not look so good, she makes this character incredible. Also, the song scene was just strange. I can't get the point and lips synchronization was terrible. <br /> <br /> Like a Spaniard, there is another thing that pulled me out, accents. Why do people who come from the same place have such a different emphasis? The difference between the two sisters is significant and does not make sense. And the village? are we in 2007 or 1950? I found myself trying to explain to my American husband that many of the things in the movie are "old school", things are no longer the same. <br /> <br /> I waited more, but this time Mr.Almodovar did it at least not for me. I'm not saying Miss Cruz is doing a bad job, I say she doesn't belong there, not depicting that character.
