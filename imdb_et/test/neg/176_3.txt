The filmmakers try to paint the influence of Mondovis and Robert Parker as equal to the occupation of French occupation and fascism. But they never find a victim in this movie. We hear from wine producers, critics and distributors that the wine industry is growing, becoming more and more uniform. However, the film never happens to have led to the abandonment of good wines or other people who are not na√Øve wine spectators. If they want to pay thousands of dollars for dull wine, then be it. <br /> <br /> If it were a movie about diamond trade, where the dominant influence of the DeBeers company leads to human suffering, the muckraking style may be appropriate. But as it is, it just comes as an American, anti-modernization and anti-capitalist. If the filmmakers had been around in the 1870s, they would probably have protested against the grafting of American vines, trying to save French wine.
