There is simply no redemption quality for this movie. OK, some suits are OK, but they're not something you can't see, for example, Conanil. And what about Ator's hair? I can't believe it's part of the series! I say one thing about this movie: it was considered bad enough to make the right lamps by early casting of MST3K, and I recommend to anyone who is curious to see how bad this film is to look at the moral support of this movie version, if nothing else.
