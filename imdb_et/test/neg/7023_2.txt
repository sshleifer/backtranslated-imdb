It's a terrible movie, and I'm not even sure why it's so terrible. It's ugly that this trendy visual style of the 1970s, which may have seemed like a good idea, but which now allows instant recognition of the film as a 70s product. The film retains the story and songs that made the stage of the music a hit, but the songs are inanimate on the screen. But most of the time the film sucks because of the failure of Lucille Ball, who would think she could do something bigger than the character of life if someone could. She walks through a movie like a frightened actor who suffocates on her opening night, and the film sucks with her. Even Bea Arthur, who I bet was the best friend in the game, can't breathe the stink. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> Rating: D
