Jack Black and Kyle Gass play in their comic show at their fixed show, which is artistic rock clothing with satirical, barbed words. An ex-runaway obsessed with heavy metal and a lively, smoking beating on the beach, pretending to be a rock god, and forming a band (birth marks on both buttocks make a group moniker). Opening with a funny prologue, which entices the 80's Twisted Sister video, The Pick of Destiny is a fairly well-produced film directed at older children; it occasionally resembles nothing more than the middle-aged variation of the Wayne world, with joke-stoner-interlude and climate struggle with Beelzebub itself, but Black and Gass have enormous comfort (they also acted as producers, wrote the script and all the music) . The target audience will probably go to this, although the inspiration is a bit low, especially in the second half (almost the time when our heroes push the police into the student car). The music rules are much more successful than movie satire experiments and in the first 30 minutes, Jack Black's manic enthusiasm is infectious. * 1/2 from ****
