I was waiting for this movie, unfortunately I should have listened to my daughters. It should have been a scam, but it made it realistic for companies to respond a lot. Better, his co-star didn't get him back. Their son in the film was invisible. <br /> <br /> The life of the crime was flashing and it was the missing link in the movie. The movie showed 2 or 3 robberies and they were richer than before, where it went for me. no weight for the film. His character was not strong enough. It was just too many gaps to make it a smart and tense film.
