"Take Fame" and "You've Served" and bring them together and what do you have? This God is a terrible film made for a normal normal adolescent. The plot follows very closely "You've Served". Three ghetto-afro-teenagers, this time from John Water's Baltimore, live near the Peckers home! To finance your tasty bag of hip-hop clothing, they steal cars and deliver them to your local cutting site? /> <br /> Tyler Gage, one of the three black musketeers, hits the local Fame High School and is forced to perform janitor tasks. He meets Nora Clark, a 26-year-old white high school student, and finds that he is an Irish-American, with many of his black friends, Mac and Skinny. <br /> <br /> Like "You've earned," crime doesn't pay and Skinny, the youngest member of the trio gets hit by the Bad Bad Leroy Brown type, but it doesn't stop the music and heart-stop finals.
