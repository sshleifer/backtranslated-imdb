Years ago, when DARLING LILI was playing on TV, there was always a pan-scan version of the version I hated and decided to see the movie on the right wide screen. So when I saw this Julie Andrews / Blake Edward's cheap DVD, I decided to buy and watch it forever. <br /> <br /> A boy that's a terrible movie. It's so bad and on so many levels that I really don't know where to start by describing where and when it goes so terribly wrong. Looking at it, it is obvious to the fans of every movie that Blake Edwards created this adult vehicle for his wife just because so many other drivers had beaten the music with Andrews (MARY POPPINS, MUSIC SOUND, THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE, etc.), but also because Andrews got started with Julie's own productions of famous projects (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY, etc.) because Hollywood thought she was not sexy enough or glamorous. So Blake struggled with this dead to show his wife's strange spy story / war film / romance / comfort comedy / musical. DARLING LILI suffers from many individuals who never know who or what it is. Some specific scenes are good or effective, but as a whole, it doesn't work at all so it is very embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Remember, the DVD version is "director cut", or in this case, "we will save everything we get" from the flop of this notorious mailbox. By releasing a DVD, Edwards cut 19 scenes (19 !!!!!!!!) from the original swelled theatrical version into a smoother, yet significantly ineffective version. The film is moving together but it doesn't know what it is. We are 25 minutes and we still don't know what's going on or why we're watching what's going on. What spy is Lili? How strong is it? Was he ever responsible for someone's death? Instead, we look closely at the boring looking Rock Hudson who is trying forever boring looking for Julie Andrews. Things don't help much for the inexplicable reason why these two fall in love. Why does Julie fall for Hudson? Why did he and not the other men he dealt with? There should have been one of his exhibitions trying to get him back or trying to decipher his secret. This would have given us much needed contrast with the confusion. It would also have given us a great deal of trouble in the slow procedure. There is no catalyst in this story. <br /> <br /> The only thing that needs to be looked at is the cut scenes to see clearly that Edwards and the writer came up with ideas inspired by Andrews (and Edwards) past advances. The best (or worst) example is the scene where Andrews and Hudson follow a group of children singing in the middle of the forest. Edwards directs the sound of music. No wonder he removed it from the DVD. In 1970, this scene could have worked at a certain level, but today, the moment when despair is. Other elements of the plot are inspired by Andrews / Edwards' other films. The endless scenes of dogfights are inspired by much better MODERN MILLIE. Julie MARY POPPINS persona, who is "dirty" was created by the musical moment "I'll give you three guesses" when Julie makes a striptease on the work. The end, Julie's view of the birds towards the Hudson plane, is another sound of music music. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is confusing. Julie plays a singer born from a German father living in England and a British mother, but sings his (English) songs in Paris. You don't know exactly where the story is going. Some moments are simply poorly edited. Like when Julie and her "uncle" are on the horse. They're talking and talking, and then Julie bounces sharply. I'm like what happened here? <br /> <br /> Comedy bits are inconvenient and choppy. Every French police scene is pathetic. Where Peter Sellers is when you really need him. Action is incredibly stupid. When Julie and her "uncle" go to Germany on this train, the Hudson squadron on the train starts rounds of bullets, almost killing Lili in the process. Brilliant. What's also funny about this scene is two train holidays at night, but Hudson and his squadron arrive by train, although they will fly the next morning. There's one slow moving train. <br /> <br /> Musical moments. The beginning is the best part of the whole movie (and the reason I gave this movie 3 stars), but its effect is greatly reduced because it is repeated at the end. Speaking of superfluous, did we really need to see a dance dance, a Crepe Suzette removal scene, and a Julie removal? "A girl who is not on the earth" is OK even if it is obvious with bleeding, but this moment doesn't make any sense, because Lili sings the soldiers of this group in a French hospital, wondering how many soldiers there have been indirectly injured as a result of its spying? Romance is 100% incredible. Rock Hudson is too old and tired (see the museum scene). Julie looks enthusiastic as she is in Valium. But what really kills this bad idea is Julie's German spy. Edwards desperately wanted Mary Poppins' syndrome to bother her wife and believed that betrayal was a good career decision. As much as I like Julie, she is not Greta Garbo who pulled it out so beautifully in MATA HARI. Funny, even when Julie plays German spy, she's still so embarrassing and cute. <br /> <br /> How bad is DARLING LILI? Even after 37 years of release, Blake Edwards felt that he still needed to work on this DVD.
