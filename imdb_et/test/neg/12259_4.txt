As a fan of ZaSu Pitt's comedies, I thought it looked like it's worth trying. I was quite disappointed. <br /> <br /> (The version I saw was in TCM but consisted only of a Niagara Falls movie, Miss Polly's film was missing.) The talents of the actors who make fine performances, Tom Brown (Tom Wilson) surprised me I was the strongest actor in the show, but the focus is on Slim. Summerville (Sam Sawyer), who has talent, didn't show it here. <br /> <br /> ZaSu Pitts (Elly Sawyer) is great, but not big enough. The biggest smile in the movie is when he arrives under the table with Sami. <br /> <br /> The only movie that has any meaning at all for Tom Wilson. Margie (Marjorie Woodworth) is generally unreasonable. Although he is physically quite attractive, his personality and attitudes make him completely undesirable. Elly, Sam, and the hotel desk manager are just fools. <br /> <br /> Sam and Elly give up their honeymoon suite Tom and Margie in a crowded hotel. But then they take it back. Sam ends up capturing Tom and Margie in his room. Most of the film tries to break them, but Sam, using a rifle, always puts them back. <br /> <br /> Finally, the worst part comes. Tom, who is finally ready to flee, gets to the minister on the lower floor of the hotel. Now, the guy who, as I said, is the only one in the movie who has his head on his shoulders, suddenly decides for absolutely some reason that he must marry Margie. <br /> <br /> He pulls the minister up to the room he just fled, but Margie doesn't want to marry him. She gives her a kiss and now, after one kiss, she feels forced to marry. <br /> <br /> Finally, Sam has a nerve to tell Tom: "You were wrong with me," when practically the only line Tom had to be with Sam: "We are not married" to which Sam replied: "You think I believe that I believe it? " <br /> <br /> Idiotic.
