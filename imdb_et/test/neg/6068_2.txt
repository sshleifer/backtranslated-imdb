For the movie I was really looking forward to, I was very disappointed. I had no hope it was yet another Amadeus, but I assumed that Beethoven's most important imagination in recent years. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris's performance was great, but the story was so weak that the film just moved from one clumsy scene to another, without consistency. <br /> <br /> The only enjoyable part of the movie was my 9th performance and since then I could quite happily step out without finishing. <br /> <br /> I was very dissatisfied and I still feel that something important was missed.
