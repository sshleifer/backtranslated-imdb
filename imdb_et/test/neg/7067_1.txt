. . . and never see it. I've been watching bad sci-fi movies for years. I love watching bad sci-fi movies. I think that was the only reason I could look at this movie all the way. "Nukie", "Indian Superman" and this terrible "Fantastic Four" movie tightened to name a few examples. I usually have to turn my head against my wall when I have seen a bad movie to erase some pain. No, not that. "TDB" I had to hit the shoe in the middle of the movie. Temporary fix. I can't believe I wanted to see it. I cried. When he finished, I cried. It was terrible. It was worse than when I saw a * shadow * Wil Wheaton's "Curse" underwear, which by the way never looks. Despite the fact that Wesley Crusher is in its narrow white, it's just so bad. However, this review deals with "TDB". The worst part is that someone wrote this movie and said, "It deserves to go to the movie! It's great!" and Wayne Newton, Rob Lowe and all others cast, said, "Oh, that's what I want in my film history!" I'm looking at "Indian Superman" until the cows come home, but I never see this steaming pile of dung.
