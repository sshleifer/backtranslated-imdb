******** SPOILER ALERT ************** Unfortunately, 85 minutes of my life watching this "movie". First of all, we think it's fun that the producer came to the movie as an autopsy physician with a terrible, incredibly incredible accent - what the hell was that, Romanian? And how is it that in Denmark no one speaks Danish except bog creatures? (Note, Scottish Camp Director ...). ? And who buys bog creatures? Their pants looked like they were bought in the Banana Republic. Very nicely dressed for 1200 years. It was worse than Scarecrow Slayer (we didn't think it would be POSSIBLE). We were basically sending 75% of the movie fast, looking for some gore / death / scary moments. Not found. Hire a DVD to watch the 2-hour "Beh Creatures" scene. Who are these people? Are they serious? And filmmakers are like 60 years old. I think this is their holy grail and it is itself pathetic enough. <br /> <br /> BEST LINE from the movie, hands down: "Not a bad girl who had never been to school." "My blind grandmother with alzheimers can make a better movie.
