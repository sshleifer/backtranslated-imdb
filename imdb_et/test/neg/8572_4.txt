Six monastery students make unthinkable - kill a nun who was overflowing. Now, eighteen years later, the nun's spirit is back and retaliation for his murder. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is basically a shortcoming. That's more, but I have no idea what it is. The only really cool thing is the effect on the spiritual nun because I was quite impressed that I was a flick with a lower budget. I am also confused whether it is in English or not. Most of the actors are Italians and even the title here is in Italian, but they speak English in the movie (I think, or it may be dubbed, I still can't say). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the real assumption of the movie is pretty idiotic and the end not only makes sense, it ... well ... doesn't make sense.
