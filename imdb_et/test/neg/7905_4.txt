This movie wasn't too funny. It wasn't terrible either. Just a fun ride on the Soul Plane board. It's a must-have air service with kick-ass disco, a beautiful bar and pumping stewards. The plot takes you through the whole black (not race or color, but "style") idea with the same black humor. Sometimes there are some great rare scenes like when the main character uses a "normal" toilet in a "normal" plane. Check it out. However, there are balls and I think it is most of the nature of Soul Pilot. Look to find out who it is. All in all, this is a fun movie. Tom Arnold adds fun to his "cracking" attitude. This is one movie to watch while playing poker when you're drunk or just vegging.
