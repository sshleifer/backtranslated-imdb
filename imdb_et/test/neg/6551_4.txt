Another of these weak stories with the most forgotten musical numbers. Powell and O'Keefe, as fighting publicists, are quite forgotten. However, there are two brilliant moments. Hubert Castle is the most amazing rope watch you will ever see - his "drunk walking" wire must have the most outstanding balance on the film. He must have believed. The other is Sophie Tucker near the end of the movie. Her magnetism, her professionalism, her unique talent - well, charisma is not learned - you have it or you don't. A great lesson for all possible cabaret artists. Sad note: W.C. The fields in your last movie cam are completely forgotten.
