This movie got an excellent record on Blockbusters 'coming attraction' I was waiting for the release date, 08/07/02. The plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have secured the side splitter, but who is there; after "wall betting events" it was quite clean. <br /> <br /> It will never become a comedy classic, and I am afraid it has not helped John Ceses's good comedy reputation. Rowan Atkinson, now he was pretty funny, Rowan Atkinson's kind!
