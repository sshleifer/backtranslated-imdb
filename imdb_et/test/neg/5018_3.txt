Not a bad concept. I just wish they'd taken it in the other direction. This is a film that is trying to be interesting, starting with the shock that works for most people (brides with weak snakes). It is not funny or romantic, so please someone would change this label, and since I already knew that the best thing about being the best place and the million dollar industry, I wasn't really shocked. But most people don't know this, and I thought the film's emergence after the mystery was just disappointing, because it could have been one of those shocking eye-opening movies that would teach an unknown fetish, which is a very reality (Yes, I did my homework) hundreds thousands of people. So if you want to watch bad movies that you can dream about, how can you see them better when you look at them, then do it.
