I think it was one of those films whose director had not read a book based on whether it was not true that they were just a little similar. Certainly, it is possible that the big movie will be "loose" from the book and it was definitely the last, but not the first. <br /> <br /> There were several mistakes. One was that he was trying to be too much like railroads, probably because adults expect it to be the same author. The other is that he tried to be too similar to Harry Potter, to music and to over-setup. I have nothing against J K Rowling or the movies, but the book is just like Harry Potter. I thought Psammead, though very well expressed by Eddie Izzard and his character, was almost completely inappropriate in the environment. Perhaps there is something left here, because the comments on one's own books could indicate the inaccuracy of the adaptation. There was no need for additional characters, and today's special effects could easily be used to read the story as it was written, but they were not. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my two children, one of whom knows the book and the other is not. The one who knows, thought it was all right, but not as enthusiastic as the one who didn't. I'm not sure what that means.
