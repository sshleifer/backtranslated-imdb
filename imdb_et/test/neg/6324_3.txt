Ok, where to start. I can't believe how many good comments I read here. I watched it (year 2004) and I had to fight to stop the stop button. I decided to continue only because of the good reviews all read. After I watched it, I felt it was my duty to let the world know about it. First of all, it seems that the film will never start, the drawing line does not really happen until about 30 minutes before the end of the film, leaving the viewer to think when "it starts". "Revenge movie" because revenge doesn't start even before more than half of the movie is gone. In addition, the film is trying to believe you are apocalyptic Australia. I am sorry to show dusty rural roads on the side of the film and the curve of the letter on the sign does not convince me of it, even in 1979, it was not a science fiction. So, add it to a randomly placed homoerotic subtext and you've got one crappy movie (I don't have any gays, there was no need for it). The only good part was the first chase, good management, since it was 1979, and another good part is how he kills his last boy. So basically I suggest you watch the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes and you enjoy yourself much more than when you sit through all such things in the middle that can lead your eyes out. Don't tell me I didn't warn you.
