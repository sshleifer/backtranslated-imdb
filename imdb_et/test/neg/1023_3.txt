The amazing production and good comedy of George Clooney is unable to unravel Joel and Ethan Coen in an entertaining way. Depression-era journey back to yesterday with three escaped prisoners seeking hidden wealth, and inadvertently becoming a land music star! The film comes along but never builds momentum. This gives a great boost to Clooney's charismatic, Gableesque looting and also the artistic direction and the lively music of T-Bone Burnett. Otherwise, the scenario (by Coens) is not serious about humor and interest; the foci supporting John Goodman and Holly Hunter do not add any lifts and the other side of the film slides uncertainly to himself. ** from ****
