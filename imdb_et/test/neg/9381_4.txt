Although this film is allegedly autobiographical, this film shows very little of the psychology of the protagonist (resulting in a flat, fragmented characterization), as well as in large-scale historical processes, and my hope of either learning something new or understanding of modern Iran has not been fulfilled. Instead, I found my feelings somewhat faded because successive bearded Islamic villains replaced each other in a dirty, tormented, or killing casual prototype middle-class Iranian whose Western cultural sympathy was a patent (and whose release from the film was quite blatant). Understanding the film seems to indicate that it is the media market, because it is meant to support common, popular folk ideologies (ie "crowd entertainers"). <br /> <br /> What made the movie completely boring was his creative animation - a truly minimalist image that always kept the screen rich, expressive and unambiguous - not a little fetish for which I give some stars.
