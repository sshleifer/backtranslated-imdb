I haven't seen Ishtar, but I had an accident to see Kevin Costner's postman, it's worse. Perhaps the absolute worse garbage I've ever seen and when you look at my review of Moulin Rouge? it says something. The poor plot, the operation was inferior and even wasted (though, yes, Michael Keaton has been in some of the worst films I've ever seen), and this film has no redemption value for anyone with more than half the brain. DON'T GET THERE IS OR 4-YEAR TRADE DETERMINED because it is an insult to your intelligence.
