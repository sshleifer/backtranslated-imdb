"Mask's Son" is a terrible apology to the film. I went to see it with my friend and I wish we'd seen it instead of "Winn-Dixie." I have to say that this is partly my fault because I agreed to see it. Being a fan of the first "Mask" movie (Jim Carrey was fun), I had hoped it wasn't as bad as all critics said. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes of the movie I knew it was led to a disaster. A nasty and pointless attempt to be funny got the little seven and eight year olds who were laughed, but the rest of us remained unbelievable despite the screen. <br /> <br /> Finding a movie as disgusting and unsuccessful as I am surprising, because I loved "Scary Movie" and "Anchorman", two movies that many people I know found raw and offensive. But the thing is that "Mask's son" is not funny if you are not under ten years old. <br /> <br /> There are many CGIs in the movie, but it can't save that piece. Those who promised this film on the big screen obviously thought of its potential given the success of this original. Unfortunately, this is not the first smile, fun or excitement, creating the original movie mockery. I recommend renting the original "Mask" to anyone who thinks about seeing it. 1 of 10 stars is generous with this terrible mess.
