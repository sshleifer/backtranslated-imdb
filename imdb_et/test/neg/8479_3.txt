This movie is not worth watching theaters, I did and I did not like it, the effects of the film are really well done and you laugh here and there, but the story is very bad, it seemed that they had run out of ideas ? which completely destroys norsi mythology, and i think they forgot that the log powers worked only at night! If you are really watching this movie, don't go to this movie! <br /> <br /> They could have done more than they did, it seemed they just wanted to make a movie to show cool animation and effects
