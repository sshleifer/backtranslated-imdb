I'm glad it was the last of 40 universal mommy movies. The films had all the varied qualities and this film was certainly one of the smallest. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it is a very slow movement with a movie that basically has nothing interesting or exciting. Perhaps it would have been better if the mummy had made the entrance to the film earlier. Instead, the film spends its first 20 minutes again, explaining what had happened in previous mummy movies, again from 1932 onwards from the time of The Mummy, to which this film is the fourth mummy story of the 1932 mummy. The film never knows to find the right pace, and even if the film is barely over an hour long, it still seems a bit of a drag. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie does not help quite simple and actually very little interesting story. The film also feels quite separate. The first and second sides of the movie did not connect to each other and they seemed to be two separate films. <br /> <br /> At least Lon Chaney Jr is still there. He once again repeats the role of Mummy Kharis. It is too bad that he has such a limited time this time. Unfortunately, it makes it very interesting to do what is also a great ruin of the mummy character. There are even dozens of stupid actors in the film who play with foolish accents. It seemed to me so completely unnecessary that most of the characters had to speak with such an accent and it really collided with a rather annoying and annoying. <br /> <br /> Mummy movies that are the least worth. <br /> <br /> 4/10
