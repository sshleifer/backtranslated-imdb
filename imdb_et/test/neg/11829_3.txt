... and in this series, I've been reduced to amazing, warm hair. I remember my friend Marco, who got all the good lines in line? Well, in this series, one of his liners was put to shame by Mr. Freeze. Remember our uber-Evil nemesis Visser Three? He's a bald guy with anna's catch. Remember Rachel, "Xena, Warrior Princess" and Cassie, my sensitive and caring love? 10 (!) A writer who decided that the original characters were not cool enough for the TV has become a meaningless bimbos. Do you remember awesome, intelligent, and really pleasant cinnamon bunnies with a terrible surprising extreme ax? In this series, he is extremely annoying with Token Alien. Remember what a clever scam in our team was? In this series, our dialogue is so harsh and stupid, it is obvious that the writers sought the lowest common denominator. <br /> <br /> So forget everything you thought you knew about Animorphes! It was Cassie, who became an allergy to morphing, not to Rachel, thought the speech was * echo, and Visser Three and Ax, rarely, if any, appeared as Andals (no, he has nothing to do with the budget!). <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy. And I'm not lying. Jerkers are around us. And if you're unhappy, one of them can customize one of your favorite books or series or graphic novels for a truly terrifying TV show. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> "Finally ... a TV that you should watch." ~ (very bald) Visser three <br /> <br /> (r # 91)
