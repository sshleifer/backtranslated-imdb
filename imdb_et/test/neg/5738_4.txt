In fact, I went to this film with some expectations, not because I thought the movie sounded very good, but since I'm a fan of Italian exploitation art and cast, which sees Franco Nero and Telly Savala starring alongside Oliver Twist, I thought it must be at least interesting . Well ... RedNeck has one or two positive things, but mostly; it is a boring, inanimate film that is just as ridiculous as it is meaningless. The plot simply focuses on two criminals (Nero and Savalas) who kidnap a young child (Oliver). The story tells us that the child realizes that he has more fun when he gets a gang. Telly Savalas and Franco Nero are two actors who have proven to be able to carry the film itself on several occasions and have some memorable moments in this movie - albeit for all the wrong reasons. In particular, Savalas gives a foolish image of a "bad" criminal. The plot does not flow badly, but because nothing is interesting, it is not really positive and does not save the movie from mediocre. In general, I can't recommend this movie; it may turn to the value of some culture, but it did nothing to me.
