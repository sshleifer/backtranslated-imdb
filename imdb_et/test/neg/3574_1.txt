Recently I rented this movie to DVD and thought it would be an interesting choice because I'm from Northern England (Bradford) as well as interested in making a movie. It soon became clear that this film lacked a decent development scenario. The characters were weak and often stereotyped, and the story was no longer valid. The topic could be an interesting basis for the film. However, its appearance seemed naive and vague. <br /> <br /> The end seemed like he'd decided to be over - punished and satisfied when the filmmakers thought it was necessary. It seemed a bit uncomfortable and stupid and seemed to be in contradiction with the "realism" that was used in the shooting style. For me, the film's characters and the subject were dealt with in a rather difficult and clumsy way. It seemed as if the writer had already decided how to end the story and set everything else to fit it. <br /> <br /> Another thing I feel is prone to Ken Loach's feeling that the film had. I am quite upset that UK film financiers do not see that British films have more than "sharp realism". It has become an almost safe choice. The film is an infinite playground of imaginative ideas that is not used by UK filmmakers. There are many talents here in the UK. Unfortunately, most of these people do 100% of the time, or they go to America. <br /> <br /> Love + Hate would have worked better if it was reduced by 30 or 60 minutes and appeared as a single TV drama.
