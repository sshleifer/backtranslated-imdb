Hm. Where do I start? I usually ignore any rating when searching for an IMDb movie, because I think I like it anyway or whatever and I should at least give it a chance, but this time I would like to pay attention. <br /> <br /> I know some people liked it and I'm not trying to say they shouldn't. In some parts it was half fun. But if you are like me and you do not like watching cats who move around in under 20 years of age, random clouds of rapid movement, dogs that take another 20 minutes in cages, will be put into "exciting" music and close-ups face when people talk, then you could avoid this movie. The actors were either wood positive or at the top, and the film quality was terrible, blurry and grainy and blisser and not artistic. And I know we had to think that Carol was not just a crazy maniac with a weapon that put innocent people in this strange religious psychosis, but ... well, he doesn't believe me otherwise. In fact, I finally really disliking his crazy character. And what was the soul in the cosmos? I understand this is a fantasy movie, but come on. <br /> <br /> I say the angel was frightened at the end. It was the most terrible movie in the movie, WAY more horrible than Darth Maul's stage face demon. I give them props for this scene, it was good. But not good enough to actually see the movie. And the open credits were big, but don't be fooled! I'd rather have used that money to make the movie better. <br /> <br /> Bah. I wish I hadn't bought it even for $ 2, which I paid for, I can buy candy instead. : /
