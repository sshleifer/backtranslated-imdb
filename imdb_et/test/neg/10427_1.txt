and I've seen many movies. I saw it in the theater in 1989 and I still remember the sick desire to walk. If you like John Belushi, respect his talent or even the holiness of the cinema - this film has nothing to offer. This is mostly a pathetic exhibition for Belush biography writer Bob Woodward. As we see the progress of Belush's life on the screen, Woodward actually appears in a movie like a ghost. The most offensive scene occurs when Belushi is dying, looking up from his graveyard to see the author above him, and he says weakly, "Breathe Me, Woodward." All of them have to be mentioned with too many terrible things, the least of which is opening up, with Belushi jumping out of his body bag and getting into a taxi led by a guy called "Angel". I'll leave it.
