Italian filmmakers love to cut American films. All our movies and as often as possible. <br /> <br /> I am not saying it would be against Italy as a whole, but I would also like to point out that the Italian film industry is doing a great deal of damage by allowing such travestyes to see them seen by the world abroad. That's all I say. <br /> <br /> And the Italian people will no longer be seriously harmed if they do not leave the harsh punishment for those who made the "Shark rosso nell'oceano" of the world - which is really much better jaw ripoff (as you didn't know) . <br /> <br /> Dive into the land (Get it? Haw-haw ...): This huge monstrous swim that looks like an attack between octopus, shark and Steven Tyler attacks many innocent Americans (ie Italians) off the coast of Florida (ie, Italy) and intrepid, beer-drinking Peter (Sopkiw) drives out with his anorexics, a beer-runner and other beers whose main goals are to be eaten by a creature that kills mysterious forces who want the creature to be left alone or just to stand and be otherwise useless (and beer). or be the doctor of this film who defibrillates the deadly patients repeatedly (20, maybe 30 times in a row) without waiting for his blades to load (there must be one good battery there, doc). <br /> <br /> Then the monster ... brother, if you thought the "jaw" shark was fake, look here and remember right away. <br /> <br /> This is a film that has been run as a successor (Bava!), edited with onion-chopper, acts as an outpatient (beer-swilling) piece of wood and written by (PRESUMABLY beer-swilling) people who should never ever a typewriter, a film studio or the world's largest city. If this is the case, the makers of this film think that in this situation real people are acting, they have probably made too many of them zombiefilme. Or tasted too much beer. <br /> <br /> Did I have to say that this movie is bad? It's: bad as green cottage cheese; bad as the Hawaii shirt in the official wedding; bad as "Bad Theater" sketch Dan Aykroyd hosted "Saturday Night Live"; bad as Calista Flockhart Weight Gain Tablets - Get It? Well. <br /> <br /> The Mike and SOL gangs will repeatedly hit the head of this beer run and show this "horror movie" as it is: terrible. Although a certain European charm: it is charming if it is followed by Europe - preferably a beer swinging one. <br /> <br /> There are no stars with wet, dead fish known as "Shark rosso nell'oceano"; six stars for the MST3K version. ... and now, someone for beer? <br /> <br />
