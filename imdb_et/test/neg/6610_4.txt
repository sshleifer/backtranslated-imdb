Well, at first, I have to say that here in Russia, Rivia Geralt's saga is well known and loved. Andrzej Sapkowski - a talented writer, or perhaps even some kind of genius - created in the history of literature one of the most realistic, honest, cynical, and well-written fantasy worlds of God. And when such an amazing material comes into the right hands, see the RPG game "Witcher" and you understand what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> Vedmak Wiedzmin is a great example of the opposite. <br /> <br /> Lack of budget. Lack of leadership. Absence of a good script. <br /> <br /> These three nasty movie whales that made this movie drowned were alive. Action is good, sometimes even more than good, but God cannot save this project. <br /> <br /> I still have faith. I still hope that one day a new Vedmak movie will be created and the whole world will see the size and breathtakingness of Sapkowski's books. ps.s. But before that, Uwe Boll must be removed. Just in case you know
