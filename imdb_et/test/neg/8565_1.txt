First of all, excuse me for the title plain pun. I browsed the movies to rent another day and saw it. I heard something about it, so I picked it up and looked back and John Fallon AKA Arrow was a short little review. At this point I thought, "Well, if he likes it then I have to like it!" So I rented it and finally got to see yesterday (college keeps me so busy). Oh and I would like to add that I read a little about Arrow's review and it turns out that four of the four stars gave him a half. So my expectations of this movie went very high iffy. Well after seeing it, I agree again with Arrow (and it turns out that the comment on the quote was the only positive thing he was talking about!) Wow, is this movie smelling or what? Where do I start, why did he do it? Well, the film was, in my opinion, so weak. Not even cool gorebits excited me and if decapitation doesn't irritate you in the movie, it's bad! The people I hated a lot and from the beginning I can tell who would die and who would not. In fact, the film proved wrong at some points, but the worst thing was that there wasn't one specific sign I wanted to die for! What the hell? And the chemistry between the main girl and her with whom she met? Didn't know it. He was probably right there to be an eye candy and gave him an interest in love, otherwise I thought he was a waste! And as a horror blower I should know that making a "stupid horror movie" sometimes has to happen, or else the movie wouldn't be much, but the local ones picked me out! Hi? Why do you make room for a killer in a nun room if you should look at him? And this was done by the allegedly smarter characters not less. Twist ... ah, it would have been decent if it hadn't been done a billion times and I didn't have to get to this point for this movie! My main point: a stupid movie that sucked me into some of my favorite film critics. Jerks!
