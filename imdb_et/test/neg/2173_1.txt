They usually don't write comments, but this "movie" was special. I couldn't turn it off. I don't think I've ever seen a bad movie, but I was sitting watching. It was like a terrible car wreck where blood flowed across the highway. It was disgusting, but I couldn't turn. Where do I start? The film seems to be a sport thriller, but it is so ridiculous, it can only be a comedy, but it's not funny, not even in a stupid / stupid way. It's like looking at your relatives to try to capture family reunions. It's a painful look, but at least it's just one or two minutes. Another String went over an hour. <br /> <br /> Who participated in making this movie should not work again. Writing, managing, acting and everything was just terrible. The problem is that I can't describe how bad it was; you just had to see it. And I'm sure it will never be shown, so if you don't see it, you're lucky. I mean, it was just worth it just to give me the recognition of every other "bad" movie I've ever seen in my life. And for every movie I see in the future that I can't stand, I mean, well, at least it wasn't bad as another string.
