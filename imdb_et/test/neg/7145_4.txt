There's nothing new in this movie. Nothing you have never thought before is something you haven't heard before. In many respects, the story of the brutal murder of gay and human beings in a small town can be highlighted and this film has chosen the most demagogic and brightest. One of the biggest mistakes in this movie is that it's not a movie or a documentary. The director has used the transcripts of the original interviews and changed the actors as they did to the film. The result is weird. And finally, I read in earlier comments that people who do not like this movie are anti-gay. I'm pretty sure these comments come from people who consider themselves tolerant, but don't tolerate other people not like this movie. It's a funny world.
