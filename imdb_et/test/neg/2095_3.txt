Snakes on the Train (2006, dir. Mallach's Brothers) The woman is placed in a zombie curse that causes snakes living inside her. Brujo, who takes care of her, tries to bring her to Los Angeles on the train. After a number of confrontations on the train, Brujo's snakes managed to get rid of their owners and hunt. Although all this happens, ordinary, everyday travelers are relaxing, they are not aware that something deadly is moving along their way and that they are not. <br /> <br /> After watching the stunningly funny snakes on the plane, I had to check it out. I knew it would be dirty and that the movie looks cheap, but what I found was the worst look. The whole curse plot was silly and should never be added. Special effects are not terrible, but not the best. I had no clue to the end. It was stupid to look and pathetic. It was terrible and it seemed bad. They just couldn't save their lives. If you want to laugh, look at it, otherwise you should really avoid it. <br /> <br /> "We have a runaway train. I repeat. We have a robbed train." - Conductor (Stephen A.F. Day)
