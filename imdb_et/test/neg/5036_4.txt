The short existence of The Sex Pistols and making this film after a controversial, ground-breaking break in the English punk band happened before I was born. However, in 2003, when I was a teenager, I started listening to their only album "Never Mind B * &% @ # & s, here is Sex Pistols" and quickly became a big fan. I didn't see "The Great Rock" n "Roll Swindle" until 2006, but I saw it a few times this year, and I thought it was pretty good (definitely not big but pretty good) even if I only remember the bits about it and did not see how it was all connected. The third time, almost three years after the second, I didn't see it at all. I'm not even sure what I mostly found about it (don't remember at this time). <br /> <br /> This movie is mystical, with Sex Pistols chief Malcolm McLaren telling the story of his band and its members; Guitarist Steve Jones, credited to "The Crook" here; drummer Paul Cook, credited with "Tea-Maker"; bassist Sid Vicious, credited to "The Gimmick"; and John Lydon (one of Johnny Rotten) was credited as a "collaborator". McLaren argues that he created a band (and even a punk rock genre) for fraud. He talks a lot about Helen Wellington-Lloyd (which is Helen of Troy) in different places where they go. It's basically between McLaren's talk, Pistols songs, the band's real-time movies, fictional scenes (often stupid, strange), a number of comics and other movies to put the gun driver on the strange way! <br /> <br /> It is well proven that McLaren is a liar, I know many have already noted it, including band members themselves. He was not the driving force of the band, he didn't create them (nor did he find punk-rock and The Sex Pistols wasn't even the first punk band, though they were unique). The band members were the ones who made the band what it was. "Filth and the Fury", a more credible film by the Julien Temple, who made the film, is said to be a member of the band who contradicts McLaren's requirements. However, the dishonesty of 'The Great Rock' n 'Roll Swindle' is not my biggest problem with it. If it were really entertaining (which I thought it was to some extent), I can forget that as I probably used to. The third time you watched, except for Sex Pistols songs, some real-time video footage and at least one amusing cartoon, it was quite boring! I found that the song "Who Killed Bambi" was at first easy to entertain, but it got tired very quickly. <br /> <br /> Is it worth watching fans of Sex Pistols? It seems that a good number of fans would say it is, not to learn from the short-lived but groundbreaking 70's punk band, but from entertainment. It was once my opinion of "The Great Rock" on "Roll Swindle". After watching it for the first time, I couldn't recall anything that McLaren said, and when I saw it for the second time, I was aware of what the Pistols leader used to use this movie, but couldn't remember anything I heard that he says! Of course, other aspects of the film were impressive. Now, after the third look, I can definitely remember some of the things McLaren says, but that wasn't 100% clear. Like most movies, he doesn't think his words are memorable, probably because they are presented. If you're a fan of Pistol, I think it wouldn't hurt to swindle, but for me, it's usually just a confusing, boring mess that tries to be funny but fails.
