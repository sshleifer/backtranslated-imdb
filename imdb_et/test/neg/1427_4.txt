I looked at it as a child, but I was very much a fan of Jerry Lewis, I forgot about it completely (not that it is reminiscent). The film revolves around transformation (which seems to be in the curriculum of every comic book)! - in this case, the German officer - and although not as bad as Leonard Maltin claims (giving him the BOMB rating), it's not a classic thing either - be sure to join Chaplin's GREAT DICTATOR (1940), even if they are relatively narcissistic! Ironically, the scenes that were before the appearance of the apparent worship of the general game offer more fun than the rather forced humor at the expense of the Nazis! <br /> <br /> The film was really Lewis's last bloom during her flowering; In fact, it turned out to be his last vehicle to be released for ten years (here it is painfully evident that his firmly stupid brand doesn't go along with Mel Brooks and Woody Allen)!
