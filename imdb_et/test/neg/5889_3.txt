Born and raised in Odessa and graduating from the "other" high school at the end of the 70s, Odessa at secondary school had mixed emotions with this film. I no longer live in Odessa, but I am always in the heart of Texan. I didn't like the way this 80,000 plus city was portrayed in a dirty little town. If I speak wrong on this issue, please release me, but I believe OHS also plays the "Perm Panthers" label home shown in the city stadium and stadium earlier in the practice field Permia. I would have liked to see a little appreciation of the city's big rivalry every year, OHS vs Perm. I'm curious as to why the game's result has been changed, I think it would have been as dramatic as the actual result would have been. All in all, the movie was okay, making me a little bit of home, remembering MOJO's "good old days".
