I was excited to read this movie after others' comments. What a disappointment! There are so many ways this movie is bad. At least, there was no computer graphics. I found a working rigid and incredible. See the sand as lost "e-shops" (what is the original name!). Where did all the stories come from? I immediately recognized parts similar to other films, ie Alien, Pitch Black. Come on, one big ship for one prisoner? And what is the prisoner? Does he tell if he can talk? I was expecting something to associate the story with bits, but it never came. If this movie is made with a low budget, it will show. The only part of the movie I liked was when it finally ended. I don't want me to like the end, I didn't. I liked it was over. A trip to the dentist would have been more enjoyable. In my opinion. don't waste your time on it.
