I looked at it because it seemed that the plot went somewhere. When it arrived ambiguously, I was very disappointed. I'll tell you what really happened in the next sentence. But maybe I won't. Maybe I just mean something happens. Writers did not have any imagination. It's not even a "B" movie - it's made for a TV "B" movie.
