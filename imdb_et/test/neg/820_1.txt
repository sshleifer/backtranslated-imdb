I like the Ali G exhibition, I believe it has a comedic instinct, but hasn't (yet) developed it to be gifted. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit worse than I expected. I can't find Ali-G offensive, just stupid. Funny 5 years old, some good, some terrible. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that looks offensive but is actually funny, see Tom Green 'Freddy Got Fingered'. <Br /> <br /> 2/10
