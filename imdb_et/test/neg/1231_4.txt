Okay, so I forgot to look and just hit the last episode, I thought it was the first or the second. Frankly, I thought CM would have at least one more part to solve the plot points. Rangers are left on the plains ("We have to eat horses") as one thing. Little Newt is left, for another. What a drop will end! But my biggest complaint, esp. if it was the finale, the episode had no relationship, no greater peak, no dramatic confrontation. Even the last fight between Blue Duck and Buffalo Hump was badly staged. The whole episode had a terrible pace that is western. Steve Zahn was traceable, Karl Urban (Johnny Knoxville ring) playing the call as a man with a terminal lock. All the glowing looks and jingling wears and beats. And what about the Ranger? They talked about the great cleaning of Texas, then grinded in the middle of the city, aimlessly. And how nice is Hal Holbrook to lend to Val Kilmer for his Mark Twain wig and stache! The Austin set was like a fake Rock Ridge from Blazing Saddles, all facades. I testify that I was plotting a plot, but that's mainly why I had a lot of things I didn't get, thanks to coming late in the story. If I looked from the beginning, I wouldn't have come to the third episode. Now I have to look at Silverado to clean my palette.
