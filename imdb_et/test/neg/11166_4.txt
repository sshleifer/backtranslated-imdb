The Korean response "I know what you did last summer" followed a similar story to your American colleague: one year after a group of high school friends accidentally kills a classmate, the masked killer begins to take them one by one. Who could have seen them at night - or was their "victim still alive when they were transported to the sea?" <br /> <br /> Originality can no longer be expected from a teenage genre, but still efforts can be made to ensure that these films are fun and scary. RECORD is also not displacing poorly rehearsed scenes "I know ...", "House Of Sorority Row", and "Faculty" (among many others) and unable to give one decent shock throughout the 95 minutes. <Br /> <br /> Action is decent, which, as it seems to be the norm of the Korean cinema, approaches the unattractive script with joy and undeserved enthusiasm. The direction is at best mediocre; a strange choice of camera corners and the worst killer costume * EVER *, which contributes to RECORD's decline. Most of the disappointment is the end of the film, where the two "surprise shafts" are that you have previously rejected them, that they are too coarse! <br /> <br /> RECORD's only sustainable arm is its bright start - the first act is really great and shows American colleagues how to shape and set the mood - but otherwise it's a very bad film. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
