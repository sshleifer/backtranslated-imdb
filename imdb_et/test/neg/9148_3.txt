Positive: It's pretty good. He has interesting peripheral signs. Desired main character (though weak). <br /> <br /> Bad: plot / story. Editing. Destroyed characters. Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of happy movies, but this movie is shamefully bad. I don't understand how anyone gets over $ 12 million for this Guy Jenkin. And before I go ahead, I just want to say that I don't like Jessica Albale - I really wanted to like her in this movie. But Jessica Alba in her fake and her model made me unhappy. He doesn't have any screen presence in this movie and he destroys every scene he has. Needless to say, romance doesn't come incredibly (not even tiny). <br /> <br /> Everything I saw was actors slipping their wings, trying to get this thing off the ground, a little they had given - but unfortunately it's all the sinking of the movie. There is no emotional connection, no emotional conflict, and nothing is achieved. This is a pretty blank movie.
