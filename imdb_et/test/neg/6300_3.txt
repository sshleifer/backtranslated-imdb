Costumes are outrageous and the Australian backcountry is fun to watch, but alongside this story - the middle edge - there are kings of dragons. I noticed this especially in the character of Terrence Stamp, "Ralph Bernadette Bassenger". Perhaps it was relevant because there is nothing "good man" about Ralph-Bernadette and his "Queen" group. Once again, we get a strong liberal inclination that says something is going and if you are not "with it" - or in this case pro-homosexual, then you are a homophobic. What really disturbs is the end when a young boy goes away with his "alternative lifestyle" father and accepts his gay lifestyle, not because it fits the story, but because it fits the agenda script wrote. Calm.
