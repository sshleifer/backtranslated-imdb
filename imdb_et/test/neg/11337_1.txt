You thought after "Traumschiff Surprise" that German comedy could not get worse? It may. This comedy is another attempt to preserve stereotypes of gays who are considered to be nice comedies. The original concept (openly for homosexual football athletes) would have been a great way to erase some stereotypes, but ... The real message of the film seems to be how gay men are straight men. . Absolutely silly, of course. Even gay sex is considered to be of lesser value than straight sex. This movie only tries to serve a straight audience who want to laugh at stereotypical gays. Well, don't waste your time on German comedy movies!
