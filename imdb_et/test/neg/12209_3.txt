As far as I love David Copperfield's story, I can't enjoy this movie. This was probably the second worst film I've ever seen. One of the problems I see is that the size of the novel requires more than a few hours of miners than a regular film. After two hours, it is impossible to capture a significant number of events that take place in the story. I don't like the glowing flashback format. It was separate and it would be impossible for someone who did not yet know the story to fully understand. Nor do I believe that the filmmakers interpreted Copperfield's personality correctly. The idea that his circle on his sleeping beach is skating seems to contradict the proactive, forward-thinking nature that Dickens gave him in the novel. Agnes also disturbed me. He became a ditsy household rather than a strong woman. However, Dora was perfect. This movie was full of problems and I am looking forward to someone making a decent screen version.
