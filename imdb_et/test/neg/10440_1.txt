This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. There is no historical accuracy, in reality the opposite is true. Just one example: Morgan preyed a little ethnic Chinese he met. The action is up, the script is poorly written wrong. I've never seen worse fake beards. <br /> <br /> Hopper arrived in Australia and allegedly would only make a movie if the script was completely rewritten so that he could be a hero. Since the script was ten, it can explain how bad it is and when the movie is separated. <br /> <br /> Every movie about Ned Kelly is much better than this movie.
