Sorry, but I usually love French thrillers - eg. Chabrol - but it was a shiny messy mess. The fact that it is based on Harlan Cohen's book tells us that, instead of being a French film (strong psychology and character), it is more like a John Grisham-esquire skateboarder whose numbers contain ridiculous plot twists, rebounds to refresh previous setbacks , the predicted cable (as soon as its name is mentioned, you think "hmm, he's a bad boy!") and mysterious stereotypical characters who seem to be living in different movies. Finally, I smiled hysterically unevenly in the tone of the film (scenes in which the two characters in the street are involuntarily guided by the wiring), an absolutely amazing plot, absurd coincidences and blows of happiness (eg an email account password) and awake uncontrollably (I thought I had to misinterpret 1- 50 minutes of driving time, as it seemed to be dragging for 3 hours 50 minutes).
