What can I say ... not much at all. Pretty boring and uninteresting. Participants' performances are just OK. The only one who seems to be in any way is Simmons, but he has only 3 scenes. I understand that by keeping your screen time to a minimum, he retains a mysterious psychic aura, but I can't help but feel his talent was wasted. No one else rose above average. <br /> <br /> The story itself seems to be intriguing at first, but it just doesn't go anywhere. There was no scene in the movie that impressed me or felt that I had just seen something special. Cinematic art was more blissful ... I mean washing it out in the desert through sepia ... not very inspiring. t really add something to the story, except to turn the middle Twilight Zone script into a full feature. <br /> <br /> Drab.
