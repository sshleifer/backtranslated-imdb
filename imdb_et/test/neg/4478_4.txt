When I went to the theater, I had great hopes - after I saw the trailer, I was as leap as the next person who saw great talent by participating in the story of a beautiful assumption. <br /> <br /> It is disappointing to see that this talent destroys the poor composition of the songs - the words are thick and cheesy, probably because it was made with a western theme. I would not be difficult to imagine the same melodies in French or English. In Mandarin they just sound strange. <br /> <br /> Musical instruments were also badly cut - too fast to be enjoyable, and the shots of tempting actors took too long. <br /> <br /> Special effects are the next disappointment. Suffice it to say, it's very obvious when special effects start and stop. <br /> <br /> It's not Moulin Rouge, and it's not Fashion, even despite the occasional (and very similar) slow roll. All in all, the hour is too long to talk about a simple story.
