this is an example of a movie that can have great potential and is filled very badly .. I'm a fan of children and thumb and many other so-called teen movies, but it's a mistake for me. <br /> <br /> Why is every white boy made a cutter who loves rap to be one-dimensional. acting was terrible but simple, because it consisted mainly of a bomb bomb only after a bit of a bad movie, if you want to see better movies: kids sucking on the thumbs bully everyone <br /> <br /> think it's better that i suggest one i want to see a good "make movie" of them, i hope my comment is helpful and i hope you hear from me future comments
