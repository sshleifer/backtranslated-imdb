Imagine what it should have been for John Agar. One of Hollywood's beautiful leading men. Married to Shirley with the Temple for five years. He finds himself doing such movies. I remember him in "Tarantula", where he wasn't half bad. Unfortunately, this movie is not recommended. The monster is stupid uninteresting and incompetent. The police are bored. Young people are bored. The plot is stupid. People run around. There are events that do nothing to promote the plot. There's a dance that goes on and on, and there's no attack. There is an idiotic triangle of love that no one can care for. It's not even campy or outrageous. It's just not worth anything. Agar can also be a post. He has nothing to do.
