This film tells the story of John Belush based on his biography, "Wired", written by Bob Woodward. All the films are about a setback without a chronological order where, after John Belush's death, we see one angel with Belush in a couple of points. in his life.Michael Chicklis is characteristic of John Belushi is reliable enough, but completely devastating force Belushi and his game only remain pale animation.Headman, more, can not give a resume, that who does not know is the book very confused. But the worse is that they have called Bob Woodward who spoke to Belush before he died. For such negative points, the film is only a desirable attempt to tell John Belush's contradictory story. My rate is 4.
