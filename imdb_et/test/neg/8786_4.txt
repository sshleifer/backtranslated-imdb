I rented it when it appeared on a videocassette in 1995. After this rewriting, my idea has not changed much. <br /> <br /> So I was an adult and I'm still an adult! lol <br /> <br /> The illogical elements mentioned by other reviewers didn't bother me. It's not a documentary, it's a fantasy story where animals can talk! <br /> <br /> Although I didn't like much of the songs, I liked what was at the end of the picture, where Barry Manilow and another person sang it. <br /> <br /> Some people seem to apologize for this primitive animation by saying that CGI is not often used in animated features, but don't forget that LION KING appeared about a year earlier and probably packed more excitement than any animated feature that came before it! <br /> <br /> But I think it's pretty fair to say that PEBBLE AND PINGOIN were made cheap while LION KING wasn't. t .... <br /> <br /> Both in 1995 and today, high scores are low-risk (mostly) underwater scenes. <br /> <br /> I also liked the opening scene on the music track page and a little love story. But mostly dragged the story and was boring. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing if you like animation, but if you're an adult and not a risk maker, go for another Walt Disney production!
