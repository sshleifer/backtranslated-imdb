Imagine any stereotypical, redundant clich√©s about every movie and TV show set on Brooklyn's streets from 1930 to 1980. Fill it with the cartoon casts instead of the cartoon characters. Throw a mix of "music" and "electric guitar" during the scene. Then pass the time that is trying to find out (or take care) which Deuces will be killed (anti) in climatic final thundering. <br /> <br /> I give this movie point that I am not just another romantic comedy, teen slasher, explosive film, teen sex comedy, child's musical or Oscar nomination vehicle. But the tragedy left on the street would bring something new or interesting to the genre.
