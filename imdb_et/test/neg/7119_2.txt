My best guess is the work that comes out of DVD sometimes before Christmas. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible. The timeline jumps all over the place. It would not be so bad as to put an end to some tension. It was completely predictable. Bitch girls pick out outcast, outcast wants to know why they hate her so much, bitch girls die terrible death, outcast girl goes home and looks crazy. Outcast girl brought with her evil spirits, making neighbors crazy and killing each other. The creepy child understands what's going on. Oh, and the younger sister is not good enough for Mommie, the sick mother, to bring her younger daughter home to home. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there were some great moments here and there. First, Sarah Michelle's character dies within the first few minutes. A definite plus. Didn't see this one. I didn't expect the woman to dig bacon fat on her husband's head. If the film had had such excitement, I would have loved it. There were so many promises in the beginning. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because I enjoyed the first one. It made me jump, I didn't expect most of what happened, and while I asked for a movie, it was still a fun watch. I didn't see any previews of this stage because I wanted to be surprised. I was, but in the wrong direction.
