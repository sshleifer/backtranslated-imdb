First of all, I would like to say that I am a fan of all the actors involved in the film, and when I rented it, I wanted to like it. <br /> <br /> I think the main reason I was so disappointed was that the box had allowed me a temporary thriller. In my eyes, the British film's temporary thriller, like Ruth Rendell's novel, is something that has many dark twists and turns and leaves the viewer in the end, which is unlikely to be forgotten soon. <br /> <br /> This movie started with a promising comment that it is such a movie. We have our main character who suspects a man who doesn't like it, be involved in the hit and running, who killed the spouse of one of his servants. His concepts turn out to be correct, but the idea that his wife may be involved does not exist until he recognizes that he is part of a crime. <br /> <br /> The elements of a good temporary thriller were now in place, but from there I felt that the film took a different direction and became almost a soft soap opera about who wants to be with whom and what is the love of true relationship. The film may be pleasing to me when the outer box was spoken of in a twisted lover's triangle and was not marked with a temporary thriller. It seemed to be more of a soap opera story and the starting mode seemed to be a mild confusion in the actual content of the movie. I felt that this movie could have done much more than it did. I felt that it led the viewer to the end of a big event that never happened. So I have to give it a lower rating if I wanted to and say that it does not meet my expectations.
