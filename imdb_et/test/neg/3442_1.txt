Tim Taylor is an abusive acholic drug addict. He is a coward and a child and has no redemptive qualities as an actor or person. The only movie that is pleasing to her is "Galaxy Quest" and that is because her character - the former hit TV show - was so close to real life. The rest is equally bad. I hate mother and actor who played Patricia Richardson, she sucks! Any cliché exists, a foolish woman who is greasy and loves opera and cares only about her children, while in real life she proclaims family values ​​and leaves after the twin. And the child's actors were about as interesting as the root canal.
