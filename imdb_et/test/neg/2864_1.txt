About one step above Olsen's double film is a surprise in this store, except how embarrassing, the amazing Depardieu sees walking on the beach without a shirt. This man had to have some kind of heartbeat? Quasimodo hubba hubba? Well, whatever. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is a great actor whose career has shown great potential as a comic as well as a dramatic actor in recent years, but this film certainly did not offer her a breakthrough. His coat-of-arms character has no trace of personality or self-esteem, a lovely boy he thinks is the biggest boy in the world (mostly because he is a cute boy), but he can't be honest with him for two seconds. Ladies, let me tell you something; if the boy really goes inside you, he's not going to spit because you were trying to leave your father your boyfriend. He may be a little confused about why you are so stupid, defiled and overwhelmed, but in the end it is just something you laugh together. <br /> <br /> The plot and dialogue will hit every ring to hit. No originality and no spirit ... but it is rilly, rilly SWEET and Ben's rilly, rilly lovely that viewers who think Titanic is the biggest ever made movie, of course, say this movie is great because they don't notice that it is not nearly your head. One letter.
