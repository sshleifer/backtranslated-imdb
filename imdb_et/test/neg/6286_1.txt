Wow ... <br /> <br /> Reading these comments I see the US and ... Dutch! USA P.o.V. it seems that this is a pretty good movie, Parker is a pleasant hero, the story is a light-hearted transition from what could be a form of glorified reality. it looks like a completely different pair of glasses. They categorically and surprisingly similar circumstances agree with the film's disaster. geographically. But based on factual observations - I saw the film with my own eyes - I suspect the Dutch are not far from the mark: <br /> <br /> "Parker Kane" is badly done, totally boring and really not worth the cellulose that was undoubtedly in its creation wasted.
