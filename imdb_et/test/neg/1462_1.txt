This film was intentional, uncomfortable and just down, not funny. Filming method reminded me of MTV. I'm a Hartley fan. But what did he mean? So much more I thought the film should have been kept in mind. It could have been a real theoretical struggle for good and evil, but Hartley seems to have used the psychological stent technique of the viewer.
