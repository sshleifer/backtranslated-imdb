I saw this movie in 1956 and again a few days ago with a cable. The film has not improved with age. On the contrary. This is a real epic of spaghetti. <br /> <br /> Trojans are heroic and enjoyable; the Greeks are disgusting, small and crazy. <br /> <br /> What if Paris went away with the king's wife? Hey ... love is love.
