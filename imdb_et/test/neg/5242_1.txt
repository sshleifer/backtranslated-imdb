When I heard that the biggest and oldest surviving Germanic hero poem became a movie, it was almost obsessed with seeing it. The first glances of this look never made me disappointed. Futuristic Interpretation Lambert is our favorite highlander and Mitra, a tomb guest, with leadership roles that were pleasing, although some doubts came to life (a significant female figure in Beowulf?) ... Two hours ago I saw the film. After reading the director's name, my world broke down. As I said, there were not many surprises ever since. First of all, the film has nothing to do with the original Beowulf, if we do not take into account some of the names that were stolen and unnecessarily stolen. Had they not stolen the names and proclaimed a new story, he could have worn f-class fears with costumes and scenography. So it's just a crime! Attack on the legend and its ideology and common sense. Be positive to me ... besides the general electro-goth atmosphere that is great, there is also good music. It was both positive and commentary.
