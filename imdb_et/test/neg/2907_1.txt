The editing technician, apparently prepared by the blessed maniac, who actually chose to distribute this thing, tries to convince us that its somewhat comical effect on this stunningly incompetent thing is totally deliberate. Don't you believe it: it's Lloyd Kaufman, because Andy Warhol is Herschel Gordon Lewis. In such a hypothetical audience torture project, it is so thorough that it seems to be a misanthropic installation of negative art, only because it is so full of self-consciousness. It's disgraceful and ugly, like "Things" or "Frozen Career" that can be recycled with ante if it is in a terribly bald claim that must be seen as credible. Hitchcock-style shot-by-shot analysis, such as an attack on cardio-girls, can bring twenty changes and maybe three minutes of shots - only the sequence is ten minutes long! WISHING to believe that it began with a more life-tolerant short topic, unless you take a repetition that was much less exciting: eg. as the "fiend" enters the room, he inspires only the extended, very apathetic, completely empty stares of his offscreen victims. Repeat this scenario about four times in different settings; to overcome these thirty lines of dialogue; offer even more hate and lethargy to the participants than in the classics mentioned above; and grace to us a monster consisting of gauze, ketchup and one yellow spock, and you have a film that is too annoying to refuse, from the definition of bad work. I'm proud of that!
