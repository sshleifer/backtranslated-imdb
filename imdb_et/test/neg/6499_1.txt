After the apocalyptic future, the new highlander is a small female Quentin MacLeod, led by a new Ramirez, while her little sister tags tried to prevent the evil immortal master. To do this, Quentin must embrace all the knowledge of other immortals before that commander, Korton. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a nonsense, like the Highlanders Lakes. Quentin is a fairly stupid character, constantly whining and saddening and chewing "I was struggling to be a reluctant hero", and he never steals that he is immortal and cannot be killed at least not easily. Ramirez would make him better and prevent Korton himself.
