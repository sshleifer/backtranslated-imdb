First of all, let me say that this movie is not remarkable. The cast is like being saved by a bell meeting, the monster is an expensive outfit and as always; the army is useless. It seems that the more training you have and the bigger your weapon, the more likely it is that you will die if you are a brilliant low budget horror film. Obviously, people in the film industry have little respect for navy seals, sailors and ninjas who are the worst. The plot is thin, Dr. According to Pe√±a's name, a nut tree from the cryptozoolog Chupacabra trap. He then smuggles it on a cruise ship where two crew members let it go. You can make your payment and watch this movie and not hit it. The most remarkable part, which really makes it all worthwhile, revolves around the captains' daughter. After all, he goes to all martial arts monster and strikes his ass. Let me get this straight, the monster wipes all the navy seals when they use ARMOR PIERCING ammunition! OK, this movie can happen? But here comes the captain's daughter, who can't be older than 19 years, and strikes the stick out of the chupacabra both front and side. It was fun. They should receive a medal with this medal.
