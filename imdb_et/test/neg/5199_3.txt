I was fun. I just saw this movie yesterday and started to turn it off but changed my mind. It was in no way what I thought the story would end. This is all positive I can say about this movie. All participants are nobodys, especially the leader. Although she is an attractive young woman, she never makes it big. Writing, direction, and acting are woody, similar to what you would see with daily soap. The shooting places were very smart to think it could be everywhere, instead of obviously falling off in Canada. Since it was fully loaded in Canada, I assume that the whole lot was Canadien, which is not quite bad, because some of the latest Canadiene TV productions: "Cold squad", "Stone; Underover" are pretty well done.
