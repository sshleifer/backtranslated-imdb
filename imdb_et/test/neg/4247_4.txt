Anyone I know loves this movie, but I'm afraid I won't. I hated this movie so much that I had to turn it off in the middle of the movie because of this displacement. Too much time is spent on nervousness and an emotional bed where the Bullock's character, destroyed by his divorce, is too much for the viewer. Enough already !! And why didn't we hear more about our former spouse? He is portrayed as something that is just a suit that arrives from time to time. Something needs to be done to get married with him, what was it? What is it about him that makes him so devastating at the time of divorce? It took more time for this to shoot another Bullock that wrinkled in the bedroom. The dialogue is stylish, clich√© and terrible, like one of those "ABC Afterschool Specials" or something like that. There's nothing imaginative or creative about this movie, it's all very predictable and so boring. This movie also moves on a trimming factor, which is very stupid and not funny as it was supposed to be! This is one more of those who have terribly done "I am a woman, listen to me roaring" movies like "Waiting to wait". If you want to see "I'm a woman, listen to me roar" movies that are really fun, original and well done, then see "Gas catering" or "Ruby in Paradise". Leave this crap !! I'm giving "Hope Floats" 3/10.
