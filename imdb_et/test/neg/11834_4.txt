Comedic Broadway's success with "The Gay Divorce" (a title that was considered too scandalous for American video players, though used in the UK) concerns men and women (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) who face embarrassing circumstances when it comes to divorce proceedings; they are dancing, arguing, forming, dancing, arguing more and dancing more. Betty Grable is very interesting with a short bit (singing and dancing with "Let's K-nock K-mat" with the essence of Edward Everett Horton), but the star-pair looks strenuous and unhappy. The complexity is complex, but the characters are not more than one-dimensional. * 1/2 from ****
