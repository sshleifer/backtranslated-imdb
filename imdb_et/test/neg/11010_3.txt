I heard that this Japanese flick is nervous, creatively interesting, "cool new thang" in the scene of Asian cinema ... maybe even as innovative as Hideo Nakata "Ring" or Chan-wook Park "Oldboy", especially you can imagine my disappointment when I find that the film is both narratively and kinematically separated (although not so appreciated by the film enthusiast), clich√©-driven, even unfortunately, foolishly. funny --- the whole "Pulp Fiction" style very bad breaking. <br /> <br /> I stopped watching in 30 minutes when I gave up that it becomes more than it is.
