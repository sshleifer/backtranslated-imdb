It is beyond me why two million people in Denmark sit every week to see this terrible show. Dialogue is terrible and not realistic. The characters are hollow and simple. There's a tough guy, a tough woman and a sensitive man. Writers say that they have shaped characters after Greek mythology! Leave me alone! All the characters are, of course, excellent policemen. When I see this example, I have missed "District Hill Street" and "NYPD Blue". These are excellent exhibitions and "Rejseholdet" is a tiny copy. This program is a symptom of the disease that Danish television is currently suffering from.
