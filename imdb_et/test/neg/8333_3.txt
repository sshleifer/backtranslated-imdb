I went to see it because I've never seen Tel Aviv where the story is set. I was disappointed because it did not offer many views to the biggest metropolis in Israel. Is this also pretentious? One of those films that leaves you with a sense of it, until you finally give up on the shoulders. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist is Batya, a woman in her twenties who works as a waitress for a wedding. His parents probably don't care much about him, and when a little girl walks around the sea with an inflatable ring, Batya feels she needs to take care of her. A little girl is not talking and Batya can't give her to social services because it's a weekend and the office is closed. So he gets back to his apartment with a leaking roof and when it comes time to work in the evening he has to take his girlfriend. The boss is very unhappy with this and other shortcomings in Batya's work. <br /> <br /> Another main character is Keren, who is getting married. On her wedding day (where Batya naturally works) she interrupts her feet from climbing a lady's door that doesn't open, and so she and her new husband can't take their planned Caribbean vacation. They overlook the sea without sea view. It smells bad, there is noise in traffic and Keren complains all the time. Her husband meets a strangely attractive older woman? writer ?? who is also in the hotel and Keren is worried that she has been alien to her. <br /> <br /> The third main character is filipino wife Joy, who takes care of old people. The old woman she is hired is very dirty and doesn't speak English, but German and Hebrew. Joy speaks English but is not in Hebrew or German. Joy is mostly concerned about how his son is going back in the Philippines and wants to buy him a toy as he asked. She finds a suitable boat shop and plans to buy it. The daughter of an old woman who has hired joy is an actor who appears to some sort of postmodern "physical theater" adaptation in Hamlet and does not get along with her mother. <br /> <br /> The way those three stories that intersect at a moment will, presumably, mean something deep. I didn't get it. Batya's relationship with a little girl is a fantasy element, and perhaps Batya's non-existent relationship with her parents is somehow reversed in this relationship. When Joy sees a toy ship shop in a window, a strange effect is used where small sails swell like wind, and they do it as if they were on the actual ship's scale. Keren pulls the bottle area around the ship around the brochure in the hotel room, and the narration of the strange woman's poetry mentions the vessel in the bottle. But what does all this mean? I thought about it for a while and realized that I wasn't going to sleep in this process. If anyone has a clear idea of ​​what it is, maybe they can fill me.
