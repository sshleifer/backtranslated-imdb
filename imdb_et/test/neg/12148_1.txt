Frightening production is not a "film". Probably it was shot on a video tape and very badly! The sound is constantly glowing (sounds like a bad microphone) that is so annoying that sometimes you don't understand what characters are saying. Poorly dubbed music suddenly appears in the scene and editing all of this thing is about NULL! <br /> <br /> The plot is painted and ridiculous. The homosexual at the end of the 20th century tried to hide from the parents of their parents? PLEASE! And the mother's reaction when she finds her son able to kiss her boyfriend is out of melodramatic and rolls stupid. Talk about a stereotypical view of gay life! Action is worse than film and the direction is very bad! <br /> <br /> As for "production", it's not! <br /> <br /> This title is just a flat video phone attempt to call itself a "movie". There is no heart and soul to give it even the slightest praise. <br /> <br /> It's just a stupid waste of time to avoid it at all costs! BAD ACTING! BAD WRITING! The title of BAD DIRECTING and the "producer" is insignificant, as it probably cost them the price of the videotape he photographed. </Amend> for cunsomeer. I can't stress how terrible this "SUGARPLUM" is! <br /> <br />
