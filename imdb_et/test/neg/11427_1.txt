It's really one of the worst films I've seen for a while. It's not funny at all. It simply depicts a lower-class North British environment. I find this to be a very sad film, in the other case cuts where they should not be. One of the things that greatly irritated me was the close-ups of pointless objects that really slowed down the movie's pace. I only did it through the movie because I forwarded certain sequences quickly. <br /> <br /> This movie loses public attention. The main problem is that it causes several reasons for one action, which in turn tends to weaken that activity. But if one factor is one reason, it makes it passionate. All in all, this movie is all over. I didn't learn enough about the characters to take care of them because they change because of plot lines and stories where I might have enjoyed studying one sign of life. <br /> <br /> For example, when a boy meets God in a bar, God seems like a cool guy. The film could have been worked out at this point and I think it would have been a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Anyway, though, it is. Look at this if you want, but I warn you that this movie is crap. I respect the authors who tried to pull it out with a small budget, but they could have done a lot better work. I think it's all in camera movement and editing. But then again, it's just my opinion.
