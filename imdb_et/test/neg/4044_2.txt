In order to make such a terrible movie, it really has to be! In fact, I'm more embarrassed that I sat through the whole thing. The old 80's sci-fi movie seems to be with super-fake "special effects", false images and a very fun dialogue. Maybe it's the way they wanted to look at it, maybe they think the 80's movies are cool. Who knows ... <br /> <br /> If you think the permissive eye candy will record the movie, then you are disappointed - the so-called "babes" are men and downright ugly. They can't do anything at all, I don't understand why they couldn't see at least good chicks if they wanted them not to be talented babies! But I think if you film this fool, you won't get very good choices, hot chicks are not just such a bad mess!
