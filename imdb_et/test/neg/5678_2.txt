I was a big "SNL" fan on the days of Chevy Chase, John Belush, Dan Ackroyd, Gilda Radner and many other memorable stars. But every time I've been trying to watch it over the last ten years, I've been very disappointed and sometimes even outraged. Ten years ago I believed that the exhibition couldn't survive because it had changed from the humor that I understood, but nevertheless it kept what I am always amazing, wondering how somebody else might be funny in the world humor at all funny. Once I have been in the last decade, I've never been happy. Indeed, I have always been upset about my time and wasting time. For me, the absolute low point was several years ago when a popular young male actor was very fond of me. At one point he played a big star at night, maybe himself, and in sketch he was Mriso, which I think Chris Kattan played, again I think he came with him in the back of the car. Followed by Mongo's coercion up and down and actor's lap up and down as he shouted hysterically when he was probably sodomized. The audience laughed away and I shake my head, surprised that they find they are far from funny, surprised that NBC would even send such a thing. Since then, I have repeatedly tried to approach the exhibition openly, hoping it could restore the sense of humor adored for so many years. But until just a week ago, this is not the case for me. Not even close. One exception: during the 2008 presidential campaign, I thought Tina Fey was fantastic and she was one of the performers who tuned me. But these Sarah Palin sketches, though hysterical, were not enough to record the remaining 90 minutes. and I would always regret that it would not be erased as soon as I heard the familiar "It's Saturday night !!!"
