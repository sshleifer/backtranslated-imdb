After reading the reviews I decided to rent a DVD version. <br /> <br /> I like classic music and wanted to learn more about Bach. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. I think I don't know enough about Bach's music and the comments were not enough to understand what importance or what music is playing. <br /> <br /> It may be appropriate to explain the film under the guidance of Bach's music expert. <br /> <br /> I really tried and saw that the whole movie was hopping so I could enjoy at least part of it, but I didn't. <br /> <br /> Look at it at your own risk.
