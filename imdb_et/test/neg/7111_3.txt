One day I was sick and ducted and I came to this terrible rank movie. The plot and even sub-blocks (if you find them) are made for extinction. IF, as bad as the story was, I reserve a special comment for Liza Minelli. His character was absolutely one of the most annoying signs I've ever seen with watching a movie. His only two competitors in this category are John Leguziamo's "Pest" and Julia Stiles, which he has done (or half-done). Perhaps he did exactly as the script suggested or maybe (flatter!) This is the limit he has in his scope. Either way, they should have written and killed the movie in the first 30 seconds (like a girl who fell from Lethal Weapon (I) (but at least had beautiful breasts)) <br /> <br /> Most humble ..
