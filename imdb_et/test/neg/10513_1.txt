A dark but humorous story that includes a policeman who has first experience with vampires and decides he needs to stop working to continue with their evil beings. Most of the film included questionable action, plot, props and filming. Fighting scenes were the same hokey as a high school teacher transfer from World War II battle. The lines delivered were spoken as if the actors were motivating to stay there. The props were bad because they didn't even look like they could do the slightest amount. most of the film seemed to be beaten in someone's basement (in some scenes, the catches saw overheads that didn't have to be seen in the basement). The plot had no motivation to move forward or go back, but it seemed that it stood from time to time without some reason for some characters. Sometimes I felt that the sound effects were inappropriate for the genre of this horror and for the series of cartoons. It's similar to Blade, as he is an African American vampire hunter. But this is where all the similarities end, and the film looks closer to the attack on Saturday night.
