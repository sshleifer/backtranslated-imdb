If you live in a suburb, you are relatively well off your money and have not really been in contact with urban life in England, this is a comedy for you. Nothing that the mass audience would listen to, but if you are like those characters they show you love it as pieces. In general, it is a comedy that the BBC snobs sit back and laugh at their joy and only a few choices. Compared to BBC Comedys, just Fools and Horses, Fawlty Towers, Black Adder, and other classics, this series of BBC products tends to deviate from the traditional product and offer some folk culture.
