What a sad surprise. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of the original series (starring Don Adams), I was really expecting it. Poor fool me. It's quieter and more brain dead than the monkey. <br /> <br /> To make it bad, it would be a serious underestimation. It's / was the worst movie (well in the first 30 minutes) I've seen for a long time. I couldn't stand more than in the first half of the year, preferring to look at the de-fragment of my hard drive. <br /> <br /> I can withstand bad ... bad is O.K., sometimes even cute. HOW TO BUILD A HOLLY CREAM (AND IT MUST BE THE WORLD WITHOUT MOST OF YEARS) This film is a severe insult to the collective intelligence of mankind! My five-year-old daughter could have written better - and she's not even discriminatory !!! I'm really tempted to try the rest of it, but I'm afraid I have better things to do ... like to make a seal and look at it. <br /> <br /> What a sad disappointment. No ... I won! What a Fraud! As Mel Brookes once said; "T-shirt!"
