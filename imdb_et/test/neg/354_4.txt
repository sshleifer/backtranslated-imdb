You hardly know that a year later, MGM put Norma Shearer in DIVORCEE, which burns with MGM's technical know-how. How far they came in a year. CHENEY is the very beginning of the stage. The camera is barely moving. Shearer is his usual charming self and Rathbone is in a romantic lead. They are all very careful to talk clearly and slowly about the source of the microphone, which will naturally relieve the flowing dramatic scene, but the game is a strong and fun warship so we can enjoy ourselves if expectations are not too high. By the way, the plot is surrounded by a ring of class-class jewelers who penetrate into society to sacrifice their victims. The script has some smart twists and true love sweeps everything. Oscar nomination for best scenario adaptation.
