Hip, the prominent doctor James Coburn (like Peter Carey) arrives as a pathologist at a Boston hospital. Almost immediately, Mr Coburn beds a beautiful nutritionist Jennifer O'Neill (like Georgia Hightower). While sleeping with O'Neill, Coburn sleeps in an emergency involving botched abortion - a fifteen-year-old who dies in death is Dan O'Herlihy (like JD Randall), a major donor to the hospital. Coburn does not believe that a man, a medical teacher James Hong (David Tao), was arrested; although Mr Hong acknowledges the execution of illegal abortions. Trying to erase his friend, Coburn travels through a thickening plot? <br /> <br /> Carey Treatment (3/29/72) Blake Edwards ~ James Coburn, Jennifer O'Neill, Michael Blodgett, James Hong
