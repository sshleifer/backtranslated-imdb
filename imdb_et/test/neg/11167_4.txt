It's already hanging up on dirty Hollywood movies like Scream and I know what you did last summer. The story is classic, some high school students are trying to walk out of class asthma, but something goes wrong. Terribly wrong. When you watch a movie that you know what happens before it happens all the time, it's not good if the movie tries to be scary. The actors are pretty ok and the girls are cute (after all, they are Asian) so I give him two of the five mojave'o'meters.
