It's about jealousy, racism, it's manipulation, but the underlying message is love. Geoffrey Sax tried to pull out Shakespeare's Othello in today's context. However, the participants were not convincing enough to pull it out. There were extra bodies that helped to put everything in perspective, but John Othello, played by Eamonn Walker, reacted a lot in this film, causing Keeley Hawes, Dessie Brabant to fall, eventually ending with Dessie's death. <br /> <br /> Ben Jago, played by Christopher Eccleston, was considered the main character of the movie. He did not provide sufficient evidence that Dessie would have deceived Othello, Michael Cass, played by Richard Coyle. Instead, he just played to a friend and gave one reason he was "cheated". In the game Iagos was much more convincing that Othello would suspect something. This change made the film more fierce for the wrong reasons than the one outlined in the book. But the film had some good points. It turned the army scenes into a more racist group, where Othello is the chief of the police unit. These scenes are incredible by the incredible crowd and burning fires. You can know the size of racism in the movie, the more it is in the book. This book plays a modern scene, simplifying its understanding as Shakespeare's time was written. In the performance, Iago (Jago) is tortured at the end, but in the film he gets satisfaction and gets Othello's position. He will never get what he deserves, and will never be forced to say lie to Othello until it's too late. I saw this as a fall of the movie because I feel that his treasure is being given to lie-dick for lying, and he found Rodrigo in the book. In general, the film could play better than playing. I feel that the director of the film omitted some of the most important parts of the game that were mentioned or played there to make the game flow or to turn it into a tragedy. I'd say you should read the book first to understand all the events in the movie, otherwise you might lose yourself and confuse yourself.
