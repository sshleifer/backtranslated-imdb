Let me start by saying that I had been waiting for a long time to release this movie. After finally seeing you last night, I'm sorry to say that I was incredibly disappointed. It is hard to imagine a movie that could do last year's Exorcist: Beginning, but Dominion does it. Don't wait ... it makes it a beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe I was too excited about this movie and it helped me down. After all, the idea that Warner Bros released two versions of what is essentially the same movie in six months is an exciting attraction. In addition, I am a great fan of Stellan Skarsgard and truly gives it a great result, despite the often ridiculous content of the film. On the other hand, this film is supported by cast abysmic. Clara Bellar seems to be capable of just one expression - stare empty and transmit all her lines with the same monotonous tone, while Gabrielle Mann's father Frances is just ridiculous. The effects of this film are the best ridiculous, and with its hard joy it is enough to rob a movie of any chance to take it seriously. This film brought more smothered giggling than anything else, and except for one really cool shot that lasted for about three seconds and made my friend cover my eyes and whip, he left something in the dread. I could go into more detail and, if possible, give away some spoilers, but frankly, I have too much thought about how bad this film was to write all the things I would like to say. <br /> <br /> The most sad part of all this is that the basic idea that both film versions tried to give ... the story of a priest who has lost his faith and restores it after getting to the past ... was a huge potential, especially when Skarsgard is the leading man. Unfortunately for us this potential was wasted. Go and watch this movie only if you're really curious about how it differs from the Harlin version, but don't wait for a good movie or regret wasting your money and two hours of your life. Otherwise, please be satisfied with the version first published and proceed.
