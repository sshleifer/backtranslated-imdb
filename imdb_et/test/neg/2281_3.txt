Numbers, an Oscar-hungry biopsy of late, great singer Ray Charles. * Ray * has one - exactly one - great scene. It happens during the rebound of the young Charles, when the boy is completely blind. Running with her mother in a shared building, she drives over the chair and bounces on the floor. He cries out for his mother; he follows his philosophy that a person should "stand his two feet", follow the kitchen quietly and retiremently, waiting for the boy to get back to his resources. The boy turns out to be a challenge when using his ears and memory to find the kettle on the stove, the nearby fire, the wind blowing out of the window, dragging the cricket over the floor of the board. <br /> <br /> Movie stops here; it expands; it breathes - even if only 40 seconds. The scene is a very necessary spirit from Taylor Hackford's otherwise noisy film. "Noisy" I don't refer to music that is, of course, great. I am referring to the sound effects (big booms!), And the dialog ("I'm talking to you as FRIEND, Ray", etc.). On the visual side, Hackford is equally and meaninglessly glowing: with sepia color filters on camera lenses; 360s rotate from camera screen, etc. All modern amenities. What a terrible cinema style * Ray *! - A style that is too common in "important" films of the past decade (Scorsese * Aviator * is stylistically very similar to this movie). These tricks are used to interfere with the clich√© scenario. Some of us are not stupid. <br /> <br /> Some of us are not quite ready to accept Jamie Foxx as more than a great mimic. Foxx recalls that he resembles Ray Charles: he walks like Charles, talks like Charles and even Charles. The imitation of the Foxx singer during the live performance is technically perfect. I will not reject Mr Foxx for his Oscar; he deserves it. (That was a pretty weak field anyway.) But one wondering if Foxx really understands Charles. The actor will achieve one great moment when he insists that he try to try his attacks: he registers, if only briefly, for the injustice of darkness and the life of darkness. The film seems to want to dramatize Charles's struggle between saving music lightly and heroin, with darkness as between these two forced battlefields. But the damn film just doesn't take time: it hits the triumph to the triumph, never really stopping to understand. To find a dramatic tension, STRETCH is needed; The movie drama must be presented. In other words, you have to imagine a better movie than that. <br /> <br /> When you complete the speed, * Ray *, then the dodges, hurts a number of great movie ideas: in his early days, "Chitlin Circuit"; his courageous musical innovations for the Atlantic label; his dependence on heroin; unavoidable artistic compromises associated with enormous success; the importance of the man in the struggle for civil rights (in the film, oh, about 3 minutes with the screen) and more. The filmmakers are too lazy to focus on one of these elements. Watching two and a half hours of a man who crashes one accident after another can make us feel good, but such a film may not be a great work of art. Such an approach does not provide a deeper insight into the subject of the film - and should not be the real purpose of such a film? If I had wanted to wear the Ray Charles achievements list, I would just have served him. <br /> <br /> 3 stars out of 10 - extra 2 stars strictly for music.
