After watching the movie, I was surprised that someone had liked it !! I think it's the worst comedy I've ever seen. If you think you had already seen the worst comedy, wait for that mess !!!! Not at all funny (OK one or two laugh maybe ....... but you have to be really high), the actress is terrible and the story doesn't exist. Even if you like snowboarding (and I really do), you hate that movie. OK, OK, you can see some nice babes, some nice snowboard tricks and some beautiful mountains, but that's all !!! Instead, look at the porn in the mountains because the actor and the story can be better !!!!! Sometimes I read in the IMDb a bad overview of some movies and finally they are not so terrible .... but that, believe me, is a clean trash !!!! Don't waste your time and money on it.
