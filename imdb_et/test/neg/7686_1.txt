I only looked at the first twenty minutes of this movie and personally think it's the worst film of recent years. <br /> <br /> The plot was so bad that it could have been a 10-year-old old child writing it. The action was also sloppy, though it seemed wrong, not only that the sequences of action in the first half of the film were so terrible that it was incredible. <br /> <br /> I don't know how the producers got this movie, but the production company must now regret it. <br /> <br /> Everyone who comes into contact with this movie in the near future will advise you to avoid this movie.
