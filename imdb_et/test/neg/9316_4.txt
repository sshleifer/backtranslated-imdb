As long as you go to this movie, being aware that it does not contain any historical fact, it is not bad. <br /> <br /> It's like Sam Raimi's "Hercules: Legendary Journeys". related to land, operating, humor and production values. You will see similarities at several points. However, most fighting scenes are not so good and the film suffers for it. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance tells the screen as well as ever before, and you never get the impression that he gives anything less than his best. Same for Oliver Reed. The problem is that their strong performances make Don Diamont less than the star actors act even more uncomfortable. The multi-year-old bit player Cas Anvar was also very good at playing the same character as Salmonius in the above-mentioned Hercules. <br /> <br /> If you liked the low-cost swords and witchcraft films since the early 1980s, this exhibition probably also enjoys. It's actually a shame when they add the Marco Polo name to it. It's not really Marco's life-related, contrary to the expectations of most people who want to watch this movie.
