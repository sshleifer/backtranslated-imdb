Every time I watch Larry King Live, he rolls out the most softball questions for his guests. He rarely gets any useful information because he doesn't ask any difficult questions. This is from the beginning of the radio. <br /> <br /> The king founded himself on the radio and has basically not changed one of the little TV formats unless his speech head is visible. He gets his guests a puppy and the only time he gets really useful information about them is if they voluntarily want it or the caller actually asks a serious question. <br /> <br /> Larry is a nice, father-type interviewer. This means that if you need CNN, you should not have a major news network to show the main time. I don't want the history of CNN. <br /> <br /> Copying (ie Cable) Ted Turner launched a new network as an alternative to network news, as it can spread the news 24/7. For the first time, the only telecom competition was NBC, ABC and CBS. That's why CNN copied its form of competition and earned respectable judgments. <br /> <br /> It worked well for CNN until they had competing networks that were innovative and offer better / more recent news coverage. In response to warming up competition, CNN went away and placed its competitors who eat their lunches and ratings because CNN wanted resistance to change. It didn't work very long and their ratings started to fall. <br /> <br /> Now, the copying network itself is trying to reinvent itself by copying leading news network formats. Unfortunately, this show is a big problem. It is 21 years old and shows its age very badly. <br /> <br /> Excuse me to say that the king must be removed or thrown away.
