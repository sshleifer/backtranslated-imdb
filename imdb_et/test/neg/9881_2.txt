The first impression when I read the upcoming movie summary was that it was very different from the book. The movie trailer said that the film should happen when Vivian is 19 years old after his parents were killed in America. He meets Aiden, with ambitious graphics. On the day of work at the chocolate shop, he must accept that he is never normal, because every full month, he becomes a loup-garou - a conceivable-mystical creature that can be closely compared to a werewolf. br /> <br /> Most of the minor changes didn't seem to me too bad, although I'm a fan of the book, shared by Annette Curtis Klause. I knew it would be different, but I wanted to support this book, thinking that the change in age, the change in settings, and some small changes in occupation will not affect the whole event, to tear my eyes out of my sockets and leave myself bleeding at the cinema. <br /> <br /> The movie killed unnecessarily many important characters, one of which was Esme, the mother of Vivani, right now at the fire that was supposed to kill her father. I pushed it aside and pulled the film, tired and a little annoyed. When Romania passed through, the corners of the camera were good, the landscape was beautiful and the music was ... interesting ... but that impressed me: "Why does Vivian look and why does she wear hoods?" I have to say that I am surprised that Scriptwriters seemed to support the incest so that instead of sticking to Viviani and Rafe's book, the leader of the five leaders now became his cousin through him (surprise!) Astrid Astrid, who was the bitter and hated rival of Vivani's mother in the novel -I can't relate to either of them. <br /> <br /> Due to the distortion of the top character, Gabriel became somehow a leader in the pack and an obsession with Vivian, who was his companion to fulfill some non-existent prophecies. His physical appearance was not only about 180 books, but probably also Rafe's father. Yeah, that's right, it's a nice little incident wolf knot that is assembled tightly. <br /> <br /> The little things that hit me were like forest forests. There was a red head standing behind the rest of the crowd who "kissed his enemy" before their prey was the freedom to drive and hunt. Why was he there? Why did he look like Astrid? I think it is not enough for me to understand why such a character was in the movie without any explanation of why it existed except to kiss the real victims. <br /> <br /> I loved the way Ameba was cut out of the movie. I loved how Aiden's past was legally created, what is said to be a dramatic scene where he told Vivian how his father wanted him to learn self-defense, and then beat his father in "self-defense" to be tragic as such. <br /> <br /> Character 180 is fun if it's completely unnecessary. At the end of the film, I felt that when a person wrote a novel, wrote down half of the list of characters, pulled here and there a couple of contacts, noted that Gabriel was a bit jerk, Vivian fell in love with Aiden, he fears him when he discovers that he is a legend of legends -garou, and "someone" is "killed by a silver ball" and is a happy ending because Vivian finally feels who loves him whom he is. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 2/10 because the camera shots were relatively decent and the casting could have been worse, but when the management goes, why is the loup-garous leap into the human form as they would like to fly (their curved backrests and a tendency to jump from high places), shine briefly and then fall to the ground as wolves? The only aspects of this film that even saw it in the very end to the end of the varieties were the wolves, the beautiful landscapes and the boys of the eye candy. <br /> <br /> All together, I have to say that in order to enjoy this movie at all, be prepared for misconceptions, strange events that are not always explained, bleeding innuendos and whether you have liked the book or have not read the book .
