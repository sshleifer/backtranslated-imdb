I think Homegrown is a somewhat erratic development of this movie - rather "Plantation Grown" - but it doesn't have the same circle. My guide described it as a comedy, but the pathetic aspirations of these unhappy buffs are not my idea of ​​laughing on the stomach. More farcical thriller / drama genre. The characters are well developed - all cast from the star made it so promising, but a shame that the plot was completely absurd. Ted Danson gave a fine home like Jamie Lee Curtis in his walking section. Jon Bon Jovi is able to measure THC content in his front seat! I think you should sit down for a while - not on the paranoid type of weapon.
