I've never been a big fan of Larry Clark, but I've somehow dragged almost every one of his films. Now, I like independent movies, and I grew up in punk rock and I would like to say that this movie is a disappointing audience. Not every punk song contains "Oh!" in your choirs, as in this movie. <br /> <br /> The real problem with this movie is that it turns the mood every fifteen minutes and there is no cohesion. Clark has lived on pretending that his fictional story is "how kids really are" and as such you let him play scenes of stylish dialogue for ten minutes, not moving anywhere, because it is the cinema's blood feeling. But when he lets a ridiculous death scene (choose one of them, except for the opening race), the stylized experiments I assume are black humor, completely out of context, ridiculously fired (in most cases that are much worse than student films) and the story is completely ridiculous. John Cassavettes and "Date Movie" make poor beds, because the last style brings you to any reality to remind you that you are watching a movie - really, really bad.
