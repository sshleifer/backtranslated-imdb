If you want a terrible interpretation of "MacBeth", this is your answer. Filled with archaic Shakespearic English in the 21st century Australian environment, this film is disappointing and leaves you scratching your head. But that's not all. <br /> <br /> Not only sophomoric sequences, but there are many scenes where a female body is displayed. The witches that are played by actors who resemble school girls more than witches make MacBeth a soft affection for a nice affection. Welcome to stupidity and paralysis - all at the same time. <br /> <br /> The wonder why this project was green. So much for a modern cheesy movie. "D-"
