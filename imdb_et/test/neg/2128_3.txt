A man (Goffredo Unger) is found at sea in the wreckage of his destroyed boat, right on the coast of Florida. There are no helicopter winches beneath the knees that only reveal her both legs. Dr. Stella Dickens (Valentine Monnier) and her partner Dr. Bob Hogan (Lawrence Morgant) is a biologist who deals with marine dolphin research. While at sea, Hogan hears strange high noise. He's interesting and Stella hired Peter (Micheal Sopkiw) and his assistant Sandra (Iris Peynado) to create a device for finding and tracking a source or something like that, because it's not very clear. In the meantime, a person inside the organization is brutally murdered as a scientist named Florinda (Cinthia Stewart), working for the rival organization West Ocean International. More people are being attacked and Sheriff Gordon (Gianni Garko John Garko) is the case. Peter, Stella, Hogan and Sandra went to the sea. Soon they will find evidence that there may be something frightening and very unfriendly under the surface. Together with rival scientist Donald West (William Berger), Sheriff Gordon, and the US Army, they tried to destroy the monster, but there are other ancient forces at work, because no one wants the genetically modified creature to be in any way open to cost! Director: Lamberto Bava, John Old Jr. The Gianfranco Clerici, Herve Piccini and Dardando Sacchetti scripts are slowly slow and most people will sleep even before the 90-odd minute duration. The monster has barely been used, much of this film is made up of boats and helicopters. The big pieces of the first semester focus not so much on the mysterious "who's behind it" part of this story. There is really nothing to talk about, a boy with both legs bitten and someone with one hand. The special effects on the monster are generally poor and are shown to be very flashy, disappointing. A virtual nobody will help you sit more easily. There really isn't much to recommend this movie, so I don't. Don't worry, you can do a lot better.
