This film could have been put together in about 10 minutes. I don't know what everyone else was smoking, calling it a beautiful movie. I feel a few hours of my life was stolen from me and I want them back. I'd put it in the battlefield category. Yes, people are so bad. You would do just as well to watch a two-minute clip of this movie that has the same effect. DO NOT REMOVE WORKING TIME !!!
