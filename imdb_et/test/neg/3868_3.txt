Seven collaborations between director Joseph "von" Sternberg and star Marlene Dietrich were so different in appearance and tone, and differ from the time they were, they seem to be almost their own genre. Like any genre, they have their own direct masterpieces, as well as their absolute turkeys. Time to send Russian Veene back to the farm. <br /> <br /> After seed-spotting hits, Blue Angel, Morocco and Shanghai Express, where Miss Dietrich set up her screen as a cabaret-singer-cum-prostitute, someone in Paramount decided to play Marlene's time. There's nothing wrong with that; as an actor he was a part. It's just that nothing else has changed the format. It's like a blue angel plus a baby. Sufficient, the story of a woman who drags her child with sloppy spirits is a good prerequisite for tragic drama, but that is not the case. Dietrich's journey is played as an adventure, using his way of thinking and associates to stay away from the law. This is not a little example of the pre-code libertarianism? it is just odd unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Although we can accept Marlene as a mommy, it is absolutely impossible to buy Sternberg as a manager of heat and poignancy. Although it is one of a handful of pictures for which he wrote credit, Sternberg just can't get the story. The emotional profitability of a film should be the final reunion of the family, but even at the beginning it is not defined as something worthy of a return. As usual, the Sternberg interiors are dressed and shot so that they look like brothels or crazes. Faradays' home is actually a rather creepy environment, and it is a wonder that little Johnny hadn't moistened the bed or asked for sleep. <br /> <br /> But as everyone knows, Dietrich's / Sternberg's idea is that Dietrich looks stunning, and at least Blonde Venus is successful in this respect. Marlene is highlighted in a bright, shiny close-up of a forest pool, and even when she's split, she loves her. The same cannot be said of the other casting that Sternberg tends to see in the mobile landscape. Usually, this pleasant Herbert Marshall is hidden in the shadows here. Even a vibrant and lively Cary Grant just becomes a boring wallpaper and doesn't seem interesting enough for Dietrich to be empty. <br /> <br /> The Only Moments In Blonde Venus, Marlene's singing and dancing courses, especially the well-known Hot Voodoo number, where she parodies her surrealist stage, rises gorilla clothes. But even they feel they are cut and pasted from another movie. Sternberg fans can do it for another masterpiece, because they are customary, but it is a tremendous disappointment for the average punter. The times did not slip it because they had previous hits, and it marked Marlene's end of flowering. A year later would Paramount have a new queen? Mae West.
