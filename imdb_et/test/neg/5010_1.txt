I tried to look at it and I was very disappointed. Don't wait for an intelligent and insightful humor in the area of ​​Amy's brother David in the middle of this dreck ... it's a polar reverse. But if you're joking, fart and boner jokes, you're in the Seventh Heaven. This is the humor of the bathroom, which I assume, those who have had several bongs, which can only explain why many ecstatic reviewers have proclaimed it as "ever the best television writing". I assume that those who hate such simple humor could not look long enough to look at the overview, but I just send a warning image to those unaware viewers looking for top-notch comedy. The characters move over. The impact factor is set to 10. And laughs are reset (unless you are naturally looking for a minor, low-eyed humor). <br /> <br /> I did this for 40 minutes, praying all the time, turning a corner into valuable entertainment, but unfortunately worsened and worsened. And take care of Amy's constant and hammy overbite expression - it makes the eyes roll. It was nice to see the comets I know from recognizable comic artists, but I can only assume that they agree to participate in the Sedaris family. <br /> <br /> For those who loved it, I'm sorry. this is my opinion. It was so bad that it inspired me to write my first review.
