this exhibition is just terrible. I liked to see Drake and Josh, which was great, and before that, Amanda's show was also funny, but it's just FULL. in my view, it seemed like watching those Seltzberg films that were painful and inexplicable. it is about 3 stupid @ $$ children who make a dirty web-example (while stealing a hole in Ithing), while their slowed brother makes sculptures (he has no life). cast is crap, megan from drake and josh is harsh (AHHHHHH!) ugly b! tch is sam and some guy they pulled on the street playing fred. all I saw about it (ugg) are random jokes, including brother making clay material, he also played the arcade game PAC (genious), Sam and Carly, who slow down their webcast, and Fred is dork. the only episode I saw (can't remember the title) where Fred gets lucky if he doesn't hold the email address. and why the heck they get youtube jack @ $$ fred, get AVGN to cancel show their potty mouth. just leave it in the show.
