I've only seen a minimum wage episode, but I don't want others to see how this can be done? Morgan starts to theatrically complain about his terrible situation, which lives right at the start of the minimum wage, and the complainant never stops. Never. Fortunately, the viewer, his skinny girl is as annoying as Morgan (if not even more annoying). <br /> <br /> And then all up, they go to the movies and buy bottled water for 2.50, and then go to the restaurant to eat all the time, of course, * drumroll * complain about the malice. <br /> <br /> I don't care if other episodes can be better or not. No one should watch this mess.
