This story was a good movie potential. Complex choice of love for money and wrong and regret wrong. However, the film was destroyed by the horrible confusion of Robert Redford, like a villain who offers $ 1,000,000 to Demi Moore to sleep. As Redford has to pay for it. Redford's boy looks good and the whole American charm just doesn't cut it into improbable, threatening, shining. Redford actors are inadequate to threaten their character. I see it now, $ 1,000,000, to sleep with Robert Redford. OK tells the lady, but you have to give me time to raise money. Jack Nicholson would have been perfect as a sleazeball.
