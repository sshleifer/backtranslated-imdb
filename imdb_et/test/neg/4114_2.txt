Ray Bradbury, run and hide! This sticky film of the 1950s story of short-term time and its impact on de-evolution is not well-known for the theater race (does it exist?) And now exists as a DVD on shelves issued in a slow week. <br /> <br /> What seems to be a fictional sci-fi thriller, opening scenes quickly make us stupid because computer-generated graphics run unchanged for the entire movie, which should be different. back in time, when a big company sells macho-boys in 2055 to hunt for dinosaurs, paying excessive fees to drive back to prehistoric jungles over time. One slip of the legs / butterflies in one of these activities and the evolutionary evolution has changed when the planet is subjected to slow waves that change everything to human eating plants and beast. Of course, there is a pretty girl who knows how to turn around the process and hunky man risk her life to act on her orders and everything is finally OK. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is the story ... and the most surprising thing about this poorly written, abysmal-like confusion in the movie is that it attracted certain features into the comic book. Edward Burns (all buff and hunky) is our hero, Ben Kingsley is a bad bad guy who sports a ridiculous white wig, Catherine McCormack is an all-female woman and Wilfried Hochholdinger is evil - everyone is a great actor and should have known better than this flop alignment. And the saddest thing is that those who like this sci-fi monstrous genre sold the creative agency with some of the most important animations to capture the screen for a long time. Must stay.
