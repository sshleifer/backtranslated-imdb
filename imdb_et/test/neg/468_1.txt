what a waste of film again is not a definite filmmaker in the film industry that could have been just a man's idea. in his theory or evolution there is practically nothing, rather than the most boring life and relationships of one daughter, a meaningless script, the great freedoms of Darwin's life, a dialogue about his character, which I find difficult to believe he would have heard. Darwin never gave up his belief in superiority, he might not quite rightly believe in the Christian ideas created by God, but he was not an atheist. this movie means. what would have been riveting and a much better film would have been to begin by revealing the origin of the species and creating a story of the great revolution that accompanied it, and the amazing side. Instead, we got a broad, boring drama that basically constituted great injustice
