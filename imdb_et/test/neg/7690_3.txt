The leap and the great advances of this film are proof of how desperate our people are for a good independent Saudi movie. The tremendous success of Tash Ma Tashi is also evidence. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to start with the importance of making movies because what is probably halfway to the movies is obvious. I've changed the world. <br /> <br /> And I don't tell you how many films our society needs to find out the many problems we have in our country. Religion, politics, women's rights, education, general health, terrorism, law and more. <br /> <br /> The news also came from a fist about the Saudi film, which should have improved some problems, especially for the young. Instead, we experienced a bald film for that. <br /> <br /> The ignorance and naivety of the script was obvious. It would be like a 13-year-old who wrote it. <br /> <br /> Now I've heard that the budget for this movie was high. I would like to know where the money went from? The effects were really ugly, editing was bad. The script was "kharabeet". You really don't know what this story is and what the director's aim is. The other thing about the role of religious friends that he had was not how religious boys operate here in Saudi Arabia! They are not "bad" as this film is about. In fact, they are some of the most enjoyable people you will ever meet with some rare lifestyles, and it should have appeared on the film. <br /> <br /> Young people here follow religion because the reason is that young people are the most passionate and sentimental. And well-established principles of religious youth, young people follow them. Again, it should have appeared. <br /> <br /> We need another "first movie" with Saudi Writer, actor, director, composer, even an operator. That they all work passionately for their test, not just for money! <br /> <br /> And we should do what Shakespeare did hundreds of years ago, we should add phrases from the Qur'an. movie. As people in our society still see art as a form of sin, the challenge facing Saudi Arabian filmmakers is to change mentality in this sense.
