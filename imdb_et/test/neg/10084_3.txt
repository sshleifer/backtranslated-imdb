Tyra and the rest of the modeling world must know that real women like me and my daughter do not care that all the ridiculous modeling sells something. Strange places, too much makeup and too much skin are not needed. Sex does not always sell to women. The same applies to the hitchhiking trail, which seems unnatural. People come in all shapes and sizes and they have to have it in the show. My daughter is 36 inches long, long and thin and size 5, I'm more than 12-digit. We'd like to see that both of them - I don't see how something would look when size 2 carries it. I don't buy magazines anymore because they're one-sided on this issue, we really would like an exhibition to consider women of all sizes.
