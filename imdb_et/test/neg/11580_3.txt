The team of amateur journalists and fruit huggers is trying to bring a secret government project, the Carnivore project, far off the island of the Pacific Island. Scientists produce giant corn, but genes spread to other species, creating abnormally large Komodo dragons and beasts (one who is bullet-proof and floats underwater). Can they get out of the island and tell the world with the help of the scientist's daughter? Even though I didn't see this movie on the Sci-Fi channel (which I unfortunately did), the Sci-Fi Channel screamed with its low production performance, weak effect, and some of the worst special effects in history. The effects here are comparable to another creature movie "Raptor Island", though not nearly as bad. I suspect that there must be at least one handful of people who worked on both films, but I have not confirmed it and probably not. It's a sad day when I see either movie again. <br /> <br /> That doesn't mean it's not enjoyable. I watched it in the morning with my sister's boyfriend and I can't talk about her, but I thought it was a pretty good time. That's a bad thing, it's a fun picture if you want to have fun with the movies, and the researcher's daughter is attractive enough to wear a movie (I think the actress is Michelle Borth). Michael Pare also appears as the captain of the ship, and his poor choices make his work "overturned" apparently honorable (even if this film is unbearably bad). <br /> <br /> I can't be too big against this movie just because it was more or less exactly what I thought it would be. Bad influence? Low budget? Appointing participants? I had no major hopes. But that does not mean it will be awesome. When turned on, there is nothing proud and it will slowly disappear into the remote memory department. One fan who likes this film (and calls it "KvC") keep your copy because you have time to get a replacement.
