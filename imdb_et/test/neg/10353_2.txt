I looked at the first episode and found it to be a very woody performance. <br /> <br /> I have looked at the original from the last series of Big Girls Blouse to seven. Kath and Kim were great at Mocumentary and it's humor is something most people get. <br /> <br /> But in this American version I found it to be boring, Molly Shannon is in fashion to be Kath's day, Kath's wardrobe has been stuck in the 80s. The face of Selma Blair, who dresses on clothes, is not as good as the original Kimmy wore. I also found that Selma seemed to have a lot of flatulence, she's probably (Australia) size 12, where Kim should be (Australia) with a size of 16/18. <br /> <br /> Changes from Molly and Selma are obviously both written and paused where there should be no breaks or pauses a bit long, because someone suggested that they could be laughing there during these breaks. It's like Molly and Shannon is not used to each other, there is no mother / daughter chemistry. <br /> <br /> Phil was fine when he had eccentric air like Kel. But Craig was beautiful and not sweet, normal, who lowered Brett from the Aussie version. <br /> <br /> I found that it was like playing a very bad stage. The action was pretty much wood, and the exaggeration of Selma's expressions was funny in ten minutes. Especially his stabbing scenes. All in all, I think this exhibition is a waste of time, the script is obviously exhausted by the Americans, who say most on the table they prefer the original. When NBC wanted to show Kath and Kim why not pay producers money for screening the original. <br /> <br /> Everything I can add is Magda, one of the smart cookies to keep manufacturers from using Sharon's character.
