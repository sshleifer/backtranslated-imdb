Donald Sutherland, an American palaeontologist who visits England, takes a tourist one evening. Two years later, when he discovered a man's address book in his car, he returned a book to a man's rich home to find that he had been killed. No one from the family or from there seems to care that the traveler could not kill (his mother) because he was in a Sutherland car during a crime. <br /> <br /> Sutherland is a man's alibe, but it's too late. In terms of guilt, he monitors the real murderer. <br /> <br /> The mysteries of Agatha Christie usually include several different people, all of whom are one or another motive of the crime, all suspect, and a puzzle that depends on a strict schedule. Often, not always, there is a conjunct with whom the researcher can talk about things. <br /> <br /> Due to the misery of the situation, one must carefully monitor whether the mystery is the reader or viewer of each element. The exaggeration is all right. We need to keep characters and lines straight. Christie's films are rare where the use of famous faces with subordinate characters is actually beneficial. (Jacqueline de Bellefort? Oh, yes, this is Mia Farrow.) But this version of "Ordeal by Innocence" is a Golan-Globus production, all of which requires production values, a thoughtful prepared script and skills in the first few minutes when Sutherland discovers that the innocent person is hung is good. After that, everyone is thrown into the viewer in scrapbooks, often with sudden setbacks or confusing voice commands that don't tell us anything. The script has slapdash quality, as if two were assembled overnight. Few faces are familiar and it doesn't help at all. All the remarks about everyone else and the names become hopeless. The music point consists of four instruments that make irritating atonal jazz rafts. Some nudity is being thrown into the audience to awaken bulldozers. If Dame Agatha was alive, she would be among the viewers who had to wake up. <br /> <br /> Dullsville.
