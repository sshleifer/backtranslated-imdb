How does such a thing go home with my DVD player in the world? How is it even packaged and distributed? Is the movie (and I use this term loosely) absolutely zero screens before it is placed on the shelf of the video store? I'm all for DIY, but come on! It doesn't give me the right to get a group of my friends and relatives, a terrifying video camera, a terrible story, and put it all together to make a bunch of pile of nonsense and call it a movie. And I would like people to end with the words "Indie" and "Campy" to describe these films. They are also not. In no other profession would it be anything acceptable. If someone tried to sell you a car that was as bad as this movie, take it back and say it was a lemon. If this were a surgical procedure, you would complain to the doctor for a violation. I wish I could look back on my time and money after that. Shame in the video shops who have such movies in stock. They are hanging over the public. You want "campy"? Go to every Friday the 13th movie (even LATER) or Dead-Alive. At least those who do not want to kill themselves. This is thanks to films that automatically transform people into waste.
