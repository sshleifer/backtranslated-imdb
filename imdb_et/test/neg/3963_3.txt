You know, the movie could have been a lot better if the animal - in this case a small dog - is the best actor on the screen! Acting in this movie is so bad, so amateurish, when the dog saw it ashamed. He (Rusty, our Golden Retreiver) could have done a better job than the local people. <br /> <br /> At the moment it is a little story: the child finds the animal, the pet doesn't like it, and one of the parents does not want it, but the "pet" holds one child and is now a hero and official family member. Sound familiar? I remember that this movie is a big hit, but it could never be seen until the middle of VHS. I was shocked at how bad it was. Why so much clips over the film? Is it because there was so much in the early 70s that there was a nice family movie inside the crowd? Possible. In the decade of the 1970s, there were not many healthy entertainments, and many people are lovely to suck a small natural story. Who can stand this cute little dog? Not me. But the movie I can resist: it's a class B storyline with a terrible effect. <br /> <br /> Recommended only for lovers of small dogs and I mean "lovers" because even the average pet owner sleeps trying to watch this movie on that day.
