Ah another Seagal movie.Not less than a few months arrive to populate the video store shelves.As bad as drowned? No. But it does not say much.Like a perfume pig. <br /> <br /> Seagal is a professional thief who wants to give up, but goes to the last job to get his boss to double. He is imprisoned and friendly with a gangster who helps him break out and pay back. <br /> <br /> It is good to see that Seagal does not end up playing an agent, a policeman or what he usually plays. We are actually seeing a US location in Las Vegas. Then Eastern European territory as usual. There is no wire-fu here. Fauntleroy does the job properly. <br /> <br /> But most of Stevie's action and combat scenes have clearly doubled. Other films, the lack of reality and logic even the smallest situation. Seagull and Treech are doing so-so team inspirational (inadvertent) laughs one minute.Sighs rest. <br /> <br /> Several remarkable faces turn up to slumm it .. sleepy Kevin Tighe has a long way from his emergency day. Nick Mancuso appears in sleep mode to take check.No more rappers.Please? <br /> <br /> Action scenes and plots are more predictable and more generally recycled than ever before. a hidden scene that Seagal needs to escape or hang.
