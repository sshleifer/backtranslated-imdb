Cheap, brilliantly bad cheese from the 80's decade of cheese. I watched this first uncut and un-MST3K, and it was pretty much ridiculous even without comments. <br /> <br /> The plot (as it is) rotates around the apocalyptic world where AI robots turned around (familiar?) and destroyed pretty much everything, leaving world ruins so bad that no one can breathe. Few people left behind act as slaves to a mysteriously called blind, which seems to be part of the computer and part of the organic nature. The work of airborne slaves produces energy for breathing air. At any given time, Dark One has the strongest air slaves to fight death, so that no one will rise as the leader of the Dark Rebellion. <br /> <br /> Okay, this is so-called serious things. It is stupid stuff like ridiculous quasi-futuristic clothing, all sporting, including car seat cover “fur clothes, back and spangles and tights (mostly worn by Dark One smile, chick with an unknown and almost incomprehensible accent) . Or wood-working and inclined lines, sported by all the so-called "actors" who are in the dialogue with high prediction and low sense. Or a dime with a special fx, including pink sock teeth glued "deadly" sewer snakes, a bomb made of tightened piano wire and tin can and terrible "mutants" Halloween rubber masks. <br /> <br /> The Air Slave Band follows its leader, the mysterious traveler, who has adapted to the outdoor air to go to the energy company to destroy the darkness. The man's name is Neo, which explains where Wachowski's brothers got the idea of ​​Matrix. They meet along the way with the Amazon group, where there is a mandatory fight where the female is the best (of course). Has anyone ever noticed that every Amazon movie or t.v. Show ever produced, these so-called amazing warriors always get their bucks by both men and women? I think Amazon is just a pansies, <br /> <br /> This particular warrior band goes through the Central Park ... errr ... devastated lands that are beyond the last permanent city (a good way to save money) destroyed New York matt paintings) and traveling to the sewer leading to the power plant, where Dark One and his go-go girl hernwoman Valeria procure. Here they are destroying such wild wildlife like giant bands, a giant spider, and a lobster robot who is one of Dark One's personal guards. <br /> <br /> The final showdown is pretty sad. One of the slaves, the daughter whose father took the darkness because he had created a way for people to breathe air, sees his father's "dark consumed", which means he has up to three major adventures destroying darkness by turning off some switches , and the robot holocaust dies not with the bang, but with embarrassment. lines, and that's the end.
