The story, as I understand it, is based on "real events." It can be either good or bad, depending on what license these real events take and how they are rendered. <br /> <br /> In this case, the results are enough to pull the maggot. I didn't expect much to expect - the hope for a story of rich high school students taking a naval cruise under the stern captain. That is, what I thought was the age layer associated with the boot camp or basic training, what type of drill sergeant says, "It is my duty to turn you off from your hostile civilian ways." Well, that's it. Children start their children and end up as an organic group. But it's a lot of hockey than any boot-camp movie I've ever seen, beyond intentional comedy. Who WROTE does this thing? The air is full of slogans that do not belong to high school but to the third grade. Dialogue violates the ear. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges usually does better than average, but in this case his performance is mediocre. He doesn't support anything more than that, though it's hard to know how much he can do with them. The rest is unknown and some children are painfully inadequate. There's a lot of tearing and crying. The best scene includes dolphin. <br /> <br /> Immature clich√©s continue to end. The Coast Guard is guided by a court of hard hearts at a post-disaster hearing. The interviewer does nothing if he hits Bridgette over his head, misinterpreting and wronging events. "You let the team drink alcohol, didn't you?" (A couple of harmless drinks.) "And you didn't punish them, even though you punished them for killing the fish." (Dolphin business.) The technical details surrounding jamming are rough. What's "white squared" anyway? And if it is as dangerous as Bridges claims, why didn't the entire team warn and carry the habitat? But why go? If "The Albatross" was Dreadnaught, it would still be torpedoed and ridiculous with a ridiculous comic book script.
