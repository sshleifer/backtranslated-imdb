If you look at low budget horror movies as much as I can, you can get where you can tell who is involved in creating the movie, because every filmmaker adds a taste to the cheese. This is the case with Jack-O. When I looked at this really horrible movie, I was undoubtedly feeling that Fred I Ray was involved, perhaps not as a leader, but in a sense, and when I looked, I found that I was right. Only Fred and a handful of others could write something such a pathetic thing, and that movie was just Fred Ray. If you don't like Fred I am Ray (and God knows only why anyone should), then avoid this movie. If you are planning to rent a Ray image, rent a Hollywood chainsaw Hookers, this is the only bright shining star I am Ray Ray in the dark movie.
