This film is probably made with a very small budget, but did they make it so obvious? They seem to have made no effort to make the "future" the least futuristic. For example, the first scene in 80's office buildings, and all the cars that have been blown up, have been in the late 70's (I assume they didn't want to blow up cars that cost more than $ 500). In addition, it is obvious that Don "dragon" is driving his own car during the film (after all, he partially financed the movie). Finally, at the beginning of the film, they point out that all drugs are now legal in the new "cyber-point" society. Not only does it become important in the film, but later, when don needs surgery without anesthesia, why doesn't he just go out and get some legal heroin or morphine? The whole movie is like that and it's totally anti-cyclical, because Don just strikes the "unstoppable" Cybertracker for about 25 minutes. However, if you find this movie cheap or free, I would look at it, the last scene is almost worth the whole movie.
