This one is like the previous film "The Masters of the Universe", which is based on "He-man". Basically, you have a big old world and for some reason they have to be almost all the action of the movie in today's country. Well I think it is not such a modern country now and that it is an ancient world that is now strangely and a lot of good times. Well I think I can understand why they made almost the whole movie in today's and in this movie. Save money in costumes and kits. It is much easier to restore what is happening now than the strange world like the Eternia He-man or the ancient world, where there are cultures and strange pyramids, sacrifices and strange creatures that hug you. This movie is forgotten and not very fun, your first idea that this is not the best movie in the world is that Robert Z'Dar is in it. The only thing that has been done is animals that are not as widespread in this area as the latter. Marc Singer is back and it is sad that he seems to be in such a state, the guy was a pretty good actor who was trying to queue for a movie that wasn't really needed, and even if it was five years late.
