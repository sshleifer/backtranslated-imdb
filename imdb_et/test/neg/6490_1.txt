Charlie (George "Norm" Wendt) and Rhonda ("Just Say" Julie Brown) are a couple of cheerful, murderous aliens who turn to Earth and stumble upon a small western city. They become sheriffs deputies and give deadly justice to rushes, murderers, and others, coming to the disadvantage of some local people (led by Wayne Grace). Meanwhile, their sexy alien daughter (Anastasia Sakelaris) comes to the black man's spouse (Christopher M. Brown) to find them and TV journalists and government agents to spend time. <br /> <br /> What I can say is this deliberate attempt to cover all possible genres (comedy, sci-fi, horror, west ...) in one movie and what a stupid, awkward confusion it is, despite energetic action two stars. The script is awful.
