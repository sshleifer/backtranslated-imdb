"Mararía" is disappointed with me. I can't think of it as a bad movie, but the development seemed too hasty and incredibly that it created emotions. Dr Fermín shows some unprecedented odd behavior in passion that can't really understand where it was born. I mean, how many times does he talk to Mararía? Maybe once? Also, Mararía never seemed to be a true character, but rather a stereotype of the film, which was supposed to be in the movie (... or was there a need for a second title?). Some of the best actors came from a role that was not a story, Marcial, sublime but humble drunk, important. Of course, the landscapes, cultural tidbits and other "wow" moments of the Canary Islands were interesting, but the film remained a documentary (if it was his real intention) and, most importantly, a drama.
