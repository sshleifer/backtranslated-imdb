Another sadistic and ultra-sleazy late 70s / early 80s revenge movie? Wes Craven launched a popular trend for his "Last House on the Left", although "Terror Express" is more like other rip-offs, such as "I Spit on the Grave" and especially "Night Train Murders". Storywise, this movie is absolutely nothing new to offer that the only thing left to director Ferdinando Baldi was to multiply the sleaze-factor of a thousand! In fact, it is just a soft nuclear color, which ends a little closer. There are three hopelessly infiltrating losers on the Roman Bullfighter who are running amok. They provoke male travelers and sexually harass women. Things go a little out of control and a prostitute who circles around in three circles can get to the jail. This is a very annoying movie and there wasn't even enough money to buy a few bags of fake. These types of films are generally infamous for cruel rape sequences and discriminatory behavior towards women, but the Terror Express sex is not at all disturbing. On the contrary, these "rapists" spend more time orally on their victims when they get themselves! Music is great, dialogues are unintentionally fun and characters are the most laughable. Crooks are wimps and train passengers are so immobile that they look like part of it. If you enjoy using it as stupid as it gets, it's your movie. But the blood and contradictions of your hunger are definitely not left. "Terror Express" should be in the porn section of video portals.
