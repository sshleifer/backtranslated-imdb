I've seen it in Cologne's Fantasy Filmfest and left the cinema between this "movie" (with other people), so I'm not right to comment on it, but I think it's a "SC" leaving enough reason to do it. "S.C." is a different film. People who need a unified narrative, a sign or a drawing can't find it. It should be an experimental film based on the power of images. But these images have no power. They are so forced to simply pull people out of their intention to say nothing. The story of the narrator is just boring, the visuals are cheap. OK, the effect is good, but if that's the only thing, why take care? Husseins' film wants to be shocking and thought-provoking - instead it is boring and annoying in its non-creativity. Note: Not every movie that contains the story is art and no longer has any creativity in breaking taboos - especially when everything is filled as bad as "S.C." I would recommend that director Hussein should visit a psychiatrist or film school before he goes back to art again. Note: I never want to see a child cut back at birth.
