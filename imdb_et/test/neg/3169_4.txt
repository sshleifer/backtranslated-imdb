Although Stephen Gyllenhaal is a good TV director with a good length for his credit, "Homegrown" is just a mess with his script and direction. Despite the performances by Billy Bob Thorton, John Lithgow, Kelly Lynch, Jon Bon Jov, Jamie Lee Curd and Ted Danson, this good film could not be recorded. <br /> <br /> Gyllenhaalics knows that Jake and Maggie are in the movie, but you don't see Jake very well and Maggie is only in that 30 seconds when the babysitter tilts Lithgow's character out of the bust. It's not even the bottom box of comedy when the movie was meant to be. It was not just funny.
