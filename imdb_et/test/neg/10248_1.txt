Galaxina is a real gem for professionals in bad movies. For truly frightening dialogue, action, and referral, it is not the right choice for people looking for a suitable movie. But if one of the genre's most unintentionally fun movies, it is invaluable for a good laugh. Particularly good are the scenes of Harley Davidson's worshiping cultural figure, and many other scenes offer the opportunity to laugh cheaply. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Dorothy Stratten's scenes cannot really be played, but as she plays an android, I think she can excuse her for doing wood. <br /> <br /> Bad movie enthusiasts, don't give it over!
