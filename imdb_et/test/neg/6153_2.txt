Wow! I didn't know this movie even before I was looking for another Mark Hamill's classic name (Time Runner). Some things are better unknown. Mark Hamill's role is quite limited. I'd compare her appearance in this film to all Vincent Price and Christopher Lee's 60's and 70's bad horror b movies. In these films, they appeared in the first and last 5 minutes of the film. Memorable, by Mark, so big as "Don't try to run. You're arrested." Did I mention that he says EXACT is more than once. Bill Paxton fell after the alien Uzumaki-type spirits of drugs and cheeses, because he came to this movie after he had set up a session after the binge. HAIR .. HAIR !!! .. The priceless Bill. It really should have been "GAME OVER" for Bill, but somehow ... he got treatment ... and went better ?? movies. This film blows. It's more boring and boring than Crazies. At least this movie was crazy ... it's just boring. DO NOT KNOW THIS MOVIRY.
