Oh God, it's so idiotic. Completely pointless, offensive and repulsive. Why writers have such a problem when we get together with Zoey and Chase, we all want them too! in traditional plays, the exhibition actually has more than one plot conflict, a concept. you can't even tell Zoey 101 episodes apart because the same thing happens every time. Quinn uses some strange thing from Dustin, Nicole is giggly and stupid, Zoey is just sure, Chase slobbers after him all the time, but he's amazingly noticing and Logan is a jerk. repeat. Quinn uses some strange thing from Dustin, Nicole is giggly and stupid, Zoey is just sure, Chase slobbers after him all the time, but he's amazingly noticing and Logan is a jerk. repeat. it's like a shampoo bottle. and the end of the movie, omg again. so pointless NOT ACID. it is like they specifically designed it so that the film would fit between the two episodes of the exhibition and the show would be completely unchanged after the film.
