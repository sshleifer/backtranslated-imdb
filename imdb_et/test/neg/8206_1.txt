How could it be possible to give the negative letters I would like for this stinkburger. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong if I LOOOOOOVVEEEEE has a good crappy movie. I am a big film festival like Octoman, Mars Wizard, Queen King and others. The real classic of B-cinema. <br /> <br /> But this movie makes Jack Nicolson and Boris Karloff in Terror as the Academy Award Winner !! Dialogues are so unnecessarily crushed and mostly used inappropriately. (ie, "I will now condense (yes, condense!) to your wishes. Action may have been much better if they had more logical lines. <br /> <br /> Story? What story, List A, is in exile because his wife had I'm still not sure about this number A (rich?) captain of the Fleet one and one of his ships who are attacking the island?

Only degradation is watching this movie. It's 90 minutes. (The case says it's 74 mins.) From your life, you can't get back. <br /> <br /> I only paid a bit for this and another movie. I still feel that I owe 50 cents even when sitting on it. <br /> <br /> All in all, the Dungeon Of Harrow had no name but was a cute cardboard cave.
