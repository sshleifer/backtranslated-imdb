Of all the movies I've seen, Rage must be one of the worst. Direction, LOGIC, consistency, changes in parcel scripts and dialogue made me aching. "How could anyone come up with something so dirty"? Gary Busey knows his "B" movies, but this is a definite "W" movie. (W = waste). <br /> <br /> Take, for example, about two dozen FBIs and local law firms around the caravan of a Jeep caravan. There is a MA inside the Jeep and it is confusing why all the police officers are. Within a few seconds, a big battle of weapons arises, the MA is killed directly. The prisoners broke down at Jeep when Gary and their blasting took place. Prisoners fall like dominoes and Jeep with Gary rides around and is not hit by one bullet / bullet. The MA is killed and gary seems to have not noticed that this guy is tough. Really miracle, not because the six-shooter had 300 balls, there is such a miracle.
