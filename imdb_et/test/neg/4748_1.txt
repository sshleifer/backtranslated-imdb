With this film, I really hoped that the idea was to compensate for the sparse incompatibility of the first AVP and yet for my fear: Requiem is much worse than I could have imagined. <br /> <br /> My hopes were up at the opening of the movie inside the Predator ship, and I almost breathed the relief when we finally saw the Predator's home world (visual digital matte, but still nice to finally see it) and then, of course, People ( When such badly written characters are called as such) are introduced ... <br /> <br /> It is a wonder why Fox is unable to make a good movie for foreigners and speakers. At least the expected filmmakers could have done their homework. <br /> <br /> The characters are created the same way as we expect on the worst Friday 13th. The pizza delivery scene was crumbling, which triggered all the other characteristic scenes that followed. Bimbos and teenagers not actors do not make a REAL movie, they make a cheap flick, and Alien 1-3 and Predator films were good because they were produced above the concept (remember that 1. Alien is "B" in the movie "A" in the movie) Strause ' i brothers really missed an opportunity that could have been improved by knowing just about their Alien + Predator: In foreigners as well as Predator, we introduce the characters in larger groups. Alien: Refiners, Foreigners: Marines, Alien 3: Prisoners and Predator Films We usually follow the main hero of the unit: Predator, Arnold - Special Forces, Predator 2: Danny Glover, Police) we have pirates ... or something, AVP we have ... investigators? ... with weapons? and of course in the AVP-R we have chilies. What's here? The idea that the convict returns to the small town and the warrior seemed to have been created for the first hero of the blood type, but like many things, it was never paid out. <br /> <br /> The film mechanism has no equal reason. There is no point in imparting momentum, but in small sequences that build the least fine tension or interest to cut just when they're interesting. The action scenes themselves, although many trailers in trailers, are so darkly lit, it is literally impossible to say what is happening during combat scenes when they finally occur. In principle, the film prevents it at many levels. Bad actors with a bad direction and a scary scenario (which I noticed as a scriptwriter myself seemed to hit every wrong note and clich√© that only the most unattractive writer who had no idea could have saved) WRITING, if you can name it, isn't even Direct video quality, nor does it demonstrate respect for legacy from previous series. Why is Predalien suddenly able to shoot a strange embryo under the throat of a pregnant woman to use her as a poison incubator? More than likely, since the brain dead scriptwriter needed a way to get more aliens to fight the predator (and the accelerated growth time even faster than the first AVP: as soon as possible. (Which means supposed characters) replaces the actual character development? What do they do, not say.) Why is the sheriff a cache of civilian weapons?) How do all the people of bimbo know where they are? Why does Predalien wait until Predator removes his mask very slowly before the attack? Why are foreigners still getting used to this nasty alien 3? it's time to let your harvest know how this series goes to the character that says, "People die ... we need weapons!" (how this writer works, is out of me and badly reflects Fox already destroyed it's like every one of the people involved in making this movie was suffering from a mental deficiency, or really what's wrong with every stage of the film process. <br /> > EFFECTS is pretty bad this time. Aliens look like suits for men and ADI is just lazy with their animal's design. Again, everything is shaded in such a state of darkness not to create a mystery or an atmosphere, but just to hide when the bad creatures are watching, and as in AVP, Stan Winston is seriously unanswered when the wrong looking Predator's face appears. br /> <br /> There are too many errors in the list, so I'm just saying this: Don't waste your money on this movie. l caring for fans, because this cheap and unpleasant film is clearly proof. I felt like I had seen it with my girlfriend (though it was free) and apologized to her after that. This is one fixed fan made with a franchise. <br /> <br /> Note to Fox: What we really didn't want was a nonsense slasher flick, it was an adaptation of the original Darkhorse Comicbook movie that was better than what you posted in 1993 for this franchise. <br /> <br /> Sign Out.
