If you and your friends find so much humor and enjoyment about terrible deeds, jokes, props and general movies like myself and my friends, you have to rent it. <br /> <br /> When you see what funny it is, you should assume that it is not funny, of poor quality, great, fun content. This is the story of some of the children who defy all laws of physics and reality and fly over time into today's world of large-screen television dinosaurs who will eventually become their friends. Not to mention a fun scene where T-Rex becomes the father of one child. Yes ... <br /> <br /> It should be in the comedy section, but you will find it in children's films if you find it at all. So call your friends, sit back, relax, get ready to laugh and have fun. You quote the ridiculous terrible liners of this film for weeks. "What's all about the ruck?!"
