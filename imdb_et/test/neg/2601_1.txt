this is the most obscure show on television. I believe people will continue to look at it because they feel they should, because it has become a somewhat "cool" show to see and talk to their friends the next day at work or school. rarely does it actually bring anything more than a break and does not cause the public any irony or thinking. each joke is interchangeable with "punchlines" that seem to have been pulled out of the hat. The lack of complete originality with even somehow lamer spin off it has emerged (see: American Dad) makes me question intelliegence of the audience that continues to keep this terrible show on TV. I give hosts any points and God can be merciful to my soul ...
