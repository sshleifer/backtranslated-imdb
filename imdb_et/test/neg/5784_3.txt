Navy Seals is an unfamiliar, racist and self-satisfied movie that uses the Middle East conflict in an unintentional way when the background is occupied by an American-oriented western audience. Both the conflict and those involved are simply used as cannon fodder to honor those photogenic young Americans who kill Arabs for pride. But worse still, the action stages of the film are handled slowly and fail, which prevents the navy gaskets from working even as a meaningless shoot-up. <br /> <br /> Charlie Sheen's character (Hawkins) is disgusting, unpleasant, ignorant, reckless, and above all racist. He refers to the Middle East as a ** t-hole and its inhabitants as "rag-heads". Throughout the film, the navy seals have been honored by the use of Lebanese natives as cannons. They kill these people with an indiscriminate attitude. There is even a tasteless murder of a young young Lebanese boy, captured by Hawkins; Hawkins makes his language fun before he shot him again, while he makes another humorous. In addition to being tasteless, it should be unacceptable. The extreme (albeit predictable) American attitude of the film is also disgusting. This can be seen when a Lebanese-American female journalist tells Hawkins that terrorists cannot speak because "they are religious eager." Hawkins then goes "yes, and we are naval seals!" The effect is obviously that zealodes are meaningless alongside American military power. Moreover, even after insulting this journalist's racial heritage and treating him as a sexual object, the script requires that he cannot resist this nasty ass and he still sleeps with him - because he is All-American Navy Seal. It marginalizes the character of the journalist, making him subordinate to Hawkins' "superior" pro-American attitude, despite his offensive behavior against him. In addition to ethics, this plot's torsion also has little faith as a drama. The scenario is also amateurish. Most scenes are simply put together without thinking of mood, plot or character development. The "Music Video" scene on the golf course is just eye-catching editing. Also, the two scenes where Charlie Sheen plays reckless heroes are also pointless. In one, he jumps from a moving car to a bridge to show his companions how tough he is, and on the other hand he drives a tow truck under a tow truck and drives his car. Both scenes have no follow-up, both are highly unlikely to affect the plot as a whole. They are just a candy designed to introduce Hawkins to cheap all-American heroes and are poor body substitutes. Most other plot development words are also poorly filmed and poorly scripted because - in fact, this spirit affects the whole movie. In addition to the African-American Navy's seal and his wife, and Michael Biehn and Charlie Sheen's characters, all the other crew members seem to be unfamiliar with the audience, so that if the climatic scenes surrounding it do not see anyone and someone's death lament. <br /> <br /> In such a movie, sequences of activity can potentially save production. But here they are not. They are poorly managed, ill-illuminated and showcase badly done tricks. In fact, their direction is so poor that they are almost unrelated to the viewer, as a result of which not only the scenes are difficult to follow, but also because of the lack of complete fear and intermediate control. Bad lighting only adds to their impotence. Explosions seem fake, firearms are not convincing, and one of the bolder stunts involving Mercedes refueling in a tank looks like a stunt staged on the back and then poorly edited. <br /> <br /> The end of the Navy Seals ends the coins on the eyes of its production. First of all, the slow moving "running-off-big-explosion-this-should-be-killed-me" scene is mandatory, where Sheen is wearing Biehn's back. This was probably the default scene that was supposed to be the star of the movie trailers. Then there is an end when the sailor is wounded and the freezer of the seal team floating in the ocean is saved. This submarine had actually returned home long ago, but of course he was back from time to time. All of this, despite the violent and stressful trials of the seals, and despite the fact that many of their colleagues were just killed, many of them still bleeding sharply, they can all laugh from the heart, blessing America gently. Predictable? You can just imagine this end when you look at the open credit. <br /> <br /> This film uses the Middle East conflict indiscriminately as a tool for 'photogenic young leaders'. Arabs are treated badly and modestly, and their killing in the film is used as a driving force for the exaltation of the use of the American army against a "worse" minority in a free environment. The events of 2001 have pointed out that such unpleasant and general trivialisation of such minority conflicts is certainly not a consequence. In the Middle East, it is no longer possible to write ** ** a t-hole full of towel heads that knock out one another (citing here Charlie Sheen); now is the place where engagement can have serious consequences. Today, it is recalled that the consequences of such arrogance can be quite close to home. That is why it seems that at least the naval seals look pretty stupid these days; but it must be kind. This is a very unknown film whose production values ​​and professionalism are equally suspect. Navy seals are ideologically and artistically complete insult to their audience.
