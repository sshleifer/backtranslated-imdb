John Wayne is undoubtedly one of the most popular and loved actors of all time. His career was stretched over forty years, during which time he played films such as "Angel and Badman", "The Green Berets", "Iwo Jima Sands", "Rio Bravo", "North Alaska" and "" Undefeated ". > <br /> The film above is welcomed as some of his best, unlike the 1934 effort of "Randy Rides Alone", which is pretty much forgotten when the time is over, which is surprising as it is not memorable after 53 minutes very short driving time. <br /> <br /> Young John Wayne plays Randy Bowers, who, for ever, never came to the center of the cabin and finds everything inside was killed. Randy there and they arrest him, accusing him of being a gang member and being required to find out where his other gang is. He is accused of murder. Sally Rogers, whose uncle was in the cabin and murdered, arrives in prison to see Randy that he was one of the gang members (he hid the secret space when shooting took place). Sally doesn't believe Randy is a killer and she doesn't know her, so when the sheriff is out, she slips and Randy flees. Running away from Sheriff and his position, Randy conveniently falls into the gang's cave, who was responsible for the murders. Randy tries to clear his name and raise the gang. <br /> <br /> Randy Rides Alone can be a fun movie to watch, especially if you're a John Wayne fan. However, it has too many errors that cannot be ignored. The film is also very dated as you think; we have a terrible camera that makes everyone look like they are moving in very fast motion and the dialogue is terrible. The actor is not too big, and Wayne's character is very woody, and with the rest of the pain looks like wooden dolls led by someone (in this case the director is Harry Fraser). Harry Fraser is in the wheel and doing a good job, but the story is thin. Can't help, but it seems like there's about ten minutes from the start of the movie, because Randy arrives somewhere and is waiting for someone. An explanation of why Randy was there later gives what is like P.I, who was sent to investigate the claims someone is trying to take over the city. Frankly, I didn't really pick it up, most of the time I was hoping for the end of the movie. I enjoyed it and found it to be quite fun at times. But it's not really a big movie, and it's not really worth it or to be watched. <br /> <br /> In general, "Randy Rides Alone" is incredibly dated and is tiring to the west with very little redemption. It may be fun, but in general it is not a great movie and it is definitely one of Wayne's weaker outings.
