Blackwater Valley Exorcism is located in a small town where it has been found that teenagers Isabelle (Kristin Erickson) are traveling with dog blood. Her parents, Ely (Randy Colton) & Blanche (Leslie Fleming-Mitchell), have a ranch and are deeply concerned about her daughter, lately she has not been herself and is considered a threat to her and others. Ranch hands and former priest Miguel (Del Zamora) acknowledge Isabelle's symptoms in the event of possible possession, and when he starts speaking the ancient Latin with a strange voice, he is convinced of this. Blanche invites King Jacob (Cameron Daddo), his second daughter to former Claire (Madison Taylor), to see Isabelle, confirms Miguel's suspicions and accepts the exorbism that will hopefully release the demon Isabelle and the innocent girl free. .. <br /> <br /> Leaded by Ethan Wiley I sat in my house in front of my TV channel, watching Blackwater Valley Exorcism, and I asked the same question over and over, why I do it. Why am I sitting through all these terrible low budget horror movies that look like they were shot on a camcorder? The truth is, Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete and totally unmistakable removal of The Exorcist (1973) and literally pointed out the main plot points that these two parts share. There's a prevailing teenage girl who starts to be horny and hints at inappropriate things, a demon who uses past misdemeanors against other troubled parents, the way a doctor, a girl hidden in the priest's troubled past, and the overwhelming girl, is inter alia tied to her bed. I think that if Blackwater Valley Exorcism is different (except that it is a total mess) it will try to give all the characters and try to overcome how the situation affects them, but it is so badly written and acted boring. The film starts with Isabelle, so we never knew what it was like a normal person, so we never care about her and what's going on with her, the rest of the characters are badly written and perfect. Sometimes I was wondering if Blackwater Valley's exorcism was a scam, there was a silly scene where the vet was trying to calm Isabelle's horse sedatives and after she claimed she needed a little stabbing, she entered her room with a huge needle. behind your back! There are a few scenes where people are captured by the comedy sound effect. The tone of this film is uneven, as it goes between foolish and foolish dramas of fears, or at least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> According to some texts, Blackwater Valley was Exorcism before the opening credit. "Actual events", yes right events since 1973, in the movie "Exorcist ... This text also says that the exorcism scenes were followed by a real priest. There is not even a proper update or exploit to liven up things, there is a cut arm scene, there is a dead dog, someone is drilled with crucifix and it's about it. Despite the demon trying to be outrageous, it's not a surprisingly bad language. I imagine Blackwater Valley Exorcism has an adult rating because one very short One of the naked female breasts is not worth the time and the money you spend on it. Also, the whole movie has a fear of zero, no atmosphere and a truly amateurish feeling. <br /> <br /> A budget of about $ 1,000,000, I have to say, I don't know where all the money went, the film looks ugly & cheap. There are no special effects to talk about, and no production effect The actors are very poor from all involved, the favorite Jeffrey Combs in the genre opens up the top credit during the credit opening credit, but it has nothing more than about five minutes of screen time. Even he must be afraid of how bad it was that he was hiding behind a mustache and a terrible accent, he was better off. <br /> <br /> Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete breakout of the exorcist without something that made this film a classic and maker, too, for thirty-five years. Turkey from start to finish.
