My main criticism of the film is animation. I fully agree with everyone else who was very bad. Some characters seemed darker with skin tones than the first film, which is much better. The background colors also seemed rushed and somewhat static. It is also a shame that Michael J. Fox did not hear Milo, he did a good job and James Arnold Taylor was not sure if he should sound like Milo or Aladdin. I have also taken into account the lack of a good story. the third story was confusing and cautious and the second story was bad scripting. To make things worse, the first thing I don't even remember, except to haunt the village village or something like that. But John Mahoney, Cree Summer, Clancy Brown and Tom Wilson gave nice music and good voices that recorded the film as a result of a complete disaster. All in all, surprisingly good film disappointment. 4/10 Bethany Cox.
