George Cukor's women are still one of the glittering gems of 1939, the golden golden years of Hollywood. The film burst and shone, and the lack of men was a subtle touch, hardly noticed by all the fine entertainment. <br /> <br /> Flash on. We see Fifth Avenue in Saxony in New York. Big crowds are thrilling along Avenue ... but nothing is gone. The picture shows only well-dressed (attractive and young) women. More rigid than the I Am Legend, the visual concept continues, inside the store and later in a great fashion show. Which NYC fashion show does not contain at least 5 gay men? The "no men" rule is pushed down by our throat, creating a strange world, creating balance and confusion. <br /> <br /> Enter Meg Ryan, who first saw an excavation in his garden, carrying a ridiculous design with his retro curls and flailing hands. I immediately approach my husband and realized why he was looking elsewhere. Later, he filmed in the older look of Jennifer Aniston and holds his hand on his side. It seems deliberate to say, "Look! I can still be relevant!" The Ryani character is loaded with comforted inappropriate friends (add here the Sex and City Comparison), who, if it were a real life, would burn one another. Annette Bening plays the power of a mother who, in the film, realizes that the dream of her life does not make her truly happy. Jada Pinkett Smith is a power lesbian, everyone who has no benefit to men who are not there. Debra Messing is a baby factory that eats a lot. Eva Mendes has a strange choice for a bad girl. He looks fake, acts fake and any humor he tries to show falls. Nobody commented here that he saw the trans sex, was on the spot. Other different letters show the reorganization of this Titanic furniture. <br /> <br /> The only thing that would have saved it would have been the brilliant casting of Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. They could have called their price, pull their tongue firmly into their cheeks and pull something very wisely and profitably. But no, Hollywood thinks he is too high for such exploitation. Instead, we are given the thing that lumbers do not create cumbersome. The parts of the entire original dialogue are lifted and put on the scene with terrible results. At one point, Ryan shouts, "It's not a 1930s movie!" No, it's not.
