This film is now studying the infamous Wannsee conference, where top nets gathered to discuss the organization and implementation of a "final solution". First of all, I want to say that I was surprised that Kenneth Branagh was playing the Nazis. The blonde hair left behind definitely showed her, but she couldn't do well. There was no threat and cruelty, and finally he came out as an exhilarating cheerleader, holding a meeting. True Heydrich would not have given the conference control over how he worked in the film. <br /> <br /> The best result of all was undoubtedly the man of Colin Firth, who played Dr. William Stuckart, who wrote the Nuremberg Competition Laws in 1935 and gave "legal respect" to all the Nazis did. Firth's presentation was stunning, the main vocal opponent of what Heydrich did. The best part of all was when he was one of the Nazi strokes orally. Hell's Mouth "I Remember You" and Firth's Answers "You Should! I am Very Known!" The film is historically accurate, but boil it down to what it really is - 90 minutes of a group of people around the table, talking, screaming and bragging. No excitement, no real conflicts (except for a brief argument). It's just 90 minutes talking! Same room, same table, same people. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the DVD is worth the money. I felt that one felt a change.
