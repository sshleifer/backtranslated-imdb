* MILD SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> In this possible satire, Chaplin put his interest in the evil of the German Fascism by playing the dual role of Tomania's dictator Adenoid Hynkel and one of his works - an inadvertent World War I hero and Jewish hairdresser. Through events inspired by both Adolf Hitler and Marx Brothers, Hynkel agrees on contracts and declares war on neighboring Osterlich, while at the same time finding several, strangely flat pieces. The dictator's much consecrated waltz with an inflatable globe is indeed very strong, humane and uncomfortable. Chaplin should definitely be fond of looking for a snowball Hitler and speaking strongly about celluloid - his very outrageous final speech is actually a piece of bold and memorable pressure - but the film is not sharp enough or funny to despise the praise that is often gathered for it, and do not require recurring views. The best gaggers will stay away from Hynkel's tiring position and involve The Barber, who is trying to avoid a big spinning bomb (a sequence that steals a weapon from the Gold Rush) and later, on the pot, accidentally walking out of the roof of his store. <br /> <br /> The Big Dictator is slow, wildly inconsistent and generally somewhat unsatisfactory when compared to the silent classics of the director, while the frosty weather between laughter is often long and hard to tolerate. There is no doubt that Chaplin was a genius, but even geniuses make disappointing images and the great dictator is definitely such.
