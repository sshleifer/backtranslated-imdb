If you had asked me 1 month ago how this movie would probably be most out of it, but I'm a fan and like every fan, I often visit movie sites when Super Troopers came out when I visited this site after that to release the DVD and was caught, it is a difficult place to stay, but good is usually like the good families they put together. What a story about this company / comedy is. READ OUT that people come and see movies on the street, in universities, everywhere they get and all for free and after a few years to develop a big fan base. Decide to close a website that helped them and was for fans but the worst thing about it. They just decided they were better than they wanted new fans not for fans who helped them get where they were. Still a smart team they released the best movie Super Troopers and got everyone's attention and thank God because after that they suck everything else. Good for you, you have to get out of the ordinary, just remember when you realize that your material is not so good, and you have no new fans who left you, are the ones who did the original withdrawal. FANS WILL BE YOU WHO ARE NOT OTHER MEMBERS. Never burn your bridges
