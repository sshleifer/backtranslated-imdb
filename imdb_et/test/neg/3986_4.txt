Bad Shirley MacLaine is trying hard to borrow this mawkish, a film-inducing "feel-good" movie, but she has looted a film that is not the least bit grounded in reality, with penetrating sentimentality. <br /> <br /> Was it led by Curtis Hanson? Did he have lobotomy because we heard him last? Hanson is able to make an effective drama hidden in comedy evidenced by "Wonder Boys". So I don't know what happened to her. This is a movie that doesn't want to accept that life is dirty and nervous, and that a nice, regular ending (though it may be unlikely) can produce a nice closing image, but is treated as people watching the movie through remote control, like a movie pass through the characters. <br /> <br /> My wife and I did the game to call the test points before they happened - for example, "the old man teaches him to read and then die." Bingo! This is one of those films where the characters give little speech summarizing their emotional problems, so you don't know why they still have emotional problems when they are aware of what causes them. Toni Collette (a fine actor, by the way, and one of my favorites who can't do much work here) gives an early talk about why she buys so many shoes and never wear them, writing in a neon flash. uncomfortable unifying motif. At this point I knew what I was, and the film was a downward spiral. <br /> <br /> Rating: C-
