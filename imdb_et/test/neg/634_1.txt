* THIS REVIEW may include spoilers ... OR NOT. WARNING IS ALWAYS ALL * <br /> <br /> Turn it on. Just when I thought the SCIFI channel had used all of their ridiculous ideas for movies, they gave us that. In fact, the plot itself is not something we haven't seen in films like Snakes On A Plane, Deep Blue Sea, etc. This means that a monster / animal / threat lies in a close environment that threatens a lot of people. In this case, the alien is on the train. Wow. <br /> <br /> I have to say that when I first saw the cable, I couldn't stop laughing. No SCIFI movie was ready for me; it was so incredibly pathetic that I couldn't believe it! Participants are all set of stereotypical genres. But because they are not so famous (at least say), I didn't expect them much. Except Diamond Phillips. There is no comment, but I think the man was desperate to find a job. The problem was the so-called special effects, terrible even for the SCIFI channel standards. This model / toy they believed it was a real train (not to mention a model / game helicopter, bigger than a train wagon), a meteor coming from space HORIZONTAL, "baby" alien (sock doll and I'm not kiddin), regular aliens who looked pretty ugly ... when they were static; when they started to "move" it was terrible, explosions (terrorist blew LITERALLY! And how exploding helicopter! How many barrels of gas was it?), used crazy math (they couldn't even solve the school problem correctly!) ... and I not talking about this end of the day, I didn't know if I wanted to laugh or cry. When I remember correctly, I did both. But warn me; it's so ridiculous on so many levels ... and you need to stop a lot of incredible stops ...
