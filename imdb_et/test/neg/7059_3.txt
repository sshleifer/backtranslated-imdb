It didn't take too long for Halloween to have let out a brilliant boom so that the category would be subjected to constant mediocrity. Already in 1983, the genre was already in difficulty to release more than three decent offerings a year, and '88 was a stalk and a slash became quite a horror whip. By then, the big studios were all aware that repeating the tired formula was no longer a lucrative direction that continued the continuation of independent and mostly inexperienced filmmakers for the legacy created by John Carpenter. Although 88 still had an impressive number of shelves, most of them were poorly produced and taken as a whole. That said, there was a couple of jewels among the rubble. Scott Spiegel's intruder in his unspoiled form was a great classic class, while Evil Dead Trap proved that the cycle was not yet full of style and panic. William Lustigi Maniac Cop was successful enough to launch a franchise and two years later, Dead Girls and Mirage turned out to be the most difficult life in their lifetime. <br /> <br /> It was a constant release of Schlock, like the Berserker Blood Lake and Speed ​​Week, which swallowed the film for eight years. Finally, Wes Craven screamed with a big budget to ensure the necessary resuscitation. After hearing something about the Demon Warrior before I suddenly arrived, I assumed that it was part of a low eyebrow bin that led to a downturn. But it said the film had an intriguing premise, conveniently located next to Scalps and Camping Del Terrore. This is another welcome addition to the Native-American affected directory. <br /> <br /> Truck is pulled by two ridiculously dramatic rednecks on the forest road and field. Forest in the mountains is only on the screen for about ten seconds and then murdered by an invisible threat. Next, we will meet with five young adult groups moving in the same place in a local wildlife over a shotgun-target practice. The area belongs to Neil Willard and has been transferred from three generations of his family. His grandfather stole a land from an Indian medical man, who was told that they had been fortunate. According to the legend, Demon Warrior, with extreme hatred, tells humanity every ten years about a forest that commands revenge for those whom it considers responsible for the tribal home. It wouldn't be much fun if these myths were wrong, as regular as the clockwork, where the manic assassin is bloody. Can children stop this phantom killer? <br /> <br /> The Demon Warrior is best described as Fredi Ray's Scalps' higher budget (but still cheap) playback. The bogeymen of both films is practically identical and the director even throws his doubts to scaling. Things start promising some sharp Friday with 13th style first-time cinematography and a couple of shock-thrusts directed by director Frank Patterson. Thomas Callaway did a good job with photography, and the result of the tribal drum changes the refreshing change from conventional eighties synthetic waste. The prosperity of strength is alongside a couple of credible productions and even some attempts to humor. The killer looked at the demon attire successfully with horrible and the addition of a bow and arrow as the main murder weapon was a weak touch of the director. <br /> <br /> Fred I Ray's infamous was remarkable for its harsh and incredible atmosphere. Unfortunately, the Demon Warrior is still double-produced, unfortunately never close to the movie it so badly emulates. The rumor is that most of the participants have been drawn from the University of Texas Baylor and were not even paid to be involved in the function, so of course it goes without saying that drama is appropriately exhausting. Did I really like John Langione? An "Italian" Indian (not asking), which represents as much emotion as the trees around him. Warrior started with some credible eyes on the director, who actually made me believe that it could be a welcome inclusion in the indicator. Unfortunately, the poisonous cocktail of dirty deeds and the end that ended in stupidsville seriously changed the initial plan I had to make an evaluation. It is a shame that the drama has been scratched from the bottom of the barrel, as Demon Warrior sometimes showed a potential flashing. <br /> <br /> Overall, is Patterson's film a combined idea? some of them were good, but mostly they were amazingly mediocre. Since it appeared at a time when the Saksher genre was aligned to avoid lucky censors, there is really nothing worth mentioning. Even the scaling sequence is relatively good compared to the graphical representation of I Ray. The Demon Warrior has a strange credibility moment, but not often to justify the purchase. Not as bad as the above-mentioned Berserker, Blood Lake, etc., but not really, good ...
