The single-use film in cinema history? This is a strong candidate! Why are you wasting so much money on such a pointless useless job? The only difference between the HItchcock classic and its bad imitation is the color, widescreen and Leila Walkman! A film that should create excitement and fear leaves me completely indifferent. <br /> <br /> Don't tell me it encourages young generations to see the original "balderdash!" This "psycho 1998" is a giant spoiler. <br /> <br /> They could have done something else, such as bringing the actor closer to Bloch. s Bates, obese man. They fill themselves with unpleasant rehash! Pox it! and long life Alfred Hitchcock!
