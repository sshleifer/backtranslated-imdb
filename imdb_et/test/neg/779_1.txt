Perhaps, if you smoke enough weeds, it seems funny or would make you nostalgic if totally free people promised themselves in the early 70s. For this movie, strange innocence and sex are much more uncomfortable and playful than the sharp pros that are currently doing for cameras. film - is the appearance of Kristine Debell as Alice. He was a Ford model and it shows. She has a classic, WASP-ish good look - like a really lovely Ivy League corporation girl. What the hell is he doing in this cheap, cheesy skin flick? From my point of view, he does not seem to have any drugs in this film (which could explain it) and he seems to be incredibly committed to this part. When he sings his first song, he really works as he thinks he's flippin 'Julie Andrews or something. I just feel like this girl really believed it was her big break or something instead of a nearby career player. Anyway, she's fucking cute and you can't believe she can even get a naked screen, much less to do a masturbation scene, a couple of oral sex scenes (men and women) and then do a real job as a top movie (snark). Surely it is not a double body at all. This is our little Kristine, who takes one show or a showcase of greater glory or something. It's pretty amazing to look at and it's definitely a stimulating (ahem), but I wish she wouldn't have done that. It was a very beautiful, talented young girl who really got bad advice. He was very cute and tempting in "meatballs". It is almost impossible to believe that this is the same girl - but it is.
