Sensitive excuse for absolutely zero-thrill thrillers triggered by chemistry or the relationship between Lewis and Hurt (why is he looking for a man who is old enough to have his father still? Excitement is ridiculous. Lewis is great, but the script is needed, and my score for this trash: 2 out of 10.
