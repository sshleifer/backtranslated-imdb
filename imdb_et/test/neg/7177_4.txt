The two-page boys working on the radio network are trying to work between face-to-face job shifts in solving the murders. Jack Moran and Sidney Miller celebrate it in 1945. Everybody speaks quickly, everyone worships and two pages call the "Marty" police detective (played by Ralph Sanford). It is a real "shortie" after 59 minutes and it feels like it is being customized because it usually takes place on a radio station. We don't care about real characters, which is probably the reason why it is hardly shown. No problem. It was Phil Karlson's second film director. We are not given any clues as to who can knock people so that we follow the police detective and the guys on the page, because they all try to solve the mystery first. I'm not saying anymore to give away the spoiler.
