Given the incredible review of this film, I waited for something truly extraordinary. Certainly it starts with funny and sharp dialogues and fine. Several of Robert Altman's interwoven stories are rolled out with some spectacular scenes from the viewer. I found that it attracts entertainment directly to the other side of the movie if it unfortunately disappears, like a card package. A series of ridiculous coincidences and right-wing messages are stacked until I'm deeply disappointed and I wonder what all the noise is. Paul Haggis has been dealing with racial issues in LA, and this alone seems to have raised this film to a new level of interest. Given that most of the Academy's voters live in LA and have some experience of racism, this film definitely affects them. This means that the Oscar's best picture goes to a film or a gay movie. We hope this is the last one, because Brokeback Mountain is a good-natured masterpiece that deserves recognition.
