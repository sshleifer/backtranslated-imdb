Having lived in the mid 1990s on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (30 miles from Escanaba), I had seen this movie. It starts promising enough to understand superficially U.P. life. But Jeff Daniels was probably not satisfied with the low key approach that would have been appropriate for the place and people. Instead, it introduces extremely raw humor and some wildly inappropriate mystical / supernatural elements. Although a good film is made about a region that is virtually unknown to the United States, this is not the case.
