Heldeke! It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. It is incredibly repetitive; Every scene seems to be made up of people struck down, running around screaming or being hit by a face that quickly becomes very dull. I don't mind if the fight would be good, but it is not; The main character Phillips pushes the various ghons ridiculously easily, and no matter how often he monitors it, he never strikes, though extras and smaller characters are beaten and blown around him. I have rarely seen the participants' worse light (especially Don Wilson, if you can even call him "actor"), but it is not really surprising given the dialogue they have to do (exemplary line: "Computers killed my brother!"). The plot is a sub-parameter of the excellent Terminator, the special effects are ridiculous, and in general, this movie is absolutely terrible.
