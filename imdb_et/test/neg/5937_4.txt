After two terrorist attacks in Europe, one in London and one in Amsterdam, Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul) is the main suspect. Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio), a CIA agent in the Middle East, appoints his boss, Langley Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe), to oversee a "safe house" under Amman's supervision and is linked to Jordan Strong Chief of Staff, Han Strala. Roger does not publish the entire operation to Hani and it fails because of Ed's intervention. Meanwhile, Roger has feelings for his local sister Aisha (Golshifteh Farahan) and is close to his family. When Roger prints another plan to catch Al-Saleem using the innocent architect Omar Sadiki (Ali Suliman) to attract Al-Saleem, he threatens not only the safety of Sadik, but also the kidnapped Aisha. After completing Sadiki, Roger tries to negotiate the release of Aisha with the terrorists and proposes to rescue his sister. <br /> <br /> "Lieseke" is a disappointing pyrotechnic tour through Europe and the Middle East despite Ridley Scott, Leonardo DiCaprole and Russell Crowe. The IMDb user rating shows that there are many viewers who, like this type of fast-paced espionage, use high technology, satellites and any respect for the sovereignty of other nations for an oil that doesn't give time to think, but that's not my case. It's boring and ridiculous that fatty Russell Crowe sees a mobile phone like a family man, while his partner is risking his life in a dangerous operation. The rich character of Leonardo DiCaprio has been poorly developed and, in my opinion, this great actor is wrong, because of his biotype, as a Middle East operative agent. But the film never explains its connections with the Middle East. Living alive in Roger Ferris's rescue is also very stupid and horny. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Rede de Mentiras" ("Spice Network")
