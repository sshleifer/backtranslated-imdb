I remember when that show came. It was originally advertised as a mini-series. At the end of the last episode, it was said "to be continued" for the fear of all those people who looked out of the words of boredom. It ended as it should, so yes, you can blame the series if you have no end. The plan was that the ratings would still be obviously higher, but it was boring to show that it was too long and irritated people when they didn't finish when he said they didn't do any more. Quite a few comments blame for its cancellation and the lack of end to the audience when the truth is that this exhibition is not that it ended as it was actually supposed to end.
