On the cover of Matthias Hues and only $ 3.00, I had to buy it. I liked a few moments, like Hawks' resentment with droids, but I watched only Matthias Hues scenes. I had a particularly fun showdown. It was a cross between Clint Eastwood's "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" and "For For Little Dollars More" (3-member hotkey, a music pocket used as a timer). In addition, nothing can be added. The actors gave good performances (all except "Assassin Droid" whose performance was not comical), but the film really lacked depth and purpose; just not enough to fill 1 hour and a half of the usual movie times, so we're caught up in the main characters who want to relocate for a while until the ball changes. For example, the main character returns to the same club club about 4 times, taking two-fifths of the movie. <br /> <br /> The landscape did not really have the depth and creativity, probably due to the film budget. I don't think we would ever have seen the "perfect city" of New Angeles, which we always talked about, in fact, when the main characters finally arrived in New York, in the factory or store that was full of pipes and walkways; it was hardly a "kingdom" where the owner / creator of the whole city would live. New York's "super-high security" was always talked about, but only a total of 15, maybe 20, security guards, even when the alarm goes off; not even near Matthias' closer to "at least a hundred men out there". <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of a movie participant / actor, you might want to watch it, just "add a list". However, if you value 1 and a half hours of your time or $ 3.00 for your money, you might want to give it.
