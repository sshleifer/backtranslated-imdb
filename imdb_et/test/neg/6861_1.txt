It was unhappy to see it when you travel by bus across Africa. It was by far the worst film I've ever met. It is worth the slowest # 1 worst ;-) Do not act, there is no plot, very little talk. This hopelessly unlikely film has a lot of monkey-like priming. Inadvertent Self-Satin - Whether you laugh at it or weep.
