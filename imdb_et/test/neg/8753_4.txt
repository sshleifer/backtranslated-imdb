Yes, the film is not a work of art, but the first time I watched it, I was 10 years old, my parents were out and I stayed home with my two brothers. It was May 1970 (I know this because I found a note on the horror movie cycle that one network had). This is one of the most vivid memories I have with a boy. We finished all in one bed and covered up to the head! Our first horror movie! We talked about it for years and smiled for a moment. These were horror movies. Nowadays, horror movies are always the same. Or was it better if we were children who didn't enjoy analyzing the plot and cast and dialogues? Most sure it was this. But for me this is a great movie!
