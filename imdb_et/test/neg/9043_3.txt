I recently viewed a copy of it (under the heading "Eaten Alive"). Talk terrible! Any film that has ever been featured looks like an Oscar material compared to its ridiculous slut. To be fair, a couple of scripts live in memory for a long time, such as "These people (cannibals) don't buy frozen meat from a supermarket like us, they get it fresh every day like you or me" Classic! The leader of the mad "Jonesville" in the jungle was the best character of the movie, he looked like a nutter. I think he was the only actor who wasn't (badly) acted when these Italians have American characters in their films, why they can't copy Americans in dialogue with English-speaking people. I'll give it to 3 out of 10, I'll give her three, because it's really funny as most of the comedies made these days.
