Guy Pearce looks almost like Flynn, and this resemblance is the only thing this film can demand. Flynn's autobiography has not mentioned the character of Klaus Reicher anywhere, the homosexual encounter is speculative fiction and the film's allegations that Flynn treated native work badly are unfounded. Director Frank Howson has still not made memorable films and I find that he cannot wrongly blame Flynn for promoting his remarkable career. <br /> <br />
