Hulking alien beastie crash-land on earth and soon wrecks devastate the population first using his laser ray gun to dissolve dust almost every person he catches sight off (this is when his goal is not terribly out) and later his bare claws with whom he wants out Straighten and Eat a Human Spleen! All in all, it's pretty stupid. I have to give him some points for some fun time. I really enjoyed the meaningless ray gun battle at the beginning and some later over the top gore effect. However, this does not help if the monster offers only really fun moments in the movie, and he doesn't have much of the movie's time on the screen. Acting all this is just terrible and amateur, and our leading hero Sheriff Cinder is too uncomfortable to film the hottest chick. I also have to take away the points that duplicate the world a number of times (1951). If the monster is not a rampage, NIGHTBEAST is too empty and eventually his attacks become so repetitive and predictable that they become less fun. Check it back with the 1951 issue and look at the distinction characterization, attention to plot and detail, and break the monster on film.
