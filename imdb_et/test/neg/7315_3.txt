University Professor Justin Thorne (Jimmy Smits) has done it. Good-looking, experienced teacher with a loving wife and two divine children. He plays saxophone, has an expensive car and his students love and respect him. But when the temptation calls one of his bright, beautiful, sexy and bad pupils, Jennifer Carter (Naomi Watts) gives her foolishly. The next day he is accused of rape and his perfect life could be destroyed forever. <br /> <br /> When we see an American actress in an Australian movie, we know we're not for a masterpiece. But even with a little expectation, "anti-gross behavior" is a huge flop. Based on a game that has a rather unimaginable title and then adapted to a reasonably enjoyable book, it can't convince its audience at the most important level, persuade, or even far away. The script is inconvenient and convincing; acting is usually not much better. Watts provides acceptable performance, showing for the first time on its screen its emotionality, but it is the only good thing in the movie that looks almost like it can't wait. /> The direction is not so terrible or disturbing, but it is just painfully mediocre. In addition to the above-mentioned Naomi Watts, who can be forgiven for seeing that it was at the beginning of her career, she is an actor of wood and is constantly getting worse during the film. It seems that usually a trusted Jimmy Smith hasn't tried it and who could really blame him? However, all these minor flaws only add to the movie's ultimate deadly error, which is that the focus is in the wrong place. Any empathy with the characters or interest in the result is lost at sea, which is basically adult entertainment. After all, the audience will probably be bored, tired, and want them to have done something else in their ninety minutes. If you just don't want to see Naomi naked 4 or 5 times, you could definitely allow this non-external movie to be left out.
