Stars: Hayden Pantierre. <br /> <br /> There are so many movies with the same exact plot, and it's just a bad repetition. Populer white girl moves to an ethnic school, not fit, will soon be accepted. It doesn't have originality, nor does it laugh. It uses so many old badly filled jokes that are annoying. I don't know why they think it's a good idea to make mediocre movies for video clips, but that's not. In this regard, it is positive that all the people who live in it are quite competent actors and actors. <br /> <br /> My rating: * out ****. PG-13 for language and sexual humor.
