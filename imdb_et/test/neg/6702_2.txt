I assume that the heart of the filmmakers was in the right place, but frankly, this film is truly subconscious. I was offended with the tone and the end of the complete police. You can't do such things so easily! Unknown to the final movie warning ... we look at the arms of a 9-year-old pregnant woman and two sons, and they should follow her in the next two hours when she tries to create a new life? You have no compassion for the character who does it. Can not! Not to mention that we don't give anything until the last half an hour of this unnecessarily long movie, why this guy suffers so much. There are no setbacks, sudden reactions to noise or movement - things that the real veterinarians are suffering from. We know she has a pain in her husband's wife and she can't take care of her and her 3 children financially. There really didn't seem to be any research on what the current Iraqi veterinarians are going through. Its a disaster. This is really detrimental to some of the really good guys who work for men and sometimes Joe Morton. It predicts everything you should know and sometimes gives the wrong tips completely! Again, this was a brutal thing this man did, and so to see her new job, meet a new blonde, fighting at the table is not appropriate! And really, the end? What a crazy cop! How do you dare. <br /> <br /> There are many richer movies that deal with the impact of war on returning soldiers, please don't worry about it.
