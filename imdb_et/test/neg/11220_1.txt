This movie is so bad that they don't buy it in my local used CD / DVD store. I only attribute it because it came in a box set that I bought for the masterpiece "Deadfall". Poe bought back the other two films I sold from four discs, but they didn't buy Underworld, and those two other films redefined what it says about this movie? So I was trying to sell it back to another store, which even bought back a DVD that could be bought from a local store for the dollar, but they didn't buy the underworld either. This film is bad on every level and it is one of those that came out in the mid-1990s after the Tarantino clone. The only little return is Dennis Leary, who tells Joe Montegna that she is a "smelly friend" and calls her "Mister Stinky Friend". This line is so awfully awful that I can't, but I quote it at least once a week when I describe a smelly friend. But now that I've quoted it, you don't have to watch this movie.
