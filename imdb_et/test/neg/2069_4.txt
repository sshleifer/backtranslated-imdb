For those who are waiting for cover design and story to show some other fun Bollywood Indian production, be careful: there are no musical dance numbers or product values ​​to lighten the rather tired story of British Indian culture - some Roopesh Parekh says the script jumps around topics that deserves discussion to cover them with conventional prevention tactics. Harmage Singh Kalirai leads the traffic police, trying to save the various blocks in the Keystone Cop tactics point. <br /> <br /> Jimi (Chris Bisson) is a medical school student who is gay and has a lover Jack (Peter Ash) and lives with Jack's obese, alcoholic, loose morals (Sally Bankes) and Sally's plump daughter Hannah (Katy Clayton). The family of Jimi visits Jim's family, bringing her beautiful daughter Simran (Jinder Mahal) to England to find her husband. Jimi's parents (Saeed Jaffrey and Jamila Massey) and her grandmother (Zohra Sehgal) decide that Simran is a girl to whom Jimi marries and arranges captivity and wedding according to Indian practices - without Jimi's advice. Jimi discovers a plot and is too endless to go with it, a decision that invades Jack and infuriates Vanessa. Hannah tells Simran a "little lie" (that she is Jimi's daughter) and the wedding is off. When Jimi's parents visit Jim's house, they discover drunk Vanessa, she is rejected by him, but finally decides that Jim's luck will go with Vanessa's "granddaughter" and decided to use marriage equipment for the wedding Jimi and Vanessa. Jimi convinces the very reluctant Vanessa to go to the idea and before Vanessa is dressed in a series that is ready for weddings, and Jimi, who is afraid of what she does to her parents, is her best man. The truth comes to the wedding and Jim's surprise adapts to his family, Jimi, and the day is simply kept honest. <br /> <br /> Cast in this stupid nonsense pretty well, and there are some good results: Chris Bisson and Peter Ash are attractive men and are doing their job well, though without any kind of loving relationship (the director seems to be scared of showing two the slightest desire for intimacy between men); Sally Bankes offers most of the laughs at Vanessa; the rest repeats the role of stereotypes they have played countless times in Indian films. It's not a bad movie - it has its own moments - but it's just too superficial and tired to take care of all the characters.
