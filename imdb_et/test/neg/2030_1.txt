OK, I wanted to see it because he had some good reviews, but this movie was terrible ... Just terrible. The characters were one-dimensional and no participant could ever breathe. The story was exhausting ... The wind didn't turn into a semi-plot device ... It's just forgotten. The visuals were cool were pulled out ... 5 minutes for a man who crawled on the ground, 3 minutes for a girl who put her makeup. I don't know what this guy is trying to pull out ... it's like he didn't have any plot or dialogue that would be needed to drive so long that no scenes could change at all ... unused, this film makes me think that American cinema can never do it. I want to stop watching movies ... Bad Bad Movie!
