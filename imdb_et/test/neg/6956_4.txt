It looks like a good film on paper. Michael Caine plays a harsh and ruthless boxing campaign that is the son of a headline suppressor. It is a pity that when a story is transferred from paper to a TV screen, it loses everything. I was hoping that we would see the issuance of its ultimate role in GET CARTER, and when the film progresses, it seems to take on the harshly hard-hitting thriller thriller, but the whole movie's tone jumps so much that you're confused about what genre he's trying to fit. For example, Caine (who you can't believe because Billy "Shiner" Simpson, she's just Michael Caine) is a laughing zone when she refers to someone like "Hattie Jacques," at the supposedly humorous moment, her henchmen have to break a hand. Oh, how I laughed. I mean, it should try to laugh, how it plays on the screen, isn't it? But they seem to be in conflict with playing the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The director John Irvin probably doesn't know what to do with the Scott Cherry scenario. Irvin is not a bad director and is well-kept for his war movie, like war and soldier hills, but he doesn't fit in such a violent drama and no one can help but feels that he can be somewhat intimidated by a living legend like Caine. Caine gives the impression that she just does it for money, and the well-known faces of supportive roles like Landua and Cranham are basically just newcomers who could be played by everyone
