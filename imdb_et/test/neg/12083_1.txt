This movie was potential. If it had been treated differently. What he needed was a different director. It has been confirmed. And maybe another leading lady. I just don't understand the nature of the Minnie driver - or at least how he played it. He was absolutely unbelievable. I can't believe he would have wanted his film in this movie too. He probably gave up the director or could not offer what the director was trying to do. I write it the way I look at it. I think I would have hated to be in my shoes trying to do something. Well, we just went to what he started with a son (I still look). I have now started to deeply embarrass all the people involved in this company. If you like watching the movie in a great way, check it out.
