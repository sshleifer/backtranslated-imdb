Unfortunately, this film lives on about 1% of the game created in 2004 and leaves a very sour taste in the mouth. For video game enthusiasts, both for books and film fans, there is no longer a disappointing film based on an original concept (either on paper or on a game console) that doesn't produce. And not only that, it goes well under the brand name. The Far Cry video game, which appeared in 2004, created a cult that made the making of the movie content easy and the number of players would be flocked to watch the movie. If you are a player who has played Far Cry; don't look at this movie. Someone else who hasn't played the game; it still looks like a B-class activated / B-class film. Uwe Boll, hang your shame ... it should have been easily blocked. The story of the game was incredible (I think Jurassic Park will meet with Alien) and still managed to take it and shape it in your terrible classic vacation. Video game companies need to be warned - if Uwe Boll comes, lock the door. Oh & Til Schweiger ... I look forward to seeing you in exhausting conditioners. What did you mean by that? Sigh.
