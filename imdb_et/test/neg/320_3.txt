If you are looking for a cinematic masterpiece, this is not the case. If you are looking for one of these terrible movies that are so terrible that they are really good, then it may be for you. There is so much unwillingness to laugh in this film that it can almost be considered a comedy. Let's start with the headlines that say "Jack-O", and then add the word "Lantern" as if the viewer could figure out that the movie was about a pumpkin that was seen on both covers. and the movie opening scene. After that, the film goes in about 20 different directions, none of which makes sense. Jack-o is everywhere, he's in people's houses, in the woods, and never seems to be much. He makes some killings, but the long-term accumulation of these killings has worked so badly and built that you almost want Jack-o to take your rage to the viewer. In addition, the plot consists of poor performance, free nudity and a ridiculous plot line. Acting in this movie is one of the worst I've seen in watching my 35 plus year movie. The film's leading boy (the son of the director) is about as much emotion as the body and almost all the other actors / actors are equally bad for a number of reasons (especially a bug-eyed lady with larger eyes) than baseball. But to say all this, if you take it for what it is (it is a steamy dry bunch), you will laugh at this movie. I also find it amusing that DVD players saw the release of this "tenth anniversary of the movie" (as if the original was not good enough). And anyone had the idea to make a "behind the scenes" minifilm, which is also included in the 10th anniversary edition (I'm not sure why) ........ I'll give this 3 broken pumpkin out 10 ...
