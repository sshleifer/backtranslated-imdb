Polar Express. Director Robert Zemeckis, I love the future, Forrest Gump, Contact and who framed Roger Rabbit (NO QUESTIONS, WHAT MOVIE TITLE !!). And Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actresses. The reviews of this film were almost unanimous, saying it was a fast classical holiday class. Ebert & Roeper gives him two ENTHUSIASTIC thumbs! Even Ebert's written review gave him four full letters! Wow ... OK ... I have to see it! But wait ... catching the used movement seems very strange. Hmm ... maybe I'm not so interested to see it again. <br /> <br /> "Well, are you coming?" says the train driver boy at Polar Express. The boy is first of all reluctant and the train starts with his running without him. The boy will soon change his mind and jump on board right now. Now, most of you have probably decided not to jump on board this train and wait for a TV train or rental car (hee hee, I'm so funny and smart). I, on the other hand, was like a boy who was initially skeptical, but jumped forward to see what the noise was. <br /> <br /> I just wasted 10 and two hours of my life. <br /> <br /> I can't even start stomach pain. Polar Express was so painful to sit, not even funny. No story. There's no fee. You're sitting there through a series of events and you don't know "is this a point?" That would be one thing if the scenes were entertaining ... but they were not. <br /> <br /> This movie is void of any emotion, soul, any credibility and most important: any fun. This movie is not fun. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about how these characters look for seconds. Saying it's the same technology (movement, I'm sorry, catching "PERFORMANCE") used to make Gollum is a real shame because Gollum was plausible! Photo-realism simply does not change well in this medium. You are using animation, why not make characters more expressive? Or why not just shoot it with real participants? Certainly they will certainly be able to. We as people know too well how to walk, talk, interact with things. This is not an impressive sight on the screen that has been convincingly made. Convincingly made cartoons are more likely than Incredibles has proven. The result of Polar Express is now as if they were dead bodies of dead children and made them dolls. They move and speak, but where is the heart? Where is the soul? We can see this on the screen. UGH UGH UGH UGH UGH! This movie is so terrible! <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie there is a scene where the boy takes the girl's train ticket from his seat because he got up and left. He wants to give it to him, but you sit there "why?" Just leave it ... he's coming back! Of course he loses the ticket and the "adventure". And then there is a boy who has been stuck on the back of the train all the time and they bring him hot chocolate, but he can't come and join the rest of the kids? And then it's a tedious "I know all this" boy with 35 years of voice. It's all so disturbing. <br /> <br /> Oh and there are songs! One girl goes to the back of the train, where the lonely child is. He sings his own song. And then he interrupts and joins! They stop singing when they hold their hands, watching each other's eyes as if they were lovers. Very inconvenient. I'm not even going to go into details about serving hot chocolate when the waiters dance around the train. "keep it hot!" One scene where Tom Hanks slides in the knees with expanded hands must be one of the most memorable scenes in the history of bad scenes. <br /> <br /> I have to stop now or kill myself. I need to look a little to clean the palettes. Yes ... crappy is better than Polar Express. <br /> <br /> "One thing on the train, it doesn't matter where you go, what's important, how to go." <br /> <br /> Don't get it. For God's love, I have decided to you! This is just one film taken from a children's book that is incredibly thin in the form of a film. It happened to Grinch and Hat, and they were terrible. But who is to blame them? I bet if I took the book, Berenstein bears too much junk food, and turned it into a feature film, it would probably be pretty boring. But at least ... there would be a story and a point that Polar Express has so little.
