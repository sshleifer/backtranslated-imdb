Fanglys is placed on a small Texas city called Layton on the eve of Halloween, because the townspeople treat it like the other coming of Christ or something, I mean, Halloween is not that important? Anyway, Sheriff Pete (Burton Gilliam) has been summoned for some other murder because the local boy Ned (co-producer John William Galt) has discovered the body in the local forest. Could it be Fang Lady (Justin Hamilton)? The central character is related to the local legend of a witch who kills teenagers who know? Being a fun man, he is Mark (assistant director and producer Robert Harvey) who convinces his Miss Kelly (Laurie Reeves) to go to the cemetery found by his companion Steven (Josh Gobin) at a Halloween party. The idea of ​​spending a night in the middle of a cemetery in the middle of the forest is probably like Kelly and she agrees with Steven and the girl she called Camille (Natalie Woods) and their funny friend Jerry (Tim Boswell). Evening fun as well as fun as you can expect in an isolated cemetery. But they will soon discover that Fang Lady's legend is far from the bedtime story ... <br /> <br /> Dated, commented, written, and directed by: Christopher Abram Fanglys is a real garbage test horror film. The script is very predictable, boring and does not give any entertaining value, in the right hand and with a decent budget, Fanglys could have been an effective horror film, but as it is not. It moves at a fair pace, but the "action" screen is so bad that it doesn't matter, I don't really know what else to say except Fanglys is really a bad movie and I don't see anyone getting any pleasure from it. Dialogue is fundamental, characters are clichés and inanimate, while the film looks much longer than the 90-minute driving time. There are some flat experiments on humor that don't sit well with horror elements and what did this cage slow down? I imagine that the budget did not allow filmmakers to show it. Oh, if you want to know what will happen to Jerry after all, then you will also need to follow the final credits because the flat truth has appeared, assuming you can actually do it far naturally (believe me that it will go some way). <br /> <br /> Director Abram does nothing special. Abram thinks that neon-light bathing is stylish, I can tell him it's not when your movie should be in the woods. There is no atmosphere, fear, tension, excitement or any element that makes a good horror film good. Forget a decent gore, there's a little bit of someone eating from the skin and somewhat stuck through the throat. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Fanglys had a $ 2,837 cost of filming, making it one of the lowest budget films with commercial release to be brutally honest. But the slow down man and his wrong joke shops that seem ridiculous? The terrible special effect, the cinematography of the camcorder and all those involved are terrible, making it even more painful. <br /> <br /> Fanglys is a direct-video-crap, it has no redemption qualities & it's low IMDb user rating score is perfectly legitimate, it's one of the movies you watch in half an hour and I wish you the thing would stop.
