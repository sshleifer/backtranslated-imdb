After Kenneth Opel's vigorous story of reviving the joy of reading back to class, I had great hopes. The story is that the number of collision racing camps all over the country attacked my imagination and resonated deeply with my growing imagination. Listening to this series, I started browsing the Bardel animation site and liked what I saw. The design of the characters seemed impressive and the fast-paced chart seemed to be stretched fairly on the arc of thirteen episodes. Much was my disappointment when I decided to look back at the early morning. The opening episode shows our hero, Shade Silverwing, who is catching a tiger moth at night in deep hours. When the Echolocatory song is interrupted, we see a pleasant illumination of the CGI effect, and the chase takes a frenetic turn because a small insect creates numerous illusory copies, deceiving his pursuer. As a biology lover, I had a good understanding of the current principles (tiger moths can feel the sounds that predators use to build and rotate themselves) but without it I would definitely be lost. Little beating, I thought. They will definitely fill the director for a moment. I waited in vain. <br /> <br /> If our protagonists are with some of their companions, then we will be treated to some of the most horrible dialogues I've seen on television. Chinook, a Shade childhood rival, begins to pile a tiny hero out of stupas with the line I have seen at the show. I understand that writers who do not produce Shakespeare think they would have had a social contact in their lives - certainly making communication natural is natural enough. Oh, how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> Voting, though not scary, was hardly a shining example of people's achievements. "Oh Shade, you are breaking the law!" Shade's mother sighs empty. "You have to come with me, young." shouts Frieda, the weakened parent of the Silverwing colony. Participants try, but it is not very important in this matter, because the story becomes less and less effective with every passing time. <br /> <br /> Although every episode deals with a weekly problem that is typical for most TV series, the all-in-one shock card goes better and worse. The main point of the story is the reunion of Shade with his family, later episodes with other animal archives, involving cannibalistic bats and warfare between birds and wild animals from the southern jungles. Writers are trying to do too much at the same time, fighting as many promising ideas as possible, in the hope that it will grab the audience's interest enough to keep the bloody exhibition going. Unfortunately, these tests are meaningless to everyone, but eight to ten years old to whom this exhibition is directed. <br /> <br /> Although the Canadian media is nice to see, it would be sweeter than a pleasant series with the direct family of Kenneth Oppel's book animators or the foaming fans. There are worse things where your kids might look like Silverwing, but also better programs are out there. Communicate mediocrity and read books instead.
