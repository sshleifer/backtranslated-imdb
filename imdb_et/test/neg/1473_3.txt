I love documentaries. They're one of my favorite movies. Before seeing the movie, I didn't see what I didn't like. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for this movie is great. Filling is well done. It was a while early when I laughed and smiled. But when the movie went, it became annoying and irritating. It could have been something special if the subject hadn't been that intuitive, childish, incited. I appreciate his passion for the film, but I gave up his whining. If you have the money, maybe you should not have so many children and spend so much money on alcohol. Perhaps you should have gone to film school or at least finish high school. Perhaps you should have lived and lived in a perspective and experience that could complement your vision. <br /> <br /> There are so many people with interesting, funny and terrible stories. To see which one of these men has been selected, there is nothing more than a crass. If you want a documentary from a filmmaker, why not do it with someone who is a Chinese or Iranian filmmaker with real problems? <br /> <br /> Two Last Questions: <br /> <br /> Who will take a small child to see the Apocalypse now? <br /> <br /> How many times did this man say "man"?
