Nothing will make KOMODO very fond of Jill Hennessey when it shrinks (!), But KvC is not quite as bad as I was waiting for SYFY's high-speed broadcasts. Just make sure you look at it drunk or rock or sleep. An inconceivable title basically says everything: a group of unknown actors is approaching the island, where the government's attempt to grow giant vegetables has gone wrong. Giant creatures in contact with vegetables have taken over the island and all have eaten. Now the government is preparing to blow up the island, regardless of the people there. Action is a wonderfully frightening, especially black-out general, which is the REVIEW of the HULK TV series, but it is typical for such a cable script. CGI creatures are TV quality, which means you know you're watching a multi-faceted monster. At the same time, two groups of gals are very cute and worth seeing when they run here and there in their narrow gear. You just want to eat them!
