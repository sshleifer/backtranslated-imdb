I got this movie as a birthday present because all my friends know I'm a big shocker with low budget classes. The Kaufman studios have always brought cheese-colored staples. I loved to watch my movies at home during the rainy nights of my family ... until I saw Bugged ... <br /> <br /> This movie started with a pretty good concept of mutating errors and even added some butterfly comedies, but in general, writing is just bad and it was a mistake. Ronald K. Armstrong should be a better writer before becoming a filmmaker. After reading what we discovered, did he play the most important role in the film? two words Mr. Mr. "Lessons" OK? Mr. Armstrong joins the ranks of other writers / directors who put themselves in their films, and that is another mistake. <br /> <br /> The only thing I believed was that this movie was recorded was an artistic camera work and a musical result (we hear it from the team!) The other actors who seemed a bit cold at the start of this production were really warmed up in the middle of its production and at the end. Everybody pulled together and helped to pull this movie out. Ronald Armstrong may not have the talent to ever become a decent director or actor, but I tell him - He seems to know how to organize people so they can come together and pull out their productions. br /> This film, which I have to say, can be an inspiration for every young filmmaker who dreams of making his film, because if Mr. Armstrong can pull it out, someone else can. If you have the opportunity to see this movie, take a look at it to get inspiration for the future. Hollywood needs bigger and better horror to come back to this genre.
