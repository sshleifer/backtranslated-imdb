It's still the worst Italian film, most likely the worst movie ever! Of course, Joe D'Amato is not a cinematic genius, but many of his films are interesting and observable. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. Its cheesy and boring .... waaaaay boring. If you want a movie for MST3k, you can get Troll 2 if you want a movie that puts someone in a coma, deep blood!
