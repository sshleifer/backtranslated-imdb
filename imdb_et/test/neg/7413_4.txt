A plane carrying a rich researcher's daughter falls in a thick desert. He is gathering a group to go and find him and others, but the rescue department will soon suspect that something is being pursued. Then the posterior motifs of the expedition will appear and it will only add to the already existing tension. <br /> <br /> The film is a good idea and the popular Sasquatch legend was supposed to end sooner or later. . However, the direction of the movie violates the basic rule of horror / thriller control and it shows too much too early. Of course, the audience knows that the character is something, just read the title! But showing what should have been the kicker of the movie, which at an early stage destroys most of the passages and the result is a lot of fun. The film also lacks a good atmosphere, and the landscape has almost no terrain that shows the landscape in the desert, but there are many monster points that add nothing. They disprove "Predator" quite shamelessly. The low budget horror movie "Wendigo" did what this film was trying to do much better. <br /> <br /> Some of the typical tensions and non-clich√© finishers will succeed in this pilgrimage of devil, but it is still poor and provides the premise and potential, very disappointing. --- 4/10 <br /> <br /> R rated against some violence and embarrassment, but it's pretty annoying compared to most R-rated horrors.
