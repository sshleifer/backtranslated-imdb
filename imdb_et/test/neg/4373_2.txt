Cops Logan Alexander and Debbie Rochon pre-criminate the five black juvenile offenders who get caught up in the fields and when they are outdated. After a deadly invasion with a racist, white rubbish bin (directed by the director), the surviving refuge remained in a blind voodoo priest's house. One of the teenagers uses an inconceivable spell to call Killjoy, who eventually appears up and down on this intermediate spot, which looks like it can slip at her head any time. He then continues to destroy the fools, while the Hee Hawi poured the most famous single liners at the time of cancellation. <br /> <br /> "Young" action is terrible, the dialogue is even worse, FX stinks and looks much cheaper than the first film. Although I enjoyed her in her earlier Troma movies, Trent Haaga (trying to replicate Jim Carrey again) is terrible and not suitable for Angel Warger's hyperactive transmissions in KILLJOY 1 (which at least laughs). <br /> <br /> Another claw of full moon studio coffins whose reputation for fun direct debit has been completely lost since the TRANCERS / PUPPET MASTER days.
