I know the curiosity killed the cat, but I just had to see Psycho remake, especially after I recently traveled to Hitchcock and knowing his work. I've watched the original Psychot, although I was a boy, I knew how to respect it and not just that it was a great movie! One of the best, actually! The first thing I said when I heard about remake was "How do you remake perfection?". I stayed with it too, but I think I now have a more open mind and thought it was the way to introduce Psychot to new generations. <br /> <br /> But it became a complete offense and the face of the original Psycho. I know this has been said, but I watched this film making and the director was like "Oh, I want to update it and shoot every scene that has been shot down like the original" ... which is friggin "? OK, but I want to judge this film myself, even though it offends the strike of the original. I mean, acting wasn't a par, but frankly it seemed that the actors just looked at the original and just remembered the lines there and made it crazy. /> <br /> this movie, I wanted to make Anne Hasche hit, she said, "I've never seen the original, I wanted to work with Gus." Oh, it made me angry, because, frankly, it's just not that it actually plays this role She was sucked in by Maria, she was not convincing, not to mention her shower, which was really terrible. Vince Vaughn did not ... let's just, the film was terribly wrong. It was a movie and a sin against it, it was a bad movie. was too much and was destroyed that could have been a new introduction to the new generation. But leave the movie to Gus, who knows what they are doing! <br /> <br /> 1/10
