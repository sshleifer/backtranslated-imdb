I admire this effort to try to reach this tragic story for the rest of the world. But the film is made so that most of the people I know could not sit through it. The film was important to me because I lived in Estonia when these events took place, but it has been written terribly and does not pay attention to anyone who knows nothing about this issue. The music options do not flow well with the film, it seems like someone just changed the background of the CD player to make the actors "mood". Acting ... well what's going on? The only actor is Jürgen Prochnow and Donald Sutherland, although Prochnow seems uncomfortable in this role. As for the development of public relations between Erik Westermark (Jürgen Prochnow) and Julia Reuter (Greta Scacchi), it is like looking at a train break. Chemistry is absolutely absent and it is painful to see their "sincere moments". It's not a good movie. The difference is when you try to send a message (it could have been a documentary!) And try to make a good movie. It is a failure and everyone who says otherwise makes me wonder if they are trying to promote it. In fact, as the mother tongue of Estonia, it offends the unfortunate effort. This tragedy deserves more than just a homemade little budget ghost excuse for the movie. It could have been much more!
