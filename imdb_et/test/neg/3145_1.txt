I was a bit outdated for this show when I was 6 when she first came out. First of all, when I was a small child, there were some children's shows that were on the sesame street that I watched and learned, but besides that there wasn't much else there. My relatives were all born a few years after me 7 years was the first one that was another one. Barney was a very big part of what they watched. When I first saw this example, I told my grandmother how it did not teach, but uses everything magic. I was 9 years old, how many 9-year-olds have the idea of ​​what the TV show really does. More and more I saw or heard what Barney's teachings were more and more than what I told people about how bad it was. The funny thing is my parents, who had a small child in the mid and late 80s, by the way. They agreed and said the same thing as me. Unfortunately, it is my cousins ​​who are now older 13 and they still agree with what they saw. He does not deceive his creation, it is not right to think otherwise than what someone says to you. Its o.k to steal if a person does not know if it is lost. Let's face it, Barney's not to teach the kids anything about money. The softer the program, the more inclined the children have to watch it. The kids are stupid not because they're not educated, they just don't know better, the other Barney put the show and the parents bought it. I never believed that television could affect people as Barney did. If you have a small child, read them for an exhibition that teaches these numbers, don't let them take part in this exhibition. Barney is like smoking once a lot, smokes little, and your hook lets your child look at this example of what they are hooked and one day children watch the same mess and buy the same purchase you bought
