Since I just finished the book, Mrs Dalloway, Virginia Woolf, I was glad it was on a movie channel last weekend. But what I met is a film that was boring, incomprehensible, and insensitive. The movie can't be completely blamed, he tried the best material he had, but when the source material is Virginia Woolf and it's almost completely written in a conscience style that has been entered for a long time and with little real dialogue, I definitely think it shouldn't be done just because it can be filmed. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave, who plays the character of the title, does not deserve the failure of this film or other players. It is just a movie that could not be made understandably from Woolfe's writing and it should not even have been tried. Don't look at the movie, read the book. <br /> <br /> - Hair
