The actors and actors in this series are OK, but the scripts have been totally terrible. This family is so uncertain that they are not even funny. In fact, scripts very often illustrate how not to be older. The scripts are so bad that Homer Simpson looks like a better father. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has become a parent if you want to see what your children do not do is an ideal guide to this show. I think this exhibition feeds us, beyond the words. <br /> <br /> Michael Rapaport has marked much better material during his career (including his role in HITCH). They need strong leadership and a better, much better script than what I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you think this is a generation, my teenager has even turned off this show because they thought it was terrible.
