An example of all the worst gay stereotypes in a single movie. <br /> <br /> And Charles, why are you talking about this strange British / high-eyebrow accent and asking the child to talk about that? Did anyone notice that all the soundtrack music is exactly the same? You should stick to the old old Hollywood camp, what you are so good! Die Mommy Die II, Sequel !! I don't have time to spend time and money on such a project; There are so many REAL life gay youth stories to be said and we should see them, not this garbage. Sheesh, a waste of time. An amazing example of gays.
