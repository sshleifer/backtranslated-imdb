I have to say that I really liked SEGE and KARDAN. <br /> <br /> Watching Seagal make his funny martial arts for people. I've always been looking for Seagal movies and unfortunately I was GLIMMER MAN's first disappointment, which I really bad. FOREIGNER is probably one of the worst Seagals ever. <br /> <br /> was working. Dreadful boring, poorly edited, wrong track and so on! Dear reader, do yourself a favor! <br /> <br /> Honestly: Stay away!
