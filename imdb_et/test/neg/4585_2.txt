Like another user, I got it cheaply - I thought. 85 kroons (8 pounds). Although it is not worth the money, it is a classic class that I - like other users - saw for the first time I was a child and was waiting again about 20 years later. The story is amazingly thin (that's why it's been working for kids), but all the radio language and driver things do. It looks good on my DVD shelf in the coming years. First View (1980): 10/10. Second Review (2002): 4/10
