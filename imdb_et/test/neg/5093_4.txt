I was really looking forward to this movie, but unfortunately it didn't meet expectations. <br /> <br /> A good movie viewer identifies / empathizes / favors the main actor. Unfortunately, it was very difficult to do with Samantha Morton. <br /> <br /> The style seemed very separate and did not flow as it should / could have been. <br /> <br /> Keifer Sutherland seemed to be more than a window cover and made me wonder why he agreed to play what was a bit of a part. The beautiful scenery and Tem Morrison and Cliff Curtis acted as one plus. <br /> <br /> Maybe being a kiwi, I set a higher band for local movies. Perhaps the difficult change of director / principal actor has been biased in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm just trying to apologize for a movie that might have been great. <br /> <br /> Lots of drinks that still do not explain why this movie had nothing special. <br /> <br /> It could have been great, it wasn't.
