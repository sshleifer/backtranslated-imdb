Again, we get themes that are well covered with so many previous films. Good and bad son, east of Eden. An American Sea Hero who doesn't consider himself one of the things he knows. And a sad husband may fall in love with another man's story. <br /> <br /> The mere fact that these stories are common is not so much a problem. Because, theoretically, they could still be better presented and dealt with each time. There is no luck at this time because all three of these yarns will end up being the same. <br /> <br /> Because a bad son will never be able to talk to his father, so the conflict will never be resolved properly. After his father, he starts to appreciate the bad son because he was renovating the kitchen of a delightful woman. Now, how satisfied is it. <br /> <br /> The next, surprisingly homecoming sea suspects your wife's incredible conflict can never be solved. Because he never talks to a suspect, namely his own brother. So we have another endless end. <br /> <br /> And finally, the subject of hypocrisy of American military heroism, where the sea is considered publicly heroic, when the war went through dirt, it should not really be called its own standards, this third theme goes the same way. Because the film ends as soon as it is able to speak with her husband for the first time about what she was going through. When the actual story actually begins at that moment, namely in its recovery process, how it would look and how it finally faces the family to whom it would have great guilt. All this really interesting bit is over and ignored. <br /> <br /> So, if the story is clever, this film is serious and I mean serious disappointment that I would give it an impressive cast. Although no movie should use the voice of Maguire because it belongs to Spiderman. In particular, it seems that the grown Gyllenhaal fulfills all the expectations he created as a young and ambitious actor. So much so that I really want to see him be entrusted with the demanding leadership role of the right profile. <br /> <br /> So when the majority seems to be able to do that, I have to completely forget this movie. Low and finally pretentious, completely unsatisfactory tear line. Message to Writers: We already know wounds, see Vietnamese movies. You want to earn credit, show us a credible improvement.
