I was loaned to this DVD by the film director I work in, where I play an actor playing Prosper. Knowing his style, I did not expect anything that resembles the "classic" interpretation of the text. <br /> <br /> I've found it is sometimes striking, sometimes recognizable, but often nervous and annoying. Like most experimental music, I find that robust film building blocks have been created in such films, even if they haven't found the most useful form in a more uniform format. <br /> <br /> So we have a Caliban who is more of a clown than a threat, and who doesn't even feel Miranda terribly afraid (which is strange because we know he's been trying to rape him at least once). Stefano and Trinculo, who is more annoying than funny. A strange young Prospero who looks like Amadeus. And creative change and graphics with great loss of creative editing and highly stylized posting. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, I have no problem with how Ferdanand or Miranda is portrayed. His stunned momentum and his slightly innocent innocence are actually quite relevant. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but an experimental one. One that takes great risks but is more for art and film students and not really for anyone interested in Tempest for their own sake.
