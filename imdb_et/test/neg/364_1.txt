First let me start by saying that I've been committed to C Thomas Howell's career in The Outsiders and The Hitcher. He was another star in the 1980s - with hits like "Soul Man". The future was bright for this young actor, and he had the opportunity to go on and really end up in Hollywood. In this way - Tom Cruise was part of "The Outsiders", while Howell took the lead. Watch Cruise Today !!! But choosing the material with such a finger makes Howell's career worse - if possible. Why does he choose such things? A small part of a big movie would be more useful to him than this garbage. <br /> <br /> Basically, this story takes place in an apocalyptic world where everyone lives under the chaos of land. Howell is a sheepdog - protects the herd of various religious leaders by killing everyone unwanted. He's a hit man. <br /> <br /> Sets are so bad that they don't look like the Thunderbirds episode. The use of slow motion is reproduced unnecessarily in the whole film, but it is also supported by bad behavior (and a bad word here), continuity, scenes that have not been thrown for any reason, vehicles that looked like they were corn flakes and stupidly limited by the style of the director. Oh yes, and the storyline was too pathetic. that anyone could have been proud of it. I'm neither a filmmaker nor a director, but I would hide my sand sand when I spent any amount and time on this film. <br /> <br /> In short, it was a monumental time and energy and I wouldn't want anyone to ever see this movie. It came with a free DVD player that I bought, but I turned it halfway because I was embarrassed for Howell. Come C - Give yourself some credits and wrestle yourself with these flawless wonders and try to kick off and get a good share - albeit small. <br /> <br /> 1/10 - and just because there's no setting for 0/10.
