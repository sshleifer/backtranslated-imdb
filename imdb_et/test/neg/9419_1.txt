I had a suspicious chance to watch this movie on television. This is a great example of how to take a terrible script and make it one of the worst films. Not only does it act bad and the consequences are terrible, the film has more logical holes than ten pounds of imported Swiss cheese. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie very well to show you how not to make a movie and what a director doesn't use in you. <br /> <br /> I turned off the TV for the last ten weeks. Naming it "pathetic" is a serious underestimation.
