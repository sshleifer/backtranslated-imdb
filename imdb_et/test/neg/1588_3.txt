The name of the DEA agent Anslinger is a nice inner joke - this is the name of the former drug tsar who was almost unlawfully engaged in marijuana. <br /> <br /> Although the book's knowledge is small, writers continue to allow farmers to harvest and sell fresh dried leaves rather than dried buds. <br /> <br /> In addition, I am always interested in the fact that filmmakers never seem to be able to find real marijuana plants for the film. You think there would be a business that would make a true searchable fake for filmmaking or maybe they could shoot a few scenes in Amsterdam or Switzerland. I think it is asking too much about the budget. <br /> <br /> Probably the most interesting thing about the film is to cover the term exactly what is right and what is wrong in society and how the law will apply. and nevertheless tries to do justice. <br /> <br />
