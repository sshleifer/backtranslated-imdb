This movie is so daring that it doesn't try to hide its similarities with The Shining. It lacks originality. And when it ends, try to cover your story, "the father goes into a psychic outing under the influence of a visual haunted house," it does so with many other conventions and ideas already created. In other words, it reduces itself to clich√©s. But hell, even if I have a good predictable horror or thriller, if there is an interesting story, one full of violence and gore, somewhere before the film makes a terrible appeal to the predictable and the trick. Well, this movie doesn't have a good story and I was very disappointed with it. What is "Darkness" for this is a remarkable direction and cinematography. This is a well-filmed film that has been carefully designed with fun, horrible corners and shots. With "Darkness" does not go, it's pretty much more. First with a small mistake - editing this movie is unpleasant. It jumps from one scene to another, sometimes meaningless. For example, the old man in the film with the current circles of the hamster (who carries a lot of background music, which is later filled with another character) is emphasized. I mean, it seems cool for the first time, but why continue to use the same picture? I think you should see it yourself to understand what I mean. Another problem with this film is Anna Paquin's character who basically sweeps the whole movie, cries and cares for everything - he's an unsuccessful attempt at the movie with a character-based horror movie. In the film, there are scenarios that are overwhelmed by sentimentality and the family drama it represents is not simply plausible. Finally, "darkness" is a confusing melodrama, the mystery of which does not contain too much end. And it's scary.
