SPOILERS: The original Road House is one of those films I know is clich√© and unoriginal, but it's so well done, I'm embarrassed to admit that I like it. It turns out that many of my friends whose movie opinions respect me think the same way. So, when they try to follow it and it's like being written by a high school child who was given the right to follow, it's just bad; Really, really bad. <br /> <br /> Strange, Johnathon Schaech is listed as one writer and I can only hope that his WGA membership will be canceled. Writing was just bad and all the writers of this film should retire because of the lack of complete originality and some of the worst dialogues of this millennium. Schaech, who already seemed to be the king of the post-DVD king (8mm 2, Poison Ivy 2) and now after that and 8 mm 2, can see that his ability to act does not exist. He was terrible, just terrible. <br /> <br /> And it's not a terrible fight scene that makes this movie terrible, but take it from me, they're bad. Each fight scene is slowly transmitted with a punch (but still an air of "sound") blocked by an opponent who returns a punch that sends the first boy to the ground. This is repeated throughout the film, which is worse than any 1970s police show. Or the fact that many fighting people for some reason have a cherry-school-full mouth. And we should believe that Will Patton is a fighting machine; His struggle scenes look so amazingly fake I was honestly embarrassed. This is the complete expiration of the logic of this ridiculous movie, which makes it terrible. For example: Johnathon Schaech's character is in the city one day and already talks to a girl he hardly knows who he has no idea in which side he is, "I'm with Feds, but don't tell anyone." A female villain who fights against a good girl with a fight stand with any super hero, but what Will Patton, the "old boy", has easily adhered to in another scene. line ("stab me once, shame you, punch me twice, don't happen" mad, it's bad) and then head to his head. Jake Busey's villain lets the fans catch drugs, but none of the DEA agents or anyone just goes into place and chooses him after he has just let him down because "it's a sheriff's territory." Busey wants a bar because it is a "great place" for drug-related transactions, but his own house seems to be as good as probably all the things the bar should have. Johnathon Schaech's character should be the son of the original character of Patrick Swayze, but the surname of Swayze's character is Dalton and Schaech is not (or the brother of Swayze's brother). And Johnathon Schaech sees about 50 people in this film. I looked at it, he's 17 years younger than Swayze, but he looks terrible. <br /> <br /> But my favorite totally stupid scene in this movie was the most depot scene that ended up in the movies: the villain has been knocked through the window on the second floor and when they lay down, I mean, "please don't tell me he's is something ... "and definitely my worst fears have come true. <br /> <br /> In fact, I hated about half an hour for this movie. Suffice it to say, let's finish these ridiculous direct-DVDs for theatrical films, at least with Johnathon Schaech.
