I hope the people who made this movie read these comments. Choreography was terrible, the plot was zero and actors, with so low budget rails appearing at 5 stars. to make the next move. Cutting the camera and bad lighting could not cover the cheap effects. The flash was just stupid. Weapons looked like the ultimate fantasy game and the double bow and arrow was just boring like nothing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The next movie that you decide to invest in a wireless microphone is a better script and really try your time for your stunts. <br /> <br /> Frankly, there is an exhibition on television to play at night and thrown for a few hours, which looks better than that. <br /> <br /> Stay in the martial arts (if it's not as poor as yours acting) then start quilting.
