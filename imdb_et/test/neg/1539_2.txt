So, when I was watching this movie, did I think the producers of this movie escaped the money of Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by dragging her "before" clothes from Miss Congeniality? Did Mrs Bullock also get through this attack by "going ahead" to Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have noted earlier, the film is very formal. Add this deja vu viewer experience to the character of Cassie Maywether, a bit darker than Gracie Hart, with more setbacks and becoming a fast-paced festival. <br /> <br /> Two bad boyfriend killers have been made (and better) in other films before. As well as a "good man partner who tries to protect his partner, despite the evidence", he has seen before. In fact, no movie characters can go beyond two dimensions and try to be nothing more than trimming stereotypes. The assassination of one person - even if it is a deliberate murder - does not make you a sequential killer. You may have the potential to become successive killers, but you are not a serum killer or even a ridiculous killer.
