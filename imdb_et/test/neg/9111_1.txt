***** I publish two "twists" at the end of the movie. Don't read if you want to watch this movie for some reason ***** <br /> <br /> Oh, that's bad. And for some reason, Sean Bean, one of the greatest contemporary actors, has sold his soul and appears in it. The only consolation is that the scriptwriters must have realized that someone who is ultimately pathetic, like Steve Guttenberg, could never try to kill someone as cool as Sean Bean. Instead, he was killed because at the end it was the great man whom Bean was supposed to kill, but he was actually his boss and lost his death. Do not worry. I have not destroyed you. The action itself is remarkable because Guttenberg's proprietary "Hey-look-I-can-pull-a-Chuck-Norris face" is a person who dominates most after two hours. Adding to a plot that I could have written, tortured and hanging up with both hands, it is also pointless to make a critical mistake that one moment the virus escapes when they watch as much as they do. while Steve Guttenberg runs around it, throws, grabs and grabs the "virus" that looks like the set of small soap balls that you put in your bath. My last word? If you are a suicide and feel that you want to laugh at something that should be a bad comedy, but what is worse, let it be the next time at midnight on tape, then burn it when you realize I'm really talking about the truth.
