Club Club promotions are introduced around the 1980s club game. What we finally have is an identity-related film. Sub-plots take over what viewers take as the main plot, so focusing on that film, which is mainly "club games", ends in the gutter. <br /> <br /> Boxing, depression, confident, gangsters, bouncers and drug deals, are all in a hurry for a total of 90 odd minutes. At least four times, I had to check the timing of the movie because I was worried that this movie was disappointing. <br /> <br /> What club scenes we see are nice and repetitive, with about 3 extra races dancing in a barely recognizable "club", barely in the day. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie from the 80s club scene, something like "Human Traffic" made in the late 90s forget about "Clubbed".
