I had a funny opportunity to see it in Mystery Science Theater 3000, four years ago. I have to admit that it was not as badly done as other scientific literature / horror films in history. The plot turned around to the astronaut that came back with the alien embryo. Now the plot is rather weird when you even call it a plot. (Seeing that the space program ends with one building and the old pickup truck has fallen funny!) I testify that it was terrible for today's standards (and 20 years ago) ... but I see myself watching it 43 years ago and the film captivates. It is not even close to Neptune's invasion of mana, Manos: Fate or War of the Future. <br /> <br />
