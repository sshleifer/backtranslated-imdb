In short, this movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> I understand that this is a Disney movie, which is generally a low film with mediocre plots and poor performance. However, I have to say that this is the worst of all Disney movies, bad guys, LOTE NATIONAL WORKSHIPS (my god) and the extremely unreal plot. Even if you were 12 years old, I wouldn't have liked this movie. The only way this film could have been worse is when they tried to put it in the theater or tried to sell it in a local video store. <br /> <br /> Take your preference and change the channel before watching it, no matter how long you are on Sunday afternoon.
