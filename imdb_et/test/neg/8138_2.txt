This movie was cheesy and it was more. It was the man who was screaming at him and he became a gorilla. I had to see how bad it was because of the title. Before this man becomes a gorilla, he marries. I was a little irritated because he was not a gorilla bride: she is now a gorilla woman. He should have been married to him when he was a gorilla, so the title would have been more meaningful. All these people are also in the middle of the jungle and they all want to leave. It's not just a B-film, it's a Z-film. I didn't even see any bananas for the wedding. Oh, he was not yet cursed.
