I found myself getting angry when the movie progressed. <br /> <br /> Dr Crawford (Dennis Hopper) has basically predicted that the meteor will hit the ground. The "authorities that are" do not believe that he will lay the foundation for the construction of a small group of people to survive the mountain survival. <br /> <br /> Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati) is a reporter for his happiness For a frustrated tabloid who gets a tip for a friend, he was dead in the mountains. He's trying to investigate. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to escape the secret of survival, Jake spends a lot of time taking pictures of people or beating them during their lifetime. He spends the rest of his time talking to Crawford who gave the dock the right to decide which people should survive the meteor. <br /> <br /> I found that I want Jake to make a great future and turn the gun himself. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this turkey.
