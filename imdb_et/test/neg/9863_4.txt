I'm a chess player and I wanted to like this movie. The problem is that the content could have been installed on a 30-minute documentary. <br /> <br /> There were many corridors that passed and Kasparov looked in the hall where he won the World Cup. The other shots of Kasparov went around the 1997 match and were told where he was sitting and where Deep Blue was located. It seemed like a filler. <br /> <br /> Also, I couldn't see the detail of where Deep Blue was now and saw IBM's technique to try and successfully open it. What would we still be interested in - a little grandmaster? <br /> <br /> Also a recent game against Karpov. I no longer follow professional chess to find out when and where it was. It would have been nice to say that was it a one-off "just for money"? Was it part of the World Cup? What was the final result? The movie nub was in the game. Would IBM allow Kasparov to see inside the machine? There should have been a focus.
