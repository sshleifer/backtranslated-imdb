Oh, I'm not usually the person who gives the movie less than 5 points. Mainly due to the efforts of actors and directors. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for Keyman from me. If anyone thinks that the main character (or whoever) deserves the Oscar, I deserve the Nobelprize for peace. <br /> <br /> Seriously. I can't believe that this movie came to Europe. The actor was terrible, the plot was terrible and about 70s with fierce music. Give me a break. <br /> <br /> "Popeye" e.g. What's with her? Why is he there, he has nothing to do with the film. <br /> <br /> And how Keyman speaks. Once she can't say a good word the next time she speaks. He also dies almost as he wakes up and some sunlight shines through his bunker. But when she walked on the street, there was nothing to do with sunlight. <br /> <br /> Look at this movie just because you're dying of boredom. I'm sorry I didn't look to grow my roses, which is more fun anyway than this ...
