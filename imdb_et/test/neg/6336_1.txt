This film must be one of Michael J. Fox's generally respectful quarries. I should have known how terrible this movie was when I rented it, and found the movie only half-viewed and not by the previous tenant. Never a good sign! Fox plays an adult adult star who is now the representative of other children in the show. His character is wrong because he still believes that everyone should love him for Mikey. His big break comes when he meets Angie Vega, a talented child. Vega is abrasive and not at all pleasant. In fact, Cyndi Lauper is the only pleasant character of the whole movie, which is an administrator with the Brooklyn accent. One of those movies that makes me want to mark the box in the box, warning others that they won't waste their time!
