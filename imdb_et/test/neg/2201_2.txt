SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I won't go into high-tech films, assuming they are 100% accurate on all computer-related things. But somehow, even an average user with a computer should believe that: <br /> <br /> 1) the ultimate secret, a computer worker with special data <br /> <br /> 2) keeps a first copy of this data on a 1.44 floppy disk <br /> <br /> 3) and absolutely no feedback on this secret information <br /> <br /> Even high school students back up for their homework because of awe. <br /> <br /> This is also the worst representation of computer jokes. Although he is super cute, we should believe he has no friends, neighbors, extended family, or associates who can identify him. Even the unabomber had a family who could turn it on. <br /> <br /> END SPOILER <br /> <br /> These are not just minor bugs that did not affect the movie. points that offered the story. Characterization was terrible, the plot was totally unsuitable, and if you haven't seen it, don't worry.
