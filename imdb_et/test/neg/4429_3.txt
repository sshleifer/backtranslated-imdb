I looked at some of the first part of this movie and the little small parts. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think this movie is really worth it. Strange characters and events do not turn your attention and are quite interesting, but there are also bad things and some hard things. Its magical and mythical side turned me off and for most Christians, this film would not be very suitable or cost effective to look at.
