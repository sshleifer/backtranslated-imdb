Some men, named Karl Rhamarevich, are learning how to live through telemedicine even after death. He's attracted to the mausoleum. That evening, Julie (Meg Tilly) will have to stay there to get into a group called "sisters". And Karl's "power" is fully flourished. <br /> <br /> Silly movie. I saw it in the theater when I was 21 and was generally bored. The PG rating should have pulled me out - it's a horror movie for kids. One REAL fool scene at the end is the body to break through the concrete to capture the young boy! For beginners, dead bodies are placed in front of HEAD, making it impossible for the body to use its hands and no one is going to break the concrete. If you notice such foolish mistakes, the film will not do its job. At one point, one sister stings on her stomach - her hand goes into the body and she can't pull it out! This scene has always been with me. And there is a cute little cover with a dead body and a toothbrush at the end (which smiled from my audience). But the rest of the movie is a dim, dull memory. For children only - adults are bored. I'll give her 3.
