Brainy, a cross-dressing little boy finds success in spelling the Bee circuit despite unusual and dysfunctional upbringing. Shirley MacLaine and the grandmother of the child, and it is always exciting to see that the long-term actor gets her chance in managing the film, the material they draw and the participants with whom they work. Here is the only person who has been "Bruno", MacLaine. It seems that the child's actors have shone for their couples and brightness, and squishy-hearted MacLaine keeps her close-ups agonizing for a long time; Nothing of these cherubs seems natural, not the lines that fall unconscious of their mouth or communication with adults or even with one another. When a boy's unhappy father, poor Gary Blue, lies around the edges, shameful, always with painful eyesight on his face. Towards the end of the movie, MacLaine turns the whole thing into a passport for hugging scenes, and even ends with a child hugging the Pope in Rome! Another divine treatise from a talented actor-director who, like Sally Field and his film "Beautiful", does not seem to be ceaselessly striking and striking the audience. Shirley uses shticki ethnic origin and childhood innocence as a punchline. Its cast children put their eyes in the eye, split with smart comments, use big words - but if one of the mealy-kissed boys calls our pint-sized hero "gay", MacLaine's grandmother gives her a command to go out and hit (in front of the media!). How does it progress? * from ****
