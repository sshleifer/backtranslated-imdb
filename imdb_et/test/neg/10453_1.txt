Sorry, after looking at the credit, I thought it would be at least a decent honor for the retired SF participants. <br /> <br /> My boy was wrong. <br /> <br /> In this direction and story POS is terrible. I never insulted this one. <br /> <br /> I have a great deal of respect and love for many of the participants in this "movie", but I have to say they were connected. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this strainer, do yourself a favor and stay away. These are not just two hours if you don't get back, but they also destroy your respect for some of the participants you've ever received.
