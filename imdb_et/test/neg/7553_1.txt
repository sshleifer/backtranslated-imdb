No wonder many young people have a disorder of attention deficit. It seems that the stage (dance) staging these days is all about how many cameras and camera corners the director / editor can show for 1 hour. Is there an Emmy category for this game? Try to read them sometimes something else to do with it, otherwise it is a totally irresistible display. <br /> <br /> I tried to make some other dancers face in production. It was impossible. They didn't see the face, but blurred - it was just Michael Flatley's face, Michael Flatley's bare chest (nice gloss!), Michael Flatley's legs and patented Flatley's over-shoulder-come-here looking at the recurring infinity squared. Since he was the chief executive of this cutting and pasting operation, I think it was expected. One does not have to wonder too much about his target group. The Riverdance was a much better production because he tried to show the presentation quite as it was seen by the viewers, not the roof cover, the side wings or the perspective of the floor nail. If I'm not mistaken, I believe Sir Michael is retired. Thank God for the small blessings.
