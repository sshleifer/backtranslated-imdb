It may be for those who have been to summer camps, but it is definitely not a fun camp. I went to one before, but it didn't make me up and down. Instead, it hurt my head. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is that Bill Murray had hair in the 70's. Yeah, and he didn't think so. But to guide him a lot, you should give him a wife. <br /> <br /> Because some stunts can't be funny. For example, a running joke with a council member who always wakes up because of his bed movement. Instead of jokes and stunts being poorly set and executed. It just wasn't funny. <br /> <br /> For someone who loves comedy, it's pain. Others are glued to life. I wish it was more like Leonard Part 6, but it is not close. "F"
