It may be the biggest disappointment I see in 2009. I look like this is a rare person who didn't like Park's Oldboy, but I think his "Lady Vengeance" and "Compassion for Mr Vengeance" are one of the best films I have. decade. That is why I was really looking forward to it, especially since he received such positive comments. Instead, I found clich√©s in the film and broke a little as something new to the vampire genre. And although I can understand somewhat wretched humor in such films, I felt Park was doing it in a very timely manner. <br /> <br /> Others have compared / contrasted "be the right one," and I have to say "Be the right one" was much better than that, and was a fresh vampire genre. Unfortunately, taking Park was tired.
