Boy, this movie is bad. And not good, cheesy, fun way too. Even MST3K was unable to stop it bored and it is also confusing because everyone gets out. But the most annoying part of this annoying confusion is Ireland's terrible high voice that I was tired of listening to in the first five minutes. Not to mention how truly unique his character is. Even his father ran away and gave up on him! I see why frankly. If he had to listen to him a little more than a few minutes, he would have been tempted to do a lot of damage to him. As I was, at the end of the movie. In addition, he is useless and annoying. If he dropped into a long hole in the ground, Alice in Wonderland, he would have done it in the first ten minutes, if it was not inexplicably held by the Australian accent miner from all his different wills. . He should have just tied him to the Atlantis train tracks and had done so. And this Atlantis on earth, where there is a strange, confusing obsession with bone density, must I ask - where did the fire come from? Do they have solar generators? Does not matter. Anyway, there is no real plot, but a bunch of strange costumes that run around trying to catch Kathy (probably so they can grab the mouth). Stupid, pointless movie. Thank you to Golan Globus for this cinematic intimidation. Are you burning for the seventh round of hell forever.
