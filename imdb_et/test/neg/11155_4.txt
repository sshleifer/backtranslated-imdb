I really don't know why I'm writing this. I think most people agree that this movie is bad. Well, let me say: <br /> <br /> When I watch movies for the first time, I like them. Then as time goes by, my opinion on the film changes. it happened at the end of the day. I liked it the first time I saw it. I thought it was fun. But a few weeks later, my opinion has changed. So to solve this problem, I looked at it again in my friends house. Well, it's bad. <br /> <br /> I am a logical person. When I see a logical hole in the movie, I try to ignore it. When I see two, I'm gonna get upset. More than two and I'm p *** ed. At the end of the day, after the second look, I turned into a success. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film is a bit frustrating. All this is sad. Everything from Arnold's operation to film color. But the dark films don't bother me, but some other thing was ... <br /> <br /> If Satan can recover his wounds, how can he kill him in his mortal form? When you shoot him, his skin will grow back. If you cut off your head, the new one should be back up. So the question is: what is the point of even killing him? I'm telling you why: because it's a silly film with a recycled villain. It's not my friends. This is the person who remembers those Bond rogues who give the hero the whole scheme. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's worth it, but you don't see it twice because it's crap.
