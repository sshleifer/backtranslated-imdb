All the ambiguities about Michael Myers have been frustrated by the chronic habit of this series with their continuity and pulling away relatives. This record introduces a potty corner, which he is not just a psychological killer, but is actually controlled by clues that appear as a star in every Halloween, and the cult uses it ... erm, well, this movie is far from uniform and after a while I lost the plot. The bleeding of the film is of such reliability that it does not end up falling down. Why did Michael put one of the victims in the washing machine? Why else is an empty corridor dead out of the wall? Does a power failure make your head explode? And so on. Donald Pleasence has in his penultimate film role a few wonderful moments of the terrible dialogue he has given.
