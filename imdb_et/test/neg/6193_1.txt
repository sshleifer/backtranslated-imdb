Let me first say that in the past I have been a great career blower. I think George is one of the smartest people in the world and the best comics. what became so great in the past was his ability to look at things in his twisted way and give us his unique perspective on these things. it was not always funny, but you have always respected your opinions because they were so smart. but you're all sick, it's just a long bead. he does not give us a unique perspective, but gives us a long list of things he had. there is no understanding, no wisdom, but an old man who complains about things we've all complained about within one hour. and moreover it wasn't even funny. you are all sick who are turning to foolish people who are unable to develop anything more than something simple and direct. I don't mind anger favoring comedy, but George could have done so much better. I really hope that George Carlin's next exhibition will live the quality that George has shown before.
