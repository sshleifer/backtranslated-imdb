I saw it last night at the Tribeca Film Festival and the holy god was it bad. From script to editing to cinematography - none of it worked. Not to mention that the design / costumes were so disturbing during the period that it lasted until the end of the 70s until the end of 2006. Even John Hurt, who is usually an amazing actor, was ridiculous. Quinten Crisp has prevailed from the beginning, but Hurt was not given anything to do here. I don't know much else except the audience I saw it absolutely loved. So maybe it's just me. But viewers love everything at film festivals when they sit next to the director and all the actors. It is not a very accurate test of how good a movie is or how well it plays. Personally, I thought this movie was terrible. On the other hand, it was so terrible that it was fun. If you are in HBO for two years, break it and let it down if it ever reaches far.
