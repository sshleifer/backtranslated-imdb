I fully agree with the previous reviewer. There are no chemistry between Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarri and their relationship is at the heart of the film. Hedy Lamarr is not his best, and Spencer Tracy seems to be naive, simple and too hopeful - both in love and in life; ideal for playing Boys Town best. If you can go through this train station with a ridiculous crowd ... who ... it is rather a hit and not worthy of an actor. It is not best for anyone to get involved. Inappropriate and inappropriate. The story is empty and there is a wide variety of non-binding inputs. Hedy Lamarr is her absolutely stunning, which is really the best movie. Spencer Tracy is not complicated with her beauty and wardrobe, and the film does not come at least for this reason.
