Not sure if it's just a terrible movie or if it was meant to mock the West. The story was so, but filming, editing and acting were just bad. Plus the background music is irritating to the end, too loud and just non-stop. How many times did you not have a background music dialogue? I'm in the SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) and do some of the Old West with them, and many actors are members of this group, so that's why I bought it. If you have no interest in this group or its sport, it would certainly not be a little interesting to help with the film. Even the actions of veteran actors (especially Stella Stevens) were much desired.
