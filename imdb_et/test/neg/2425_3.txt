First of all, let me say that I live in South Africa, where rugby is our biggest sport, and our national side, Springboks, has won the Rugby World Cup twice, so here's a pretty big deal. I've been playing all my life and I'm shocked by the bad attention of this movie! First of all, I thought it was a great movie, taking into account Neal McDonough, Nick Ferris, Gary Cole, and Sean Astin's wrongfulness, but it turned out to be a mockery of sport. They mashed it with their usual daily American football movie. <br /> <br /> My first problem is that this movie is supposed to think of Rugby values, but discipline or should I say that their total absence during games is controversial. Ultimately, it seems to be a NFL game, where Penning is being fought many times, before a judge ... which would have led to a few red cards right now, because playing in this way would not be left unpunished by the judge I assure you! You can't also find a world rugby trainer with so little control over your team. All coaches took the landfill of the players' head when he deliberately tightens the opponent's player or double team, as he did in the final ... on the red card and on a certain stop at the full stop. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is absurd for a trainer to take on a brand new player who has played his entire life, leading him to a whore, a very specialized position and saying it is TEAMI! What ?! Hooker is in the front row a very specific position where you have to be able to move extremely well and preferably hit the ball during the outflow that Penning never causes. Moving the wing whore without extensive long-term training would first lead to the death of your team during the scrum and, secondly, the poor child is likely to be on your neck! How is this good for the team? Finally, the overall high emotional pitch of the film is too much, because although rugby is a great sport and it builds great friendships and team spirit, it rarely gets out of hand and scares. I've seen a real life football drama that has fewer emotions than this movie and it turned out to be great, but the skills of this Penning actor are moving too far and the film is trying too hard to get an emotional response out of the audience, which is sometimes boring and difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> Over the years, Hollywood has made some great sports movies, but next time they will have a sport that has risen recently in countries. should try and do their homework and maybe could scare some experts. <br /> <br /> DON'T OR DO NOT ALL!
