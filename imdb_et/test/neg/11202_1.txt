Gordon Scott, along with his well-skinned hair, a sand-clock, and a strange pidg of English must be the worst of all Tarzans. For the other participants in this confusion, they are equal to the Grade 4 drama class. I've seen used car dealers in TV commercials that can do better. They make Clayton Moore like Laurence Olivier! And where Jane (dull Eve Brent) gets her lipstick and eyebrow pens in the jungle? I understand they are made for kids, but Wow! The plot line seemed OK, but the director should have demanded more from his participants. I understand that even Weissmuller's films have some flaws, but it seemed like a low budget.
