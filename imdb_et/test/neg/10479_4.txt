Protected young woman, trained at home and maybe quite talented, distracted in the harbor, too emotional side, which arises on the surface after her boyfriend's father pays her mother a visit, asking for a divorce. Under the leadership of a remarkable operator, William A. Fraker, this bad seemingly psychological thriller traps the majority of the photographers who are led by the photographers themselves: every shot is made up of ultimate style, but a victim of fluid stimulation and tight, gripping narrative. Fraker (and his operator László Kovács) are very fond of white and golden tones, giving the picture a fine whiteboard. The mansion in the middle of the manor looks like a funeral workshop and the Fraker emits a whistling yarn like a funeral. Robert Shaw and Sally Kellerman (Shawi's fiancée), two of the most interesting actors in the 1970s, were able to go through a plastic coating and are quite compelling, despite the blatant edits (which makes their scenes a little half-realized business). Sondra Locke, another interesting personality on the screen, seems to be like Catherine Deneuve's "Repulsion". Bad and plush eyes, with extremely thick and long hair, Locke is a curious human puzzle and is initially quite scary and dangerous; but this role is such an old hat that Locke can't find anything fresh to bring the freezer out and it slips. Fraker promises Locke's fictional scenes to go on and on, while Shaw (looking scary) is impossible to play with him. All this mess can be worth it if it makes sense (or at least somewhat dry or humorous). As it is, the sliding scenario of Lewis John Carlino and Edward Hume, tailored to the Stanton Forbes novel "Go to your dead chamber", directs the viewer early and only the players' charisma goes to the finish. * 1/2 from ****
