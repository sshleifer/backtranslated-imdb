I rented this thinking so it would be pretty good to have the movie cover. The judge and the jury started a pretty good killer who was hunting for a man who killed his wife with a bicycle with a cool gun, but this film gradually progressed as he moved on. David Keith is a fantastic actor, especially if he plays such a role as it is too bad. The judge and the jury were very ordinary, I gave him 3, would have given him 2, gave him an extra star just because David Keith's gun was cool.
