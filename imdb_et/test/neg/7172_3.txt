This movie begins with children who talk to each other about city legends, such as the bottle in a microwave and something extra in the place of a chicken. Unfortunately, it turns to its basic anthology film. The first one is a janitor who has a little secret. That's the best. Then it gets worse when the next story about a child who is registered by dead flies is turned on and on and on. It's a long way and not all interesting to start with. After that you get a typical shock scene and it ends. You need an anthology movie to do more. You need at least three stories, and one shouldn't be so long that it becomes terribly uninteresting, especially since you see how the mile ends.
