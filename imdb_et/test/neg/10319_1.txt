I watched 5% of this movie today and you can tell me that I have to see the whole movie to understand it, but frankly, I don't think so. <br /> <br /> What the hell is that? Movie? I saw a lot of people running around the factory shooting everything around them. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Okay .. <br /> <br /> 1) They fired around as if it was a Terminator or something they were trying to kill. The whole place is made of metal, but not any bullet that has been created on metal surfaces. <br /> <br /> 2) No ricochet. Metal vs. metal has definitely caused ricochet, but apparently no one hit a stray ball. <br /> <br /> 3) Magic balls? In one scene, a bad boy stands in front of a good boy when another good boy jumps behind a bad boy and pumps him up with a metal. You see that the balls come out of the chest when it explodes in the bloody fog, but a good man in front of him can't hurt at all! 4) When a person has shaken the whole wall, two good men are joking and laughing at each other and look like teenagers playing with soft weapons. <br /> <br /> 5) Sound? At one point the good guys cut the wire and the alarm goes off (who hell stops the wire just to turn off the alarm?). The lady shouts "Alarm in the sector blah blah" and the bad boy boss says, "Okay .. this .. is .. no .. ..powder .. blah blah" very, very amateur. Ooh, we get into the hands of terrorists, it's not a cage, but I hear I don't give it a mess. <br /> <br /> 6) Focus !! First you see the bad guys on the weapons. For some reason, the same guy gets the same Uzi twice. Deja vu or Scenes loop? You literally see that every bad guy gets the same type of weapon and they lock and load the same way. Weapon Dealer appears clip and bad guy extra. XX locks and loads. When they started to open the fire, you had to see that the barrel was flashing. Whore! 7) Actors or dummies? One of the expected good men will give up the smoke grenade for some reason and of course the bad guys are suddenly in the smoke because they are smoke-blind or something that they can't see. They cough and complain like Anthrax on the grenade. Then the half-boy's bad guy arrives and he doesn't even cough when he enters the smoke, he just pushes the other bad guys out and they suddenly realize that smoke is still not Anthrax. <br /> <br /> 8) B flick? I think yes! A man slipping down a metal tube that went to his right hand with Uzi, shooting him at eye level. I'd like to see one man light up one hand with Uz and I'd like to see him get his hand. Especially Bloody Gore Confusion B Flick Kinda Way. Small * jump * and a red hole with a torn shirt shows that this man is dead. While the first bullet struck his heart, a good man who is very educated with green berets still feels the desire to clear his dead guy. <br /> <br /> 9) One of these trained soldiers jumps out of his hide with an empty clip! How stupid can it be? Always check your clip before you come across an unknown number of enemies! 10) boring scenes. Like barrel flash scenes and lock and load scenes, the movie is full of time wasting scenes with people running around apparently an empty building. Take action if you plan to go to the B movie. <br /> <br /> My two cents for this movie.
