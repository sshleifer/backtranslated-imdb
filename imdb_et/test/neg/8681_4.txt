On the plus side, it contains interesting information on many different topics, especially regarding Himmler, SS and their discipline. It also has great piano music, some interesting film footage, and some great camera work. <br /> <br /> But this is a very poor historical work. It has no clear purpose and the whole thing could be summarized as follows. <br /> <br /> Himmler founded the SS Department to investigate the origins of the German race. They went all over the world. They did some things and launched the expeditions to all sorts of places ... (the unofficial authority of these options was examined, the results were not shown and the arguments were hardly refuted). They wanted to prove that the Arab race and the German people were one and the same thing as historical evidence. They didn't find any. The members of this study group were leading professors, members of the SS, and hence associated with the Holocaust, and they were considered OK after the war and went on to lead the German institutes. <br /> <br /> These facts are intriguing in themselves, but they are not thoroughly investigated and the program does not present any coherent arguments that condemn or release these people. It also does not seem to be the purpose of the program, the purpose of the program is unclear, it stops on the topic. Witnesses are small and are not supported, although they are reliable. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this program doesn't know where it goes or why and can't impress. Themes are exciting, but this program is trying to take on a tremendous field of research and so does not seem to be happening. I would avoid it. <br /> <br /> The "Holy Grail" is also a German bloodline, with nothing to do with the Holy Grail of Christian mythology, except for the passing. References to expeditions to search for a Christian Holy Grail are made, but never performed. The title is misleading and the content of this document is not convincing and incomplete.
