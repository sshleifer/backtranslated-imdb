This doodoo shadow won the prize? They must be desperate to give up something. This movie speaks of a beautiful bopper and it made me sick. Fortunately, I looked at it with MST3K Mike and robots to make it more tolerable. Dreadful, uncomfortable mom / daughter moment, silly assumption if you want a bad movie here. Warn, but watch it with Mike and robots, or suffer. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10. I still can't believe it won the prize, and the director protects it * && ^ $$ # $ ^ && ^% ^% $ ^ $ #% @ $ # @ movie!
