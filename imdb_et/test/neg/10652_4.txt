I just bought this movie because I love to donate to the operation Smile, the charity on which the film is based ... but I found that writing a movie is very strange. It does not focus so much on the operation Smile or similar organizations such as Smile Train and their Herculean efforts to alleviate the suffering of children born with facial deformation from third countries. No, it focuses on the American teenage volunteer, Katie, whose "privileged" life in Malibu, California, includes a mother who takes her to the doctor to have her bedtime with her boyfriend. . What is this birth control unnecessary, should the audience do better? That's 2005. I'd be surprised if Malibu wouldn't be under birth control in 2005, and even if he is, what and who cares? The contrasting Katie is characteristic of Lin in China. The girl is a deformation of the face, who left the last year's surgery and does not want to do this year. Neither sign is written so that the audience can really be identified, let alone understand the girl. On the other hand, actors do enough work to try the bad hand they wrote for this ridiculous script. The best result was given by Mr. Lin's father, although much of his dialogue is in Chinese and subtitles. Operation Smile deserves a much better film than that!
