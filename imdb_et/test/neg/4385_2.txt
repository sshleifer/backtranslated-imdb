I love movies in this genre. Beautiful girls, toilet humor, free nudity. Why didn't you like this movie? Such a film should not even add the slightest confusion to the plot. Who is who with money, it's not SE7EN, just laugh at me. Maybe it is me, but I never felt disappointed with American Pie movies or other modern National Lampoon movies. This film has no flow that keeps me smiling, waiting for what follows. Instead, I find myself stopping to think, "Why did they keep this scene?" I don't recommend this movie. If you're waiting for Van Wilder, think again. The only fun I was watching this movie was to guess what movies the actors were when they were kids. 2/10 generously.
