This movie must be ranked "Gratitude to Jungle" and "The Hitcher" and "Dream Catcher" for rank and horror. You have the most irritating hero in the history of gore, who spends most of the time slipping and wobbling and beating - all the time in the most frightening toilet. Why he spends so much time in this embarrassing bathroom has never been explained. Even if a normal killer driver tries to kill him, he refuses to leave the hangman. When the motorcycle policeman comes to the rescue, the killer drives the truck driver over the police feet when the heroine just looks. Instead of grabbing his weapon for protection, he pulls the poor sliding valve and locks the door. Then the policeman ordered him to burst his brain due to pain. He does it as he scares and sniffs and jokes, and blows behind his head. Then - the cop, still alive, ask him to shoot because he is still painful. He says it while his whole head is on the floor. A scary, frightening hero puts it on again. The film continues and works like that. The heroine is so unlikely that you really want the killer early. I saw it on a flick on the Sci-Fi channel, so it didn't cost me anything to look at, but I still watched that the fascinating film showed how the film could be so bad.
