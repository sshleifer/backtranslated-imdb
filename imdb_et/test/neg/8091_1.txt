It's a movie that's garbage, it looked really funny in the preview, but I never laughed through the movie. Make a big profit and don't waste your money, don't waste that money. I gave him 1/10 of my belief that I would have given less if I had. I'm a 15-year-old boy and I thought it was a trash if you wanted to see a good movie and see Jay and Silent Bob.
