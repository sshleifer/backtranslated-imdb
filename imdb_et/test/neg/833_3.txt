This is a classic example of what will happen if the session side is too long on television. Everything is tired and the jokes start to happen again and again. OK, from the beginning, the first pair was pretty good. You had an entertainment manager (Simon Cadel), followed by his deputy Ruth Madoc, a cleaning lady who wanted to become a yellow coat, an alcoholic childhood Punch and a Judy-man, a bent Jockey, and an upright comedian. As mentioned earlier, it started well but went too long. When Simon Cadel left, he went downhill quickly, you got a terrible story and a new entertainment manager who Ruth Madoc (again) scored. When all the comedy is filmed in one place, there are limited jokes that can be cracked. Unfortunately, it went so long as every joke cracked 3 or 4 times. If this comedy had stopped after the end of the 2 series, it would be classic all the time. As it is, it is largely remembered for a terrifying last series.
