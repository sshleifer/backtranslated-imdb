- may include spoilers- <br /> <br /> It is clear that those who have ever made this film must have many connections. I just can't see it in any other way. What really surprises is that no one has used the name Allen Smithee and it is more surprising that not everyone involved used the name. <br /> <br /> Anywhere to start. Poor dialogue, harsh costumes, an apologetic film package, involuntary comedy, senior figures and more controversy than George W. Bush's college career. I don't know what was more funny, the man who lost his hand due to the snowball, or the slow scene where all of the baby Jack Frosts were killed. One of the greatest features of all time was also proclaimed in this film. "How do we know that?" Like there is another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs! Great camp film, but very bad film.
