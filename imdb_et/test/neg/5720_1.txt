I remember Conan's this notorious weak spin-off trailer. I saw the movie years later and laughed at my head. Inadvertently! Poor Briggite Nielson. His career never got thanks to Cobra and Red Son. The plot is: Sonja (Brigitte Nielson) is a female warrior tribe killed by the evil Queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman). Queen Gedren steals the orb that the female warriors are defending and uses it to destroy every city she passes through. Sonja goes to Queen Gedren to hunt and later it turns out that Gedren killed her parents. In his quest, he reluctantly joins Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a noble prince named Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) and his ghostly idiotic servant Falkon (Paul L. Smith). Together they go to Queen Gedren and orbit. Operation is subpar and action scenes are soso. I mean, Briggite Neilson looks so emotionally distant. If someone loses their entire family, as well as female comrades, Sonja doesn't see any fazed. Arnold plays his usual stoic role and Ernie Reyes Jr. Moral servant Falkon had more personality than these boys. Action scenes are the only redeeming moments in a movie, although sometimes they fall flat. The scene in which they struggle with mechanical marine animals made me laugh until my ribs hurt. Dialogue is also a hoot. It would be like the scriptwriter thought that no one was going to take the film seriously, so he gave everyone the fools to work. I can only recommend this movie to you if you like your epic movie. No one else bothered.
