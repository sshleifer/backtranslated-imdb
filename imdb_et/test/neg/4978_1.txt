When I heard Disney was entitled to "Underdog", I thought at least that it would be a cool Pixar partnership and we get a big adult and children's movie like "The Incredibles". Unfortunately, I forgot how Disney must fool classical material for today's stupid youngsters. What did they mean? "Underdog" was a 60s product, your Prime Minister Fanbase in your 40s and 50s, why would you focus on 5-year-olds? It should have been the area "Roger Rabbit", half animated party real. Instead, we get signs like Riff Raff (WOLF !!) that moved to another dog. "Underdog" cannot have an "energy pill" because we are now so "illuminated" that it is probably a steroid or drug reference. The only good pain was Patrick Warburton as "Cad" because he actually sorts the comic version. Otherwise, the old school "Underdog" fans should avoid it like a plague. What's next? "Go-Go Gophers" live version, a hidden mode vision? (My further apologies if Disney jumps into it!)
