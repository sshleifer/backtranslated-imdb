I've recently seen the gate of Heaven. After I watched this 3-hour 40-minute epic West, it's not west, I read Steven Bach's book. Considering all the events and the film itself, I think this movie is a waste of time. I believe that if someone says you look at it, they will actually try to kill you. If for some reason you can enjoy this self-conscious thinking about a really bad movie, I have to ask why. Although this is not a reason for hatred, it is historically down. He pretends to be in a situation in Wyoming called the Johnson County War. The livestock farmers just wanted to kill all the cattle and claimed they were all immigrants. You find that you just don't care about these people and hope they're all killed because at least then something happens. In the movie, everyone is talking about things that happen and it is never shown. After you sit in this huge waste of time, think about how someone could make a 4-hour epic where nothing happens. Oh, and how the Johnson County war was not a war, it never happened. The Johnson County War was actually called almost because two people actually died. I can't warn you about this movie. However, if you're like me, the idea of ​​watching a movie that destroyed a career and made United Artists "for sale" sounds like an interesting case to look into, anyway look at this terrible, narcissistic, movie without text and lots of photos ( which is sometimes cute)
