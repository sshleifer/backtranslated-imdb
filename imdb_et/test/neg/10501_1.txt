So, this is the WORST movie you probably see. It's "Crossbones" and "Southern Comfort" there, but if your bad movie fan like me, this is the most frightening thing you have had over the years. WHY does the camera make the old school kung fu noise while zooming? WHY does this casual guy in his bag want a nascar monument? And who is he? WHY Are Vampires Firing After Their Death? What is this? Highlander? Dracula McCloud? Who cares! Just laugh. This film has no consistency, no plot, nothing, really. The amount of Ron Hall's emotions is always off. She looks happy if she should be confused, angry. The rest of the majority could not go out of the paper bag. Special ("special effects of" short buses ") are randomly placed and never needed. Most scenes are illuminated with a table lamp if they are lit at all. Mel Novak has AUDACITY to watch his line off the camera and not even change it. They just remain filming. In fact, half of this movie is not even on the film at all. This is a 1/2 movie, 1/2 sony hand-doll. For most movies, they seem to have left their boom home. This film doesn't just have some plot holes, it is my area of ​​confusion and mental pain. But oh I love it! Thank you to Ron Hall for this cinematic intimidation. I went out and bought it because it's just so funny. ($ 1.99 on Amazon, and I had this rush delivered!) <br /> <br /> "I have weapons! I have weapons! I have weapons!"
