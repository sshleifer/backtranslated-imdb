I understand that it is very difficult to live on the first 10 command film (which was grandiose and not personally Charleton Heston fan), but wow ... this film / mini series was disappointing. Even the animated prince of Egypt was better. <br /> <br /> One thing that dropped me was Ramses. Compared to Yul Brynner's version, Paul Rhys's version seemed so weak and un-Pharoh. Action was not so great. I was expecting something better for modern adaptation. It just didn't look visually as stunning as the first. I think they worked in a tight budget or something. There is a random voice builder that I found strange and unnecessary. It also cut off the story. And ... God's voice / lines were strange.
