Intelligent overall story / story. The activity is respectable. Children are annoying and their motivation is unclear. The leading villain was a nice change but could have been better. "I Love You" was over played as "you stopped me" but at least Van Damme got a chance to show a little bit of tenderness. One of Van Damme's better films.
