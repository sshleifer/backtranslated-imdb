You know, this is one of those "Emperor's New Fabrics" movies. It's like, so it's wall-like and strange that you've liked it when you're really a movie. I think it's a bunch of bologna. Films that hide Dada under the prince or surrealism make me nuts. Some people have this bad dream that may have led to eating the aforementioned bologna before going to bed, most of them remember (unfortunately) and then put it on the film and we should all admire our creative genius. I also have strange dreams, sometimes that doesn't make sense in any way, but I don't feel the need to put them on the film, reveal them to everyone else and call it art. Strangeness in itself does not mean something interesting. True Dada or surreal expression has some intent and intellectual thought behind it. If other people don't get it, it doesn't make it deep, but it makes it incomprehensible. For me, it is not odd for peace of mind, not to mention the great art. And comparing "Tuvalu" with "Delicateen" is like comparing "Godfather I & II" with "Godfather III" --- with the same genre, not in the same league.
