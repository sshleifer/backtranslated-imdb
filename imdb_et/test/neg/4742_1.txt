My qualification for this review? I have all the foreigners and Predator films and I have and have read almost all the books that are related to this series. <br /> <br /> I can say for sure that this movie is smelly. Save your money and don't waste your time. If you like pointless action, meaningless gore, no plot to talk about and like Hollywood, look at the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a serious alien fan, send a message to the oversized, overpaid suits in Hollywood and 20th century Fox and don't give them a penny. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are so many holes in the plot to get through the sieve. Read other negative comments to get a big picture, everything is said exactly so I don't have to repeat them. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are cardboard. You want them all dead. And the movie is not fooled, almost all of them die. Even hot, the bubble headed to the blonde. Do you know him? No. No plot, no character development .... who cares. Predators are now also idiots. They scan everything after their dead warrior. They think it's a high-tech society, right? In the Predator movie, they scanned the soldiers and the girl to determine who was armed. The trophy kills. In AvP, they scanned Charles Weyland and let him go because he had cancer. Major Plot hole! <br /> <br /> The R-Class rating is also because they have kids in the film who get a face hug, a lot of brains and violence, and there is one hospital injecting very large pregnant women with chest bursts. An alien of a hybrid implants it with 4 or 5 eggs in the mouth, and they all hatch, for example, in 30 seconds. Sensational gore give much, nothing more. These scenes are ridiculous, not serious. It's almost like violence happens and the alien looks at the camera and looks for applause, thumbs or some confusion. <br /> <br /> Aliens of this movie are all performance-enhancing drugs. They evolve rapidly and spread quickly across the city, t. Pathetic because it doesn't stay in the series story line and adds something to aliens, alien Predator continuity. <br /> <br /> I've noticed positive comments from people who love gore. It's ridiculous. This film is the best cluster of cheesecake in developing the film as a franchise for foreigners and further developing aliens vs. Predator franchise. Once you have followed this series, all rules are violated and foreigners and predators are reduced to comic books. <br /> <br /> There is no fantastic, memorable action. Almost anything special effect to remember. No trademark actors. The plot is as thin as the onion paper, which ultimately ends with: "We have two choices to get out of this mess ... Hospital or city center!". I almost noticed myself. The city center means that everyone can get a kernel from a bigger brother who knows the city is infected because they have air in the air that can see the infection on the radar screen with special effects in red spots. I just fell out of my chair. Special effects with a red alien radar in the middle of AWAC in America. I share my gut laugh. <br /> <br /> Reaching the helicopter cartridge made my popcorn suffocate. Has anyone played a game called ZOMBIES!? You have to beat your chips on a helicopter pad. I'm almost gonna laugh at myself. <br /> <br /> The end is enough to shake you. Who did the 20th century Fox rental to write this script ?? OH, oh, ask me .... 5th grade student. There's really no other answer there. Oh, yes, there may be another answer ... Sci-Fi, a low-budget cheesecake. <br /> <br /> End? "Colonel Stevens takes the Predator impulse bar Yutan (Francoise Yip). He tells him that the land is not ready for this technology. Colonel Stevens knows that Yutan doesn't want technology to be used on earth." You're kidding me, right? Mrs Yutani? Who is Ms Yutani? (forshadow: Weyland-Yutani: Sorority) He's in the movie for exactly 2 seconds, and yet in the infinite wisdom of his infinite city he says the world isn't ready for technology. Seriously? !! Brothers Dweebs (Strause) are leaders? Who is responsible for the hemorrhage of this film? They are the directors of Doug and Bob McKenzie, and yet Fox trusted them in the flailing franchise of Alien. They are called Special Effect Experts and the film is a special effect with a low budget. Hmmm, I see the pattern. Laughing. <br /> <br /> This movie is only made to clear the wallet. It has no other purpose. He has no plot. It's not worth mentioning. It's divorced. It does not follow any of the principles set out in earlier films. It does nothing to promote the franchise. Special effects are flat, minimal and low budget. And he has no end to talk about. This is a small budget and is strictly for your hard earned money. Nothing else. <br /> <br /> Save your money. Watch it on the TV, where it comes very fast. Buy a bootleg or leave it bleeding. That's why Fox didn't look at the film's critics. Critics would have lived this crap and no one would have seen it in theaters. The original creator, JR Giger, is right now, tilting his lunch over the flowing toilet. It is just as bad or worse than an alien 3. You offend us. <br /> <br /> Rinse now ...
