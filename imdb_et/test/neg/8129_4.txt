The big (and we think plus size) baddie Sebastian Cabot is trying to get the salt of the farmers working on the ground off the ground to get the oil rights. When Haden's death killed after the death of Haden, how did Haden stop TERROR IN the Texas Hall, which was armed only with harpoon? First of all, it's not B-West. There are no song cowboys, no bold tricks, interesting sequences of action. It's just an independent film - you know, those who use irrelevant actors to say "important things" and cover interesting low budget times for camera corner events. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this movie to avoid compromises (one waiting) that would cause Trumbo's important statements on American justice, and the rather ill relationship between the main henchman and his girl is a very small budget. The main problem is that it is really, really bad. Sterling Haden has enough harsh tasks, but he is the last man you want to play with a sensitive Swedish seaman who has gone to find his fortune in the West. Sebastian Cabot tries to make Sydney Greenstret (very) expanded plutocracy. This is not a bad idea, but Cabot does not have flaps for this. A man who plays a hired weapon with a missing hand and soul (Johnny Crale) is the best role in the film. He does nothing about it. <br /> <br /> Third, the script is not all. Trumbo gets some excavations for an immigrant who doesn't get a sheriff shake right in the right city, and people, when there is a tendency to go back to true oppression. This is an outdated movie message for 1958 - High Noon, Bad Day, Black Rock, Devil's Doorway - are all Western countries dealing with the evil of Western society in the eyes of 50-year-old American evil. In the 59's, Trumbo was definitely a personal reason to accept these feelings, but he doesn't do anything new or interesting to them. <br /> <br /> So, considering all the negative, why does this film get a 4? Mostly because the film has interesting questions. (The relationship between Crale and her girl is tempting.) And Trumbo, who is her environmental writer, when she exercises her political influence, is very good at creating both interesting signs and intelligent interactions between them. Just when one is ready to go into the boredom of the Indy movie, there is a change of dialogue or a simple quirky that understands that writing a script is not just a cage. <br /> <br /> Like Trumbo or westerns, give it one. Otherwise, try it. You like it more than me.
