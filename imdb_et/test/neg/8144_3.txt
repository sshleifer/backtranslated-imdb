For Indy, it's probably a little better than 10 out of 10, but it usually only gets 3. The impact isn't terrible and at least they have some adult roles, not all kids. indy low budget horror movies do. The actors are very woody, but at least they had a better screen than some movies in the buddy budget category. It's filmed in a lot of building, not in a friend's basement. The plot as a whole is not the worst. This is Resident Evil, which pulls down a small city into an evil enterprise and the outbreak makes people zombies. I would have wanted to see some creatures, not a big baddie just another "super" zombie. I'm not trying to write a spoiler, but this review is so warned! SPOILER ALERT !!! Some of the cast images do not appear only on the shoulders of zombies (the same are recycled more and more, but at least they have more than 5 people). But one of the plot's pulls doesn't really drive with me. The vice-judge who goes in is a bad company payroll. He kills one other cold-blooded worker and then meets the office head with a bad guy who talks about cleaning up the mess. The Vice President has just shown us that he is also a real bad person and talks as he can clean it (that is, kill all the surviving witnesses). But then 2 seconds later he will help them out. There was no real "change of heart" emotion or something that made me feel that this bad boy went a few minutes ago from killing an innocent man and told everyone not to get his rescuer. There was no case or anything to buy me in. It's worth checking out if you're a low budget fan, or you won't be able to enjoy it.
