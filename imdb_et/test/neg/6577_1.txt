What are studios like Paramount with a proven series of hits on their hands, and I think it can turn around the budget and formula? Paramount spent less on this film than they did with TMP, which doesn't sound bad until you realize there are 10 differences between making movies. The $ 40 TMP would cost about $ 75 million in 1989. This film is the reason why Shatner has never had a fair chance to lead other films. Every time he turned around, he looked at the budget of the studio and demanded a story. The fact that this was one story Roddenberry and Shatner largely agreed on was enough for the new manager to be appointed, but after all the machinations were done, everyone had an uneven story and a badly dead load of special effects that are not worth the original series , a much less important film. The most prominent examples are: - All the effects of Phaser were heavily ashed and fake. - The shot of the company, which hit a big barrier, was so obviously taking a picture with a frame. At least the popsicle stick that kept the Enterprise extract was successfully matured. - God "chasing" Kirk up the mountain ... Egads, they can also just cut shots of Godzilla climbing the volcano at the end of "Godzilla 1985", and use thumbtacks to scratch the emulsion off the film to make the electric bolts come to his eyes to the embarrassing master of the Church. Yes, friends, I have a real problem with the look of this last scene, especially. <br /> <br /> Thanks to goodness Star Trek VI was such a movie redeemer ...
