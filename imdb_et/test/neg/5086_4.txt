** Warning - This review may include a spoiler ** <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a Danny (Jet Li) character is good - a young boy is hoodlum and raised to behave like a bad guy controlled mainly for his neck collar is on the neck or not. <br /> <br /> But the writer did not know how to deliver this idea within credibility. <br /> <br /> He has a Danny meeting with a blind pianist, Sam (Morgan Freeman), who must be the most trusted stupid person ever - with his n-wit, endlessly despicable, rather unpleasant daughter Victoria (Kerry Condon). I was otherwise amazed when I learned that Victoria had to be 18 years old - she looked at me 25 or 30 times. <br /> <br /> Amazingly, there is no romance between Danny and Victoria. <br /> <br /> When Danny's up again, he's wounded by Sam, but he takes him home. Danny's 2 days, but are these nerves taking him to the hospital? Nooooo. I don't know if they even called the doctor. <br /> <br /> Now, Danny is apparently not a person with mental stability, it is also evident from the move, but Sam takes him to his home, where both he and his girlfriend could have seriously harmed or even killed that pretty strange young man. <br /> <br /> Why Morgan Freeman took this brilliant role in this asinine film that I can't even guess. Certainly, Mr Freeman is not desperate for disappointment. <br /> <br /> Then we have Bob Hoskins as Bart, a gangster who "owns" Danny - now you are talking about a gunman who is hard to kill. Bart got rid of the balls that would have competed with the death of Bonnie and Clyde. We think he's dead but not. <br /> <br /> Then we have another car accident - and again, that Bart flees unharmed. <br /> <br /> In addition, we have Danny fighting at the same time for half a dozen tough men, plus a scene where Danny has decided he no longer wants to fight. I don't care how much a person wants to fight if it's in your fight or dying, I think someone would win. <br /> <br /> As I said, the title - this movie is about 40 miles beyond the reality limit as we know it. It's not just a case of suspending beliefs - it's far from it. <br /> <br /> In addition, I have never understood why Danny's mother, who turns out to be a nice lady, not a prostitute, said she was confused with Bart and his gang and was shot. Maybe it was my fault, I got confused by the time of this scene - but it seemed very unlikely that he and Bart would ever cross the trains. <br /> <br /> 4 stars out of 10 - and it's generous.
