I know that every movie cannot be beaten or even average about it, but the responsible parties who got together for this epic dud should have seen that they had the time for them. I can't help but think that it would be cast between scenes and consolidate each other as a massive mass of manure. I hear it now, "You can" pay? "" No, you? "I understand that this flick was more than likely a shoe string budget, but even that taken into account it could have been better. You are waiting for a monster / creature to appear and when you finally see it is this big awakening. I'm so mad that I spend 1.07 on this stinker!
