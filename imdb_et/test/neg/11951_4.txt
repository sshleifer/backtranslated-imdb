Well, I have to admit that when I saw the trailer of this movie, I waited for it. I am a fan of romantic comedies and trailer in general, this is the impression of this movie. But I spent most of the film waiting for the comedy to begin. Although there were a couple of fun scenes, the film's outlook was rather frustrating. <br /> <br /> It was also difficult for me to fall in love with some characters because they all seemed a little underdeveloped, the time a director might have used to look at things that the operation had taken over unnecessarily, making the film unrecognizable and slow. <br /> <br /> All in all, although there are some touching scenes, the trailer is quite deceptive and I would recommend that you only look at it if there is really nothing else that hardens your fancy. <br /> <br /> Not fantastic and as I said before; Bland.
