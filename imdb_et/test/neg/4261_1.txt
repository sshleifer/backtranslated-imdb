And the worst part is that it could have been good. But something terribly wrong. First of all, they wouldn't have had to pour Amliph Bachchan in this film at all. He's too iconic to deal with such a delicate and controversial topic, not to mention his role. Secondly, Ram Gopal Varma should be ashamed to take the classic Lolita story and make it a pathetic fortune-telling slut. His Lolita is called Jiaks (newcomer Jiah Khan plays) and when we meet him, he lacks any stolen innocence or that delicate naivety, usually associated with the original Lolita complex story, in the original story. gradually becomes a nymph. Sure Jia is already a whore with her own eyes, even before the camera meets. And he doesn't make his films as his leading nymph. Varma puts his pawn upright up to the fixation of vulgaris and mannequins that he did not leave the audience less than discomfort with the corners of his Voyeurian pedophiles camera. <br /> <br /> Don't talk about the chemical nature of Jia and her so-called Rita (daughter of Bachchan character). These girls should be the best friends but look like the worst enemies before something goes wrong. Nothing they do together is unlikely until they become enemies. Perhaps Mr. Varma should have worked on this aspect of the script instead of focusing on destroying any credibility. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the film is perhaps a descriptive image of the character of a Bachchan character. His role was so signed and ridiculously made of wood that he could not really get any harm or worry. In fact, I felt like I would get a screen that strikes him so he wouldn't respond like any normal woman. Instead, he just stood up irritated and helpless, as I imagine that a large part of the film's viewers may feel after breaking the train train. See at your own risk.
