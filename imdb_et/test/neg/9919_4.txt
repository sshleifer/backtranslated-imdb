A time-old story of teenagers who rebelled against the church and the father of his minister in a small Norwegian village. Landscaping is picturesque, but the story is rather pretentious and buggy, and many of the films are dedicated to quoting scriptures. It's like watching a religious propaganda movie. Theisen, who has made only one other film, is pretty good as a sensitive young man, as well as Sundquist as his strict father and Riise as a woman fascinated by Theisen. The goal of the film is to be fresh and charming, but it looks pretty old and tired. The director and co-author, Nesheim, who has worked mainly on television, is not in charge of this task.
