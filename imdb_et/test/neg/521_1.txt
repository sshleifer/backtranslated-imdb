Bored, ridiculous and stupid "underwater" is a waste of time. Shootouts were fun, real people just didn't look like an open lid, hoping to shoot first! So many things are wrong or bad, not worth the effort, except one big mistake. 500 mph at 20 minutes = about 166 miles west of L.A and the water is 100 feet deep ??? Even then, no nation would have survived decompression under 100 hours of water pressure when they grew up. Just terrible.
