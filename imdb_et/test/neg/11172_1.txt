Do not let the fool fool you, as described on the cover (at least in the Swedish version). Its story seems to be quite interesting with speculative clues. Nothing can be further from the truth. This is the absolutely sad film experience I've ever had ... It's simple and right ONLY and can't be sold or rented to anyone. If you think the plot seems intriguing, think about it: phones can move people, run and kill, as well as other electrical devices. It can throw things at you, haunt and drive after you. DO NOT HOW TO ATTENT THIS GAME, that it is a disgraceful genre of fear ...
