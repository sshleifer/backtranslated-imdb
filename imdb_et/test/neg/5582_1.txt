It is incredible how the film can take so much time and effort and is still terrible. For those who appreciate a comprehensive special effect and unimaginable detail for each picture, you look at this movie's awe. Just because Predator Island does not contain any of it. This is a redundant remake of any horror monster movie over the past two decades. Now I appreciate the bad fear films, have a certain situation with a sense of humor in the most dramatic situations. However, if your goal is to create a memorable work, which is therefore famous for the fame of the cultural halls, my first suggestion is to find some imagination and creativity and to gain some talent. Oh, and a few extra bucks to put on your picture. <br /> <br /> The tradition of horror films has been to shock the audience with violent deaths. But the shock does not last more than a few seconds. In fact, to induce a satisfactory response to the crowd, b should be the development of characters, some identifiable features. I know you probably say that this guy does not offer the filmmakers anything intelligent, but he just says an amateur note. Well, it shows you how these filmmakers are amateurs. <br /> <br /> Despite the need to go through the movie's fear of watching, there was a silver lining. Dan Gordon's performance Chr≈Üa is great. She can't work on a script and she can still look like a star in this movie. Of all the actors he is the only one who believes in what he is talking about. Not only does he provide someone to whom we can identify, but we also have someone we look forward to reviewing the rest of the movie. Gordon shows true talent and the ability to remove high quality work and overcome the enormous obstacle that remains. Dan Gordon is a star, hopefully sooner than later. This means that when he gets such films that keeps him back.
