Tarentino should be ashamed of involving this terrible movie. Functional, leading and scripts are all third rates - the entire movie plays like an excuse for a writer / director / star Larry Bishop. The only reason why this was done is probably due to his association with QT. The film's plot is rather weak and basically tries to survive not so much the hidden references to older B-films and some men like David Carradine, Dennis Hopper and Vinnie Jones. Each of them is inconvenient in their work, especially Hopper, who is full-time at his career. The saving grace, if it exists, is that the script is so ridiculously bad that it can be fun. The bishop is trying so hard to get this brand out of Tarentino and just fails, which can occasionally be quite humorous and grateful to others. I'd check it out only if you love bad movies ... or if you're really a biker movie.
