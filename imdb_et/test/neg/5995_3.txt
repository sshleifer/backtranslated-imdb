It should have been shaken. VH1 went away from the traditional divisions (Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, etc.) that were so obsolete in the 2003 show. Unfortunately, he moved back. There was no MC at the show to show together. Queen Latifah made a fantastic show at Divas 2003. The show went on with a terrible handover from Lady Marmalade, with Patti Labelle, Cyndi Lauper and Jessica Simpson. Okay in the studio, with some control that they all sound good. <br /> <br /> But when they compete with each other (why?), it just sounds embarrassing! Jessica Simpson has the most strange facial expressions when she sings what I've ever seen! Cyndi Lauper also appeared with Girl Just Wanna Have Fun. It wasn't that bad, but it was hardly impressive. The worst was still ahead! Cynd and Patti Labelle joined Cynd's hit "Time After Time". It was acoustic and didn't fit the rest of the show. However, it could have been okay if they both did not insist on breaking the nursing animals. It was just terrible. <br /> <br /> Debbie Harry (from Blondie) is always cool. He has his own style, and although he may not be able to compete with many vocals with vocals, although he can certainly sing very well. Debbie came out and made Blondie # 1 hit "Rapture". With some cute vocals. He struck the notes perfectly. He looked stunning. Rapper Eve gave a new, but unfortunately worse rap. That was good. Debbie's next show was a team with a new comer, Joss Stone. They made Blondie "One Way Or Another". I think Joss misunderstood the style of the song and just called Debbie. It was a bit sad for Debbie to try and match his style. He should just have given Joss his totally inappropriate hiding. The whole Blondie did this trail. The final track Debbie performed was Blondie's massive hit "Call me". It was pretty bad. Not Debbie's fault, because you just didn't hear him. The sound was amazing throughout the performance. <br /> <br /> Joss Stone also introduced a couple of songs on their own. They were pretty well done. Ashanti also showed two unexplained cover versions. First he made Diana Ross' 'I'm Coming' and then Chaka Khan 'Ain't Nobody'. He's not God! He can sing to some extent, but he has no presence. Why not just get real singers. Chaka was interviewed even at exhibitions .... <br /> <br /> Gladys Knight showed up and went. That was very good. He was probably the best show. I don't know much about him as an experienced performer in Las Vegas and his experience and class have really gone. This time Patti Labelle placed another show on his 80th hit "New Attitude". It was the finale and it was okay, but it was too late. That was one big thing. Better luck next time VH1. <br /> <br /> I saw this version, which was a heavily edited 55-minute version of VH1 in the UK. If these were the best bits .....
