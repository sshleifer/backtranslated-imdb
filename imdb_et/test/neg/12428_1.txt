OMG, another bad film by Larry Buchanan. This man didn't learn to stop, right? First of all, he gives us a zero budget sci-fi movie and lies in the famous dead people and now he uses Loch Ness as a monster. <br /> <br /> "The plot" is basically about another US pretending to be Scotland camping in Loch Ness. Unfortunately, I mean Lake Loch Ness, there is an inflatable monster in the killer that tends to become a Ness, and its way of killing people for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that the MST3K team has never heard of this movie. Yes, it is so bad.
