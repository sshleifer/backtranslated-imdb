I've been watching "Fuckland" for a long time. I lied when I said I remembered it in detail; most pleasantly, I remember the irritation that it called me and the total cost of time and money, not only my time and money invested in watching the film, but also the director. <br /> <br /> Supposedly, "Fuckland" is an Argentine critic who presents us (I am also an Argentine) few people who take credit and even praise for small, ridiculous victories and think we are the best thing God has (who is also Argentina). I'm not going to say that. This is probably a real statement from a fairly large part of the population (by the way, what I despise). And even if it wasn't true, it's not my business. The worst sin "Fuckland" devoted such a statement to its director. <br /> <br /> The constant impression I got was that the director was too busy trying to impress us on a camera on the islands. worry about making a good (even mediocre) movie. Many pictures taken with a hidden camera are meaningless. The director decides to show off the foolish edition of the old wars and his own. And there is no plot at all. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film proudly presents the Dogme certificate before the opening titles, so that it does not later respect its principles (for example, involving the director's credit - another sign of his pride?). <br /> <br /> I found the film as an offensive, not an Argentine, but an observer. I felt underestimated. "Fuckland" is just one of the worst films I've ever seen.
