Thursday, 9 June, 18:45 Broadway Performance Hall and Saturday June 11, 13:45 Broadway Performance Hall <br /> <br /> Bless the independent filmmaker. Without them, nothing more than Spielberg, Farrelly's brothers and old sitcoms would look like. They are risk takers. They will succeed and suffer failures. Max and Grace are definitely a failure. The credit is earned by Michael Parness to get out of it and make his first feature he claims he forced him to go bankrupt. He may be detained at a better stage if this film shows what to expect in the future. Even when everyone warned me, I went to see Max and Grace, hoping to discover something they didn't do. It starts well enough, Max's party in his parent's house, warming up in warm, quiet light, the camera swims into interesting corners. As soon as we see that Max has hung up, the obvious hanging of Harold and Maud, the whole thing goes in the tank. How can he make it unnoticed in the middle of his birthday? How could two mentally ill and dedicated psychiatric patients decide to marry and bless them with all the parties involved? Q&A after the movie David Krumholtz suggested the whole story was a surreal dream of his character Max. This story is so badly written that the comment sounded more like an excuse. The film does not look as if it was made in a shoe racing, all the more so that the results would be so disappointed. What is meant to be funny is not, but is maliciously bad. Continuity is sloppy, lighting is terrible and the effects are cheap and forced. The BPH seats are under three hundred and were surprisingly full, but I saw at least thirty or forty walks in the first half of the year. At one point, Grace, played by Natasha Lyonne, regrets her inability to die. I found myself thinking about the same thing because I don't go before credit. If Krumholtz really thinks it is "one of the best scripts" he has ever read, he seems to have to catch up with his reading. The terrible waste of talents and resources, this is the worst independent thing I've seen since Bubba-Ho.
