Give Stanley Tong to Bronx Jackie Chani Super Cop and Rumble and what can you get? You get a number of kung fu fights and the lack of Magoo-type madness. <br /> <br /> On a limited plot, Magoo (Leslie Nielsen) is on an international plot where she steals a world-famous pearl. Of course, he has no idea what he is doing. In fact, he has no idea he had a pearl. <br /> <br /> Within thirty minutes, you can watch it very boring. There are some very funny moments, such as when he feeds on a chicken. You want you to look as far as Magoo. Watch this fun movie, but its quite a disaster! You have to love Leslie Nielson because she had made very funny movies. It's not his best, but he does a good job playing Magoo. I thought it was a funny movie, and it should be recommended for babies because they think it's very funny.
