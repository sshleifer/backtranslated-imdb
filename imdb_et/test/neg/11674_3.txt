I feel terribly sorry! If Lubitsch-pic was enchanting, wonderful, full of spirit and elegance, it's just colorful here! Lana looks like 51 (in fact she was 31 at that time, but apparently depressed) and trying to play a shy and boring gyr. Think of Jeanette McDonald, who gave the widow the role of double-depth "playing" Count Danila. This Lana was supposed to play operetta, though she couldn't sing - crazy! She sings only one song - the role of the Lehar operetta, which is really funny! The only really good thing at the end is a big waltz, glamorous! And after watching this scene, check out the introductory roll "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"! All the similarities?
