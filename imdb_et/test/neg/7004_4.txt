I ran over Yvette McClendon at the Los Angeles Film Festival and thought she was a doll. After writing a review of my movie, I wanted to see her more! I found this movie, it was pretty bad. Not his fault, he's only in the first few minutes, where he is probably the person who pulls you to watch this bad movie. BAD redirection. The scenes are outstanding, all the actors. Amber Smith has very bad breast work, but other actors seemed pretty good. I like Yvette, but it was probably a bad choice. I can't believe I rented it in the trash to search for it. I hope to find my other movies.
