OK, a movie about a film that takes a crack in making movies can be fun. Maybe it should be, funny, nervous, even controversial or at least interesting and yet ... This film is the negative version of this bizzaro. Hamlin was entertaining as a "B" film producer. Shatner played mad but pleasant and was all the best. The remaining characters were boring, predictable, boring, underdeveloped, boring and boring. Production value was flat. You see the boom falls in one scene. In some scenes, the sound was terrible. Hey, I'm a big fan of Shatner and Hamlin, but their talents are wasted here. At least the story was clapped.
