this film has no plot, no good action, frankly they have nothing, the same songs play over and over again terribly, and if you can actually sit and watch the whole thing and enjoy it, there's something wrong with you. I wish I could give it from 0 to 10, but I can't get it to be 1 that is generous! Ice is not even a good rapper, and even worse during operation, every movie has a bit of garbage, I got this movie on DVD without knowing what it was priced at 1.99 pounds and thought I had bought it at an affordable price I watched the IMDb rating and did not take this into consideration, but after viewing, I discovered that the purchased DVD was a complete waste of time, money and electricity. If you have this movie, there are two things you can sell it to someone who doesn't know it or does not burn it!
