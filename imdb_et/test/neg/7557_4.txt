Young sculptor Ken Harrison, who has been in the early thirties, has been seriously injured in a road accident. End of story. <br /> <br /> "End of story", that is, "end of physical activity". Not in the "end of the movie". Ken's life has been saved, but he's paralyzed under his neck. When he discovers that he has probably not recovered his limb, he decides he wants to die and asks the doctors to stop the treatment that keeps him alive. The rest of the film is essentially one long debate about the rights and lies of euthanasia and the right to death. <br /> <br /> Ken's main antagonist in this debate is his doctor Michael Emerson. Although the case of euthanasia is often religious, it is purely secular. When Dr. Emerson has deep religious beliefs, they are never expressed in the film. However, he believes passionately that death is the enemy he has to fight as a doctor; to allow the patient to take his / her life effectively, to give up the enemy's assignment and to abandon that obligation. Ken is therefore in the Catch-22 situation. He must be able to show that he is reasonable and rational to decide to end his life. However, Emerson believes that the desire to die is in itself madness and irrationality. The Keni dilemma can only be solved in order to hire a hospital lawyer. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss as Ken and John Cassavetes, like Dr. Emerson, presented their points of view skillfully and sincerely, but it cannot hide the fact that "whose life is it still?" just not working as a movie. At one time, the filmed versions of the staged productions were performed similarly to theater productions, but in the seventies and eighties, it was often considered unsatisfactory due to the differences between the two media. When the films were played, there was a general tendency to "open them" both by filming and in studio series, with the actors' text freed, often making significant changes to the plot and even additional signs. br /> <br /> I've never seen Brian Clarke playing, but I suspect it's a story that works better in the theater than in the cinema. There is little physical activity; most of the activities consist of long discussions around the hospital bed, where the main character is paralyzed. Such a plot is not compatible with the "opening" device at all, and the resulting film is very static, dominated by speech. Although it is well written and a good way of working, I am surprised that such a mysterious subject has ever been made into a film. 4/10
