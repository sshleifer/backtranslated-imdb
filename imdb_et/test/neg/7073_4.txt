Teenager Tamara (Jenna Dewan) is tough. He ridicules all the popular "children" for being shy, passionate, frumpy and his interest in witchcraft. All footballers and cheerleaders are especially angry at her writing an article on steroid abuse school paper. In addition, his father is drunk, his mother is not around and he is in love with his supportive English teacher (Matthew Marsden). Popular children created a cruel mess to humiliate him, involuntarily kill him during the fight, bury the body of the forest, and make the pact quiet. In his shock, Tamara will return to the classroom the next day, looking at the seduction and kill. Yes, back from the dead and ready for supernatural revenge against all involved people. He also takes time to eat his sexual abusive beer bottle and tries his English teacher away from his wife (Claudette Mink), a school counselor. <br /> <br /> Operation and writing are strictly mediocre. You can also say to the people responsible for this that they have seen such films as CARRIE (1976), HELLO MARY LOU: PROM NIGHT II (1987) and THE CRAFT (1996) because it borrows from all of these higher films. There are some gore (a man who cuts his ear and tongue and then strikes his eyeball most likely), nasty vomiting and some paired / witty one liners. In no way was a terrible film, but it didn't have much originality either.
