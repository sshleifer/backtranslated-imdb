J.S. In 1982, Cardone led the name "The Slayer", a little-known "Video Nasty", and has since been a handful of feature films; including garbage 2001 vampire movie The Forsaken. His latest feature film, Wicked Little Things, boasts a decent and terrible image that seems to remember a few years ago the ground that the Tobe Hooper had to direct the film. Well I think he felt that it was too similar to his foolish zombie mushroom movie "Mortuary" and so it turned down. I don't blame her for that too. The plot focuses on the mother and her two daughters who move in the old house in the mountains that once belonged to her late husband. But what they don't understand is about a hundred years earlier; a group of children who were used under the miners were trying to bridge the bridge. Of course, this is not their end and they have managed to survive their quest and now struggle to seek revenge. <br /> <br /> Film is mainly a collection of clich√©s; from the youngest child to an "imaginary friend" with a mother who fires it and all the usual zombie garbage. J.S. Cardone tries to get horror fans back with shocks and gory scenes (mostly involving children), but that's not enough. The story does not play well at all and reminded me of a much earlier body, and this is not a good thing (although Mortuary is actually a better film than it is). Acting is nothing to write home. Lori Heuring is a decent look as well as the oldest daughter Scout Taylor-Compton; but cannot provide interesting work. Chloe Moretz is a little better than an ordinary child artist. The plot is hardly credible and the scenario cannot even be effortlessly explained to explain why children are attacking local people. It all goes to a typical and rather boring end, and generally I have to say that if you know your horror films, you can skip it freely!
