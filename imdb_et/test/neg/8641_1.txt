This movie is an absolute trash that is getting worse, a very protracted end! <br /> <br /> The plot is confused and cumbersome, the actors can't take care of less attitude (maybe they were paid - bad movement or they knew they wouldn't pay), and Sets were pristine, boring and cheap. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep twice and actually decided not to bother after the last five minutes if I expected the actors to sleep by then. Indestructible life is wasted! <br /> <br /> If you need to look at it, take it to the bedroom and forget about sleeping pills once. But maybe you need an antidepressant instead! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is good for celluloid to break down.
