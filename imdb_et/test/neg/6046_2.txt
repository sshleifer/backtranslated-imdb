Sci-Fi network original. Not the best. Not at all the worst. Electrician (Richard Grieco) stumbles on a "key" that can open the gate to a parallel Earth taken over by mutant spiders. Over the past thirty years, mutations have been controlled by a huge alien queen. He has already eaten this parallel world, reminiscent of Chicago's minus inhabitants. Guess? Now he has to find another world to whom to pass it. The electrician manages a team of four men who reluctantly find themselves in saving the world. The final confrontation is probably the best part of the whole movie. Richard Yearwood, Colin Fox, Kate's greenhouse, Jason Jones and David Newman are also cast. One might think that the Sci-Fi Network could have spent more money on special effects.
