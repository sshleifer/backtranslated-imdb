This movie is really bad. Most seem to have filmed it either in the park or in the basement. There's a giant spider, but all we see is one foot. There are some worms living in caves, which are just cheap socks with cardboard teeth. And the plot has a number of post-apocalyptic mumbo jumbo that doesn't make sense at all. The whole thing is just ridiculous.
