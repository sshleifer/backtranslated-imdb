Who the hell is responsible for the terrible confusion of one of my favorite books? It's just terrible. terrible action, terrible script. The story is not even close to his old man - and what did they mean? Robin Williams, for Gose! It really violates the description. Don't look at it. Seriously, don't. Don't even laugh. Especially not when you're a fan of a book. This can be the worst film adaptation - all divorced and confused - the signs that are important to understand the sequence of events are seriously marginalized and any potentially interesting location in the book has been changed (for example: Vienna - New York) to some deeply uninteresting. <br /> <br /> For those who haven't read the book - it's basically a fictional biography of a writer growing up, exploring his writing and so on. Her mother writes an autobiography that is greeted (despite her protests) as a sort of feminist manifesto. The book is well written, involved and long. Its prose is just beautiful. <br /> <br /> This movie is once again Robin Williams, telling us that we are trying to take advantage of this day.
