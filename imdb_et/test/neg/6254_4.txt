CHEERLEADER MASSACRE (2003), starring Tamie Sheffield, Charity Rahmer, Erin Byron, Leonard Johnson, E. Eddie Edwards, Samantha Phillips, GiGi Erneta, April Flowers, Nikki Fritz, Tylo Tyler, Brad Beck, Summer Williams, Brinke Stevens, Melissa Brasselle. <br /> <br /> Plot: A group of cheerleaders with their coach and three boys are on the road when suddenly the parent breaks down and they hide in the nearby salon. Soon they will drink, have sex, and see the killer one by one. <br /> <br /> Good: The couple laughs, the killer's surprising identity, Brinke Stevens's firefighter, my favorite scene SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE, used as a setback. bad: I was excited about this movie, I loved all three Slumber Party Massacre because they were just so much fun, and I was expecting a lot of "Slumber Party / Sorority House Massacre with Scream Tones" but it just sucks! its "we are cheesy but proud" thing and basically we made soft core porn but good, who-dun-it. <br /> <br /> **
