I've never seen the original 1930s movie, but this remake is one of the worst I've seen in the big production studio over the years. Seeing actors such as Meg Ryan and Annette Bening, who are close to A-level talents, are dreaming of the way of dreams through poorly written roles. There seemed to be no desire in front of the camera in front of this film. <br /> <br /> Jada Pinkett Smith and Debra Messing play valuable roles that do not affect the plot or add value. Jada Pinkett Smith's character is used not only for something that is modern, with an African-American lesbian character, but in reality she is just cool. There is no real reason why Messing in this film, besides filling women who are in the original, does not. <br /> <br /> The side-effects of Eva Mendes and Debi Mazar are stereotypical female characters with Mendes, depicting a vixen who wants to steal a wealthy but boring and lightly neglected husband and Mazar, covering gossip roles. <br /> <br /> Film is boring, no charm, no humor or no compassion for any character. It almost seemed that the film was a punishment for everyone involved, be it in front of or behind the camera. <br /> <br /> The film has one glowing hope, but little is allowed to shine surrounded by twilight, and the stars around it are Cloris Leachman. Leachman is still an amazing talent that brings its remarkable charm and humor to its film in its small role.
