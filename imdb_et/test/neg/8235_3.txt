Luther Geek (1990) is a boring horror movie and it's really bad even according to Troma standards! It's about a freak who rejects the head of the chickens and kills people by beating his neck, and he thinks he's a chicken himself !!!!! Luther is released from prison after 25 years because he has probably been a "model" prisoner and deserves a second chance in life (which is very difficult to believe after seeing how he acts and treats people throughout the film). <br /> <br /> After killing a older lady in a supermarket parking lot, she can get into a female car and continue to torture her daughter and stepdaughter at home. <br /> <br /> Then you will be treated with a long wind and a boring movie that will be terribly active all the time before a useless policeman turns to Luther for killing and final slaughter! Oh and the film has a ridiculous and ridiculous end !!! I love low budget horror movies and I think "Toxic Avenger" is all the time classic, but I'm afraid that Luther Geek is just boring, illogical and boring, not too much gore too just bloody neck bitings and that's it! 3/10
