I like all the main actors in this pretty weird movie. Terrance Stamp, Guy Pearce & Hugo Weaving have all proved to be some of the best and most capable actors, but I couldn't do that. I don't know if this is because I don't understand the lifestyle or what, but I didn't get it around. Worse than anything, the actors made some of the toughest bullies I've ever seen. I think it was part of the point, I don't know. I understand that this is probably an insult, but I don't know what else to call them. I have to say I bought boys as performers (right term?), But the story just wasn't very good or very interesting. I say I can't really appreciate costume designers, though I notice them when they're wrong or inappropriate, but I was very impressed with them. Very creative at least to say, just not attractive, but I don't think they should be. I do not know that I am definitely not a target group and I never see such performers I don't see, but I don't see ballet or opera, so I don't know. If this is your movie, you probably like it, but if it's not skipped because it's ... not for most of us. I just checked that it won the Oscar costume design and I say it right. I have to say that Ebert wasn't interested in this movie even though he liked it better than me.
