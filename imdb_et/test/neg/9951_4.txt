Not to be confused with George Zucco's 1943 "The Mad Ghoul", "The Mad Monster" is a film Zucco appeared last year. In this fairly color-uniform sense, Zucco enhances the way to turn his twilight masters, Petro, into a wolf / human hybrid with a wolf injection and then wastes little time sending a transformed doofus to kill former colleagues who were screaming in their experiments. It is a very simple plot and very low budget output. Glenn Strange, who plays the man / wolf here, will soon gain more fame by playing Franky's monster in films like "Frankenstein's House" (1944) and "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948). The work of the girls here is pretty flat and she can do it like a bad hippie (like the 1957 teen monster). In addition, the sets of this film are quite non-existent and the deviation is steep and convincing. I've given the movie a very generous 4 star, partly because I have a constant love for the horror movies of the 1940s, but to tell the truth, most objective viewers probably think of this ridiculous mess and I think it is. Surely this is not a well-established or universal media Val Lewton masterpiece! However, Zucco is always fun to watch, even in a weakness like this. If you can save your life for 72 minutes, I think you could do worse than "The Mad Monster" (of course not much worse!). Oh ... another thing. This DVD is Alpha Video, and you know what it means: fuzzy pictures, bad sound (indeed, any worst-hit Alpha Video DVDs worst sound) and extras. You have been warned!
