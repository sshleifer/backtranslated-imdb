For the first time a couple of days ago, I watched all three crazy max movies and was bitterly disappointed with the third part. it destroys the first two weak and cheesy films and the story that makes apocalyptic western forests a comic sandstone expected in children's adventure. Max's nature is not unknown from the dark and cynical person seen in earlier films and has become a predictable rescuer that left me on Friday. if you haven't seen the movie yet, just do it. Let the story end with a road war and save yourself a very painful feeling. (Spoiler warning) Another big problem I had with this movie, which was really a bitter taste in my mouth, was the flying person. we had already seen him in a road war where he had helped the maximum and yet, when he woke up again, it seems that the two had never met. was he supposed to be of a different character or a relative of warriors whom I do not know. but it was not explained and it is a weak element of this weak film. 2 out of 10 will not get 1/10 because it is a fierce fight.
