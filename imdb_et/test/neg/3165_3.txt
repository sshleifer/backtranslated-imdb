This love story between an American journalist and a Eurasian lady does not contain much conflict because she is largely westerned (having studied in London) and fireworks because she is rather modest. What little interest the story can raise is their wooden dialogues have been pushed forward. They should be two cosmopolitan intellectuals, but they speak like a Hollywood cage who is not much of himself in his own words. The film also suffers from the lack of amazing reality - a crowded little Hong Kong on a deserted beach, crossing one million Chinese refugees? And probably an American journalist in his 40s who doesn't know what is hysterectomy? Hollywood ideas. Finally, the "song". After the film has been heard twenty times, starting with credits, it tends to lose some of its emotional impact, sorry to say.
