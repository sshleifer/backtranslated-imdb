OK, so it's not great, but only because of the size of Laurel and Hardy in the past. When this movie got a full repair, increased the picture quality, add a new dubbing to the poorly dubbed voice and the nice unnoticeable background music of the add-ons, so this movie would really start to develop. As it is, he has problems. People shake it by the look of old boys. Quel surprise! they were in their 60s and had led a "life". But for me, they still find that they have a tough charm, and although it is not even close to the feet of these classics (I gave it to 4), it is worth looking at just because it is them. Think otherwise would be an impostorous!
