Director / director-actor Dutcher enjoys this view-film, where he tries to get the world-accepted morale in a otherwise very peaceful world of missionaries. Some of the actions are fair. But some roles are unrealistic, ie threatening (not father) mission president, etc. The film gives a fair view of how some missionaries are fighting their faith, but the actual mission program he claims to represent is far from his concept of being viable, united and inspired. The only inspiration I see in this film is the Dutch self-inspiration. The film is slow and boring, and the shooting and scenario looks like a college student project.
