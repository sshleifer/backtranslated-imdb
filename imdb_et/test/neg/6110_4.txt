One line summary is actually a very old joke that starts with "what is a Jewish porn movie?" <br /> <br /> Although this movie was in its interesting moments, it was too slow to move and not to do enough to explain to those who are not familiar with Orthodox Jewish practice, just what is happening and why? How many people who found this movie would know that a bath whose female characters are washing is actually called "Mikvehik", a ritual bath used to clean the spiritual cleansing? The same question may be asked about why the bride went through the glamorous number of brides when her face was covered just before the promises of marriage. These two examples are just two of a large number of moments that were unexplained to the uninitiated audience. <br /> <br /> This movie has untouched moments with great love and emotion. The characters are presented in a very authentic way, up to the number of garments the ultra-orthodox Jewish man has to wear, as well as the religious rituals he has to wake up in the morning to start his day. The attitude of Orthodox Judaism towards women in general and women in particular is both intriguing and crazy. This is another reason why more clarification is needed when this story is understandable from the context. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to people who know the Orthodox Jewish tradition and ritual and those who might be interested in a brief glimpse of how living people practice this lifestyle. <br /> <br /> The story of about two sisters who are rebellious in their own way against the "system" is a moderate interest.
