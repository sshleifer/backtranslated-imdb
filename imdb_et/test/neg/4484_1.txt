After reading the comments I am so easily aware that I am not the only person who was very disappointed in this movie! I'm a big fan of Nicholas Sparks, I've read all of his books, most of them more than once. Of course I loved the laptop and I remember to walk ... I haven't seen a message in a bottle or at night in Rodant, so I can't comment on them ... <br /> <br /> But I did go see Dear John last weekend and I was terribly upset! The film wasn't good at all! Watching the movie alone and not at all thinking about the book, it was still a terrible movie. I didn't get the speed of this movie and the choice of emotions I've enjoyed from movies, especially the laptop. I did not laugh and laugh or cry or worry and scared ... ever! From the beginning I could point out how they all changed! The thing like this book, similar to the book, is that there is a man named John who is in the army, and a girl named Savannah who is not .... the part his father is obsessed with coins is the only one the second part that went with the book. Everything else was completely out !!!! First, in the book, Allen Timi was a little brother, not his son! Why they had to change it, I don't understand. It made much more sense how it went in the book when Tim was just a little older than Savannah and they grew up and Allen was Savannah's inspiration to work with horses and autistic children .... it didn't happen in the movie .... ugh .. And they spent much more time in the book than just the first two weeks and then 1 night ... why are they leaving these times out? I could go on and on, but then I run out of space! Basically, if you're a big Nicholas Sparks fan, don't waste your time or money on this movie ... just read the book again ... because it's terrible and something like a book!
