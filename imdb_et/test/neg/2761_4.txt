I've read a lot of books in my short life, but it's far from WORST !!! I just read this worthless trash and when I finished it, I threw it over the room! I hated it and let me justify it! 1. The soldier dies. Why should the author die a soldier?! Why couldn't he keep her alive like a good love story author? I deeply praise Patty for trying to throw the eyes of this FBI agent. Ruth (black housekeeper) is lit and for no apparent reason! He tried to comfort Patty and then Pattyi's SOB father shot him without good reason! Ruth and Anton and Patty were the only bright spots in the book. Oh and grandparents too! 3. Perm. Yes, yes. Perm. Now, can you guess why you perm the perm? Well here's why. Patty's mother asks her if she wants to do her hair. Patty says no, but mom calls Mrs Reeve (a terrible hairdresser) and tells her to give Patty a perm. Why should God's green earth do that? Why did my mother ask her daughter if she wanted a permit just to get her perm in any case! Mom always pretends that Patty has a say if he doesn't say anything !!! He should give Patty the "Worst Year Award" for things to offer. Thanks to God, Ruth cut off his perm! 4. Discrimination, Racisem and Prejudious. I hate discrimination in this book. They use the word * beep * too much. Yes. I know that these days there were black ones, but they didn't have any rights, but came on! Why teach today's children this word! It just teaches them how to discriminate against people. Not only black people were discriminated against, but also China. People refer to the book Mr. Lee (Chinese man) as "* beep * This is really despicable and last but not least ... Jews and Nazis. I hate to spit on a small girl. Wrong if she liked Anton. SHE IS 12 YEARS! !! It was just crushing. Like a 12 year old, you can really be 22 years old. Come on! It's not "Lolita" and "Lolita" I'm surprised that this movie is not considered "dirty" as "Lolita" is. <br /> <br /> 5. Patty goes to the Reformer The career opportunities are thieves and murders, not the innocent 12-year-olds Teacher or whatever he was called Patty ungrateful, spoiled brat. he did nothing wrong. He just helped a friend. <br /> <br /> 6. Favortisem children. Patty, their first-born daughter is clearly the least-favored while Sharon, a five-year-old mother, is their favorite daughter. that he wanted to take Sharon to Hollywood, but forgets clearly your second daughter. <br /> <br /> Father. I hated her! He was so thoughtful that Patty could be his father Hitler himself. His father wins him for no apparent reason, and the way he finally talks to him makes you so mad that you are trying to think "Patty gets in better concentration in a concentration camp". <br /> <br /> Well, that's where people are. 7 reasons I hate this book. Instead of reading this book, read "Anne's Diaries" or something else because I warn you, it's very frustrating and it leaves you really crazy! The only reason he gets 4 stars is Anton, Patty, Ruth and Grandparents!
