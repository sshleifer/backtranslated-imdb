OK, if you read it. This movie was so terrible that it was quite amazing. The creatures are cute, but the only very good thing about the film was the growing detention among prisoners and their guards after being marooned on this nervous island. Even if Barbara Bach's hair saw it, it wasn't all worthwhile for a ridiculous purchase. He goes with whispering, which I have never used-my-voice-before breath, which just doesn't wash when one cries a bloody murder. (He was also a lovely man, but I'm still not guilty.) Bad Richard Johnson, who was born for better things, is just a bad bad as a bad boy. I mean, how bad is BAD man BE? (Ask Richard Johnson). Joseph Cotten is trying hard to see that he does not see embarrassment when he comes through his cheeky look. In the name of all holy names, do not rent it boldly in a bomb.
