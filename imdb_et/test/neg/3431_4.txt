This (very) low-budget movie is fun when you're a fan of John Krasinski, but otherwise it's disappointing. At least it was short, so I didn't feel I had wasted too much of my time. John's scenes are pretty funny, but the "deep" scenes with Lacey Chabert are pretty nausea. It starts seemingly as it may be a funny movie, but some characters are just as extreme as others are too serious to just fall. Don't let me finish. It was absolutely incredible and didn't even fit with the rest of the movie. I say I was not bored, so I rated it over three. John Krasinski fans enjoy seeing his knee and stockings around his head and eating Cheez. Oh, and make sure you get to know John's deleted scenes, they're better than some that were actually included in the movie.
