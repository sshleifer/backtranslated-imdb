George Lucase American Graffiti has been well received and loved by the age-old concerts of teenage life as they grow up. One Eric Monte, a common creator of the popular 1970s CBS sitcom, a way of adapting to the Good Times. <br /> <br /> Cooley High was the black version of American Graffiti. The American Graffit has a story here with this Chicago background. In 1962, instead of America, Cooley High, located in 1964, is located. Movie Stars Welcome back to the main characters of Kotter, Lawrence Hilton Jacobs and Glynn Turman. Garrett Morris plays a principal who tries to keep Jacob and Turman's characters, Coceise and Preach, in great trouble. <br /> <br /> You know I'd like to say Cooley High is a valuable comparison to American Graffit, or it's a great movie of your own, but I can't. The problem is that the filmmakers were unable to hide the sad bottom of America's black life. The film does not help in the green part of the Cabrini movie in Chicago. Also, humble sense of humor is not here. When Coceise is looking for a declaration of intent from the college, she finds her little brother throwing the toilet. When a gang visits the Chicago Zoo, one of Pooter's gang manure is manure thrown by him. When Turman's character, preaching, two school boys hoodlum (dirty and depressing place where to eat much less to meet people), he opens the girls' bathroom door, when the girl is released she gets through the same bathroom window! Gymnasium, characters' homes, bathrooms, almost everywhere in the film show the regrettable look of the city's disintegration and poverty. in the movie. Using violence and outrage in the movie. Cooley High may be an age movie, but it is a tough and unprepared age design that has little or no fun and pleasing nostalgia that made people like and appreciate American Graffiti. <br /> Motown Records had a hand to make a movie. The company's music was part of the film's soundtrack. But even here you get the idea of ​​the same old old one when one of them has heard these millions of times. Not that they themselves were big songs, but black music, since then there was more than just Motown. Especially in Chicago. The song near the end of the movie Spinners' G.C. Cameron, not all impressive. The better Motown ballads that have been done have been better for Motown artists than for Cameron unquestioning. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie showing how the characters went to the Cooley High movie to be American Graffiti. This shows that an intelligent but under-performing student went to Hollywood and became a successful TV set. Eric Monte might have been according to Turman's character. The last film show Preach ran away at Cocee's funeral, which was held in the dark on a rainy afternoon and all the darkness represented by Cooley High. Eric Monte had a little lesson for all of us through the Preach and its final scene, watching Cooley High and the love of the past. Don't look back.
