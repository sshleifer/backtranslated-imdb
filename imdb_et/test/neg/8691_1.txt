Does anyone care about the characters in this movie? - Or what happens to them? - I doubt it. This is the main problem - in order to work in a tragedy, we need to take care of at least one character and none of them inspire any compassion or seem to have any redemptive qualities at all. <br /> <br /> What may have worked in the 16th century, certainly not working one can only expect "after apocalyptic Liverpool" if it was really what it was supposed to be. The problem is the apocalyptic Liverpool characters, while driving on cars, using mobile phones, and watching television have turned to Shakespeare - the Liverpool break. Heldeke! It is bad enough to think - but it often disappeared into the mirror - comments like "eh you are a cook? And was it a Merseyrail's message during a scene shot under one country? The good news is that the Post in the apocalyptic Liverpool - trains are still running. <br /> <br /> Characters without exceptions are poorly drawn, wood and similar quarries Joker / Penguin in Batman and Robin, unless there is no real story to talk about - or if it is - not working in a modern environment where half of the sets are gloomy and "Blade runnerish" and the other half are fluorescent or only normal in the 21st century. The costumes are also blended with wearing half-day clothes (Parkers are big in Apocalyptic Liverpool - probably big) and the other half in costumes that fall Film explores ideas of belief, incest, and revenge, probably unimaginable - the tragedy is that this movie is ready was sitting at all. <br /> <br />
