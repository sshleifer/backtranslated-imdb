There is probably a custom vehicle for Ryan Philippe. It seems that the studios hoped he could play the leading tough police officer and wouldn't look like he was forever 16 (he couldn't). <br /> <br /> Jason Statham and Welsey Snips earn books for Phillippe, but if they are not on the Phillippe flounders; his low-profile style is not bouncing. <br /> <br /> The script is a typical potboiler from the late 20th century, a good cop / bad cop, who has a ridiculously predictable plot and an out-of-the-1970 dialogue. "San Francisco Streets." Snipes repeats his role as an eternal black hat, playing a little less mad than his demolition worker. But Snipes and Statham didn't have much to chew. Statham's symbol says he gave up nicotine and caffeine - something that this film really needs. <br /> <br /> Really forgotten moment: Ryan Phillippe, who explains Buddhist dogma: Galloway: Are you a Buddhist? Dekker: No. It's just something I'm going down the road.
