There is a difference between "movie" and "movie". Film regardless of quality is ready for public consumption. The film is what a group of friends can do to make a camcorder at the weekend. In my time as a spectator, I have seen examples of both. <br /> <br /> On September 19, I participated in the screening of the writer / director Jon Satejowski "Donnybrook". Now, reading the script and seeing two pieces (the raw cut and the "ready" product), I can definitely say it's a movie. And this is a student film. Due to the lack of a better word, it is competent, which means that the director knew how to record the camera and record moving images. Visual images are mostly static and impressive, and the scenes in the dialogue are mostly reduced to long frames, little or no shots that allow the audience to create relationships with characters. I understand that this is a modestly budgeted film, but some visual praise would have been understood and it would have been a long way to keep the audience interested. <br /> <br /> These are independent images that have shown that limited camera work may be too good, well-written, enthralling, and some sharp dialogues. Steven Soderbergh's "sex, lies and videotape" comes to mind right away. However, this film does not have any. The main story is weak and determined. If the main plot is Davie, who is trying to improve his relationship with his father, I feel that this movie is not talking. What I got out of this is that Davie's main endeavor is to change the face of "rock 'n". " However, we see very little action to show it. Although there is one queue of dreams at the beginning and there is expression at the end, everything we see is Davie's scenes while listening to music or guitar randomly. We've just been told that Davie has played a lot of concerts, but we don't see him full of rock. Next time, SHOW, don't listen to the audience. Anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows this. Also, Davie doesn't look like someone who would have been a great glam rock of the 1970s; he looks like he would be more comfortable with rock 'n' in the early years than James Dean's less talented brother. Meanwhile, it seems that the rest of the film's events happen randomly with clich√© characters, and story seams that have little or nothing to do with the thin main story are raised and abandoned more often (ie, a sub-block that includes Terry's father). If I want to see such a random film, I will consider "Napolean Dynamite", a movie I hardly got to do for the first time. <br /> <br /> In the above-mentioned dialogue, scenes, I think I should mention that they are a little and extremely far away. Is it too much to ask the characters who speak? I don't think it is. When characters are spoken, this is a short, filthy sentence; oh so the collections of summary questions, angry primates or wildly overturns. These characters just don't act like ordinary, rational people. Working with such material makes it easy to see why there is only one good result in the movie, Al Hudson, and that's just because he's doing a bad time on Sam Elliott's screen. A good director or at least one who is ready to challenge the director of the function would have been able to detect these problems and get the writer and camera people to fix them. Satejowski is so close to the material that he just doesn't see them, or if he doesn't, he doesn't want to take the necessary steps to fix them, because it damages his creative vision. Being able or unwilling to deal constructively with criticism is a sign of a self-conscious, misleading fool. Just ask Rob Schneider. Finally, we have the poor, high school, Zach Braff's amazing "Garden State" and the same amazing "Velvet Goldmine", two more movies Now, before someone casts or the team leaves for the word to lead me to this task, let me offer it . The best thing I can do is congratulate Mr Satejowski on trying to make his own movie and see it for the audience. But the hopes of collecting and distributing this film are simply brilliant visions of glory. It's a student film, nothing more, no less. If the film has any promises (and let's face it, it doesn't come from going, writing or guiding), it's like this: If, IF, people related to this movie want, please, learn from this movie, play it and use your movie the lessons learned from the next test; Don't attack your critics or let a friend or family do it. If you can do this, then maybe the next thing that deserves to be mentioned is what could be called a "movie". <br /> <br /> I'm your audience and I'm ready to watch.
