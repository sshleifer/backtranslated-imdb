After some lies, we are still waiting for the French horror film, which critics will certainly condemn, but will launch a new trend. Not this time. Doug Headline can not be blamed for ignoring the genre (he is an editor of a high-quality fantasy, has worked at the legendary Starfix magazine), but why a scenario that uses every clich√© in the book (maybe a funny comic relief)? Why is it so predictable? Even Argento's inquiries fail. It's not even a euro-teen movie like German "Anatomy", much better, just a collection of scenes that hardly seem to have any connection with another and features lots of plot holes. The whole "Celtic" aspect hardly touches. And after the painfully predictable scenario of the "revolution", we get a boring, endless chase in an underground necropolis that looks bigger than the catacombs in Paris. I really wanted to love this movie. Really. But even mother wouldn't. Oh, and the writer Valerio Evangelist had to come, but I was looking for him easily.
