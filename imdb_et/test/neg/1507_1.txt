I looked at it at the movie party, we were very puzzled at the end, it ended up pretty poor. Although the whole movie is not too amazing, I was expecting a little better. This movie is a clean trash, but I suggest you look at it when you find a cheap script with cheap horror movies pretty funny. Personally, I loved advertising, it was my general highlighting, fighting scenes were basic, knife, some shadows in the window, a fake. I have to say that grandmother's costume was pretty scary, this movie is mixed to kill joy, camp blood and brittle streams 2, except this film is a little better camera wok and color care compared to camp blood.
