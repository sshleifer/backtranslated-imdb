Amazing, terrible, terrible, terrible, did I mention horrible? The DVD cover just can't get this movie, but unfortunately it wasn't so good for me. and when I looked at it, I just wanted to strangle a person because they used their money. I'll definitely take it back soon, but I can tell you if I have it in memory, because I definitely don't want to even call this movie terrible. This is daunting. Possible, the worst movie that has ever been. The action was so, both, so terribly disgusting, and the deaths that are so LAME and predictable. I didn't even laugh at how bad this film was, what scared me a bit. Don't see this movie, shame you if you even look at this movie page and I have EXTREME sorry for you if you watch this movie page because you think it's DECENT.Final word: YUCK !!!!!!!!!!
