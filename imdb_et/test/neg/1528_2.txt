Where do I start with Killing Mind before I mention that good? This film is about a young psychological FBI woman, or something that for some reason goes to work for LAPD. There are some recognizable faces like "I Love You, Man" from Wayne's world, playing a policeman (also a good beard-age!) And two men who always seem to play the police ..... you guessed it, the police. One of them was John Cusack in place of Gross Point Blank, the other is the FBI man, who has the specs in Final Destination, who is also in Fugitive as the second cop. I know that FBI, US Marshalls, CIA, etc. are not police, but they are all the same. They enforce the law to some extent, which makes them into the police in my book. Feel free to agree with the police definition you want, they are still those who are trying to bring down the bad guys. Whatever, I land. She works alongside the police who just seem to be sitting in the basement or in a library in another library and, for some unknown reason, decides to reopen a case that has not been viewed. He saw the body as a child, so of course he decided to reopen the case. I also like the witness of the other person's psychological state as a child at the crime scene. Surely this is something one can screw with? He starts asking questions from a journalist who opened this story, although he seems to be of the same age as a woman, so he was writing to a newspaper when he was 10 years old, or wrote some school reports he decided would be the best person for this ask about. <br /> <br /> Then we see that resuming the killings 25 years ago, he tries his hand against a small theft, as some really inconspicuous blocks hit a busy street with balaclava. Make a blend, moor! Anyway, he and the police with whom he eats ice cream in the park are chasing him, and when he crosses a bridge with a woman and a child, the thief is standing by his mother and throwing a river into the child. This is the best bit of the movie, if you haven't guessed yet. I'm not sadistic and I have no hatred for little children or anything, but the scene just looks so stupid that I promise you laugh your pants if you watch that movie. It gets better when a policeman from Final Destination and Fugitive jumps to rescue a child, then he declares to his friend "It's a child!" How he didn't know that before he jumped in, it was farther away from me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he traps the thief earlier, but loses it. Later, he recalls that the casual dog did not bring the thief so it was supposed to be his and decided to steal the dog through the thief. The dog had no signs or anything like that, so how did he know where to find the dog, and so find the other question of the thief, which I did not. soon after that I stopped watching. The story really moved slowly and after I smiled the baby a bit, I lost interest and left what was said. <br /> <br /> I said I was going ahead and I assumed the killer was a journalist because he seemed a bit sparse, and he spent a lot of time with him and anyone who watches Columbo knows that a non-police person spends most with an investigator, your bad boy. Plus, other people's reviews say the killer was quite obvious, so I'm sure it was him. <br /> <br /> So, at all, pants are a movie, but it's worth checking out this one glorious scene.
