Joan Crawford is convincingly uneven when our story begins and of course he gets up. But he is a bad egg that uses one man while living on another man's antisocial philosophy. All this is happening in Sweden, which is really odd. This causes something memorable in the visuals that are released from the Anytown USA image, but it makes the viewer wonder why each transformation is loaded and become non-specific when it comes to changing everything. There's a plot, a plot, a plot so dirty that you could sink it, and making things worse is a frame device that adds zilch to the film. Photography is occasionally nice, odd corners and miniatures are quite well connected. But it's burned without ever drawing.
