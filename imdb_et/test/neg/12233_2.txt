You might think that because this movie is a bad rep, I'd be exaggerating when I say I hated this movie. But I'm serious that this movie was just so stupid and so uncomfortable and such a waste of time. first 30, I had a big headache and a smile that I had a face (which was mostly laughing) was wearing. When this movie was over, I was so happy and I had good expectations that it would be funny I was very disappointed. The actors are not big, the moments of comedy are flat and unfunny.Hardly something is good because I laughed like maybe 2 parts. Generally it is so boring and I can't tell how terrible it I think it could be used as a suicide technique. I don't think it's even traceable.
