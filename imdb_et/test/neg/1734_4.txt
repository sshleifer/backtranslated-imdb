I rented this movie with my friend to laugh. We smiled at a video store by an official because of the taste of our questionable film. Unfortunately, I do not remember the first half of the movie because everything I did looked at Jane's gigantic metal braces. and I didn't hear anything because of an incomprehensible affair. Another thing that was able to grab his attention after the metal mouth was his questionable fashion idea. This film was made in 2005, but it seems that the wardrobe jumped back to 2000. If you remember the days when Aaron Carter was considered a "pop star" and you like high waist jeans, ankle socks and knee-length skirts, this little trip to the memory card is right for you.
