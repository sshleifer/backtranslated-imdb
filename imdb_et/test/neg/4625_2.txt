This movie starts great and sucks you in. Most of the actors are good until Patrick Swayze (with his Texas Twang - everyone else sounds like British even Muslims) and proves he can't act. With this you can live up to the first battle scene where they all fall. Why Patrick Swayze fights with bad ax when he just shut his sword into the ground 5 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> After a few minutes, swords are still misplaced and people know other people they shouldn't know. Other reviewers called "Troubled Production" and it shows. <br /> <br /> Finally, I just didn't care about the fighting scenes that the CGI dragon was weak, but the story was the biggest backlog.
