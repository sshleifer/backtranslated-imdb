The worst movie ever seen. Worst performance. I can't imagine the film even worse. See something. Not at all. Hey (actors) should look for another job. I don't understand who was stupid enough to actually put that movie in. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Eric Roberts. Must be tough ... I can't imagine how HUUUGE his mortgage must be to justify the job! /> LEADING MAN ... what a leader! He's better off driving and staying there! I see him work better than barking. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: DO NOT rent ... DON'T BUY!
