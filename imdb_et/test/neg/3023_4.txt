I was in two ways I hated about WASTED: leadership and scripting. I know I'm opening myself ridiculous, but the direction of Stephen T Kay is too similar .... like .... well like MTV pop video. It's shot (guess) against a digital video intrusive soundtrack, often uneven, and often with a fast cross-section. If you are not a teenager, you will find many WASTED segments due to a stylish approach. As bad as management was the script that brought my chain. The story is told by a poor little rich girl Samantha, who spends a lot of the film by talking (strange how the voice never seems to be identical enough to come from the same character) that tells us about the pressure of the exams, the pressure of home life, her social loneliness and all this is what led him to taking drugs. This is for similar reasons, such as breaking the parents, that his two male friends (I thought he was supposed to be lonely?) Start taking drugs. Oh poor little Sammi in his nice house and his problems with how my heart is for you and your sons blood - NO. What WASTED does not mention is that regardless of whoever is addicted, be it a drink, a drug, a nicotine or a chocolate, that a person has to work for becoming a drug addict, they are not victims of external forces, they do free will. Both TRAFFIC and TRAINSPOTTING did this very well, people become addicted because they want. To portray them as victims in some way is wrong patronization and very likely to be dangerous <br /> <br /> By the way, when MTV is a drug, do they stop playing videos of stars who allow drugs?
