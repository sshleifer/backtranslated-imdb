If it is not in the list of "what not to look at", it should only be because those who keep that particular list are not aware of its existence, which, as long as it is, is an acceptable alternative. I'm not kidding you, it's a * bad * movie. Joseph Meeker returns from the dead with a variety of vague, undefined supernatural powers, most of which seem to appear in new, more comical and ridiculous (and never frightening or scary) ... the last of those who are just strange, and the attempts of the former simply do not work , period) equipment and stereotypes / archetypes and depicted by David Keith (whom I respect ... well, at least Daredev), more often than not terribly inconsistent (which may also be related to the script) and often over top scores. On the sign or two, the personalities are so incredibly irritating that they are painful to watch. Editing thinks it is much smarter than it really is (and what on earth were the red tones that set back?). Cinema ... oh, honey. Frame, Coverage, Effective Use of Angle (That Some May Also Be Related to Editing, Perhaps), Please, guys, stop me when I say something you've ever heard. As far as the technical side is concerned, it is a pretty bad excuse for the projector to have something more valuable than an unlit film. But why stop? The plot is just poor. The basic idea is done and so much has been done (Crow would be one). The way it is spoken is a trick, but even though there are explanations behind the setbacks, it does not match. Pacing is non-existent. Lead is clearly unlikely and there are more personalities, not to mention that they are also much less wood. Kelly Perine and Thomas Ian Nicholas? What are you doing in what is good and fair (pun intended)? Perin, you were funny before, at Drich Carey's show, Nicholas, well, I haven't seen you before the American pie, but if anything else, you were funny later and the entertainment in those productions was deliberate. Dialogue is ... the less said, the better. The language is unlimited and tends to be stupid. Violence has been gently made, and they do not even seem to care to try to hide it (a hint might have been a smarter strategy). Characters, don't start me. Why spend so much energy to portray unusual, sometimes totally illogical events? The more you think about it, the worse it becomes. It is not even a "bad horror flick", or a B movie (it can very well pass the rest of the alphabet and go even further), it could not scare you on a frightening day when it was an electrified frightening device. I recommend it only to people who want to deny how bad it is, and don't say I didn't warn. 1/10
