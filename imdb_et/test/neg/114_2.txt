I saw this Mogul Video VHS. This is one of those old distributors of the 1980s whose catalog I want! <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty bad. Although he said "don't look in the attic," the main repetition it says is "Don't go into the villa." An interesting idea is just for a wool reason. The mark does not go into the attic for up to an hour of the film, and in fact it should have been learned earlier because it is being studied there. <br /> <br /> The film begins in Italy in Turin in the 1950s. Two men are fighting and the woman tells them that the wool will do it. One man kills another, then regrets, and the woman pulls the knife out and stabilizes her. He escapes from the wool and after he has left the chair he moves himself (what is the point of that?), But when the hand raises through the earth and drags it to the ground. <br /> <br /> It is today, thirty years later. There's a séance that appears unexpectedly and doesn't seem to be related to the movie. The children of a prologue woman inherit the house. The main daughter plays the same actor who played the mother. At least one of the men from the prologue seems to be repeated as another character. He is haunted by some warnings not to go to the villa, but they all do, because if they don't use it, they will lose it. People die. An attorney who has won all his cases will try to investigate a little. The end is pretty bad. Why was the family cursed? Unfortunately, boring film. <br /> <br /> On the back of the video box, there are a lot of amusing publications: “The scenes depicted on this package may be representations of the artist and may not necessarily represent the actual scenes of the film. "In this case, the box is an illustration of a cover that depicts a woman who has been drawn into the underground scene, although it has two hands and a woman is different. that I saw the reviewers who had a bad film fortune teller, where at least one point was scored for movies instead of pictures.
