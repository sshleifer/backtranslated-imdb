The pioneer of the 1960s underground film movement, writer and director Robert Downey, raided the advertising world of New York's Madison Avenue with its avant-garde comedy "Putney Swope". Downey is not limited to advertising with his ridicule, but deals with black military culture, Hollywood race portrayal, elite power structure and the nature of corruption at any power event. As potty and ambitious as "Putney Swope" is trying to do, it qualifies as a terrible film made from a shoe-string budget with an amateur, called humor. All this film is about improvisation. "Putney Swope", during the first release, brought out disputes that were politically wrong with competition and consumer culture. Like most Marx Brothers films, the plot is thin, which is an excuse for Downey's anecdotal gags, most of which are terrible. <br /> <br /> The prestigious Madison Avenue advertising bureau chairman dies at a board meeting. Before removing an institution, the board has a secret ballot to determine who will replace him. Each member understands that they are forbidden to vote themselves. A happy accident happens when everyone votes for a symbolic black member, Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson), because no one thought that anyone would have voted for him. The Swope bench slips all, except for one white driver, surrounded by black, gun-packing workers and renamed "Truth and Soul Advertising". Swope decides to change the face of American advertising. He refuses to accept customers whose products are alcohol, tobacco or war toys. Swope's customers will emigrate after the appointment of the Executive Director, and the grandfather will attract new customers who show their wallets in their offices and are ready to suffer from Swope's military personnel. Swope also uses its Afro-American workers by harassing their ideas after their fire and releasing a number of offensive advertising campaigns, all under the "new wave" of the marketing gene. Incredibly, Swope's conservatism proves successful, but the agency becomes a foundation for government agencies claiming that Swope's advertising tactics are "a threat to national security." The highest point of this monochrome 85-minute comedy is the color television programs. Unfortunately, Downey does not know when to cut these ads, which consistently start cleverly at the beginning, but they will wear to greet them. The funniest part of Putney Swope includes our name associated with US President Mimeo in Washington, Pepi Hermine. come out with your new car Borman 6 ad campaign.
