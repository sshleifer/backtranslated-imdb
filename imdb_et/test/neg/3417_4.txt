Aussie Shakespeare 18-24. With blood, blood and more with blood. it may not be for every level to be too violent for most. Made with low budget they are trying and doing the best, but it only works sporadically. If this macbeth just seems to be missing, its just not convincing. although most others have some good deeds, there is no head, especially mecbeths. The best results were gary sweet and strange mick molly. if you see it in Shakespeare, but if you like your cheese to mature, you will love it. It's not a bad movie, but it's not that good. sam peckenpah would have loved it, this is when it was filmed in the west. I waited much for it, as I loved the romper stomper. but it has been a free job.
