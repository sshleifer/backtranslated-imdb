This movie contains 2 famous actors I've seen before. There the operations are great and every action is the heart. But it makes me think these two were thrown for the first time in college's speech / drama class and said they were acting as a space-limiting factor, without being able to leave and being truly innocent and treating him enough to make the audience tear for his release. <br /> <br /> The only good part is the acting ability, the plot has the same role as Hitler's and I started to hate the main character. But in my opinion, all this could have been done in 15 minutes, so pulling out for over an hour was just a pure punishment for anyone who watched it. <br /> <br />
