It must be a WORSE movement I've seen !!!!! It wasn't just boring, it was a "fool with a spoon" stupid. Where did you find the actors ... in the corner of the street? Who made the special effects ... Maaco? For God, I could have made a better film with my CELL PHONE. And if it wasn't bad enough, at the end of the movie, there were even extras, so we saw how stupid the actors are in real life. Who ever made makeup for aliens ... have to spend $ 5 on your local costume store and call it a day. And who in the world wrote a description of the movie on the back of the DVD case, take a picture. PUHLEEZ !! It is not even 1/8% of what it describes. This description is simply to breastfeed people to buy, rent or pay a ticket. No wonder there was never a trailer. Ya would have taken them all !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Bad Actors ... $ 5 <br /> <br /> Special Effects ... $ 5.50 <br /> <br /> Fake Fire .... $ 1.89 (Cigarette Lighter) < br /> <br /> Time to watch a movie ... all the waste! (I have to watch it)
