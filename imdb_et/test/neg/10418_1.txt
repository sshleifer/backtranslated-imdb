I'm sitting here writing this review and the movie isn't over yet. In fact, I just checked and is still 45 minutes. However, no need to see it to the end. I am writing this review and laughing because the film plays in the background and stumbles upon some of the probably terrible conclusions I never care about seeing or knowing. <br /> <br /> What is the hostility to this movie for me? The characters are not plausible. The plot is not plausible. The film's pretense is sick. In principle, every element of the film is wrong. Buscemi probably thought he had something to add to dozens of films that have already explored the ups and downs of families and the obvious meaning of life. But Buscem was wrong because this movie doesn't contain anything new. He is trying to be very depressing, but fortunately no one can really suppress it, because it is obvious that there is no such person in the whole world. <br /> <br /> What is frustrating is the knowledge that several unsatisfactory prizes have been given to this film. Nasty !!!! Bottom line: away from this worthless movie at all costs.
