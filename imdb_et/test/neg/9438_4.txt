I know this movie was on local television when I was a kid, but I don't remember if I watched it or not; I see it now, given that it is completely forgotten, I still don't know? so I read it in the first view! There have been many films with the title, creative French author Jules Verne; these include: 20000 LEAGU ON THE BASIS OF SEA (1954; in the role of James Mason), THE WORLD MASTER (1961; Vincent Price), MYSTERIOUS ICELAND (1961; Herbert Lom), CAPTAIN NEMO AND THE BASIC City (1969; Robert Ryan) and CAPTAIN NEMO MYSTERIOUS ISLAND (1973; Omar Sharif). <br /> <br /> This version marks the winner Jose 'Ferrer. But even if the assumption itself is not half bad? woke up from the suspended animation of his submarine The Nautilus and found himself today, Nemo found his ingenuity to help the US Navy defeat the megalomania scientist Burgess Meredith? it's as easy as its most infantile adventure yet! For example: Five seconds movie, Meredith assistant? steel mask fixing? "The world must be ours!"); Equally fun is a similarly covered dwarf, whose job is to shoot, zealous gesticulations. Professor's all important "Delta Beam" - and how do these android-type minions on the Meredith ship, who never seem to have done much? ! <br /> <br /> Ferrer manages to maintain his dignity, but Meredith is embarrassed (practically restored from his penguin character since the 1960s BATMAN TV series and movie) where the budget was so tight? mostly invested in blissful production planning and dirty special effects, undoubtedly, and both apparently influenced STAR WARS (1977)? that they probably could not afford him a proper costume (he sees positively an idiot wearing a tie)! Supporting casting includes Mel Ferrer (playing Joan Fontaine's saboteur from another Irwin Allen production, VOYAGE SEA) and dealing with his laughing routine. Nautilus "), Lynda Day George (surprisingly he is the only female character) and Horst Buchholz (King of Atlantis for any reason, Nemo is stuck in finding the location of a famous lost continent). <br /> <br> By the way, reduced to three parts from the mini-series to the theater show, the film seems obviously nervous? though one is still able to discover where one episode ended and the other started.
