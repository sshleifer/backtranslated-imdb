The greatest effort to succeed in adapting the classic Odyssey story to the 30th nostalgia period. This time, the rockers have escaped the convicted offspring for the southern depression. <br /> <br /> The greatest strength of the movie is the excellent music soundtrack that effectively proves not only the era in which it was set, but the spiritual references that curb the film. In addition to its value for the film's tone, music is simply fun to listen to. <br /> <br /> What the film depicts is that the characters aren't really that nice. In comedy, you need this element to stay together with them. Instead, we have a bunch of selfish, arrogant, breathless, thoughtless moods that have no positive points at all. They are not violent enough to hate you, so they are hard to associate at all. They are offered clowns, but like people who march in clown makeup and parades, they're not just funny. <br /> <br /> Like the story that inspired it, the film takes these men as "odyssey" that encounters various symbolic (some even mystical) characters. All have been subjected to offensive stereotypes, the operative word being "stupid." People are banged to the right and left and therefore no one is particularly interesting or tempting. The movie doesn't like its characters and it doesn't let you like them. <br /> <br /> Rivers baptism, beautiful sirens, stolen cars, fistfights, radio preachers, people whipped; everything is thrown you apart. Some refer to some laughter, others interfere or carry you. I laughed when a funny man banged the tatt out of a particularly unpleasant sticker. But there were a lot more meaningless scenes; an example: some "30-year-old Dillinger-type boys" eating cows with a tommy gun. Comedy? Symbolism? No; just meaningless violence that reduces the intellectual nature of the original source material on which this story is based. <br /> <br /> Other Odyssey adjustments are much better. If you are not a George Clooney fan, rent something else. But buy a soundtrack CD; music is great.
