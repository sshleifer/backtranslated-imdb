I'm a fan of Ed Harris's work, and I really had great expectations of this movie. Being such good actors as Harris and Von Sydow, the director always has a great advantage, but if the script is bad, what can you do? I really think that the troublesome film is the worst film in Harry's filmography and that it was a big mistake to deal with it. Anyway, I've seen a lot of worse movies in my life, but the things I needed was a disappointment about the waste of acting talent. The overall story seems too unbelievable and fake. I don't know if it's because of this book because I haven't read it. But if the script was so bad, I don't see the reason for filming it. Perhaps it was the commercial success of King's books or the need for low-quality films for the 90's VHS era. Whatever the reason, this movie was a very bad choice for everyone.
