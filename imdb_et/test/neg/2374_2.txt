I've always said that the original form - comics - has nothing to win. I'm right again. Like all other films in the Asterix series, they couldn't impress. The makers of this movie can't get that what makes all these other comic-rotated movies (x-men, superman et al.) Are successful, they all deviate from the original comic versions and adjust it to be more observable. It was agreed that this film was different in the sense that it was a cross of two Asterix books. Asterix and Great Crossing & Asterix and Normans. Without characterizing the Asterix series (except for Asterix and the secret weapon), it was also one of the main characters of love. It all ended up doing was childishly immature story. The funny parts were very little and far away. All in all, wasting time and money watching it, not to mention theaters, even at home.
