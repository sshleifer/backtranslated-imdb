PLEASE?! When it comes to technology and what a person does to kill others and myself, I think I got my whole point. Because I went out of the way Reggio relied on the Cold War era for space exploration and had nothing new to add to the dialogue on technology fears. Lanes 1 and 0, which mark technology and mathematics and science - STEPs. Does anyone there see the Matrix there? And mobility research on moving people? Ever heard of Edward Muybridge? At least he uses photographs of Muybridge's human movement studies. <br /> <br /> This movie was a derivative and the score is just enough for Philip Glass to make it sound like everything he has done in the last 10 years ... Avoid this movie is all about cost !!
