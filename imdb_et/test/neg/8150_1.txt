This movie has one or two interesting gags, but they are not expected. After an inexplicable argument between the two men taking the litter from the film chamber, we cut off the family who left! Driving a Hollywood and a passenger car over your finger across the screen again and again when you talk about a man's dialogue. At least I think this is a man, this terrible song that comes with the assembly is so loud that it makes the dialogue almost obscure. Finally, the caravan arrives at the petrol station at night, where the family leaves, with another intermediate interview before driving. The camera is put over to expose the actor we just saw. She speaks directly to the camera and we understand she is the film's director we look at, and how she came to make the film. <br /> <br /> A nice idea that ALMOST (but not quite) makes the previous sequences worth the pain. <br /> <br /> As the movie comes out, he encounters two characters at the beginning of the movie, which we met in the litter and they all form a film company. <br /> <br /> All kinds of not very funny and awkward comedies when they put together a team and try to raise the money they need to start filming. <br /> <br /> This movie was obviously put on a shoe string and promise, and here's a nice little idea that is trying to get out, but it's so wrong that the idea disappears. Comedy is more than things that just fall and everyone is talking (or screaming) at once. With so many dialogues here, several participants shout at the same time - Robert Altman can do it well because he has a script, samples, sound technicians, and editing capabilities. Anyone who screams at one of the mike that this sound was hidden in the trash in the next room is not clear.
