Some movies are just ?? unhappy. These are films that evidently flourished with a lot of goodwill and a handful of potentially great ideas, but they just didn't have the necessary budget and / or professional and team members. "The Strangeness" definitely belongs to this category. You really want to like it, but even the most tolerant and unjustified 80's spooky fanatics have to admit that the film hardly reaches the level of mediocrity thanks to cheapness, cumbersome stop-motion effects and impenetrable dark cinematography. "The Strangeness" has a rather original plot and setting (okay, it's similar to "The Boogens", but I doubt the director David Michael Hillman has unintentionally canceled the 80-year-old B-film) and the players are showing enthusiastic performances is all wrong. The collection of amateur gameologists goes on an expedition to explore the notorious goldfish mine. Many years ago, many mysterious miners died there, and the place has been abandoned since then, but there should be too much gold for it to remain closed forever. Soon after they landed in the mine, the members of the group met one by one with the narrow ruler of the gold mine; Lovecraftian monster with tentacles and incredibly cheesy way to move on. Throughout its working hours, The Strangeness is a boring and incompetent confusion that is difficult to follow due to the lack of light. The characters are uninteresting and the mining remains a mystery, because the only lighting effects come from the spellologists' helmets. There is very little action or horror in the first lesson, but the director Hillman is attentive to the viewers, regularly showing the monster. As soon as you see the monster's tentacle as a first glance, you are forced to watch until the end. The creature is realized with stop-motion effects that I usually adore and worship, but here they seem extremely weak and merciful. The person responsible for the special effects should have paid more attention to Ray Harryhousen's work. Death hunts occur largely during the screen and there are very few tensions in the film. Such a horror strike with such a device should benefit from claustrophobic atmosphere and undetectable sound effects, but "Oddity" does not. The greatest trump of the film is undoubtedly the beautiful appearance of the blonde actor Terri Berland. She reminds the speleologist as much as I recall Theresa, but she looks good in her tight top and beige pants.
