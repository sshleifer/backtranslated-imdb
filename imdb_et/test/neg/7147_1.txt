Throughout this movie, I wondered why they made it on the documentary as a "documentary", but did not contain any real material about the people interviewed? Of course it would have been like any other documentary, but then the filmmakers should have found the meaning of the film. <br /> <br /> Using several famous movie stars (many of them probably asked for it) to portray "real" people, I felt that there was a predetermined message, and the director was so deliberate that real people could not both participants and tried scenes were used. (Yes, I know it was a game too, but the documentary should be a documentary.) "<br /> <br /> This movie could have been a much more powerful social comment if it was more objective or let's see Matthew Shepard and his murderers as people rather than symbols. (Much better "Boys Don't Cry") watched the participants - good and bad. Instead, the Laramie project gives hope for almost relentlessly that someone's sexuality should be accepted independently and little.
