An interesting topic. Pathetic delivery - script and direction. <br /> <br /> Our hero, Miles, melts and has the world's first life-saving operation in an emergency. Here begins fun. The main question is that Miles has no SOUL !!! It is used to explain your quasi-uneven behavior, which is indirectly responsible for two deaths (I believe it is the total number of deaths within 104 minutes). On the livelier side, Miles prefers an odd glass brand, relaxing fireplaces and her young, baked female cousin. The final is indeed fair to this movie. <br /> <br /> Some idea: 1. The producer $ $ was divided to create this story. J.D. Feigelson was a script writer and (or the only) producer. He seemed not to learn the lesson of "how to bring an interesting idea in life" when reviewing his other writing credits. It supports the reliability of this script. <br /> <br /> 2. Now available on DVD !!! It's really scary. Should be forever "shelf base" in VHS format. <br /> <br /> 3. A transformed person without a soul default goes to an evil unit. <br /> <br /> 4. The result provides minimal support. Not even in the form of Jerry Goldsmith could not save it. <br /> <br /> 5. Achieve 0230 time slot on TV and a touch that was more entertaining than infomercials + test patterns he was competing for while watching. <br /> <br /> 6. Fortunately, there was no queue for the "Nightmare" franchise of Wes Craven. Chiller league: Return to Miles, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Despite my assessment 1, I still recommend this movie as a great example of how to kill a acting or script writing career. This should apply to management, but Wes Craven has been released forever thanks to his only good "Hirmuunne Street on the Street" in 1984.
