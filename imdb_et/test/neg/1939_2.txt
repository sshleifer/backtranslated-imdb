VIVA LA BAM This "Jackass" spin off focuses on the (apparently written) adventures of Bam Margera and his palettes (Johnny Knoxville, Brandon Dicamillo, etc.). This exhibition, although it has a fair share of comedy and crazy stunts, mainly focuses on the torture of Bami's parents. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say, Bam, but ... you are not as cool as you think. This ego-rejected exhibition is not only painful (and yes, I liked Jackass), but also an incredible narcissistic. The overly styled intro ends with Bam, explaining that he is going to "whatever f ***" he wants. How about something that is really funny? I liked "Jackass" for what it was worth. The camera-work was terrible - every idiot could have done with his parents in the garage of his parents, but at least the exhibition moved permanently and never felt mad, dangerous or just disgusting with the tricks that the bales did <br /> <br /> Not so " For Viva la Bami. We watch our hero when he plays scams for his friends and tortures his relatives, but never feels like something really flat and written comedy. Stunts and horrors are lightly entertaining, but they are so annoying and boring that they barely smile at you. "Viva la Bam" is a bad spin-off from the feed of Margera's already too big ego. I do not recommend this flat and unimaginable example to anyone.
