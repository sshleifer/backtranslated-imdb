It doesn't say much. This Killjoy movie is better cinematography and is more professional than the latter. This does not mean that it is more professional. This terrible last movie was about gangsters killing the boy and then haunting the voodoo clown. I thought the last man who played Killjoy was a bad actor but wow !!! This Killjoy is honestly the worst actor I've ever seen in every movie, and I've seen many movies. The last movie that the clown came in after about 15 minutes is shorter and the clown doesn't even come in for 40 minutes and it's only 65 minutes long! I'll give him 2, because some of the characters are OK.
