Let's face it, it's a pretty bad movie. But if you go ready to have fun, you can survive this experience. Okay, you scream a lot of trouble. Frican jungle fun in a fun way. br /> <br /> Tom Conway (who spends most of the funky chapeau movies) uses local sorcerer and mad science to create a "perfect" nature. It looks like a hero who has been drunk for six weeks and is in the bag dress.Strongly kind.However, it does not kill him, because he uses his girl as a good girl.He needs a bad bad girl. <br /> <br /> Marla English and Lance Fuller are two small crooks looking for African gold. English lessons should have been at the top of the search list. She's a bad girl and lets everyone know if it's worth playing junior high school. "Connors is the leader's white guide between English and Fuller con. <br /> <br /> Finally, English and Conway meet and this is a game made in hell. It has its own voodoo creature because it does something (stress something) to get what he wants.You will do something to stop the agony of this movie. <br /> <br /> What made this movie interesting to me was Conway wearing that funky tribal hat / headdress / floral piece! still figure out what the dead animal it was. /> Really bad cinema.
