Okay, now it's a movie. It's full of stupid Jesus and a dialougue that would make most people's biennials question if they should be filming at all. Big names like Roddy Piper and David Carradine pull you in, but take it from me, this movie sucks. The story is incomprehensible and incomplete in intellect. Sets, wikis and costumes come like a baby in between five and prison sentences. I'm sure there's better dialougue porn.
