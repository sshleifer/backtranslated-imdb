The main character, Pharaon, has suffered the loss of his wife and child in the pre-film past. He's just doing emotionally closing. Too long a movie, too much time spent on Pharaoh's expressive face, too much "pavement" (one of the TV shows: spending time with moving cars, trains, etc.) Long scenes trivial - sometimes completely inexplicable, pointlessly trivial - actions with no cause or emotion. His best friends, Joseph and Domino, are not much more, their relationship with gender (this film can give a new meaning to the phrase "free sex"); Domino and Pharaoh's mother have two characters showing some emotion, but not much. It is hard to say with all the characters in this movie: whether it is indifferent, indifferent, or simply an indifferent character that is good in writing and working well. The characters in this film speak very little to anyone; it is no wonder that they are emotionally isolated, which is even more bizarre because it is clear that they live in a neighborhood where people are friendly and know each other.
