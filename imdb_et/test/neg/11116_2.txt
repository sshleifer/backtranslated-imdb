I didn't like this movie for so many reasons I can't even say. I mean, who thinks they grabbed the chupacabra and it broke off on the cruise ship. LAME !!! It was all right when the movie was flat, but it wasn't worth it. I can't believe anyone's actually ten in this movie. But I think people like this kind of movie. I gave this film 1 instead of 1 just because it was about chupacabra and it was a boy of the Lord of the rings. If you want to see this movie, I'd stay home and wait for the sci-fi channel. Don't waste your money to see this movie. Believe me.
