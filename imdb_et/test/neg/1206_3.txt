Don't bother to check the logic. Missing. But on the other hand, there are many great movies with no logic, so why bother? <br /> <br /> I like this movie and I like it. I like it because the air sequences are really big, you see a lot of dogfighting. I also like the F-16, which is a very cool plane. <br /> <br /> But there are too many goofes to really enjoy me. I think it's not fair to want YOUR continuity because it's really hard to make a really good fighter film - but I also think there should be some way of thinking. <br /> <br /> And I have a question: will they drive from California to the Middle East in F-16 without refueling? I would like to see it.
