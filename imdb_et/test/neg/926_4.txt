Ignore extreme voices about "House of Wax", it is by no means "1" or "10". I am trying to help everyone who thinks about seeing "House of Wax" or those who saw it on a trailer and feel cheated. The trailer makes this movie very promising, which is what trailers have to do. In the case of trailers, only one thing is certain, if manufacturers cannot put together the elements that are interesting for a minute, it is quite certain that the film is a great breastfeeding. But a good trailer will only tell you that some movie-related things are good, it doesn't give you a lot of ideas about the whole package. There may be little research on value here. <br /> <br /> "Wax House" stars Elisha Cuthbert (whose skills are closer to Kathy Ireland than her compatriot Sarah Polley or her look-alike Rose McGowen) and were led by a formerly known music video artist. like Jaume, your debut. These are not good signs, but if you are like me, you ignore them and look at the work of the production designer Grace Walken, who is responsible for the look of "Ghost Ship". Again, it's worth seeing Walken's work, so it looks like 90% of the $ 30 million budget went to production planning. The rest went to Cuthbert to compensate him for the abuse of the whole movie (finger cut, lips glued, stuck and lots of different things). Cuthbert looks much harder than "The Girl Next Door", about one big pig with no greater difficulty. <br /> <br /> Which means they had little left to pay for the rest and team. And judging what was on the screen, it can actually be true. It seems that everyone else donated their time to get their first operating or team member. Unfortunately, whether it was inexperience or jealousy about the pay gap, the contribution of all these inexperienced / incompetent volunteers is less than zero. Look and work in the league with incompetent editors like Joel Negran (add "Pearl Harbor" here), where they can take away most of the value added of the product development group. Instead of dragging over and showing sets, the movie window has this stuff with a camera with poor lighting and a zooming zoom. Negran increased the problem with disagreeable disorienting cuts. Bad lighting, ADD-like camera and exciting cutting are what you use to hide cheap and nervous product designs; not what is needed if the only strength of the film is its expensive and detailed set. <br /> <br /> Chan Hayes did a scenario and Charles Belden (who wrote the original story) is credited as a writer, although except for the title and the use of wax figures there is no similarity. One lasting scare is that the film does not take the horror film seriously and is usually a parody (add "Van Helsing" here). The murderers are laughing, too extreme to be scary or even horrible for anyone over six. Especially in cracking, there was an audience when a certain high-level hotel heiress got his home face through a steel bar, although his earlier semi-forged striptease was the only really horrible thing in the film. Another highlight of the comedy was when Cuthbert put his finger through the grate and cut it off with a bad boy. <br /> <br /> Good scenes take place in the Trudy Wax House, wax works that have nothing to do with a closed sugar mill, connected twins and lots of road surfaces (which Cuthbert can swim in). All this should take place anywhere in Florida's rural areas, although many mountains seem to look like the state of Paul Hogan (scouts of a remarkable location - the Gulf coast is not marked by this rolling landscape). The scenario apparently provided for the establishment of a two-to-one connection (bad pun), but somewhere during production or post production, most of this dialogue was cut. Since it makes sense to go for a twin connection and goes somewhere further, you do not know why it was not cut to reduce the boredom factor. <br /> <br /> It is especially sad that manufacturers had no brain to recognize in middle products that they had first-class horror classics even with existing pain. What looked at them was an opportunity to go somewhere with the illusion of a wax town. As it is a photographic environment, today's film is inherently naturalistic, almost exclusively inclined to create the illusion of reality. Here they were prepared to give the photographic medium an element of extreme stylization theater. Like the Impressionist countryside, the city also creates the illusion of reality far, but shows itself as a very stylized wax. Of course, they would have had to find a vision of a leader and a DP in order to take it out successfully, but everything else was already there.
