I am partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say "in part" because most of his movies fall into two categories: brilliant and boring. Unfortunately, this movie belongs to a later category. <br /> <br /> This film has the same basic problems as Miyazaki's recent film "Howl's Moving Castle". An intriguing premise has been created, but then some somewhat unobtrusive is immediately reduced to some unimaginable events that only interfere with the plot rather than explain it. <br /> <br /> The first third of the movie shows the post - the story of the apocalyptic world is set and actually looks like a very interesting story. Since then, things are going down the hill. The central part of the film is usually composed of a thin hidden eco-propagant, the end of which is strongly explained by the dependence on the impenetrable spiritualities of a large number of Japanese animated films. <br /> <br /> In general, it seems the film seems to be hanging on every other page of the script before it is sent to animators. What is left is visually stunning (though unfortunately, this vision was a copy of the so-called generation with a bad color that leads to a common myth that Nausica shows his bare base on the fly), but that makes little sense and finally left me confused.
