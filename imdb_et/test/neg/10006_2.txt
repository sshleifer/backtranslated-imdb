As a long-time fan of the Japanese film, I waited for more. I can't really do a lot of trouble because this movie is just so poor. The story can be the sweetest romantic little thing, the damage I couldn't do terribly, the confusion they called, and the standard "peculiar" Japanese story. If you have noticed how many Japanese films are used by signs, plots and twists that seem too "different", forcibly so, avoid this movie. Seriously, a 12-year-old could have told you how this movie is moving, and that's not good in my book. <br /> <br /> "Beat" Takeshi fans: his role in this movie is not really more than a kame, and if you are not a rabid fan, you don't have to suffer it due to movie scraps. <br /> <br /> 2/10
