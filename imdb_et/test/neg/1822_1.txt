This brief overview does not include a spoiler because the film has broken. It's wood and pedantic. It has no rescue charge. If someone invites you to look at "Mr. Empire" at your house, don't go. Even the movie's title is terrible and portends which garbage is located. The whole plot is so bad that it can drive to Mother Theresa's despair !!! It was not a stroke leading to the early death of the poor Ezio, he had to act in a clown that did him. It must haunt him for the rest of the days. Maybe she was an alien of the enemy and wanted to revenge the Americans for her birth. He found the perfect vehicle for his anger in this travesty.
