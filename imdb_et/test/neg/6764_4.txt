Some distant ships from the planet have sent a giant robot to Kronos to rob their energy world. They have a prototype that opens up to openers around Mexico and if it proves to be successful, more will be sent. This Kronos would definitely take a long time to complete this task. <br /> <br /> For reasons, foreigners cannot explain first the mind of the leading scientist John Emery, who telephonically directs Kronos to his first goals. Since Emery died later and the monster seems to be unable to work as an Emery Controller well enough, why might foreigners need her first, a little odd. <br /> <br /> In any case, scientists Jeff Morrow, Barbara Lawrence and George O'Hanlon, who work under Emery, are not deceived by their nature. And, of course, they're going to have to deal with a fierce metal giant. <br /> <br /> Kronos is the perfect film of the fifties, bad guys have never seen that they are just looking for humankind. This is the perfect movie for the Cold War. And Jeff Morrow assures us that we are ready for them in the future. <br /> <br /> Players look like they have an old age when they have as many keyboard lines that writers can put into the script. I have the impression that Kronos is a movie Ed Wood could have done with a bigger budget, a little more with care.
