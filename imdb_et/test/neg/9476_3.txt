Now I was watching when I was one Sunday and I was hungry and my aunt and uncle visited one of my two cousins ​​one day (one 11, another 9). We got stuck on TV and the Paris pass was just over. My relatives had both said they sometimes look at two kinds and I said they could watch the movie if they like it. Since I wasn't up to the right state, I just stayed in the living room and found the movie! I have to say that if a person who has no interest in such TV shows or films, I really enjoyed it ... it must have been alcohol, but I testify that it would probably only be more for girls aged 6 and 13, but it was a time that took time. There is always a movie or an exhibition you don't think you like, but a laugh enjoyed it.
