I'm not a big fan of the Spielberg / Cruise version of this movie. And so I have to go for a more modest Latt / Howel version. C Thomas Howel had more conscience and sympathy for Cruise's lead (at least in my opinion). Now it is hard to imagine it until you remove all things in the Spielberg version, which costs more than a thousand dollars. There would be nothing special effects, kits, no cruise. Because I doubt anything will cost anything more in David Michael's Latt version. So, I think that when comparing apples to turnips, laughter is needed. At least it provides independent films to the market of epic scientific literature.
