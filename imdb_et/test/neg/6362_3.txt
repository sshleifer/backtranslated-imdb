Well, this movie wasn't as terrible as I thought it would be. I waited for this one star. I chose it to three. Why? Well, it is not so bad for a cheering horror / sci-fi movie. Of course, the characters are sticky (like their behavior - including young Leonardo DiCaprio), cheap looking effects and monsters ... and just say I've seen some of the most effective Halloween costumes in elementary schools ... But there was something in this movie that made to see me to the end. Little humor helped to guess. And if you ever wanted to see an alien's gas, this movie will allow you to dream. 3/10
