I know I'm sure the guys were sitting in the office one day and said, "HOW CAN I HAVE MONEY?" They had made all possible toy variants they could do with their current characters. So they decide to steal the star wars idea A PREQUEL and we can make all the new characters and sell them as toys. By the way, what did they do for dollhouse 3, but who cares? Anyway, before the first movie, when Toulon is still alive, he and the dolls are sitting and the wooden headscarf on the floor and the dolls want to know if it's a dead family member or something, it doesn't matter. So the story of the ancestors of the puppet theater begins. It's long, it's boring, no body cares. <br /> <br /> The funniest part is that they talk about the origin of these new characters in the movie, but don't give their fate tips. HOW, HOW, When new toys are profitable, they can finance a new (and fourth straight) rotten sequence called "PUPPET MASTER 8 SEQUEL to RIRO RETRO PUPPETE SHIPPING PREQUEL!" Hold your breath!
