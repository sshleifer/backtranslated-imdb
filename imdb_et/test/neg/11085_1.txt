My first post in IMDb must (unfortunately) be a warning to others not to spend their time with the cave! There is no story, no character, no fear, no good light. That doesn't make sense. If you have poor performance, people who run through small parts of the cave will collide with bad angles and people will scream in full darkness of the screen, love this movie. I can turn off the lights in my house and screaming and I shouldn't pay for it. The only thing that scared me was that someone made the movie terribly. <br /> <br /> ... one of the worst films I've ever rented.
