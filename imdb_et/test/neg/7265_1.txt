In short, this film is the announcement of artistic bankruptcy. <br /> <br /> Almodovar is the most important European filmmaker in the 80s and 90s. No other lively director has shaped the style and content of contemporary European cinema. Therefore, it is not easy to say that his latest efforts are not just another disappointment after double films, but rather a complete and complete disaster that confirms that he has run out of ideas, humor and worst symbols. it creates. <br /> <br /> It's not a story of complexity. All Almodovar movies are almost impossible to summarize. This time it's pretty easy if you know his previous job. "Broken Embraces" is a remake of the "Desire Law", only this time the director is a straight and jealous jilted lover is a millionaire. <br /> <br /> For those who don't know this movie. m make a summary. If you do not want to know too much, skip this section. A blind man, who was formerly a film director, seduces him with a sexy buxom woman reading a paper after a casual street collision (on paper, really, just right). That's when he gets his visit and his best friend visit. He mentions to him that he has learned from the paper that a certain millionaire is dead, which takes the story 14 years ago. She can still see her next movie. He celebrates this millionaire as an inexperienced mistress, as he is immediately appalled by him. Millionaire is discovering his thing through the silent videos of his homosexual son, interpreted by interpreters (some excellent scenes: Cecilia Roth). After violent quarrels, the lover escapes with the director at a seaside resort where he learns that the millionaire who produced the film had issued it at the worst possible editing, destroying the director's reputation. The couple decides to return, but he has an accident where the manager becomes blind and a possible actor dies. He is currently learning that his representative has retained film negatives and is about to reconstruct it. <br /> <br /> As with "poor education", there are different sub-lines to complement this rather thin story, and like "Bad Education", the result is more confusing than satisfactory. For example, the agent's son, working as a DJ, has a random drug overdose that is completely unnecessary on the plot and is interpreted quite badly. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, participants don't have to blame, but how their characters are written. Blanca Portilla has so many skeletons in the agent that even the brilliant force does not save the mark from a ridiculous one. Lluis Homar is the old man's dream of the main thing who lives in an artificial world where the name of English and some sweet words can attract all the supermodels. And Penelope Cruz is the embodiment of this old man's sexual fantasy. His character is totally inanimate. It is not clear why he goes from an old man who at least helped his family to a little less old man who is not charming enough to convince either a romantic hero or a passionate defense. But all these drawbacks would not make this movie so terrible. Yet, Almodovar ends up with the worst possible driver (or any storyteller) ideas: he quotes himself, something he's been doing more and less, and very little. The movie "Broken Embraces" in the film uses as a plot control device is actually "Women on the edge of nerve break" (1988), only this time called "chicks and suitcases". This rather unimaginable title can give you a hint of how the beloved classics are treated here: when the "Broken Embraces" dialogue, which is the last ten minutes, is complicated in the original film, a general change. , here's a stealthy, colorless, irritating business. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is the brainchild of the creator of the DOA's earlier miracles, pretty much terrible and disappointing, like the last Indiana Jones feature. Perhaps so many people would not agree to this, because Almodovar was a genius in the past. I'd rather offer my respect for his achievements by asking the humble reader to look at "All About My Mother" or "Tie Me Up" or "High Heel" or "Matador", all showing Almodovar's unique and unbalanced talent. Another such film and his legacy can be destroyed for good.
