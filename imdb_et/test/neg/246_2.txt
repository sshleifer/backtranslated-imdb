2/3 of this movie is recycled material from previous films, which unfortunately is obvious to me, like me, who has not seen original movies. And somehow it seems like a rip-off, even though I've never seen this stuff before. It's like every episode of a TV show where the characters sit around the photo album or something, and you just see the recycled materials of other episodes. I have seen some manufacturers use the expansion of recycled film, but never more than 5 minutes. This movie is mostly seen by the audience, so you might want to install the case that it is one of the biggest staples ever released to the film. <br /> <br /> I saw this theater, 16mm in print, which is good enough, I think that rarely is such a movie on that day. I give the film a semi-convincing Gothic atmosphere and involuntary humor, but that's it. The Aztec mummy monster looks good, even on his face has mobility that is better than a period of monsters. But the robot is sad, though it is interesting that they saw the human face completely visible. This is a "robot game" or something they explain in the film. I think it's considered an android. So technically hard in terms of sci-fi, this movie should be called "Android vs Aztec Mummy," but I doubt anyone was too worried about technical issues when they were worried about quality. In fact, this film is so slowly assembled that it makes television good. Even copying from Mexican to English is lazy and weak - for example, at one point the hero says, "I could start from the beginning..." Could they say at least "the beginning in the beginning" so that it would not happen again? The editor of a high school newspaper could have confirmed the scenario of this film. This is an image of utilitarian filmmaking, and there is nothing in this film that does not have to be the main commercial purpose of the film. They no longer made the effort to do it when they were, and considering the extensive recycled material, I doubt they did it for more than a week to make the film. <br /> <br /> I stop posting on this, so I don't want to spend more energy in the commenting process than the filmmakers actually did.
