Sometimes funny but generally boring. I recognized Robert Hesse's greeting back from Carter (aka Epstein) as a former celebrity offender. There's a knee movement, an intestinal burst where a French lady has a bad reaction to American food. S. Baiot, S. Kellerman and Tom Arnold are billed, but they have only small roles. You never know characters and it's hard to take care of what happens to them. Not recommended.
