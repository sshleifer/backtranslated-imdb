I was encouraged to watch this movie because I heard a good word: it was supposed to be this exciting real crime milestone, disruptive, shocking ... all this jazz. Well, I'm disturbed because I spent some money on it and I'm shocked that something so God-terrible has actually been released. That's about it. <br /> <br /> This is the expected "new look" in the junkies and murder of the crazy loser of the Charles Manson family. But if this is a "new look" then it is probably "new" like "fresh and completely intuitive": just looking at it gave me a headache, and I had to give up trying to understand it or even understand what the director wanted it to be would be. <br /> <br /> I think I should say something about a plot, but it is so stupid and inconsistent that I hardly remember if there was even a plot at all. "Manson tape" had something that was sent to the radio DJ (or television producer?), Then an hour of meaningless "family" footage "69, then Polanski murders (like a bad school game) and finally an idiotic part about chewing gum in drunk and hell beating each other alley (I'm not a boy you are), and then it ended (thanks to God) (do not ask me to understand this idea) I just remember what I saw!) The performances were also terrible. And how hard is it to convince convincing "Manson"? Take a short skinny screaming blast, put her dirty wig and hairy beard. There's your Manson. But this "Manson" doesn't even look right. She just looks like, cheap, wig and pasted Santa beard with black. Or maybe this is the movie that really is: Manson's family didn't make any sense, so there's no point in this film either. It's symbolic! (Yes, right) I'm still so angry about spending that money. I stopped my usual lurking on this site and just registered this movie to vote 1 and posted a warning that hopefully prevents others from spending their money on this garbage. Stay away from it, it's not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> PS. The recent US television production "Helter Skelter" received bad comments here, but I saw it last month (I also saw the original 1976) and let me say, compared to "Manson's family", that the new Helter Skelter is BRILLIANT and FLAWLESS. And I was disappointed! This is how bad "Manson Family" is: it makes a false and mostly disappointing TV movie that is perfect.
