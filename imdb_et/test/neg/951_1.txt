Since this exhibition was changed from TSS (screensavers) to AOTS (attack attack), it has fallen to the hill. TSS with Yoshi and Kevin Rose Alex ... etc. Showing quizzes, they came from TSS for an unknown reason. When the exhibition was switched to AOTS, it changed less for computers and games and magazines. It also promoted bands that no one had heard or cared for. Finally, I couldn't look any further when Kevin Rose left. He kept it interesting, but he went to do his thing, which is good. Now, Kevin Rose has several online stores on REV 3 and shows it, etc. Look at it. REV3.com think you can go to www.systm.org. If you want a real tech show, not a gaze, check out Kevin Roses' example or listen to Wit-podcast. <br /> <br /> J <
