I recently looked at Shame, led by Ingmar Bergman. The film was interesting and unique. I liked how it was in Swedish with English subtitles and that it was also black and white. These features allowed me to better associate characters, time, and their stories. I didn't like how the movie was very slow at first and how you didn't know what was really going on. At first it was mainly about the relationship between Eva and Jani. The film also ended up with a very depressing note, because nothing was good about all the film's conflicts and changes. I'm probably not ashamed again, but it was a very cultured experience.
