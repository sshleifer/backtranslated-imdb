A good example of the differences between American and foreign cinema is seen in the recent film on television: an indecent proposal. . I'm not sure if it was their complete lack of chemistry or that they didn't work well, but why should we care so much that these two will go together. Love, affection, playfulness, attraction? none of them appeared on their interaction with the screen. <br /> <br /> Since I knew that Robert Redford would finally come out, it was clear from the start that a good part of the movie's meat would be the scenes between him and Demi Moore. Poor Woody Harrelson was unable to collect any emotions at all. He seems to hold on, worried about his retarded hairline. <br /> <br /> OK, so fast forward. With these idiots these two (Diane and David) think they can win back the $ 50,000 they owe to gambling. There's no action out there, just badly bad, lazy, unforgiving writing. Of course, they lose all their money. Surprise? I know I wasn't. Enter Robert Redford (John Gage in the movie)? romantic, maybe emotionally cold, man, upgraded to Gatsby. A very good role and though not a big, big actor next to these two, Redford looks like Olivier. She loves her right now and loves Diane and we look at it once. That's how to love a woman! Not David's Way, trading in the mouth of the gum mouth with Diane at a luscious mule. (Did I see it right?) Like Gage, Redford wears a suit and tie in any scene. Yes, it is meant to see the brain dead audience, that here is a rich person, but he also sees the devil good and since then the brain's dead audience appreciates it! At the end of the movie, other wardrobe decorations include shirts that are iron-strewn, which signify determination, getting it together after a long, wrinkled shirt that is wearing. Hollywood Movies? Suddenly everyone seems to be British, with fancy dresses, three pieces for men, hats (HATS!) And, of course, for sunshades. Yes, Diane, her transformation into Rich Man's groom, is now ready, gently turning the sunshade at the auction. Although he insisted he could not be bought, he eventually fell into sexual tension. Here is where the film is separated from Americana. I mean, David and Diane get together, my question is: WHY? Diane was bored with David, why not let him ride the Robert Redford wave? And I mean for a long time? How can he pull himself from the sexual romantic square of this sexy older man so easily that Woody Harrelson brings his retreating hairline to a garden party, sits down and sees Demi in Moore's eyes. It's not just that. He was so WEAK. <br /> <br /> But we have to have a happy ending. We have to swallow a moral lesson. We are not complicated enough to do otherwise. Director Lyn tried to make fatal attractions for juvie sets, with young people. <br /> <br /> In addition to garden-side locations with a SUV, a road shirt or baseball cap. it has a reliable public transport system that connects cities and municipalities in distant California. How else to symbolize the life of a middle class or a working class?
