Can they get worse off? Probably. But after all Steven Seagal does what he does. Well; this time, instead of the deadly injury of bad wounds, he wounds them easily. The reputation of being a bad ass is hired by Seagal to offer a special package from France to America. But this is not an easy task for so many people trying to cut off the mission. The battles are just not enough and the big bangs are just big and everything is. Anna-Louis Plowman seems to be the only cast member who doesn't show up on wood. Jeffery Pierce, Max Ryan and Harry Van Gorkum are also cast. Don't put this charge on Seagal.
