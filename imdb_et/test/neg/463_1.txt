How can anyone even start making this movie that is really over me. <br /> <br /> Idea? It has nothing. "The man broke down". That's the idea. Wow. The environment killed him slowly ... now that it's original and it's worth a look. <br /> <br /> This is the first Fasbinder movie I've seen ... I've heard that he is a genius-genius genius scene, but I've seen student films more attention, inspiration, ideas and crafts than this ... it's .... it's something. It has nothing! <br /> <br /> Each image is too long. They have so many voids ... Functioning terrible. You see that the actors were not ready at all, did not understand their roles, not even try to show emotions ... it is ... superficial ... lines are so clear that you could remove 90% of them and still have the same filthy movie . Tempo? Who cares about it. Atmosphere, dynamics, pussies! One picture of the scene, 80% of the time that comes unrealistically, with no idea how to represent emotions and the importance of the moment after hollow looking at the camera or each other. All editing rules have not been taken into account without any remuneration ... Photography? Half shots are reflected and funny lighting in them without any stylization. Shadows, playing shadows ... who needs it? We need a guy peeing, drinking, beating his wife like he does ... as he does. We need a heap of non-so-beautiful woman's close relatives ... we need an amateur climax that is incomprehensible to her arabian tormentor ... This movie is so wrong that it is not worth the budget Frankly speaking, I haven't seen The movie that is this bad because American Pie 5. Yup. This is bad. <br /> <br /> I just started watching his "Veronica Foss" movie, which looks much better based on the first 15 minutes (because it has a hint of leadership and an artistic idea, unlike the mess) so I don't claim that Fasbinder is helpless .... but that's .... this movie SUCKS!
