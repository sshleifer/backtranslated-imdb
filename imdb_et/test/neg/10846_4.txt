This film is only striking in its banal and clich√© use. Unfortunately, it was obvious until the end. But do not be mistaken if you think it ended strongly. Slightly unexpectedly, though nothing is worth looking at. <br /> <br /> The silent and false hero, the Germanic wicked, was completely wooden and obvious to the weary team. Two FBI Agents Smith and Wesson (geddit?) Gave hope to humor, but it didn't come. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of science literature, but it's hard to find the quality of redemption in this movie. . Turkey! <br /> <br />
