This is a hopelessly stupid, boring, unimaginable, lazy piece of waste. If you look directly at the video clip selector, it is only fair to assume that the film is a trashy on some level, but it goes further. It's just terrible at every level, a clich√©-driven script that can be incredibly stupid and incredibly boring, as well as the names of the actors and some of the worst special effects I've ever seen. Even movie fans can't find anything here that would make this movie useful for one and a half hours. The plot focuses on your usual group of young people who decide to spend a weekend in a far-off farm in West Virginia, one of which has recently been a member of a group. Unfortunately, the land inherited for teenagers was once a farmer who made sacrifices to help grow their crops, or something stupid about these traits, and now some evil peacocks are killing everyone. I don't know anything about the writer's director Paul Moore, but I assume he's over ten years old and so he should be able to bring out something more original than killer peas. Honestly. <br /> <br /> Special effects that bring peacocks to life are ridiculously bad. They often look like hardly more than Haloween's costumes. Such special effects, as they would have been rather poor 20 years ago, but today's standards, are not embarrassing. <br /> <br /> This is a waste of time for all viewers, whether they are horror movies or not. If you need to watch a movie, rent a "Friday 13" or "Halloween" movie. Most of them are not very good but are definitely better than this.
