What's wrong with CURACAO (also known as LAST NEXT, although what you need to change your name is not a clue) can probably be summed up when a woman tells her lover: "Keep this baby, I try to sleep "<br /> <br /> It is not a dialogue or a problem, but an actor with a Central European accent. There is nothing wrong with this until it appears that its character is from Philidelphia in the United States! What struck me at this viewing was how the accents did not match their characters. Apart from the German accent Philly, we see South Africa, with an English accent, a local police chief, who sounds like he is an Irishman who embodies the Gestapo officer and the worst George C Scott who plays someone who is either a Dutch or British accent; it may be American South African. Soon you will give up on the screen and finally focus on what the nation may be because they are strange. It is interesting to note that this site has not given this film to the country of origin. With so many actors from different countries, you feel that it has been produced by the United Nations. <br /> <br /> Even if you are not curious about accents or dialects, you will probably still have to give up. because CURACAO has a lot less. Things happen like a boat's explosive and hostage situation and a hero who is recruited as a South African intelligence agent, but you've been scratching your head, wondering what the hell is all about.
