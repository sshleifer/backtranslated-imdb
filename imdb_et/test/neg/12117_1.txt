Any night with Jonathan Ross now means my mind is first puzzled and disturbed by carefully selected words that a 78-year-old man on the phone and then indicates that he and Russell Brand should break him and masturbate when he sleeps to apologize for it for making wrong phone calls to him. Kinky! And illegal. For a really big laugh, maybe next time he should try it for someone he knows well, like his boss? Or a follower of Abu Hamza? Would he be amused if someone had done it for his daughter? <br /> <br /> Over the years when I have seen the BBC Star Man Ross talk less than 30 minutes because I find it so uncomfortable, some of the guests I saw were OK - probably most those who ever appeared were all I know. Like a chat show, does it look pretty bad? what's so dirty to ask Tory leader David Cameron about this TV show, has he ever masturbated with Margaret Thatcher's photos? He talked to Gwyneth Paltrow when he just asked him if he wanted him. However, Ross's yob mentality was finally in full contact with the revelations above, and I thought I would take the opportunity to warn the little decent people around the world who might not know how poor this person is and to him and his - if you don't think everyone comedies should be "nervous", ie stupid / empty. We are not all the same here, although the BBC and Channel 4 jetison all standards. <br /> <br /> In October 2008, Ross and other tosser Russell Brand made several Senci Andrew Sachs sexual obscures. The answer-phone (Manuel from Fawlty Towers), it was broadcast as provided by the BBC National Radio against the Sachs' application and then tried to get Sachs grandson to burn evidence when they got charged. A significant number of people here (probably most of those who are not BBC licensees) found it to be fun and / or that the national scandal was overwhelmed, but many people were still wrong and 42,851 complained to the BBC about this incident. . Many of the unfair media fools and others have not heard (and never wanted to) their 42 851 radio programs - using their argument, they are likely to think of an event just like the Holocaust, because at that time few people took the media, and no one of us here should be intimidating because we weren't there. The two BBC producers who were originally involved in the transmission thought it was a "very funny and brilliant" comedy, and only two people complained about the Brand radio broadcast - which I am afraid it only shows the moral level that its 400,000 weekly listeners were with the help of BBC experts. The very moral BBC tried and did not use it later in the investigation of OFCOM. Talk to Aristotle, tell Lord Reith news! The Sachs agent complained to the BBC, but ignored them until Tory's national page got into the story. A punishment for a normal pervert that would do this would normally be sacking and prosecution, maybe even a prison, but although the leader of Brand and BBC Radio 2 were both asked to finally give up on several millionaires, Ross was given a 12-week holiday at the BBC Boss (I think he asked Ross for permission before he could pay Ross £ 15,000 to sue him) to return to the program again in 2009 before his contract expires. All the time to think that his 4,000,000 spectators admire more hitting and / or more offensive witlessness, but at least he could still go to his bank to keep his spirits up. Some people think his position is unacceptable and he can't continue. I think her skin is so thick that the stakes are so big that she returns unacceptably and tightens her vitriol again. (Updates 23.01.09: I just looked at the first 5 minutes of my new series - "The Most Huge Cock" - To Use Your Referral Phrase - Allows You To Continue This Defamation Intact Legal Remedy To Take Public Money But Who Knows: Perhaps In The Future After The British he has been comforted by the film and TV industry for 42,851 moral attitudes and has been handed over with prizes, he becomes a gentleman at his service by the Perversion Government, at least I hope that this couple of nervous deviant will register with other perverse commercial TV and radio stations and stay there, so In 2009, OFCOM fined British TV fee payers for £ 150,000 for this "apology" - thanks to Ross for paying! No. <br /> <br /> Apologists: Get life / sense of humor / sense of proportionality! This is not the end of the world when your heroes are a few talented perverts and there are many r thinner worrying like the price of a real cheese! All in all, the family man Dross: a comedy genius apparently for a million people (especially himself), just a nasty obscene phone caller who gets the obscene pay package from an inconvenient multimedia company to others. So much for our political correctness and respect for society! As you should have thought, it does not apply to the rich and the famous and never, but only to the poor. All in all, BBC: Dazzling Humbongate, Campbellgate, Dykegate, Springergate, Crowngate, Phonegate now with Rossgate I hope his next crisis is Abolitiongate. I also hope that anyone who thinks that comedy should always be challenging and defining, that is, insulting is not disputed and I do not insult my pervert of this particular offense, his perverse programs and his current perverse employers.
