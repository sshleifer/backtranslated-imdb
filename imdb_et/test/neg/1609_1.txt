I start by recognizing that I tend to really enjoy action movies (military or other). I'm a man. But this dreck was terrible. I saw it for free, showtime or hbo and still feel like I'm paying too much. It was a long-term episode of a general hospital. <br /> <br /> I gave it to 1 only because 0 or 0.1 was not possible. How and why 59 others give him a rating of 5-6 in my opinion. Unless they are the entire cast or team family. It may be, this movie was so bad that many rescued ....... and as such they were too tired to disturb. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for repeating, but the 10-line minimum seems stupid because what essentially falls under the warning ......... hopes others will record a 2-hour black hole this film represents. Trust me, stare at an empty wall, they're more action.
