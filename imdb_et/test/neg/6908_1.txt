Hi - usually love movies. I'm 19 years old, I've seen a lot and don't like just one or two. But the other, finished, I had to pull my sister (who wanted to see it) through my hand and I penetrated the laughter tears as soon as I got out because it was such a ridiculously terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Why it was terrible: - all the cows had the udders, especially the bitches who had the udders - no character was unique or interesting, except maybe the main idea of ​​Coyote Dag - see coyotes it is just ridiculous - funny moments are repetitive and simply become sequences to make the last one - the subjects where the work that should have been there was nonexistent. Instead, people get the impression: Well, I'll take it all over and in that case I was happy that my friends decided to bring me back without my knowledge - all the moments that are similar to the lion's king (as mentioned below) were out of the child's movie <br /> <br /> and ... worst ... IT PARALLEL LION KING IN ALL KINDS Responsible father figure killed by Coyotes (Coyotes is essentially Hyenas, with Dag, leader Coyote, equivalent to Scar) chaos, Odis (a cow, though basically Simba) wants to play and is shocked that his father died, believes it was his fault (although in this movie he was his fault, contradicts Coyote and gets his ass instead, after which Dag tells her to leave, and Odis decides to go and leave some chickens and her friends back (of course, she surprises she knows they will help her). <br /> <br /> Other things taken by Lion From the King: stars, t The signs that point to the stars / signs in mystical love, meaningfully circular, how father Ben found Odise and took care of it, and how Odise's love of interest gives birth and has similar experience. Born at the end? GOOD GOD, what the hell ... and even a similar type of music that seems completely at the end, because it is completely different from the previous music. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this first movie I have ever seen where I really are bad guys is getting into - I've never understood what other people have said so far. <br /> <br /> LOWER LINE: Don't waste your time to see it. Make sure the kids don't see it and follow Lion King. Do it, or take them to see Ant Bully, which was creative and artistic.
