The Salena incident is by far the leader Dustin Rikert, the best film that doesn't speak much. In his earlier films (and I use the terms "movies" loosely), the director takes the ideas of Hollywood blockers and seriously marginalises them. Salena's incident is no different. The film is basically a Con Air meeting with foreigners made with the production of your medium film school. The film has attacks with non-focus frames and special effects that have difficulty with most of the high school computer animation classes. For example, almost every screen explosion is the same fire effect that is matured on the screen. <br /> <br /> Weak effects and production value will only be damaged by a faulty primer and a rocky dialogue. In one sentence, the story captures, like the Hollywood clich√©s exhibited. The film begins with the worst CGI alien ship that has ever made the worst CGI land ever made, and the army crew who are going to investigate. In the following, prisoners fall by their blond girlfriends who are armed with silicon implants, prison trucks that carry the worst of the whole country. The prisoners flee and run to the town of Salena, where they come in contact with aliens who ... SHOCK ... has escaped the transport of alien prisons, which suffered the worst of the worst over the galaxy. Prisoners and their captive police, who are only armed with weapons and sad bombs, must fight against aliens and flee from the city before the International Space Alliance * rolls out * bombs the city into oblivion. <br /> <br /> The only real fun part of a movie is when actors (who have been clearly undermined by the script) are given the freedom to improvise and even when they fight the fire of a foreigner with a lesser attack. Other than that, the movie isn't really worth someone's time, let alone the DVD is made. How terrible was that? Let's just say that the Defense Minister is about 90 years old, working in a room that is around 1950s high-tech real estate agencies and wearing a Looney Tunes tie. Yes, if it wasn't clear enough before, then PENTAGON'S FOLLOWING YOUR HIGHLIGHTS ARE ALL THE FIGHT AGAINST AND SERVICE. The film culminates mainly (HAHAHahhaaa said it culminates ...), with the last remaining soldier running into a group of prisoners and guards, and a new set up team is fighting its way out of distant aliens - which strange reason causes them to be returned directly to the alien's ship? Yes ... <br /> <br /> The film has a heart, but it's terribly awful and even worse for the camera to work. Someone needed a serious blow to the bomb and told him that cinematography is more than repetitive, standing, chest images. This movie is not really worth renting (if it ever goes so far) that it is not so terribly bad as the director's latest films, which reduces the amount of laughing, but it is not anywhere near a watchable cinema.
