If my child has asked me to leave this movie, I know it's bad. I wanted my eyes to go up. I wanted to get through the screen and hit Mike Myers to sacrifice the last dignity he had. This is one of the few movies in my life that I watched and wanted to let go if it was possible. Other movies are "Troll 2" and "Fast and Furious", both of which are better than the crap in the hat. this blasphemy is the good name of Seussi. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers tells you to stay with Austin or even wake Waynes World. Just because he worked for Jim Carrey does not mean that Seuss is successful for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
