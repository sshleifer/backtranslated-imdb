Michael Caine usually appears very well ("Blame It On Rio", "Sleuth", "Clue", "Gambit", "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels") or Really Bad Comedies ("Noises Off", "Death Becomes Her", " Harry & Walter Go to NY "). It belongs to the latter category. <br /> <br /> TA is a comedy that only succeeds in two things: it can be wasted cast, which includes Cain, Gambon, and Richardson, all of whom have comedy abilities and are successful in their mission not to laugh at the viewer. There are no really funny moments here. The main reason is a weak script; there were so many pointless efforts to write a meaninglessly complicated story that was just too cumbersome to follow (considering only comedy) that the writer (s) forgot to forget the thing to remind me. is what the whole comedy point should be. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen that Moroni before. Some people even say "if you are a Moroni fan you love this" bla bla bla. Moroni fan? Does this non-descriptive person really fans? Comedy, as it is badly written, because it requires a mega-talent to laugh or two out of it, someone like Steve Coogan and not your average Moron. <br /> <br /> If you are doing comedy participants at least make them the perfect mores they usually have. Caine and Moron characters are inadequately stupid. <br /> <br /> One of the most disturbing things in this inhumane scene is the little girl. Only a truly terrible writer would think that building a gentle script is a wise addition to a super-intelligent wise boy. Smart-a ** kids aren't even funny for Bill Cosby fans. In "Little Miss Sunshine" we had a perfectly normal baby and she was very funny. This stupid creature, an adult shtick, belongs to the centuries-old Marx brothers film.
