"First snow" has an intriguing start. The traveling salesman has said his old fortune to his fortune, which has proved to be amazingly accurate. From that moment on, the movie looks like an expanded "Twilight Zone" episode. I'm not just thinking about car rides, phone calls, and paranoia. William Fichtner gives his usual interesting report, but Guy Pierce is something other than a sympathetic character, ignoring the well-being of other people for his paranoia. The end is particularly weak, but there is no profitability for a long-term target group. Make yourself a big advantage and avoid it. Not recommended. - MERK
