I see this movie as a bad tribute to the old slasher films. Because it does not hold the golden age of the 70s and 80s horrors, this is of course a personal taste. <br /> <br /> This movie belongs to the category "New Generation of Slashers" in my book, featuring typical 18-24 year olds and possible models. I am personally quite tired of this picture in fiction films, at least old films had some variation on people. or several fat people and dorks in general. Just looking for people who of course have a few good viewers are good to have always been there. But if the whole cast is just a bunch of nice shelves and butts, it becomes stupid. I want to look at HOT chicks, but not in horror, which should reflect some of the common people who are going to the woods, such as a knife-holding maniac ... You think people are trying to look at something random people you see on the street, I mean. a movie that just has good eyes, which is fine, but they're not much. "Wrong gear" is one example of the better. <br /> <br /> The next point is to kill scenes In this poor movie, everything you see is 2-3 more high-pitched / shouting and music in crescendo. And that's it. The little you see is not graphic at all, not for people who have seen some horrors over the years. Compared to this, the old school slashers were much more and better for death, blood and gore. Not to mention the killers of those films who have seen it here. <br /> <br /> As for the real horror fans, it's more fun and exciting to look at new approaches because of originality. it jumps, this man's killer doesn't add anything new and fresh to the genre. I have to agree with what someone has said before, CGI is something I don't want to look at. Personally, I prefer this sense in the sense that I am conservative (unless CGI is really well done). But the most important thing is to set a good mood that allows you to get into the movie, a good background story is one very good thing. Too much watching and explaining the film to the audience also takes away the mystic feeling that adds a lot of mood and does not give you much thought. Just like, for example, keeping the background of the killers for the viewer is a complete movement in many cases. I mean, if all the story or the people inside it are explained or shown in detail, then there is not enough talk to the viewer to think ... It's like watching a movie and hoping for a great thing in the meantime, it's a story. <br /> <br /> Why are old schoolchildren still working, at least for some people. The fact is that they are cultural figures created in the age when they were a new thing; The exception may be someone who is naturally newer than such horrors. I've noticed that many people love such horror films, so of course there is no "right taste" for horror movies. <br /> <br /> But for people who can share my opinion; here is the framework you can expect for this flick.
