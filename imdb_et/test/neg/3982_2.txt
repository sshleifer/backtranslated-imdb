This film had a lot of interesting plot about the use of clones and organs, but it fails because the leader's actor is so annoying and I think you want him dead. Not that someone else is very good at it, but if you hate this symbol, which should collect your sympathy, the film just can't work. It seems funny that in the near future there will be a film that has a plot that reflects more with deeds and better pains, although I can't think of anything else, but this movie when I had to watch it. This movie has a very expensive clone that is somewhat clever enough to have something wrong in his camp, where people drive one mile an hour and fight for no reason. The counselors tell them that when they are ready, they go to America, but our "hero" doubts that he is shifting around and learning the terrible truth that is sending him out of the bad guys who shoot and hit him repeatedly. He looks at who the man was cloned. Peter Graves is in it and so is Dick Seargent, but they don't add anything to this movie that looks like television. If on the plus side, when the "island" comes out, the filmmakers can proudly say, "we thought about it first".
