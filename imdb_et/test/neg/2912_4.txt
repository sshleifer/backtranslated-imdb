Let's Get Tough is one of those films that people will probably regret years later. This East End Kids story tells how children want to join soldiers to defeat Japan. Because they are too young, they decide to clean the city out of these stupid Japan. They find one, throw the fruit (without anyone stopping them) and pull a short sword to threaten them! Police officers say he's upset! He's only Chinese! He's on our side! When the children return, the Chinese man is dead! This is part of this huge Japanese and German spy ring! Children take care to stop it at all costs! I'm sure all this was good when it was done (1942), but now it was seen, of course, that it is clearly a product of that time. Full of stereotypes, German and Japanese. It's funny how East End Kids has a black boy in the group, and he doesn't lose. Gee whiz.
