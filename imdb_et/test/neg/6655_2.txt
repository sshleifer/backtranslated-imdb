They give you the settings and carried you to death behind a constant cat and mouse. The main characters participate in one continuous state, where they threaten each other every five minutes or less. And I would like to see the police force, who would let one of his police pull a little bit of Garcia. It's like some local police officers walking out of Charlie Manson's jail. Get real!
