Basically, she's an unforgettable B-film, mysteriously led by one of the greatest talents of the golden age, Fritz Lang. Even if Lang, Walter Pidgeon, Joan Bennett and George Sanders, they are ready for ridiculous events, bad action, obviously fake kits and failure. For the sake of transparency, I have to admit that I am Walter Pidgeon's enthusiastic admirer who was happy to find a MGM in an artificial dream factory in a niche and somehow worked in secondary roles, supporting Greer Garson and others. He is wildly uneven, operating in a drill machine, a 30-Ray Milland's mattress, in a role where his life is in danger, and he hides. Joan Bennett's cockney accent is exorbitant, but his lacquered hair, perfect makeup and stylish clothing affirm the street-smart Cockney slum-girl. George Sanders is not able to act badly, but disappears after the reluctant opening that Pidgeon finds somehow pretending to shoot Adolph Hitler. The surprise of Fritz Lang is the unevenness of the tone. I found this film glowing uncomfortably between the occasional moments of an intermediate thriller surrounded by a frivolous comedian. Hitchcock reversed the relationship completely using a comic to speed up the pace from time to time. There is a reason why the film is not known. It did not serve or advocate anyone's career or reputation and is forgotten because it is a surprisingly bad film from such a generation.
