It's just a waste of time, a waste of time. Today, MTV wraps up a pretty clip for TV movies. My friend suggested this, and I rented it, without saying it, I'm not getting any more of his suggestions anymore. This film shows the use of drugs. The problem is that you really don't care about any characters because of lack of credibility and self-discipline. This movie is literally annoying, looking at the horrible angle of the camera for dialogue and tempo quality. The "digital" format strives for realism but creates confusion. If you want a true range of drug use, check out Dream for Requiem.
