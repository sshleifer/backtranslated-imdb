I was tired of several attempts to sit and watch this program "Gilmore Girls". It confused me that I just couldn't do my finger on that. Was it a young woman who had a childhood life and never grew up? Was that the daughter more responsible for her mother? Was it a rebel's rich girl and her rebellious daughter? What the hell is that? Finally, I just don't care. The cast makes me scream. Writing is not "smart" or "intelligent" that is syrupy and annoying. So why did I watch it? Because I heard so many good things about it and I'm not an opinion until I look. Knee joint reactions are usually wrong, so I looked a few times. When I first looked at it, I saw my mother running around like she was 12 and her daughter, as she was, was 40. Maybe it didn't attract me. I never liked any "Freaky Friday" movie - not to say it's like that, but there are similarities. <br /> <br /> I also have a friend who watches this exhibition every week. So I asked him, "What is it?" Very bright young lady, usually she says she couldn't answer me right away. So I asked the others who were striking it - they didn't even know. <br /> <br /> Gilmore Girls is a TV product that is like an "art house movie". Many of us do not get it, but those who go are desperately trying to find a point where there really isn't one, just "hip". Yes, I find Lauren Graham's annoying Lorelai. The whole hour of it. Wow. And the rest is about as memorable as yesterday's cheese sandwich. The city is hokey, men are wimps, bigger parents are bored and unfortunately I can't find anything by redeeming such a sign and don't care what they do. It's like drying the paint on the wall.
