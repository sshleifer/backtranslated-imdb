The film "The Tempest", directed by Jack Bender (DVD), was released in 2001. It did not reach German cinemas or the director or actor did not receive an important prize for this film. The film refers to Shakespeare's "The Tempest" game, published at the end of the 16th century. The director tried to create a modern version of this game but couldn't do it. At the beginning of the film, the owner of the plant, Prosper, is confronted with his brother Antonio's handling of their slaves. Antonio sets his brother on a journey and tries to kill him, but with the help of a witch Prosper is able to escape and escape with his daughter and slave Ariel, a small island near the Mississippi River. For over twelve years she has lived on an isolated island until her lucky chance to give her brother a vengeance .... If Prosper is happy, you need to find out for yourself. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie is really bad to try to create a modern version of William Shakespeare's original game. The story of the film is both confusing and characters. Prosper does not have the same powers as the temple ..... PART I FINAL
