I remember this movie in the air on holiday in Florida. I had recorded my videotape. Waiting killed me. I had learned about the film because it was reported half a year ago. We came back from Florida 4 days after the movie and I looked at it right away. I tried as hard as I would, but I didn't. <br /> <br /> I am a big 3-seat fan. And so I know quite a bit about them. So it wasn't as I expected I learned something from the movie, and I didn't. I was interested in more images and saw how accurate their information was. There were a lot of mistakes with this movie. Participants, script, reenactments, ALL could have been much better. <br /> <br /> Paul Ben-Victor is an enormously talented actor. But let's face the facts, Moe Howard was WAY at his fingertips. She doesn't look like her, she doesn't sound like her, and she doesn't like her. Michael Chiklis is also very talented, but his idea of ​​Curly was not quite a score for me, although when Curly became ill, he did very well. The depiction of John Kassir by Shemp might have been better. It was a bad impression rather than a depiction. The worst was Joe Besser. They made her thin and irritating when she was. It was just lazy. I don't like Joe's shorts because, as the film illustrates, he never hit. But he was not so annoying and DEFINATYY was not so thin. The best performance comes from Evan Handler. He had the most accurate stooge depiction. Larry's character problem, her hair is too weak and WAY too red. I know it's too technical so I don't read why I didn't like this movie on my list. <br /> <br /> Back Shempti, who is just my favorite stooge. He is written as a whispering, trembling, chicken. True, he had a lot of phobias, but he wasn't that bad. He did not leave the group initially, because he was afraid of Ted Healy, although he did not like him, Shemp left because he was offered a second studio that he simply couldn't get down. Instead of the truth, this film chooses to put her in bed wet, no less for Larry, run into the closet and shamefully worship. Another problem is that Shemp did just about as many Columbia shorts as Curly did, but only one, Fright Night, which was his first short. His career was almost completely ignored. Plus, bad editing caused a terrible and most unforgiving mistake. Shemp was born in early 1895 and died at the end of 1955. Well, here's a hint, it's not 59, like the states of the movie. <br /> <br /> Now for writing what I think it was wrong just because this movie was pulled out. Some lines are stupid and can be developed and / or introduced much better than they were. One line that really got me was at the end of the movie when Moe shows the promoter how the eyes were made. <br /> <br /> "So we do it, we contact the eyebrow bone, not the eyes, really see the movie." This line was badly written and poorly placed in the movie. It's meant to be one of those lines that make the audience say oh! Amazingly, and I'm sure it did with some people, but the end of the movie wasn't in the line. The better place you ask? How about when they first show up in Columbia and introduce them to the sound effects machine. I know initially that there was no sound for the eye, but for example, Moe could have said, "What is it?" and eyepokes Curly or Larry. Then Jules White says, "Are you okay?" or "How did you do that?" There were many wrong lines in this movie, which is a clear sign that the script was pulled out. The second includes the name of Shempk, although it is not so bad, and so I let it one slide. <br /> <br /> What does this film do well? This illustrates how Columbia plots were what they were. I'm not sure if Moe was a mistaken boy, but it was such a dramatizing material that was meant to be seen by the viewer. I know this movie was dramatic. I know that everything is not crisp and clean and absolutely perfect. But some of the things they made and the real things they ignored were in serious conflict with each other. For example, Curly's stroke is not even close to how it happened in real life. I know, I know, dramatizing, but the purpose of dramatization is to make the real events more dramatic. Curly in real life is more dramatic than what they showed in the film. Here's what actually happened. Curly sat down from the chair when the scene was shot, they called him in the final pie fight, but no answer was received. Moe went away and discovered the head of her little brother, half-poor, half-paralyzed, able to talk and tears that flowing on her face. Moe said, "Baby?" and tried to help him out of the board. Poor Curly falls on her knees. Then the ambulance was called. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie was not scary, but it wasn't good or even OK. This film depicts stooge helplessly and inaccurately and sometimes gives drama overboard. This movie has a very long list of inaccuracies. If you don't believe me, check out the list of threestooges.com newsletter called Slaoge. It's about half and a half years long. I can slip some things in the movie. But others were unforgivable. Three Stooges were geniuses and many of today's comedies rely on what they did. Don't believe me? See Simpsone and so on Ren & Stimpy. However, this film does not capture their genius. It is so inaccurate that it hits their difficulties, which is important, but if the movie's title is three Stooges, it must represent their ingenuity and originality more than anything.
