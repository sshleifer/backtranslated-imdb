I got this movie captured on a DVD titled Evil Never Sleeps, giving Carrie Ann Moss a face-to-face billing, but she's so small a character that she didn't really notice in the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I find it one of the worst things I've ever done. The dialogue was stylish and delivery to wood, I found that the actor was disconnected from the plot. Graham's performance for me was someone who wondered if he left home gas at home. <br /> <br /> All in all, I found the painful viewing of both my husband and this movie and this is not a valuable addition to the collection, look at it in danger, but spend 90 minutes when the nails are pulled out, would probably be a better time to spend your time .
