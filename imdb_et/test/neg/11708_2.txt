I understand that a periodic piece is expensive and that this style of photography (camera shots, moving camera, wide-open shots, pulled out) makes such movies affordable. As a style, it has advantages and disadvantages like every other, it allows you to do more time. Like any style, it also has its own detractors and supporters - there are probably even those who believe that this way of taking pictures is artistic. <br /> <br /> If only part of the saved money could have been spent on the script Whatever style is used, the film needs good writing and good action. <br /> <br /> The action in this movie is usually very good. Writing less. It consists of a collection of bits collected from the book, and many that are linked to the chart are omitted, leaving little or no continuity in the collection of scenes. <br /> <br /> When you have read a book, never look at it. If you have not read the book, you are easily satisfied and have nothing better to do, there is no harm in looking at it, but be prepared to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> It could have been so much better.
