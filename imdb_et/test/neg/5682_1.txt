First of all, I have to say that I don't like so much fiction movies at all! But there are some movies that I really liked. This is one of the others;) I have the same opinion as some (most) of others. The film is still on my back, but little effect is enough to watch all the time .... I think the things they have done are animated landscapes with 3 suns and 4 months, but the only one I liked. There are no intelligent dialogues (is there ???). But this is a great movie for anyone who loves Lara Croft or any other girl HOT-PANTS ...;) <br /> <br /> For managers: "Stop trying again, PLEASE !!!"
