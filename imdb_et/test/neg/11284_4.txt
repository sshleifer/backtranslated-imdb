I have to admit that, despite all the media campaigns and being an Oscar candidate, my expectations of the film were not so great before watching it. And I really found what I was expecting; a film that strives to be pleasing to both conservatives and liberals in Turkey, trying to be authentic for foreign spectators and funny enough for everyone. But it is to be understood that it is not possible for everyone to be profitable, which is why the film is an average for everyone. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is spoken within 24 hours. A short story to match the length of a full-length movie adds some scenes without touching the basic story. These are scenes selling ice cream for mostly eccentric local people (ie goat farmers, old women, etc.), each of which attempts to make the spectators interested in comic dialogues. This issue is referred to as a universal problem: the struggle of a local producer-merchant against holding companies and a monopoly, but it was an interesting topic 20 years ago. Most readers in the 1980s remember Ferhan Sensoy's "Hero Grocery Store Supermarket". It was the right time at the right time. In short, this story is not strong and worthy to be in the movie, as it is now. <br /> <br /> Except for some local accents, the cast is so successful. Turan Ozdemir, who has excessive body language, plays a leading role, but it is still a success. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the limited budget is marked by the efforts of the director and the players to clearly film the mood. But it does not bring enough film to compare them to neo-realists or be worthy of an Oscar nominee. <br /> <br /> Note: In real life, the ice cream maker stops his production. and be a dealer of one competitor to the Manda brand.
