The visual and sound exposure of artworks from Kiarostam is a surprise. For a careful director, who is a well-known director for the vigilant monitoring of narrators and people, especially children, questions about minimalist cinematography: why did he do it? Was it supposed to keep him on the shore during the holidays? <br /> <br /> "Five, 5 long" consists of, you thought, five long time. These are (title titles are my own times and approximate times): <br /> <br /> "Inclined wood and waves". The camera is almost still looking at a small piece of driftwood as it moves around the small waves spraying on the beach. Ten minutes. <br /> <br /> "Watching People on a Boardwalk". The camera is still looking at the ocean horizon and boardwalk. People walk around the camera frame, their faces are too far and blurry to make them interesting. 11 minutes. <br /> <br /> "Six dogs by the water". The camera is still looking at the ocean horizon, where there is a sandy beach. Far from the water, six dogs don't do much, just relaxing. Sixty minutes. <br /> <br /> "Ducks in the row, grabbing the ducks". The camera is still watching the ocean horizon near the water edge. A dozen and a dozen of ships flowing from one file to the left from right to right. I assume that Kiarostami gradually released them. The last two ducks remain dead on their way and suddenly rolled ducks quietly from right to left. I assume that Kiarostam collects the ducks and released everything at the same time. It is not the first time he has been dealing with the contrast between organized and incorrect behavior. Eight minutes. <br /> <br /> "Frog Symphony, Oops, I mean Cacophony, a stormy night". The camera stands over the pond at night. This is dark black, except what seems to be a reflection of the moon in wavy water. It's a stormy night and clouds that cover the moon. The screen goes dark. For us, the cacophony of frogs, the scourge dogs, and finally the morning roosters have remained. Hit me on the head when it happened in one key. I saw this segment as an audio composition assembled in the editing room and was accompanied by easy visualization. Twenty-seven minutes! <br /> <br /> Except for the slightly amusing ducks, this minimalism exercise was cold. Kiarostam admirers of no need for a movie. <br /> <br /> I thought I'd rate "five" for five, but four is what he deserves. <br /> <br /> The film is dedicated to Yasujiru Oz.
