Summary: Kid has not been accepted in any college. He creates a "college" where he and his friends can use their parents' tuition. <br /> <br /> Wow. I am awake to ignorance. <br /> <br /> If you believe we are all OK, this movie is for you. In addition, you need to understand that: <br /> <br /> 1. Children get it all inside - they just have to give it out. <br /> <br /> 2. Teaching stops the natural creativity that everyone is born. <br /> <br /> 3. Someone else should pay for you to follow your passion. <br /> <br /> 4. 300 teenagers can live together when you take away the restrictive rules. <br /> <br /> 5. Historical calls are often much more convincing than ready-made presentations. <br /> <br /> 6. If the Education Council allows you to open "Charter Teaching" with "Non-Traditional Teaching Methods", it is because they have close-to-heart interests. (Not that they're ready to go to low-performing students who work anyway with fast food.) This movie is a college comedy genre, ie Animal House. It follows the pattern very accurately. What is still here is a complete attack on higher education, not a parody of bad elements. There is no sympathetic insider, a professor who embodies the valuable part of university life. <br /> <br /> This imbalance makes this movie on the back of Blockbuster. It's so one-sided that I was wondering if this is an ironic expression for the whole genre - about one minute. The film has no deep meaning, no layer or introspection. It's like they let some kids who never went to class do what's naturally going on. And what is natural is the name of the school: S ***. <br /> <br /> (Never thought I'd say: Go see something with Will Farrell. His comedies can be surprisingly complex.)
