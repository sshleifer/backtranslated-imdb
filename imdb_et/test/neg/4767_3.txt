Although this is not one of Miss Davies' very worst films, it's pretty bad. And it's sad that, in a revisionist manner, recent IMDb riders have deliberately swept over the results of some of his films to make up for his past in the past - or so it seems. Over the years, common wisdom has been that Davies was a terrible actor and he only got the roles he got because his beau, William Randolph Hearst, bought Hollywood. This is definitely an image created by Orson Welles CITIZEN KANE. It is true that Hearst used his remarkable wealth and influence to build Davis' career. With all this money it is not surprising that he made some great movies and it is not surprising that people got everything he got. Having been sleeping with a man who finances his films, he has definitely noticed. Nevertheless, he also made a good number of bad films and I think we really need a balance in the price of his films. After all, no rational person could believe that today (1/5/08), PEG O 'MY HEART and two more Davies films recently featured in Turner's classic films (FLORODORA GIRL and MARIANNE) deserved exceptionally high results - they are higher than such films as high level, BEN HUR, THE BEST YEARS OF YOUR LIVING AND ALL BETWEEN SOUTHERN! In fact, MARIANNE would now be 8.8 !!!! Given that most people out there don't even know who Marion Davies was and most of his movies were financial disasters, this is a serious problem! But he was a much better actor than CITIZEN KANE, who indirectly broke into movies before he started sleeping with Hearst. <br /> <br /> What sets PEG O 'MY HEART apart from these two other films is that MARIANNE and FLORODORA GIRL were very small movies, while PEG O' MY SYNDROME is in some sense terrible. The big reason was Marion's terrible mess. Although her French accent, MARIANNE, was lovely, PEG's strange Irish accent - not particularly Irish. In addition, and maybe I am wrong, but his constant use of the word "you" gives him the sound he should make in Shakespeare, not in 1933 in Ireland! It was also a strange requirement that Marion should be a perfect versatile star - so that they had not only action but dance and singing. The singing actually fits the scripts of some movies, but here it seemed uneven and seriously damaged by the film. It just seemed like you almost heard that Hearst shouts "look - he's a great actor --- see him sing and dance". Unfortunately, Marion just seemed uncomfortable and at times in many of these scenes. But the biggest problem for me was playing the 36-year-old Marion's youthful role. It was obvious that the character at the beginning of the film had to be like Mary Pickford played in teenagers and twenties - with pigs' tails and strange attitudes. Miss Pickford can do these roles even though she was no longer a girl. But here, Marion had put some weight and looked at at least 30. Not to blame - he looked good for his age, but he didn't look like a teen! Strangely, when millions of Hearts spent Marion's career, he never realized that the most important thing he needed to spend his money was a good script and one that suited Marion's talents. Believe me, I have rated several of his films very high (especially adore SHOW PEOPLE), but here he just couldn't flop - this film was a turkey.
