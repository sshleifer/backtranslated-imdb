Corey Haim can never be called one of his great actors of the time, but at least in films like "Licensed Ride" he was more in his element ... low humor. <br /> <br /> Dean Koontz's "Observers" book was one of his earlier works and still probably his best. Unfortunately, this is a great story about a brilliant dog, a robbed mutant, and a terrible genetic experiment. Acting is so inanimate, you might think you're watching a zombie movie. Only a dog gives a respectable result and if you want to see a decent movie about a dog, it would be better to look at "The Incredible Journey", "Cujo" or even "CHOMPS" ... okay, maybe not "CHOMPS" <br /> <br /> When you read the book, don't avoid this movie anyway. If you haven't read the book, read it and avoid this movie. Thank you later. <br /> <br /> A somewhat better translation of Dean Koontz's book is a thriller, "Phantoms."
