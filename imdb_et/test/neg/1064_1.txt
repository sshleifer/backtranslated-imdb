There is nothing original, humane, or understandable in this film. Action is average, the pictures are amateurish, there is no fine in writing, and scenes are very basic ... something close to soap. <br /> <br /> In 2:37, a temporary drama of suicide is used to turn on the movie. We look at it partly because we want to know who dies. The different characters have a problem, and the movie shows how bad each problem is for them, but only to get each one to where you think they can kill themselves. Regardless of the different perspectives that the camera has provided on key events, NEVER has any chance of seeing events itself. So 2:37 arsols are arsenals, angels are angels. It's simple things. <br /> <br /> Without creating this complexity, the film will be a voyeuristic story of youth sex and violence. You hardly know the children as much as the breasts, bodies and limps that the filmmaker describes. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you know ALL about the last five years of the movie, 2: 37 is just the immature hangings of Elephant - not meditation, not progression. However, while the filmmaker and the distributor use the friend's alleged suicide to give the film some legitimacy, they never talk about Gus Van Sant or the elephant. IMDb Positive Posts are interesting to avoid mentioning it or simply do not value originality. If you want something with your heart and voice - avoid this youth exploitation. I was amazed at the age of the filmmakers when I learned this after seeing the movie - I had expected the 13-year-old to have done it. The twenty things I've always known are too busy trying to give them a real expression of the old man's work.
