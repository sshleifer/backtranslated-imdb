We have seen such a story as before: in the spouse's marriage problems (played by Nastassja Kinski), she has sex with a stranger (William Baldwin) and then wants to return to her life with her husband and girl. When he returns home, he finds that his wife has finally found a job. Everything looks bright. But Kinski finds that his wife's new boss is actually a stranger who is still interested in him and seems to do something he wants. What to do? Say something? <br /> <br /> I didn't like the movie. Although it was not just bad, it obviously lacked "something". Maybe it should focus more on what's going on inside Kinski's head. Something to say about the actors themselves (I think Baldwin was a good choice for an obsessed boss role), but the characters seemed somewhat stereotypical, acting like characters in movies in their daily lives. In the end, completely destroyed what could have been an interesting plot. , but finally I think it fits much better with Spelling's production. The same goes for music. Otherwise, it didn't look so bad. <br /> <br /> Some might like it, but it was definitely not my cup of tea. To be fair, I usually don't see this type of thriller. It seemed too long, even if it was only an hour and a half, I think it could have worked better than a one-hour episode in some TV series. There was no need for some scenes, especially the shower room. <br /> <br /> My advice: Try before you buy!
