As a fan of Marlene Dietrich's films, I was very interested in this "documentary". I also wondered when I read the rave review after making critical reviews of national critics. It should have pulled me out. <br /> <br /> The film is just boring and probably overpriced. You don't even see Dietrich. He hears in the background, discussing his films and this video. He does almost anything but complains about everything. What a drag! <br /> <br /> The filmmaker, Maximilian Schell, constantly complains about her and asks her to be on the camera ..... all without results. He just refuses to cooperate. After a while, such a thing becomes really tiring. Why should Schell continue his approach to this project? He should have just said that "prima donna" hit. <br /> <br /> Whatever you read, don't waste your time with it.
