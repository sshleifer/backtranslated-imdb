I was quite disappointed. The first Tetsuo made me a INSTANT Tsukamoto fan from the first 5 minutes of the movie. It was fresh, innovative and just ..... different. I like to enjoy the movie on my face and push all those who "shut you up". Tetsuo did exactly where there are few films for me. <br /> <br /> For those of us who enjoy fresh air, those who value those successful styles that make indie movies so worthwhile are likely to be a sign. If you are looking for the visceral feeling of the first movie "HYPER-KINETIC", skip it because it's all removed. Tetsuo II is some strange reason, but a typical Hollywood style action. I was quite confused. But I still think it makes sense for every hard Tsukamoto fan.
