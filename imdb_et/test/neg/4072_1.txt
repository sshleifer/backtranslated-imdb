This movie is so bad that it is worth it. This movie has been out and out of the first ten minutes. It all started when a number of writers came up with the idea that a jetliner would be hijacked and a passenger who could fly on a small plane must land a beast. But they know that this has been done several times so that it is different, we do it very badly! Major Master has his name pirated from the 80's "Live and Death LA from the character played by Willem Dafoe. It recorded 10 minutes at the time of writing and production. Just ask Ronald Reagan, who hurt this point, when Ruskies shot down KAL 007 in the eighties. Two complicated rumble seats, no flying engineer in this complicated plane! Gloria Lynn Berg is constantly hitting the hijacker. just forced to be interested in. Only track 300 feet too short! Four little Bobcats military guys (what do you rent to spend the whole day horseshoe load on the back of your candle) clean the 200-meter wide and 300-foot-long hair through the jungle in 20 minutes! There is no need for a bulldozer here! Where can you find such guys? These men could make a road between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in 3 hours, equipped with a tablespoon, a compass and a duck! <br /> <br /> After this hustle and bustle, the captains will try to punch the airplane heroine. Hijacker giggles itself and unattended can freely do more problems. Finally, he has slowly retreated that I cannot tell you. But can you say Moby Dick? <br /> <br /> There are so many slow scenes in this movie. The wounded master is parked on a plane, while the Masters, allegedly unable to fly, lay the plane 60 degrees and 20,000 feet per minute. The pilot should kiss the ceiling in French during these difficult stunts, but don't move the customs. I think if they had chosen different players to play some parts, this movement would have been better. If we need a toothpick in the film, why not choose a better-known actress Bernadette Peters, who seems to have been constantly complaining? Besides, he could sing and busty well-aging Peters could have some free cracking. Now that the singing angle can be hijacking, let's put the MUSIC movie on the ground! Create a pilot Luciano Pavarotti. They can sing a duet in the booth before hijacking and there is no chance that the tubby tenor will fly to the ceiling when the Masters is running their magic on this big bird. Based on the music theme, the masters could play Andrei Bocell, which Peters can sing on landing. Not only is he blind, he knows only a few words of English. Now that's the plot! Think about the boundaries of your meeting conversation between Masters (Bocelli) and the Air Traffic Controller: <br /> <br /> ATC: "Sir, please turn back to 180, the valves are set to 25 degrees. /> <br /> Bocelli:" What ? "<br /> <br /> ATC:" Sir, fix the spoilers now, fasten the brake pressure at 250 psi. Maintain a descent at 500 fpm "<br /> <br /> Bocelli:" What? "<br /> <br /> The hijacker may have played late by big Rodney Dangerfield, who is able to capture a large number of his lining when he's sitting unbound and Unattended: "I don't get respect. a woman is a group sex. Yes, he spun me before the judge and the jury! "Get the idea? <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE POSSIBILITIES Your movie has your usual crying and buoyant travelers who have never been developed. Woody Allen might have been behind, offering one of his neurotic monologues:" He said I was in bed great. I told him to train myself a lot ... "Now it's the movie! <br /> <br /> According to a similar movie" Executive Decision "where lazy eyes Steven Segal is killed mercilessly at the beginning, giving this film a chance, 747 The aircraft was introduced in 1969, who knows what has been gathered there for almost 40 years? My uncle has old clothes, sled, magazines and all kinds of things. It wasn't cool when Masters opened the door and saw ridiculously eyeed by Chevy Chase's wife housecoat, watching old Super 8 movies from her childhood? Just a suggestion. <br /> <br /> So give her a chance, and if u swim and lose consciousness, imagine how big this film might have been be if I had a hand in this ...
