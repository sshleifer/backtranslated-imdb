Slowly moving amazing movie with terrifying action - but beautiful places and clothes admire, and of course Timothy Dalton, who is doing a tough job, as always. I wanted to laugh with a loud voice - so stupid! But Dalton is always worth watching even in bad movies, a wonderful actor, a parent, but still very beautiful and masculine. This movie is worth watching only to see her .... and she seems to have traveled to a bad dime novel. Your time would be better for Mr Dalton's "Wuthering Heights" in the 1970s or "Jane Eyre" for the BBC version of the 1980s. Poor Sela Ward, so cute, but so tree .... she's definitely been better than other movies.
