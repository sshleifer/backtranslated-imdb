I found this Robin Williams vehicle lightly amusing. I think you would call it political satire. It is about the host / comedian of a political storytelling event that decides to lead the president and unexpectedly wins. and Robin Williams is much more restrained and sedative than usual. I would say the film is a drama rather than a comedy, a little puzzling and suspicious. I think the dramatic parts worked better than the comedy parts and the mystery and the mid-term (although it is a small part of the film) worked best. I didn't think this movie was very high. For me it was 2 hours of waste, but something special. Before you decide whether to buy my voice man, this is 4/10
