I saw this movie when it first appeared in 1986. At the time I was young and enjoyed all the usual comedies, i. Monty Python, Jim Belushi & SNL, Steve Martin, Cheech and Chong, so I believe my rating represents the most "reasonable" individuals. <br /> <br /> The absolute best part of this movie was the trailer that was first played in the movie's "My Little Pony" movie that came out. <br /> <br /> This movie was so frightening that it was from most theaters before the end of the original week. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that somebody would waste a company's money there to duplicate this evaporating human waste. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money to rent or watch this "movie".
