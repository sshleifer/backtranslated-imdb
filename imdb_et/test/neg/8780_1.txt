I remember the very bad press that this film received because the producer court was against Clayton Moore using the name "Lone Ranger" or pasting his black mask on personal performances. In addition to taking into account the quality of the film, it was the absolute height of the eyesight and stupidity of producers and their lawyers. And I suspect that this lesson was well learned after refueling the film, which was widely perceived as being responsible for the jerk responsible for a court order against Moore. <br /> <br /> Recently, it has become commonplace for the legendary film or television project to revive the original letters or letters for local appearances and rightly so. Show no respect, you idiots! And even if they turn to their nose, what has happened is at least a bid. This is a proof of the fact that film producers, studio managers and entertainment advisors are not too foolish and arrogant to teach them as an example.
