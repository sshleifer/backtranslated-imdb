Asia Argento has never made a movie (as far as I know, and it includes films directed by his father Dario), where he is unable to show his entire anatomy at some point. Certainly, in the most boring dialogue, where poor Madsen come to their office and from there, reminding us that although his hair has grown up, he can still hold his fingers every other second (but so randomly, what? Do I really?) I see it? "some way). The DVD box, the package, makes it look like a femme fatale movie, so you wait to see it become an elegant and minimalist killer. He is verbose, hung with some aging and is even worse, he has no other physical agility skills apart from the surprise !, which takes all the clothes off if any scene allows it. His inconspicuous English would be cool if he didn't try to influence it and try to talk like a 12-year-old. How is this plot? Weak minded, but at the same time a nymphomanic woman is suddenly driven to kill if she has another thing going on and working on some cheap drugs ... huh? what? Does anyone have the motivation to do anything other than buying a hamster in this movie? The scenario seems to be oriented, letting everyone talk a lot about the same things over and over again (I was expecting its worst performance to appear as a producer who simply dumped money for the time of the screen) - there are no obvious shortcomings in the phenomena that occur in Asia at any point in the film what the DVD covers. He's weak ... but he knows how to kill. he cuts LOT. She bounces naked, she slips half dressed, she even strikes a dead woman's clothes .. she's very floppy and unmotivated. In fact, "floppy" would have been the big name of this movie. And in the Asian frame that was angry with the cover, there would have been a better representation ... in fact, his eating plane's food !!! What is this? <br /> <br /> The end makes 0 sense - everything is just outrageous to your goal and all goals. Lester's wife does not give any real revenge (taking someone to bad karoeke IS life-threatening but not really valid). Completely misleading key art ... yes, we know that Asia lost its first-born baby's fat, but really, the whole film that tries to pretend it's interesting enough to drive a movie about a passive aggressive chick is not worthy of you. Instead, look at the return point.
