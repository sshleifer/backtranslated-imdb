So this is where Columbia's head of the short topics unit got its start? Yes, it is nothing other than Mr. Jules White, who has been credited (or rather "exposed") to this MGM DOGVILLE entry director. One co-director of the co-financier is Zion Myers; whose name is still unknown to us. Mr. Meyers was undoubtedly the man who checked the four-legged and was responsible for training and "doing". In short, he was supposed to be a dog trainer. <br /> <br /> The short name of this comedy is undoubtedly the same year's THE BIG HOUSE game of MGM. was supported by Chester Morris, Wallace Beery, Robert Montgomery and stars. We must support ignorance of this title; did not see it so far. (Sorry, Schultz!) But there are many dog ​​gags associated with reading a movie *; not to mention a specific character gag. For example, we found a dog conviction who st-stuttered and rightly concluded that a bow-wow actor imitates the actual comedian, Roscoe Ates. Later we checked BIG HOUSE and presto with pain, his name exists! (Brilliant deduction, one suitable for Holmes and Watson!) <br /> <br /> The practice of popular lamp exercises was already a tried and true practice in comedy. This seemed to be a contradiction between major film producers and copyright owners; but rather opposingly got a cup of approval. After all, imitation is a form of supposedly sensual sincerity; besides, every producer would be welcome even with some seemingly uneven parody. ** For your movie, we found it interesting in a sort of perverse way. Seeing so many "Best Friends of People" who are so artificially animated into one, long and boring anthropomorphic gag, it seemed to us who is in the audience very tiring. I mean, how many actions are unnecessarily exfoliating to achieve the "talking" illusion? <br /> <br /> If it is with pet or animal companions, as the politically correct crowd prefers, we are quite eclectic; not only dogs; but also cats, hamsters and parrots. We do not like to see that such a non-funny, extended gaming animal is not seen. <br /> <br /> HOW THE POSSIBLE BASE MAY ALSO Seem Mr Jules White made MGM's shorts in Columbia 2 Reeler's production seems to be not only $ financial; but al $ o Arti $ tic content. We never thought it was a producer-director who wanted luminaires like Stooges, Andy Clyde, and Hugh Herbert, as well as some who had certainly seen better days like Charley Chase, Buster Keaton and Harry Langdon; would be a step kinematically. <br /> <br /> UNDERTAKING We have not yet made our position; we officially create it. So, look at it at your own risk. We warned you! <br /> <br /> NOTE * In both MRs we read great accounts about sending both BIG HOUSE and Laurel & Hardy, PARDON US (Hal Roach / MGM, 1931). LAUREL & MR. HARDY John McCabe (1962) and William K. Everson (1967) LAUREL & HARDY. Both books are our most enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> NOTE ** Prison picture became a genre; all thanks to the debt of a big house. PARDON in the US Laurel & Hardy, Hal Roach and its director first-class looting, the first of many; prison comedy became a necessary topic for so many future funny people.
