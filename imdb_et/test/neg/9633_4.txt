This relaxed and humorous (especially in the light of its relatively suspicious psychology), but amazing and comfortably gentle, this nervous body film outlines the unusually hypnotic presence of Angharad Rees as a young woman, periodically held by Jack Ripper, thus allowing some nervous gorefacts to be placed in Edward's favor. It is all things common to Hammer, but it is dealt with a lot of visual life, even though the central relationship between psychoanalysis between Porter and Rees leads to a narrative without ever being satisfactorily explained.
