That's why this movie fell from its potential (I don't read much so I don't care what the novel was). 1. I think Brendan Frasier copied his Encino man Lambert Tarzan. It was rigid and although his Tarzan appeal was a bit more realistic, he had no humanity. 2. They screws the story. Perhaps this book goes, but as long as I remember, Tarzan's first statements were "Me tarzan, you Jane". Jane is the first human tarzan meeting. I liked a little more than the sparse miniature pigs in the Weismuller version, but these curves and arrows were a bit cheesy. 3. Tarzan is mainly a love story. Sorry, but the interest in love enters the picture for over an hour. It qualifies him for the best supporting role at best. Supporting roles and leaders do not belong to each other, not enough time on the screen, sorry. Andie McDowell's vibe was not only pathetic (most likely because her strong southern accent could not be masked). The chemical weight between Tarzan and Jane was surprisingly 0. I didn't think they loved each other, which made the Belgian dudes close to saying honestly, silly. When Tarzan sees Jane in the jungle for the first time, she feels the desire, if you want, to feel what she has never known before. Jane brings her into humanity and brings out her unarmed side. It's the chemistry that makes Tarzan's story. Not that Lord Greystoke's dying desire is to keep his land as a whole and that Johnny boy does it. Even a good face lift couldn't help this movie. It needs a massive internal structure. Oh, and could we shoot more in the jungle or use at least camera corners that don't show the sound of this place, like its place. Final judgment in 4 out of 10. Sorry Tin-man and by the way, if you want to see real action, let Lambert and Leonardo Dicaprio look.
