Alfred Hitchcock did a comedy of this misleading marriage in 1941, but his heart does not seem to be there. Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery are those couples who discover that they are never legally married and spend the movie on their true love. It has little reputation and is easy to understand. Jokes are familiar with better movies, but they don't gel here. And the leaders are insecure. Lombard's play is trimmed and starchy and twice as sad to believe he was dead just a year later. Robert Montgomery seems to know that he is in the sow's ear and tries to make his accusation a silk handbag without much success. The best performance comes from Gene Raymond as "second man" (he has a lovely drunk). This is one of the few really bad Hitchcock movies.
