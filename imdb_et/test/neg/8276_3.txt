The title of this review summarizes how I feel about this movie. I can't imagine what the audience would be for this thing, not the deadly fan of the 1980s who just had to see it from then on. Otherwise, it will not waste that time. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to most of this type of film: something open-minded is a terrible event that inspires a blood-thirsty killer to go to murderous rampage. I was there, done it. It must be said that none of these 80's slashes were known for their originality, so I don't see the movie's hopping point just for that. <br /> <br /> But if the movie fails, it's stopped and murders. I've seen pretty scary movies in the 1980s, which had a much smaller budget. It just doesn't create a real relationship. Director casts some nice camera corners and some semi-professional directors touch here and there, but they don't mean anything if you are not afraid. Gore is also a real thing, so anyone who looks at these things to see some of the 1980s makeup effects is unfortunately disappointed. To be honest, the main ingredient of almost all the ingredients is the tense pace - you need to move things quickly and keep murder cells at regular intervals, because to be honest, we don't look at these things for characterization and star plots. But because of a scenario or editor, it's all turned off. The murders are divided into an odd interval, leaving us with some long scenes (undoubtedly designed to "character" build) that only serve you and leave you praying for the next killing (which, as I have said,) is usually not done so well. <br /> <br /> In the case of a killer, do not expect anything original or even repulsive. He (or he?) Wears a jogging suit, a fencing mask and his primary weapon is a sword. I bet the writer moans with the thought that he came out with an original, "cool" murderer, but the idea is just as impractical and stupid. The essence of the "whodunn" movie is not much emphasized, as if they had forgotten or didn't care to put red herring in the mix to throw us away. <br /> <br /> I have the sense that the people behind it tried to do something decent and respectable, and sometimes it shows that their intentions were probably a bit more authentic in terms of making a high-quality film, compared to countless other era-exclusion followers. the test is mostly unsuccessful, but still there are some pretty good things (at least for this type of movie). There is a characteristic test, but none of this means anything in the end, so ... Here's all he can do, drag a plot and make a series of murders that they don't get fast enough. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, if you actually got into the old 80s slashers in every way, look it out, just to say you've seen it. or something. We have a very light entertaining film here that does not really impress.
