Despite having a very beautiful leading woman (Rosita Arenas, one of my boyfriends), she is an exemplary and guiding example of what to do while making a movie. , The Aztec Mummy (the real Aztecs, by the way, DID didn't do the grandmothers) has attracted the leading figures and is starting to emerge in the suburb of Mexico during the first film (The Aztec Mummy). In this second part, the leading men and women want to find their mommy and put it on their final holiday home (the fireplace would have been my first choice ...) <br /> <br /> The Bat, a criminal, master-minded stereotype of a criminal genius creates a "human robot" (some idiot in robot SUIT) to control Popoca and (get it) take over the world. The final game between the robot and the mummy is fun, some of the worst choreographies. The funniest part is that this movie was made and published by a serious Mexican film studio! ). You should watch this movie through MST: 3000. Comments are even more funny.
