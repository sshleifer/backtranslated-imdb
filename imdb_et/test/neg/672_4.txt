Leon Shamroy's CinemaScope color cinematography is particularly noteworthy here, including the use of color filters for different scenes <br /> <br />. Alfred Newmann's score must be a sensational and seductive result ever created by Hollywood. It's a shame that it's no longer available on CD. Participants will never rise to this event. The accents are so different, from Ustinov's British and Purdom to Baxter's and Mature's Hollywood, that it seems to be a real hodgepodge without central vision. Tommy Rettig is American. Acting styles range from zombie-like to classy. Only Ustinov as a consensual servant steals the exhibition - what is there to steal. An interesting point is the premise - the story of a young Egyptian physician who has attracted and abandoned - and the parallel theme of the cult of individual Gods - to be tempted by the authorities to persecute. But when the film's plot disappears, it's a haunting music and a visual.
