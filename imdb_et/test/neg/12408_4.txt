When do I sit back after watching Wong Kar-wai's 1994 film "Ashes of Time"? more specifically, re-editing and reopening 2008 with the title of the word "Redux"? I don't know what went wrong. I don't know why the movie didn't work at all. I don't know why the movie failed to get any important points in my book. Especially what was the film that drew it down and made it into the worst film of his career? <br /> <br /> Well, it's not really too hard to figure out. Let me just say that it is really a shame that Kar-wai fell so sharply in this middle and poorness hell-hell, especially since he released the Chungking Express, one of his lasting legends and a totally sublime film that same year. So ?? what went wrong? It would be expedient to regard the ashes of Ara as a somewhat experimental film. Our director puts his own irresistible style into filmmaking and puts it in a completely different environment, mood and atmosphere; what results is a catastrophic film that is all over the place and just doesn't work. So it would be wiser to call an unsuccessful attempt at Ashes of Time. Bold, cruel and innovative, but still a failure. <br /> <br /> Let me clarify. Those who have seen Mr Kar-wai, the author of a Hong Kong-born film, who has appeared in his art house in the world since the early 1980s know that there is an overwhelming aesthetic that links all his films together; in essence and honestly, they are all colorful, thoughtful, friendly, delicately humorous and meaningful about life, love and loss. The same formula is put into the ashes of time; however, the establishment of Hong Kong on a regular basis takes place instead of the land of ancient China and the land of legendary martial arts warriors and clans. <br /> <br /> This quasi-adventure / historical whim is a typical Kar-wai love story, this time involving an elegant strike who has moved to the center of the desert and is engaged in contract killings. But I have to stop there; character description is a useless thing. Why? Because no character from Ashes of Time is worth mentioning or anything. What a blessing and a waste of talent (Time of Ashes includes almost all common Kar-wai companions). <br /> <br /> Not only this, but the movie is a terrible, almost non-existent narrative structure of endlessly incessant rambling. One of the main reasons why timeless ash is driving it is that it does not seem to have any plot, let alone a similarity or a single label. You can definitely see what they get, even the first two, three minutes, maybe less movie. Perhaps it is an atypical environment in ancient China that is unfamiliar and unsuitable for Kar-wai's typical cinematic style. However, I like to think that, unfortunately, it may be that Mr Kar-wai was just here for a long time. <br /> <br /> One thing the reviewer can really congratulate on the Ashes of Time, though this compliment is very tough, is the other director's brand? wonderful, colorful and blissful aesthetics. What a joyful color is made on the screen, what brilliant textures have been painted for us, and what breathtaking landscapes and pictures are for us all over the film. We can at least point out that Wong Kar-wai is still close to the heart, and that is just as atypical a film that is bursting with its traditionally commendable nuances. While visuals aren't enough to completely release Kar-wai from this catastrophic attempt, are they enough to value the movie? and at least we are not moving the film completely and in a strange mood, now that there is something we think beautifully. <br /> <br /> The film is essentially a "wuxia art" film, followed by the legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. But one thing distinguishes Kar-wai from the best of Kurosawa, and that is that in the films of the Japanese director, all the gels sound and just work. There is nothing in the ashes of time. Kar-wai's attempt to make a truly deep wuxia film, not to mention the intellectual and provocative film in general, is a pointless endeavor. <br /> <br /> Kar-wai claims that exhausting the Ashes of Time and that he needed time to clean his head. It must be tiring on his behalf, because his efforts have been included in the film and handed over to us? I mean, watching a movie is a tiring effort, and now I have time to explain my head to this unpleasant movie experience.
