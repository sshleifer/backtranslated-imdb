I was wondering what the organizers of the Victoria Film Festival were about to include this film in their program. I think they have to agree with others who have reviewed this movie. In contrast, I consider this to be the worst film I've ever seen. It starts with a bad script, full of holes and dialogue so unlikely that it is embarrassing. Introduces ideas and then without development. The actor left me completely cold and unobtrusive. The set was suitable for that time, but a beauty nightmare. The only way the characters love this house is that their previous homes were strange. The attic looked at the objects being thrown into the scene without trying to create a real attic that had spam over the years. Photography was leading and different. Save your money something valuable.
