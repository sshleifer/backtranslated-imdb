It is usually possible to forgive periodic pieces that remind us to remind us of important historical events and to spice them up with the love of love to keep the story going. BRAVELE OF THE BRAVE deals with the 18th century struggle for control over Quebec (all over Canada) between Britain and France, with a new America. It has an amazing epic that is enchanting, but unfortunately the writer Pierre Billon (whose script deserves the Razzie Prize in the worst case of the season) and the scattered, unreasonable and confusing direction of Jean Beaudin. - An annoying mess lasting two and a quarter hours of the film. <br /> <br /> Even Fine Actors - Linking Noémie Godin-Vigneau to Marie-Loup Carignan and David La Haye, François le Gardeur Bianca Gervais as Acoona, Honorable Gérard Depardieu as Le Curé Thomas Blondeau and Similar Irène Jacob , Vincent Perez (ridiculous wigs of the period), Tim Roth William Pitt, Colm Meaney Benjamin Franklin and Jason Isaacs Général James Wolfe - don't help. Veteran characters like these have to be the raw lines written for their characters! Cover all the confusion about Patrick Doyle's happy musical score and the result is a long film to be avoided. Sad to say so bad about costly projects but to warn .... Grady Harp
