And so it started with "Shreik" sending a horror movie, then we had a scary film, a really good test for a new genre, a remarkable broadcast. but ... now we have: Scary Movie * Scary Movie 2 Scary Movie 3 Scary Movie 4 * Date Movie Meet Spartans No other movie * plus many more (really funny movies marked with *) <br /> <br /> and ..... Super hero movie .... it seems that the people who make these movies can't figure out what makes the messengers fun. The use of dirty movies in other movies in a funny way is good and good when done properly, but many manufacturers don't know how to do it. The scary movie (1) did it well, the following queues were terrifying because they tried to play the franchise, but it was redeemed with Scary Movie 4. No other teenage film was good because it used spoofes well ... and my credit is sick teen movies. but this movie plays like all their bad version. it is based on a stroke that would even triple, violating Stephen's hawking image, and then when people start to get bored (and manufacturers knew if it is), we will be treated with Pamela Anderson in a tight suit. All in all, scams should be making a model similar to the original film of the original film, rather than plastering the unlawful removal of the movie into a true movie story. <br /> <br /> I despise the idea of ​​"SCI-FI MOVIE" and get my blacksmith knife ready
