I read this movie online and after seeing the generally positive comments he has received and looking at the trailer, I decided to check it myself. What a disappointment! It starts well enough. opening was actually quite tense, but it is all downhill. I see the filmmakers trying to do something different with this film, but by doing so, they all took a look at it. These choices, along with "C.S.I" editing, using music and editing, temporary shortage, intimidation, or humor, really attract this movie. There are too many predictions and many "fine" tips, so when the first twist arrives early, you already know how the movie ends. I gave the movie three stars because I think most did a good job, except that I can't recommend this movie.
