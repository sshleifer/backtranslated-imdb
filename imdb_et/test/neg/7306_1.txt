It was (foolishly) somewhat pleasant that I sat down to see what a friend had promised, the worst / best film experience in my life, a powerful "roller blade 7". 2 years and I'm still in therapy. Oh yes my dear friends, it is really a bad thing. They obviously got about 40 minutes into the frame and then decided to use these materials endlessly and repeatedly for an anesthetic effect on the brain. My only fear of this post-apocalyptic world that emerged in this turkey is that somehow, somehow, the impression of this abomination will survive. Truly living people would envy the dead.
