I'm warning you of people there, it's just a waste of your time. I'm honest when I say it's the worst film I've ever seen. It's just a movement around Christian propaganda! Don't throw your life away, don't see it! <br /> <br /> I think they made the movie so that more people believe in Jesus or something, but it works the other way around. Actors are all beginners, the story is just foggy! <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a fucking job. <br /> <br /> This movie isn't just worth it, so please take my advice and don't!
