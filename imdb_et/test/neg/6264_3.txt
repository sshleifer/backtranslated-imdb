The Slasher Order (fourth film by SLUMBER PART MASSACRE) concerns cheerleaders in the group's nub who are occupied in a snow cab on the snow. Typical elements for fans of heavy fans, gore, nudity for a perfectly free woman, lack of a plot. Although it will end up being welcome, even in short length. <br /> <br /> The original star Brinke Stevens makes a suitcase that seems to be there to add a movie.
