Now I am a big animation fan - I love Svankmeyer and I am usually in all applications of the stop movement, so I had great hopes for it. Then I came to IMDb and stopped it - I always have a real suspicion about movies that have a bimodal distribution of IMDb votes. Here we have another set of 10s (shill someone) and then some real low. I also doubt the word "visionary" in the 10s. <br /> <br /> Of course there are sight stars, but this sign is not one of them. In spite of my doubts, I saw this film and consider them aside. The stop motion animation was okay, but the plots were banal and generally seemed amateurish. Keep a real deal to get Svankmeyer and leave it on the shelf.
