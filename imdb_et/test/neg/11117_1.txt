If you do not know whether the buffoonish Loren C ***** n (Cryptozoology Inafame) is a living idiot and any information it offers, you must throw it out of the trash. The man is just a newsprint cutter. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it was a predictable train wreck, actors were mechanical, lighting was terrible, and props / clothing were cheap. / / <br /> Bobcat Goldwait should have celebrated the clown of this movie. I was physically ill after ten minutes. <br /> <br /> There are crazy / slowed monkeys who still see movies. <br /> <br /> Dan
