Madead scientist Professor Tabani drinks the drink he made in his laboratory, but has instead become a vampire of blood. When Dr.Aqil visits, Taban's picture of Aqil's husband Shabnam sees Shabnam as his vampire. Shabnam is making his vampire and his brother's grave in Taban Castle and killing his brother with a knife to release his soul. Saban manages to put a bite on Shabnam and once he turned his youngster to lure his niece away.KÃ¼la's brother runs with time to end the vampire curse. "Zinda Laash" made me almost sleep. The plot is extremely slow but more or less follows Bram Stoker's famous novel. Gore and nudity. The film is only recommended for curious horror fans who want to see another horror film made in Pakistan (after "Madman" since 1964).
