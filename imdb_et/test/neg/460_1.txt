The alien was great. Many writers tried to copy it. They all did a bad job (or almost). But Dead Space is the worst alien copy. Bad actors, bad special effects, BAD scenario, and other bad things (it takes about 3 pages to say anything bad about this movie. The movie wasn't very long and it's a very good thing You can't laugh because it's too serious ... it's bad because in almost every B-series sci-fi movie you can laugh all the time, looking at this stupidity, just look at an alien or the Horizon event ... they are a lot better! of.
