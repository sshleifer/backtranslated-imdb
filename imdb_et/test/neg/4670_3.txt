I remember that I liked this movie because of the love, theme and director of this movie. <br /> <br /> As I stepped into the theater and stayed in place, I was like a ugly schoolgirl like waiting for my opening scene. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with this opening and felt that I really love this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen a movie and feel that everything that scenes are giving can be seen as a spoiler, please stop reading. I'm not going to give anything really important, but it can be considered as such, so it's a warning. <br /> <br /> The spoiler may be attached below, be careful. <br /> <br /> I think the first scene that really hit me completely ridiculous was the Russian space station scene. I mean honestly, refuel the shuttle without any real prior warning, and then just show the station so fragile that a simple little mistake can cause the whole thing to explode. <br /> <br /> Although all this is possible, it seemed to me that it was up. I'm not sure if it was just a situation or if it was cheesy, a stupid view of Russian technology or just the premature attitude of the scene. <br /> <br /> It only worsened after me, because then we wear what seemed like a 2-hour constant super-abundant explosion in space ... you know the place where there is no sound because it's a vacuum. <br /> <br /> Frankly, it was a weapons scene. (spoiler option) - We see in the movie earlier that Bruce Willis is ripping his land vehicle (a vehicle they use to ride there and help them drill) when he is told that this is what they are doing. She takes off the pieces and complains about it because a lot of what it is is difficult and it is not necessary what they do. <br /> <br /> So when we travel on asteroids, we see that they have decided to add a massive weapon to a vehicle like a weapon ... you know, the standard NASA price is that you have a heavy weaponry on all space powers if you know aliens or anything. <br /> <br /> I could be a 2-hour explosive, stupid refueling of a Russian space station, an end-of-the-scenes love scene, Bruce Willis character is nothing more than most of his other earlier signs, but Steve Buscem goes crazy and takes a space vehicle over a gun place and causing destruction / damage that threw the whole thing on me. <br /> <br /> Save your money and time and avoid this movie. If you want a good meteor film, look at Deep Impact if you want a fun special effects fun movie, see Space Cowboys, but no matter what, avoid this flick.
