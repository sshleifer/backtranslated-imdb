Seek what no one wanted anyone to want. There are obviously too many mistakes in this movie, so I'm just focusing on the actor. Miles O'Keefe would have been more suitable for playing Thong in Asia, mainly because he had no dialogue. Lisa Foster equips her lines with one emotion, boredom. Charles Borremel brings his life to life, stopping every five words. And finally fun, John Saxon-type man ...... no need to comment. <br /> <br /> See "Conan Barbarian" if you need to, but don't waste time on this low - budget loser.
