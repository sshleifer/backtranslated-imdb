Every time for a while I remember that I've actually seen this bizarre fiasco of "What happened to Baby Jane", "Sunset Boulevard", Lana Turner's LSD movie "The Big Cube" and Manson's murders, which happened in 1969. but maybe before the so-called "movie"! Here are some plot descriptions so I won't go for it. But it is worth noting that Miriam Hopkins plays a parody of herself: buggy, ego-maniac, fading actor. Perhaps he thought he was making a movie that was as successful as one of Bette Davis's horrors. The old gal Hopkins never stopped working, so you have to hand it over to him. He shows some meat in this movie, something that Davis and Crawford would never have done. And there's a scene with Miriam in a real sticky Hollywood Boulevard Christmas parade, which must be filmed in Xmas, 1968. Gale Sondergard is old, old, old. It's just shocking how she's wrinkled and terrible she sees. John Garfield, Jr. looks like his father, but not so interesting. I think one of the three Stooges is a guide from the beginning. If it's not one of Stooges, it's someone. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to come into contact with this thing in the form of a commercial videotape that a friend of mine knew all about junk. It's amazing !!!
