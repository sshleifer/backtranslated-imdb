Five years after the US Civil War, the Western people are more concerned about the age of war between home and livestock farmers. Cattlemen flock their products, from Texas to the trail town of Abilene, Kansas. There, cows find homeless not only big money, but also great confrontation. The high saddle Marshal Randolph Scott (like Dan Mitchell) is trying to keep the city in peace. Mr. Scott has experience in mediating between patrons of trawls and salons. He also juggles the best women in the city: the sexy salon singer Ann Dvorak (like Rita) and the beautiful church lady Rhonda Fleming (Sherryna). Boozy County Sheriff Edgar Buchanan (like Bravo Trimble) offers more comic relief than witty help. <br /> <br /> "The Abilene City" begins with some promising symbols and contrasts: the shocks interrupt Scott and Mrs Fleming's singing in the church; then the camera turns to Dvorak sexy to sing the number of his cabin, which causes the man to fire his gun with joy. After that, it will really become quite ordinary Western; it is somehow dusty than it should be, but not quite terrible. Young Lloyd Bridges appear among one of the domestic servants. Dvorak's clothing is the biggest asset of the film; it is a real move. <br /> <br /> City of Abilene (1/11/46) Edwin L. Marin ~ Randolph Scott, Ann Dvorak, Edgar Buchanan
