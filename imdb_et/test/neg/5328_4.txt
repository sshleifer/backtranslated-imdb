I know I loved this movie when I was 12-14 years old. Now that I'm 24, I looked at it again and I wanted me to be. Because all the things I laughed at younger are no longer funny. so it's fun for one and a half hours. For me, the sheep were funny, not funny or just too kids. So the same thing I loved about the movie when I was a kid is now what I don't like. Besides, it's not funny, it's not at all plausible. The nature of the evil is very badly done, but I think it is such a film. And the last 20 minutes of the movie are pretty flat with bad struggles and so on ... But if you're young, you probably love it. I appreciate this movie 4/10
