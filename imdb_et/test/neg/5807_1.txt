Honestly, it can be the worst film I've ever seen. And I've seen Spider Baby and not Earth. Heck I've seen even 200 motels. Having just discovered the Freaks and Geeks series and surprised Linda Cardellin's ability to act, I checked the comments here and decided that it was a try. This is the last time I ever hope for an IMDb review. I didn't know that MORONID wrote IMDb reviews when they were waiting for their calls to be answered on AM. <br /> <br /> This movie is so far from bad that mere words can't express the mercy of their vomiting country. Seriously. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you think Will Farrel is really funny when you think Adam Sandler is a comic genius. Watch this movie, but DO NOT MAKE!
