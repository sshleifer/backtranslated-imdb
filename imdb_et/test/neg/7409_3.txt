This is Jonas Quastel's debut as a director and frankly. He seems to have scored every type of cinematic art he was studying in a film school to try to add a poorly written script to the style he helped write! The film is Lance Henriksen and a group of others who are looking for an aircraft in the Northwest Pacific that fell into his daughter and also a special machine he has built to want to download. The first 5 minutes of the movie are blurry or shaky or out of focus! Quastel tries to capture the "Blair Witch" mode with these types of shots and they grow very fast. And there are also POV shots that are directly "Wolfen" and "Predator". These shots are from the Sasquatch perspective (POV). Editing is uncomfortable from time to time because the scene seems to be shifting right into the center. I've heard that this movie was shot for about 12 days, and I think that instead of going back one, they just started again without stopping and changing the scene together. And the rest of the movie is fade-out from one scene to another. They are so many scenes that disappear that I lost. Now, naked scene with Andrea Roth. He's not her. you can easily see this body. And you know you're watching a bad "B" movie, when in the middle of the Pacific Northwest, the hot chick decides to go to the nearest hot spring and swim! ******** SPOILER ALERT ******** <br /> <br /> And Sasquatch itself is not bad if you don't really see him and he's just a tree behind some trees or shrubs , but when you finally see him at the end, you are naturally disappointed. First, he's not that long. An actor who plays Sasquatch is only hairy in certain parts of his body. Its a partial suit! And he's bald! I've heard that a make-up person died while filming, and maybe it explains why the costume rushes. Some of the sound effects from Sasquatch are something other than the familiar lion we all heard about. I have to admit that Henriksen is not bad. Yes, he works with bad material, but he has one interesting face that really boosts some movie moments. People say that a good Bigfoot movie has never been made, but I disagree. I've always said "Black Lake creature" is a good movie and I highly recommend it. I'm a mammal in Sasquatch's movie, but it's just an amateur.
