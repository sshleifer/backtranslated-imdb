Oh my God ... where to start? "Chupacabra Terror" is one of the worst ever made B-Horror movies. This joke makes "Demon Slayer" look like "The Exorcist". Special Note: Horror The B movie must have at least one sex scene. Don't wait for a hot girl in it. With this infallible error, I should start with a full bash. <br /> <br /> First of all, if you are going to make a horror monster movie, you should spend a large part of the budget to create a cool beast monster. This movie looks like a $ 10 Halloween costume. Chupacabras is in no way (yes, it is how it is written) threatening in the movie It is an actor of Halloween clothes, it seems so cheap to make me crazy Second, gore effects are the backbone of any of the monster Horror films. damn fake! Please take a closer look at this man who will be into two parts. This is probably the best scene in the movie and lasts for about ten seconds. The end is a very bad scene that will not leave you alone. <br /> <br /> Action is the last thing what you should be waiting for in such movies, but this movie is terrible, casting non-experienced noblemen fools for about 85 minutes. d SWAT members that he is ill. The cough he fakes is ridiculous. He's probably the worst actor in B-Horror's movie ever. Captain Pe√±a also gives a terrible result in the first ten minutes of the flick. <br /> <br /> The real story behind Chupacabras hasn't even been said. All you know is that the monster sucks the goat's blood. Why barely this chick? Plesae, don't even look at it even if you have the chance. Not even when it happens via cable. <br /> <br /> I usually support low budget horror movies because the people who are dealing with them are trying to do something at least like Hollywood, but that doesn't mean that Horror fans like me should accept such garbage.
