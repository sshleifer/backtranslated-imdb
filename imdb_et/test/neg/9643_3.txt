The story is not very strong. Don't wait for a "Bourne Identity" type movie. It started with a strong talk of Tara from Russian and even sounded reliable. (Not that I'm a Russian expert.) In Moscow, this darker depressing look that gave this film potential, I still believed it. It only took half an hour to see that they actually left the place. Action was bad, perhaps because the story itself was not very strong. The movie has the part where Gordon Patrick (Nick Moran) is talking to C.I.A as you listen to the Chinese sync. W.T.F!? Too bad that the writer did not even make little effort to give the depths of the main characters. It is also a cheap and easy end. <br /> <br /> The plus point is almost every scene where Tara Reid is. Not that he is doing well, he really isn't. But she looks very good in this movie. In general, it was a little disappointing. Rental Material? Maybe.
