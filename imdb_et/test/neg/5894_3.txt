We never know the truth about 9/11. And this dirty movie proves it. <br /> <br /> I recently watched a YouTube report claiming that there were no planes involved in destroying the Twin Towers; that all the news programs were allegedly equipped with the same angles from the Towers' mysterious source (probably gubmint?), in which case CGI planes were replaced with real life MISSILES, which actually hit the towers. <br /> <br /> This is a convincing video, and although I am not the theorist of the Wacko conspiracy, I am still not sure if the actual planes hit anything on this day (towers, Shanksville Square, Pentagon). because the airplane cannot be used. (And what are their notorious "black boxes"? No one recovered.) Millions of other theories are abundant, all of them encounter speculation in the ocean a little truth. But you drown in malarkey before you find something real or worth speculating about 9/11 COMMISSION REPORT, a no-budget movie that tries to close the barn door after all the horses and jihadists have escaped. <br /> Writer-director Leigh Scott is obviously an American citizen who wanted to enlighten the audience about what a 560-page report can publish. It would help if his film had actors, not a man who looks like David Duchovny, a chick who looks like Gina Gershon, a man who thinks he is Russell Crowe and another man who I am pretty sure to try to be Sean Beani. This would help if his camera operator had no Parkinson's disease; if the lighting driver did not try to save electricity; it would help if his editor had no disorder of attention deficiency, or if the soundtrack was not an esoteric order of the inefficient world order; and the loop should probably be inserted when people actually moved in the mouth. <br /> <br /> We can't even name this propaganda. It's too funny. And funny, I mean it's complicated. <br /> <br /> You can't squeeze this complex problem into a two-hour movie, but Leigh Scott will try to buy any weapons from Somalia, not - anyway, including all the sexy statements we've grown to: bin Laden's intention to attack. Aggression Agreement with Iraq, Mussawi Attending School, Weapons of Mass Destruction ... <br /> <br /> The problem is: we know it is all retrospective, so every discussion that the relevant intelligence services have has one another with all the cumbersome conversations being counterfeit. Like the opposite of reverse technology, all the things involved are briefly mentioned, so we can shake our heads when the incompetence of all these areas of government is incomplete. <br /> <br /> There's a ridiculous interrogation scene with a sliding bimbo. man with his face in tomato sauce. Now - it would be considered torture if most men didn't consider it turned on. <br /> <br /> The tag is: "What if the attack could have stopped?" With this movie account - and we expect the Commission to report - the CIA and other underground agencies tried to defeat bin Laden and not. Anyone involved with "terrorism" reports (you think you're actually reading these reports?) Is so worried that we just want to hit them for their bad actions. <br /> <br /> But the whole story goes as deep as the banal soundbytes careless Ku Bush Klan fisted to the American people after September 11th. Now we know that even if bin Laden was not caught before the September 11 attack, nothing would have changed or been achieved - the wheels were moving with or without the Taliban's head, whose involvement was possible if someone had uncovered the imagination to unite America against a common enemy. Contrary to popular belief, "they" did not attack us. As Ron Paul tried to explain, it was a case of returning to the Middle East - "they" were so ill in America that they planted their incredible legs "there" that they brought the war "here." So, if George W. Death likes to be meaningless, "We fight with them that we should not fight them here," in reality, "As we are over there, the fight has come here." The September 11 attack was not so much a matter of complicated planning of terrorists. , because the busy negligence of the Bush administration, which we know (without commissioning the commissions), was the entire Clinton administration; information about terrorist cells that reach critical mass and their intent to cause chaos. The Texas oil dude, who refused to read his daily presentation, and rather broke his Crawford ranch when he spent one extra day at work, canceled the commitment he swore to protect the American public. <br /> <br /> And then he tried to use himself as president as a result of his negligence as a political hammer against his own buggy countryside to gain a second term, crush the American Constitution and take America into a false war against weapons of mass destruction (WMD), where the country had nothing to do with the September 11 attacks. Strangely enough, the film never moves close to Ku Bush Clan, providing an opinion or judgment, Leigh Scott, who wants to remain neutral. Tell that hundreds of thousands have been raped and kidnapped by the war on terror in the Iraq war. <br /> <br /> With pure coincidence I realized I was watching this DVD when my "Bush was lying." t-shirt.
