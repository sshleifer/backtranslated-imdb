It's his worst Wes Craven! this is the very worst horror, if you can call it horror, you ever look, no matter what horror master Wes Craven, poor direction, bad behavior, bad set, bad atmosphere makes it the biggest garbage! a bad boy is completely convincing, you couldn't even apologize for the boy! the horror and horror of the movie is ridiculous, it's just plain! the only good points I think is that he celebrates Natasha Gregson Wagner, Giovanni Ribis and Lance Henriksen, but not even it could be stopped by control and one of the worst horror. If you still don't look at it, don't worry, you hate it.
