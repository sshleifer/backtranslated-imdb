Ha ha. - Oh no - what to say about this movie? Yes - green eggs and ham are more meaningful than this film. Where does one begin? A lot of good things have already been said - so I will not publish the same territory. I believe you already have a movie summary - so I didn't redefine the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all - let's start with good. <br /> <br /> 1). If you like a psychological thriller that makes you think (as I do), the first 29 minutes of this movie is for you - this is one of the films that illustrates what you always say about longer cars if you were kids (which then if you had to choose a family member to live, die another or if you were to die due to drowning or fire) This movie is a great concept - the bottom line. <br /> <br /> 2) The wardrobe team did a good job back in the 70s. But how real is it? ..... Okay, that's all right. Let's talk about bad. <br /> <br /> 1). This movie looks like a 2-hour "Twilight Zone" episode. It can be 90 minutes. It could have allowed the movie. <br /> <br /> 2). Do you remember the movie "Dusk til Dawn?" The movie started to be interesting, then halfway through the movie that just humiliated it? Yep - the same thing here. I would like to say that the writers started with the concepts, then there was no idea what to do with it. I'm deeper thinking about provoking transformers 2. <br /> <br /> 3). Yes - we get a dilemma in the movie. We understand the philosophical foundations and the utilitarian approach - but the story jumped too much, did not clarify the current story and took (forgive me) a completely offensive direction. <br /> <br /> 4). The end didn't make sense. Not at all. None. <br /> <br /> This film would change the college philosophy 101. If you want to get rid of your mind, you are sick in bed or have ever seen a face with a pie, and you can watch it free on the internet - all the way, go to it. <br /> <br /> If you have to pay for watching this movie, don't waste your time. Howie Mandel stands on You Tube. You will get more philosophical stimulation that organizes your drawer.
