When writing this review, I have difficulty writing what to write. Nothing happens in this movie. The story is a South Asian woman who falls for English in London. The problem is that he and his friends are racist. At the same time, his friend is unaware that he has sexual relations with his brother and that it is just expanding from there. The problem is that this movie is very predictable. As soon as all these things have happened, it's all pretty much standard. It pulls a little, though it's only about 90 minutes long. It's more of a Chick Flick than anything else. So if you're a man, I don't recommend this movie to you.
