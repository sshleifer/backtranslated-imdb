It's just one of a hundred million movies where directors try to put too much drama into a movie that isn't dramatic at all. As in the beginning, the part where the monk monk was carrying the arrow, shot the same arrow five minutes later - no point. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was worse than the plot's line was CGI, which would compete with a very own homemade flash movie. Actors look like they are doing their hardest to portray a number of 70's robots; The dialogue makes so little sense that it is not funny. <br /> <br /> Many things are just HAPPEN, without explaining how or why, like a woman who suddenly wanders around a zoo that was closed hours ago. And when he sees that he is driving to him, his first reaction is to take pictures rather than what he does ten minutes later - the power-walking (not even running) depended on, as his life probably isn't. <br /> <br /> Generally not recommended. Wants they did some new MST3K episodes.
