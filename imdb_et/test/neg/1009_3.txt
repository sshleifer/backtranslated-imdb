This movie was not reliable for two reasons. One, not the metropolitan mayor, and New York are certainly as big as it gets. Allow your town to degenerate into such a violent residence; especially for voters who could say a lot about their future reliability. All the victims of the film were mostly elderly, Jewish or defenseless. At the age of 62, I have never seen a film that depicts such a complete lack of respect for authority as this film did. Even "Escape from New York", which was fictitious, in front of them, ie they said it was science fiction, did not use such deep violence. In this film, most of the older victims were sacrificed and still had weapons, but they did not want to use them. Also in this movie and I haven't seen the previous two, is more legal than the "Escape" movie. Second, gangs, as far as my research shows, have never been as cooperative as this film does. On the one hand, they catch a gang member from another gang who works in his area and is killed. Yet, when the heroes begin to shoot in the local gun, the next gang is over open arms. Outside the gang members are always viewed outside and stopped. We should believe that when automatic guns are used against our gang, other gangs want to be in it. Why did the outside gangs get help? I believe there was more than one gang from outside. What did they come up with? The second question is why was the gang leader in prison and why do the prisoners' prisoners ask for their permission to attack the Bronson character? It wasn't a great movie and I can go on, but I don't want to.
