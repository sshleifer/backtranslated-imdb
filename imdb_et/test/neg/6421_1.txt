Holy God! This movie must have a new classification on the cover: "look only if you have nothing else to do!". I am disappointed. I waited for a good horror movie over the weekend ... I needed the speed of adrenaline and that awesome tingling that went under my spine. But this movie didn't do it. Reasonably good story, but pretty terrible action, dialogue and filming. It was separate and sometimes completely silly. We had actors who looked at the wrong direction of the camera, the people who spoke aloud (by themselves) and told what they felt and what happened, the shadows of the equipment in some shots, the foolish clich√©s like "I just need to keep me" in the wrong place and situation. Thank you for letting me unload and apologize when I insult someone, but it was a waste of time and money.
