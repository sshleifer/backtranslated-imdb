I rented this movie because I'm a big Dudikoff fan. I thought it wasn't that bad. The boy was wrong! At the 15-minute mark, I started giving others to allow me to rip and rent the DVD, but they refused. They swore to get better. <br /> <br /> They were wrong! That movie was missing everything. The actors gave their lines as much emotion as the cloak stone! The plot was ridiculous and I was insulted that Hollywood thought people were stupid enough to enjoy it. No characters interact very well with each other. Ice-T gives one of its worst performances here. <br /> <br /> After looking at the wrong plane, the bad guys who are standing to get off and the clips are empty and missing everything, I wanted to shout and shine on the concrete. The film hit its plateau of ignorance when space station people used a lift to travel. Space suits are not necessary and there is gravity in the room, no matter what real astronauts can say. <br /> <br /> I didn't finish this movie and hated it. I don't want to end this movie. This is a slow suicide. I can feel my brain cortex to plan to get this torture.
