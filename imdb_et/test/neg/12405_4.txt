Your ability to enjoy Time Ashes can depend on our expectations before entering the theater. Even its most prominent supporters seem to agree that the audience can be shared in the middle of this unique film. <br /> <br /> Unlike most HK makers, the battle scenes are kept far away. When they happen, they are fused with a style where it's hard to do exactly what's going on on the screen. Dramatic scenes can be extremely beautiful, along with Maggie Cheung, Brigitte Lin and HK's role as top performers, who are looking at the landscape. As with some of Wong Kar-wai's early work, dialogue can be more accurate. In short, the ashes of time need a forgiving attitude. At the same time as Wong Kar-wai's excellent success with Chungking Express, it is clear that the director is not so sure he works with the elements of the martial arts movie. Anyone looking for a tense activity is likely to be disappointed. But those that are interesting to the director's aesthetics are likely to find at least a unique experience.
