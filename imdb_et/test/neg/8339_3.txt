When I saw this movie, I thought it was a disaster! No, I'm not talking about a volcano, but about a movie. I've seen a lot of movies, but that's definitely one of the worst. I don't care if L.A. a volcano erupting under the city center is possible or not. Maybe it is not, but even if it could have been a good movie ... but it is not sure and I will explain to you why. <br /> <br /> I don't know how much of a stage flows from an average volcano, but what I know is that the volcano of this movie makes Vesuvius, Mount Etna and Pinatubo together, like a small grill. I don't think the volcano has ever flown so many blades as we can see this movie. I'm sure the director had a lot of money to spend on his film, but I really don't know why he spent it on special effects, not on script and actors. I'm not saying he should have been working on the top story, but it's really the opposite of what I would call a well-functioning one. Their performances are so incredibly poor that it makes the whole film even worse. <br /> <br /> And what's wrong with the script you probably ask yourself. Well, do you tell me who comes up with the idea that people stand a few meters away or even a few meters from the lava without burning or having to hide? Or will people fall on the ground if the stage flow is not even two feet high? I'm sure I wouldn't be proud to write such a script, but probably Hollywood script writers don't believe in credibility when it costs good money! Very good money !!! <br /> <br /> When you see a movie, you probably agree with me that this is one of Hollywood's worst catastrophe, which is not worth more than 3/10.
