My mistake was that it was a serious war-hell movie before it was seen. It all ended with the movie "MTV" logo appearing in seconds. It can also be called "National Lampoon's Sexy-N-Loose". And it played the "MTV" crowd; the movie that followed those comic first seconds played like music videos they played 40 years ago. At least Disney was smart enough to send Rated R stuff to Touchtone and let us take it seriously. Okay, I'm tough; it wasn't so bad for the movie. However, its share is superfluous and the film is extremely biased / unilateral. Of course, I'm not a buff movie buff. I can't watch Plato, Full Metal Jacket or Private Ryan more than once. Of course, they were good movies, but they are not my forts and they all look for some time where I couldn't distinguish. After an excursion in Iraq, Phillippe is planning a life after war, but has been withdrawn due to his contract term. Or at least this is a military plan until it goes to AWOL and the speed of the characters breaks a few bucks that have been caught astonishingly. No, I have not been in war or in Iraq and do not agree with it. I also have no knowledge of recruitment or signing contracts. I can say this: although I am sorry that they are retreating in this conflict, I cannot feel that someone is so stupid not to read fine paper. It's like someone in your dead chamber, tend to read the surgeon's warning to the cigarette box and say, "Oh, are they? Deadly?"
