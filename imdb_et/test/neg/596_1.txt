Evil Behind You, created with the purpose of writing a writer / director for a personal viewpoint who can walk on the water or who knows the devil. Unfortunately, it seems that the creators were so focused that they stressed that they took their power completely, forcing their point to the viewer. The way his message is presented reminds me of the story I have heard of the Spanish Inquisition! From one true Christian to another, avoid this as a plague, the tactic of fear never works by sending such a message! <br /> <br /> Operation was terrible, the choice of Muslim terrorists was racist and unfair (they are terrorists that they must be Muslims). The assumption was good, the story was an excellent channel for this message, but it was short to complete these ideas, making it very difficult to even leave the message of the message. <br /> <br /> You'd better be pollinated by your dust-removing DVD to get Mr. Swayze to receive this message better. at least this film did not try to put itself down. Or if you like good Christian movies with a powerful message, try the end of the end
