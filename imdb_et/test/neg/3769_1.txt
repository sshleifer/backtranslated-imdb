At the peak of impatience. Somehow I was just a little interested, but it was because I really wanted to know what was "secret" (which should say that it is obviously understandable) or that I hoped Scarlett Johansson would put on sexy clothes? This film is poor and it is still shameful for all lonely, alcoholic southern professors of literature. Travolta wants his Oscar to be so bad that he is crying in the bathroom after blood is urinating. Sorry, sir. . . you were more believable in "living." Not everyone can pull Peter Fonda's "Ulee Gold". If you want an opponent of the type of brave anti-hero Oscar you need, you actually. . . not limited to screen. Stop this director until he (vague about the gender) redirects!
