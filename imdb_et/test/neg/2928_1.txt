Can this movie be considered a movie? Imagine a situation: somebody puts a tripod and a seaside on foot and a movie that walked or runs. Then he places the camera on the beach, buys some ducks from the pet shop, opens his cages and lets them drive in front of the camera. Later, he films the surface of water and the sound of birds and insects in absolute darkness. Is it an ordeal or just an insult to the audience's intelligence? What would happen if an unknown director had made such a film? Do we celebrate our work with 10? I am always disappointed by the directors who believe they will get everything they want by becoming famous.
