Is it possible that the film will get worse? There are a bunch of chains that are circling around, babbling b ******, acting supposedly stupid, and should we laugh? There's no plot here to keep you first. Even when women finally appear, there is no sign of healing; the most anticipated things happen, and by the time the movie is over, you can be asleep. Caution: It's not a tough cult film, it's a trash bin! I can't believe there's even a sequel! <br /> <br /> 1
