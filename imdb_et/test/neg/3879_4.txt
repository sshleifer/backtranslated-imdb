Bhagam Bhag was a waste of money and time! I don't know if Govinda did this movie? Govinda ... dude ... m your big fan, u have to make the right decisions when choosing a movie? I don't know he had any role in this movie. The role of Govinda could be given to Johnny Lever. Akshay Kumar steals the show here! Akshay ... dud u rock! u have created a space in the heart of the world! Lara Dutta, Tansuhree .... u boys deserve better. Paresh Rawal is good for his wise! at all, there was little scene where I laughed, otherwise I just thought that "the devil made Priyadarshan such a stupid movie?" Anyway, wait and see the upcoming movie.
