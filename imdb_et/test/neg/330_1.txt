Man, these films suck. It seems that seven different plots are taking place at one time and they all made little sense. Special effects, costumes and all these things were terrible. Operation was exceptionally bad. Everything seemed so compulsive, especially women with big eyes and small children (her "Noooooo", as she was buried, is so unenthusiastic it ridiculous). A good part of this movie is pretty funny. The death of a woman, where she cuts a knife into a toaster, becomes an electric shock and magically becomes a tougher carcass of the world, my friends and I smiled for ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: If you look really horrible movies, look for it. If not, run your life.
