I think I've finally seen my last movie, Woody Allen! I read the newspaper review and went to see this movie, assuming I had a good Woody Allen experience (as I have been several times before). It wasn't like that. This movie has nothing to offer. Even the talented Sean Penni with great results - this movie didn't work. One of the features of his other films is several characters - diversity, clever dialogue. This film consisted essentially of only one label - very one-dimensional. It didn't laugh almost. Apparently it seemed good on paper! I think the only special thing was Samantha Morton's performance. Now I'm looking for her movies in the future. Therefore, this film was a great disappointment. >
