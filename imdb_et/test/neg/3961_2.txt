The dog can act ... unfortunately no one else in the faux children's films of its varieties can. The stray, but very smart dog puts himself in the lives of a two-mother child, with the bitter and cold heart of his father. In what can only be described as Dickensian, the evil widow forbids her children --- who may be spiritually challenged - to play with Benja. Neither kids nor Benji follow. Soon children will be kidnapped and Benji will have to help the police find them. This is only when the old man realizes that Benji is good, not bad. <br /> <br /> Tom Lester, whose only previous experience seems to have played in the dark Eb with green ACES, is played by one of the robbers. So, unfortunately, overwhelmed by Deborah Walley. Walley's previous screen triumphs BEACH BLANKET BINGO and shameful BIKIN WORLD. He played both Gidget and Tammy in the past trying to lose the reputation of his good girls. <br /> <br /> Stop BENJI ... he is a dog and this movie is a dog!
