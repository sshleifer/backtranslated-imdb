This movie is so much about it. Prehistoric society, adventure, romance, true brotherhood, violence, sex, religion; all depicted abundantly ... without proclaiming one word !!! And how is it so bad? This film makes you think about the origin of humanity. If this were the result of anthropology, you would rather faith in Darwin's theory and hegel's synthesis all together. You can't look at it even when your brain is closed. And now you're thinking, "I have to see it." I warned you. I assume no responsibility if you regret spending hours of this hour. I warned you. It must be forgotten and buried forever.
