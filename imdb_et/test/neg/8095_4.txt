Most leased this movie to watch Shannon Elizabeth. He played well in this movie, but the plot was lucky. The film was not really about trying to stay one after the other, when one of Jerry O 'Connell's friends marries. Other friends put that money together and who is the last to get married to all of their friends. Anyway, it's just trying to follow the film by doing it and trying to make it funny. I'm glad I paid only for .50 for this movie. It wasn't good at all. I rated it **** out of 10 stars!
