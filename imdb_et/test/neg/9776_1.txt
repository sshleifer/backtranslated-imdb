*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Some ponds of Afrikkaner-Hillbilly are in the desert looking for Diamonds when they find a hard hill in the middle of a sandy desert region. Spoilers: The darkest will start to glimpse, and it will open. Then he looks at the hole and stays with his head and SURPRISE! something eats him. The other two dimwits are not alive again. Scott Bairstow looks like a Pizza Delivery boy, but he plays with a medical graduate teacher (which means he should be at least 35 years old). Bairstow should join Camp C and help them find diamonds. The truck that is transported to Bairstow's C camp is a handful of strange things that usually populate movies like "PITCH BLACK" "THING", and so on. The truck is going through the first truck and they decide to explore (how did the truck not see another truck when they were driving Bairstow because they were driving the same road?). So they find the eaten bodies and have some decent special effects associated with bones with small pieces of meat. The main deadly group in the Cup will decide that they have to find a killer. So the truck travels in the desert after some trails, and finally it has an electric short and the team is stuck in the desert. The stupid guy in this group had pulled his cover to wear them. When he takes a sleeping dove (wearing the same jacket), the creatures eat him alive and the other man runs over and stays in his arm and this dummy loses his hand. Until now, except for a few minutes later, Dr. Bairstow realizes that the creature is really hundreds of thousands of ants using bones to save each other so that they can travel to the new hive (because the miners opened up the old hive). Now, the last time I checked, ants could move independently without killing people to use for the bone structure. If all they needed was something hard, they could have put a bundle in the sticks and used them to create the form. The whole story is really, really stupid and the antenna explanation is the only one that is given. The rest of the movie is about killing this group until they find a new antenna slot, and kill the brain-brain (sorted) and hundreds of thousands of ants are walking their own feet. A back-brain brain (camera) is found and sent back for analysis, creating a sequel.
