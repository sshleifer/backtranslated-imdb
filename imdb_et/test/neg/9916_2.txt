I hope that Matt Dorff's original script for this was much better (there are signs - a dialog that should be done well before the big f / x scenes (for introducing the characters), which would make sense much earlier, is stuck later. Maybe the original the length of the script was longer, but maybe not - in any case, it repeats - every character is uninteresting and * everyone * speaks about exponential parts as they would speak the word of God. Characters that are fully exposed - Dianne Wiest's "secretary Abbot" is just terrible, explaining things to his assistant (and, among other things, to us) in endless speeches that no one would say to anyone in real life (if he doesn't explain things to his assistant, he already knows that his assistant explains to him what he already knows. which is completely one-dimensional - dude of an evil power company, a pilot who just CANNOT focus his / her life on his / her life work. "Understandable" power company superdooperuber hacker oh, who gets crash in chicago (including phones) <br /> <br /> * and then oh-no-what-have-I- made a call (but does not leave behind?). An offensive reporter who gives up his principles when the hat goes down? Power-company exchange supervisor who ABANDONS HOST POST is the worst in the midst of a crisis in Chicago after a fire - without consequences? Hospitals that doctors and nurses have interrupted during the crisis (I'm not kidding, it's in the movie.) <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and it's full of Hollywood moral clich√©s - in general, women are good, men are good, if it is not influenced by a woman (the ultimate punk with a weapon - without the influence of a woman, she will literally go crazy); An evil dumb act (like what a reporter did with a hacker) is fine as long as you "think well". Evil people die, capitalist evil men die as terribly as everyone else lives (well, except for Randy Quaid). And did I hear someone saying that the nuclear power plants had to shut down because there was no electricity to run the safety systems (think about it)? <br /> <br /> There is one sunbreak (if you forgive the expression) - Randy Quaid basically plays her character "Independence Day" (you know - "Hello guys - I'm baaaack!") - this time as an infinite range of storm SUV and superdoop batteries for his video cameras. However, they kill - mostly, it seems that the audience appreciates that tornadoes are quite dangerous things (sure low, that's it.) <br /> <br /> Give this one go.
