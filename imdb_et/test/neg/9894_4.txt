The Texas Revolution 1835-1836, including before and immediately after the episodes, is depicted in this mid-3-hour film, whose only redemption value brings light and respect to Stephen F. Austin, the "Texas Father," whose biography had long been overshadowed by legendary Sam Houston. The rest of the film is just the usual "Santa Anna's tyrant" story and a weak attempt to show Mexico's perspective on a fictional Hispanic character with a stereotypical Latin mechanism. Together with short, low-budget battle scenes such as Alamao and San Jacinto, this movie is only recommended for real historians who do not come from Mexico. The Mexican uniform sees its credit exactly and the romantic sub-block (the second love triangle) doesn't take too much time on the screen. In general, this film depicts the violent separation of the Texas Anglo-Saxon racial minority, which is a positive and fair revolution against the Mexican tyranny expressed by the general Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, the so-called. "Western Napoleon".
