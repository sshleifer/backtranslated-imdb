Killer (John Karlen), who really wants bad disguises (afro wig white guy?), Driving at his age looking for victims. Detective DeCarlo (James Luisi) is on the scene and finds the murderer quite easily by simply hanging up at a local pool and looking for someone who is looking strange (again playing an African wig). Watching the killer in his home, DeCarlo decides to create a risky sting with a police psychologist. Inspired by Ted Bundy's crimes, KILLER's DELIGHT is a pretty predictable and cheap series of killer flick. Director Jeremy Hoenack has no idea how to speed up or even make a movie. He knows how to show many killers who are wringing their hands! The only thing it really is is the atmosphere of the 70's (see the background picture of the bathroom). Well, this and shrinkage. The Media Blasters / Shriek Show DVD has a lot of nice stuff, including Hoenack and Karlen's audio comments, video chats, trailers and alternative opening.
