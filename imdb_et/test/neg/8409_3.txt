Pretty dirty TV rhythm for Roman Polanski's classic. Rosemary's son Adrian has grown and is a horrible Stephen McHattie. After removing Rosemary (played here by Patty Duke), Minnie & Roman Castevets rebuilt a witch, preparing the son of Satan under world domination. It is not really a scary and easy year that is less successful than its predecessor. Instead, the writer Anthony Wilson and director Sam O'Steen choose a worshiping throne from Satan, filled with many songs, many candles and Ruth Gordon trying at the same time to joke and disgust. Gordon's only detention from the original. George Maharis replaces John Cassavets as Guy and very hammy Ray Milland plays Roman Castevets, who defeats former Sidney Blackmer. Newcomer McHattie is the only real sustainable arm of the film. She's very off and looks really embarrassing, even if she's not doing anything. The music of Charles Bernstein is suitably horrible, but so superfluous that it is more intrusive than effective. O'Steen, who edited an earlier Polanski masterpiece, does not show any praise or nuance.
