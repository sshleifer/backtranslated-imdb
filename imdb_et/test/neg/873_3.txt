* Warning: 1 small minor spoiler * You are right. It wasn't Madison County bridges. As soon as the lonely woman and Richard Gere checked the big empty hotel, it was a conclusion that something of such fun would happen. The question is: how does it happen? The answer is some stupid connection-point-story that is not worth sitting on. In one of the anticipated interconnection experiences, they get drunk and clean the old cans (it was my spoiler). LOL It was not convincing. I'm an old wife like a movie and my friendship is more interesting than her romance with Richard Gere. LOL. . . It had this advantage. You walk and go, brother. . . even i could have written something more plausible. I think my life is not as dull as I thought it was when I could capture romance with Richard Gere. LOL! And this friend inherited this completely modern, probably computer-generated mansion that rested half of the ocean, its GRANDMOTHER, who built it after civilian care? Maybe her grandmother is Oprah and it was the way after the civil war? And yes, HOW IS EMAIL? What alternative universe is alive? I never want to see another movie pretending we don't have email or Facebook and text messaging. And OK, maybe these people have a terrible reluctance to broadcast news over the phone, but don't ask me to believe anyone in this age of direct communication that someone just falls into your life without calling.
