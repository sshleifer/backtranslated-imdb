I really tried to give this film a chance, but when I realized that most of the movie was told by a bunch of bored officials who walked around and talking about phones, I knew it was over. Much of this movie looked like a movie. It's just flat. <br /> <br /> The camera person held such a quick short zoom NO REASON! It struggled me so much, but I just wondered why they thought the devil was a good idea. It does not add anything to the static scene where two people speak. It is not a NYPD blue or any police exhibition or anything. <br /> <br /> How did they not understand that this type of story talks about conversations with people in conference rooms and what is not? Didn't they look at this confusion? Anyway, it was just a really boring movie and it does seem that the one who did it doesn't understand good storytelling. <br /> <br /> Darn stock footage ... it's just wrong.
