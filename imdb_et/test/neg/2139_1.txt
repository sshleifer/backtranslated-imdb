I am not sure what the director and the editor thought when they changed this poor apology for the film, but whatever they thought did not help this film, it only harmed it and it badly damaged the film. Functioning, once, is not a problem, it's a terrible editing, scenes end without a visible reason, while in the middle of action or people are cut down. I'm not sure what the story was, but it wasn't really important because what I saw was quite uninteresting. Just a bad whole, huge "jaws" rip-off and not a good one. However, the MST version was funny. 7 for that, no movie for yourself.
