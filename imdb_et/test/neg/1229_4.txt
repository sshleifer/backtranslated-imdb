It's a bad caricature of "Lonesome Dove" and Larry McMurtry. <br /> <br /> I love your books, with "Lonesome Dove" in the top three. I have admired how you saw yourself through your characters, with such insecure honesty as you would never take it too seriously. That's why I am corrupted. <br /> <br /> Why have you reached this? <br /> <br /> Comanche Moon does not meet your standards. I see that you are credited with writing the screen, but that is, unlike you, I think it's written by someone else. <br /> <br /> The dialog makes me claustrophobic, wishing someone to break a naturally assigned sentence. Part of the "genius" was embarrassing. McCrae was recognizable - mainly because of the words he spoke out of his mouth. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm not calling. <br /> <br /> The most important missing factors are Gus and Call and the men they are: their true courage; the underlying vein consists of ethics and honesty; lack of self-deception. Hard men who live a difficult life with some undeniable grace. <br /> <br /> Some accusations here and all the time have to be related to the workforce. All cast dialogs and dialog guides. <br /> <br /> Although I try to imagine Robert Duvall as a McCrae, it speaks the same dialogue, it goes better - but not much. It tries to call the cowboy-of-a-couple of shy, clever-faulty funny, but not half-successful ... <br /> <br /> How can it be so different from "Loneome Dove"? Has the writer forgotten his characters? You are deceiving some people, Mr McMurtry - but not that.
