This movie probably started with a good idea, but it has gone so far. When I read Blockbuster's cover, I thought it was a promise, but it was based on the general idea of ​​the film. The film began with a professor who talks about how we can see creatures from other dimensions in the future. There was no explanation of how this would happen, but that's okay, I thought it would be in the movie. It wasn't. In the next scene, we see two young men lying on a table attached to their tubes. Each of them has two attractive women. Men will ask "Do you hear it" or "Do you see them". We conclude that they think they see ghosts or other creatures that seem invisible or have hallucinations. Women do not see these beings. It was fine for the first five minutes, but this scheme goes full-time. This is a brief set of setbacks that do not correlate with the "plot" of the film. We also introduce a man in a laboratory that seems to be a Middle Eastern terrorist. What is this? We'll never know. Flashes support us to believe that terrorists are forcing the laboratory to make bad experiments for young people, but we never understand why. At the end of the movie, the terrorists finally do what the terrorists do? they blow well, but why? What's the point about this? We have no idea. This movie contains so many divorced thoughts and ideas that there are too many to list, but another remarkable thing is that the lab coats and terrorists come in and out of the room throughout the film and never young. Men are trying to escape or even leave the tables where they are placed, although they are not hit! The filmmakers also bring the performances of cockroaches on many occasions, but once again we never learn what is involved. I'm sorry, but this movie was a waste of $ 4 and the time I drove to the store and then watching it. Take my advice. Don't try it.
