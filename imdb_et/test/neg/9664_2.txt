I don't think it's really important if a piece of this movie is, the main thing you notice is the extreme amateurism of the whole production. Acting is what you get when you randomly chose people on the street. The sound is really annoying - the medicine closes with a shot coming across the ear, while dialogue is perhaps one fifth loud. The various noise levels that are set are largely dominated by the audio track, with the dialogue being far from the back seat. The music of the theme sounds like it would be about a quarter of the movie released, because much of the movie doesn't have music at all. The camera's work can best be described as dirty confusion, close-up photography, where it would be much better at an average angle, camera players moving around and moving around the camera, no attention is paid to shaping any scene. the cameraman was most comfortable in any position. If the operator was taller than the actors and you have to look at the top of everyone's heads, then be it. Editing is just the work of a butcher; Everything is thrown in the steepest way, nothing moves or moves in some sense. I don't know if it's a video or even a rented video camera, I think it was the last one. <br /> <br /> I did this about three-quarters of this thing before I turned it off, so I was just annoyed by the low quality of production I couldn't get. It's like a ninth grade audio-visual project.
