When the filmmaker Uwe Boll released the first cemetery, which was completely deserved for mockery, it was agreed among the video game fans that one should be incredibly moral to think about making a sequel. Indeed, the number of Hollywood residents per host must be high, because not only do we have a sequel, but it was distributed in Sony's antipodes, the company is usually not well-known for writing off its taste. In the United States, the order for television directly improves on most aspects of the original, but in doing so it becomes more exciting than interesting. The scope of the scenario is increased, with the action taking place in an abandoned city that just happens around the university, where there have been attempts with a virus that can revive the dead. Above all, this activity has spread throughout the university with the first infected features. Simply put, the film differs from the original in that it actually takes place in a house where dead people can be found. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, a real step back is cast. Emmanuelle Vaugier was specially made for the similar low rental price to Angelina Jolie, while the rest will never reach the level of slipper JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. In fact, the only name that hurts in this pain is one Sticky Fingaz, who apparently didn't want people he was at home to feel easily. Simply put, these people could not order the pizza on the big screen convincingly, even in the best direction. Say what you're saying about Boll, but he inspired at least actors such as Ona Grauer to fight for their intuition. Nevertheless, the people involved here at least seem to be aware that their film sucks and that they can also have fun. Much of the original problem was that the director thought he was preparing some misunderstood masterpiece, and he took himself seriously. Unfortunately, if the participants do not take their character or threat seriously, then what little dramatic tension there might have been undermined. any plague causes the dead to rise. To make the butter more practical, they try to find someone who was infected just after the virus became a human form of mutation. How it helps, if a non-mutated strain is usually needed to create a vaccine, one has to guess, but the way that this endeavor is eliminated is problematic. The reboot primer is used to develop working time, but the actual timing of additional search is also problematic. At one point, we are told that the Cruise missiles will be destroyed in ten minutes, but the heroes will return to the university, find the sample they are looking for and fight enough zombies to eat the Chinese army. this time. The filmmakers note that over time it is only concrete if it can be a barrier to dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> The special effects of Dead House's 2 leave dust out of the original. When Uwe Boll simulated the death of symbols with idiotic rotating camera states, Michael Hurst uses all the graphical details his budget allows. Necks are bitten, hands are cut off, head down. All of this gives much more convincing permeability, but it also prohibits the mocking of obvious fakeness. Photography is also much better. As DVD Crypt put it, the fact that it is in full focus will change the original, but it also leaves us laughing. Writing is also a correction and a setback. Throughout the script, reference is made to other horror and survival horror games, the most obvious of which is Run Like Hell. The first few times they work because they offer smart, routine ways of everyday dialogue. After the eighth time they still get nervous because they remind players of things they would prefer in their time. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the dead house 2 cost only six million television screens across America. Given that Tom Savini himself is paying more and more for the film today, I have to say that I have somewhat impressed with the visual results. Contrary to what has been much revised, the zombies here look like real zombies rather than bad pictures of bad makeup. Contrary to the original, the actors seem to have a clue what they are doing. The closing of a transaction is that, apart from some real zingers who are scattered, the characters speak like real people. But this story is not something we have not seen thousands of times. When the aliens, the real threshold of the dead or the evil dead were praised, praise was given to the fact that these films did something we had never seen before, or did it so well that we didn't care. The House of Death 2 is competent enough not to look at it, but it does not give the table anything new or brilliant, so we don't have to take care of it. <br /> <br /> For this reason and many others. I gave the dead home 2 to two out of ten. It's too good to be bad, but too bad to be good. If you're not in such lucky movies as I am, it is better to get rid of it.
