I would not lie, I rented this movie because it was an "artistic" film with a possible explicit sex. I got this scene and Catherine Deneuve's (briefly shown) breasts, but the rest of the film is just ordinary long pretentious European art films with lines like "Do I have a mother or a father, I don't know" (parafrased). Usually delivered with long soliloquies. <br /> <br /> If you are curious about the "art" transition to porn, it may be an interesting look using the fast forward button (I was still too slow!)
