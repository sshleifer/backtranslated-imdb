My wife rented this movie and could never see it comfortably. If I want to torture her, I look at this movie. I've been watching a lot of movies on my 4 year old and I can do almost everything. Barney is refreshing after shooting Quigley. <br /> <br /> Plot, dialogue, cinematography, and acting were one step higher (or equal) with cheap porn movies. I feel sorry for $ 3.69 we paid for it, and then 90 minutes of my life I never get back. I say my 4-year-old loved it, luckily it was a rental that had to be returned immediately.
