That's what I asked myself about many struggles, screaming competitions, swearing and chaos that go through 84 minutes. Comparisons also occur when you think of one-dimensional characters with so little depth that it is virtually impossible to take care of what happens to them. They are just badly written by cyphers, to the director to hang on to their multicultural beliefs, a topic that has done much better in other dramas on television as well as cinema. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I am not really one of the bad performers during the movie, but I have to say that Nichola Burley (the heroine's best friend) and Wasim Zakir (the disgusting, bullying brother) were absolutely terrible. I don't know what the school they finished, but if I were, I would ask for a full refund rate. Only in the lead role of Samina Awan can impress the so-called British talent, which we will probably never hear. At least this is hope. Next time, hire another scout. <br /> <br /> Another intriguing idea is the amazingly fashionable music that likes Snow Patrol, Ian Brown and Keane. Now I'm a bit of a music fan and I know most of these artists' productions, but I didn't know any stories of this film (except "Run" everywhere). B-parties, anyone? We get many, many musical assemblies that telegram how we think we feel. This is accompanied by amazingly original images, such as couples that can be swept by the lake and can carry door openings. This is a problem, because no song transmits the mood efficiently, and we understand that the director has no ability to carry the emotional journey to the audience through storytelling and dialogue. <br /> <br /> The end is probably just a dessert, because everyone gets their score and there is at least one big shock in the shop. But I was indefinitely immobile because the script had given me some root. Dealing with the hot button problem is not enough, you really have to give us a plot that has not yet been killed, and individuals who are more than a blindfold. In its present form, this film is a noble failure, with only a promising leader of the actor and some lightly guiding punches to record it in the trash. 4/10. Must try more ..
