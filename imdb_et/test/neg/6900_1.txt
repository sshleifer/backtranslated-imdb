When my six-year-old child stayed in the theater during this movie, it was all I needed to make this film smelly. It was boring. Frightening parts were boring. The parts of Maudl were boring. Even the funny parts - with two small exceptions - were boring. And predictable. And did I mention predictable? Examples: 1) Dirty but loving father who takes care of his child. 2) Tough but loving father who buys a farm (singing song?!). 3) A child who decides to cut and run, but thanks to his friends, adhering to them because they need him. 4) The charm of a child who wins with incredible probability. 5) And the African-American actress expressed sassy character. I have to credit these filmmakers for preserving this originality and its stereotype. I mentioned two funny bits. In both cases, these are small letters. The mouse hit the farmer's pulse was funny. The peasant, who fell victim to his dog's weakness when he was in charge of leadership, was funny. But the rest? Painful. Someone tried to make a Hipness-Thru movie and even make it a hipster, making it a computer animated film and that was the result. And why make a coyotes Batman-foolish fool, sacrificing monologue rather than just eating them? Oh yes. This film does not need blood for children, which already focuses on alcohol consumption, destructive behavior and potty humor. And the fuzzy-thing-in-a-box? What exactly was that? Porcupine? Tasmanian devil? What besides a really foolish drawing that helps Otis win the cow, does the mother of all battles win? Barnyard is a bomb. And I didn't even have to mention the udders.
