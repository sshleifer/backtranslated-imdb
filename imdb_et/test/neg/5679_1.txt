You just can't touch NRFPTP! The new harvest is just terrible. Jokes are not funny. Part of the troupe makes me stop watching TVs. Lorne - you let your work down the toilet. Guests are sometimes good, bands are mostly garbage. Seth has to talk to the audience when she laughs ..... Seth could get a good reception at the Baghdad cafe ... Make sure Andy goes with her ... There are about 10 jokes in the show and they'll keep going again and again. Even segments that probably aren't funny. The name of the game has become offensive, but they can't even do that right. Just offensive. I'm so disappointed with what has happened to the show, but now I know it's safe to go on Saturday night!
