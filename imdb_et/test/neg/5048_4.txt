Tingle's teaching, which I wanted, was a fun and enjoyable teen comedy that attracts me for this working time. Despite the rather good first half of the year, the film quickly falls into a dull, cliché confusion that is about as much fun as pulling eyelashes with pliers. Rusty pliers. "Scream" writer Kevin Williamson wrote and directed this film and proved that Scream could be a fluke. Most of the elements of this film have been viewed for the second time millions of times; and although it was OK for him to steal elements from other films in Scream, as it is meant to honor the slasher; here it just looks like he has run out of ideas. The plot follows the smartest girl in school, played by Katie Holmes. After catching cheat with two of his friends; three decide to take their host with the hostage. But it's not just every teacher; this is Mrs Tingle, who is the most important bitch in school. He does not take in the bed as he starts to play games to make his captors against each other. <br /> <br /> The plot is very similar to the 1997 Suicide Kings. and a whole host of earlier movies. It is not really a bad idea of ​​a movie and if Williamson could have populated the movie with interesting characters; it could have worked really well. The character of Mrs Tingle is the most interesting in the film, but she is massively one-dimensional and like all other characters in the film; is just a caricature. Operation is largely devilish, except in the title of Helen Mirren. He is appropriately evil in this role, and although he does not have much tooth; he enjoys being central. Teenagers are not worth mentioning, but Katie Holmes stood out; and it is really only thanks to his star profile, not his talents. Williamson has almost every scene dulled with soft soft rock music that would be really annoying if the film wasn't absolutely terrible anyway. Frankly, this movie has a few moments that are pretty good; but basically if you want to see a good example of teen comedy - this is not the movie you want to see.
