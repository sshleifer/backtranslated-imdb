It was the second MST3K movie I ever saw and still holds a place in the heart that is one of the most fun scary movie experiences you ever have. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keeffe (sp?) is here using his chiseled bodywork to score another apartment on his apartment association mortgage. He is rigid, woody and convincing, but he is still cool, a pleasant man and at least he's photogenic. This is the only decent thing I can say about the film, so I thought I'd get it right. The fact that he is in the movie adds another point to the score and saves it from "1 in 10". <br /> <br /> No specific queues for this movie are compressed: <br /> <br /> 1) OK, Tanya Roberts' Clone (Mila) is for the guests to find Ator that takes 3 minutes time, including the time he spends the poisoned arrow on his shoulder (which I assume he would have slowed down a bit) So Ator heals him and takes his trustworthy help to Thong and plans to go back to his castle ... and continues movie over the next 50+ minutes, restoring Mila's 3-minute ride. How does it work? I know that the terrible team is being harassed by magical forces and enemies etc, but still ...! <br /> <br /> 2) Probably felt writer / director need to add "depth" to the movie by adding a current discussion / Socrates dialogue / match between 20 questions between Zori (average John Saxon wannabe) and wisdom Akron (Richard Harris wannabe) But Joe Damoto apparently got his philosophical training on Hallmark maps t, t-shirts and bumpers and he doesn't understand the pace, pace or timing ... nor the actors. (Crow's note at one such exchange is my entry line). These two dragging scenes that bring the film to a frightening stop and kill some of the momentum or excitement caused by the heroic struggle and heroic trio. <br /> <br /> 3) When the Ator arrives at the castle (and it is caught) things go further downhill. Zor decides to feed a woman's victim with Ator and Mila Serpent to God, whom she holds in her basement. There was some excitement in this scene, so the director will kill this potential right away, bringing the scene together with the drama that awaits its fines on the DMV. Ator has a great fight with Serpent, which is hardly more convincing than Bela Lugosi's struggle with the rubber octopus "Bride". <br /> <br /> 4) The climatic scene where Ator pulls the glider from the twigs and animal skins is so foolish that it completely captures the viewer from the movie and makes you roll, laugh until your parties have hurt. 5) Oh, yes, and the filmmakers decided to add an explosion at the end of the atomic explosion, moral that Ator decided to destroy the "atomic nucleus" of McGuffin, which drives the film because humanity was "not ready". ("Zzzzip! MESSAGE COMING IN !!!") Just like "Monster Bride" again think about it. A bystander was needed who said, "They have broken the domain of God." <br /> <br /> 6) For some reason, I saw an introductory and closing homo-erotic credit sequence in a movie version that has absolutely nothing to do with someone or another movie. I have no idea where this film came from, but it is REALLY WORKING as the actual movie he is booking. <br /> <br /> Look at it only if you are a big fan of Miles, or if you enjoy MST3K.
