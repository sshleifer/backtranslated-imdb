Robert Altman's "Quintet" is clumsy, gloomy, hard to follow a thriller, where you finally give up for a while because it's so complicated. <br /> <br /> I remember it in my local twin weekend with full time. . When the picture ended, it was less than a quarter full. Never have I seen such a mass emigration without the need for an emergency to drive people out. It should say how bad it is. I believe that this is still the worst film involved in the front and back of such a great talent camera.
