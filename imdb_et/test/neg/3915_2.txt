I would never have heard of this movie before I caught the night off last night. I hope it was never given a cinematic extract because it would be an insult to both the silver screen and the film's visitors. <br /> <br /> Was it supposed to be serious, was it supposed to be funny? Why is it a terribly basic plot? Does anyone really care? ... <br /> <br /> Intelligent movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
