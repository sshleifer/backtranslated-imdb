Naming the film boring is usually not something I think is the right criticism. However, if the film is a spare part of other films that was not as good as the beginning, and it is a slow molasses, without real profitability, I think it's fair to call it a spade. And the ghost is a very boring film. <br /> <br /> A film that is as original as its name, a ghost tells a story about a young girl whose amnesia worships a ghost with a secret to her past. Only that is much more complicated and less interesting than you think. <br /> <br /> The plot line is almost incomprehensible for most images, and the hook, the amnesia, makes things worse. It seems that no one, including the scriptwriter and the director, has any idea what happens in hell at any moment. Instead, they decided to do what is roughly equivalent to showing sitcom clips. For a good scenario, there are techniques taken directly from the Ring, Dark Water, Shutter, The Grudge series and Pulse Fragrance. Deterioration of the situation, half a dozen female leads dress and read their rows so that it is impossible to distinguish one another. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to understand about this movie. The story is not all well thought out. The amnesia trick is lazy. The element of mystery is little involved and treated. Characters never give anything, all the information is simply passed through the memory, reminding it of its past if it is convenient for the plot. <br /> <br /> Cinematic art that is full of reflections and water images, at least trying to add to the subtitle, has a thematic relationship with amnesia and the ultimate twist (which I don't publish) beautiful, but often burnt. Even the score seems borrowed and clich√©. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that inciting the curse is not very interesting and the last twist is predictable and flat. "Wait, you mean one character with a 15-minute screen time but having nothing to do with the plot will eventually come back? No!" Target groups are too difficult for this type of tear. Anyone who has seen a movie that hangs on it looks very little to keep that feature awake. I thought Shimizu was the bottom of the barrel for this kind of crap (at least 5 times reusing his terrible movie), but even his second hurry like Reincarnation, a movie I couldn't even finish my own, is miles before that. <br /> <br /> Find more comments at www.collider.com
