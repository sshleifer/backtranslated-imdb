It is not uncommon for celebrity to face the proverb "wake-up call". And if they survive this event, they will gain deeper understanding and appreciation with their special happiness. However, in the case of comedians, they are rarely as funny as they were before they were before. This is the case with Martin Lawrence. Frankly, pay little attention to celebrities, because I have much better things to do with my life than to spend on watching others. So, I didn't know most of what Lawrence went through before. It was interesting, but unfortunately all. I had a bigger impression that this guy is not very funny. Save the book's great life messages, just be funny on stage. If you want to see the funny Martin Lawrence, go to one of the old Def Jams for which he was housed. Don't rent rented.
