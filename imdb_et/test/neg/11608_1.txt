This film talks about pathetic, spoiled, ego-guided winners who think they have something interesting to say about pious, spoiled, ego-led winers who think they are interesting. Direct from New York's artificial farty bleeding drama scene from coke filled gutter. <br /> <br /> How so many viewers beat them to think that it carries some substance will remain a mystery to me. Maybe they mysteriously override this over-priced and overpriced "actor guild" or maybe they have never seen a decent movie? <br /> <br /> Get out, put your hands on the dirty land and get the job done. Otherwise, kill yourself with a real weapon.
