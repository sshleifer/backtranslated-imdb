If you just want gore and anything other than gore and torture, you've come to the right movie. If you want at least a good actor, logic, story, consistency or even a good man, go elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I couldn't think of myself, "Jeeeez, have these people been mentally challenged?" As an example, after he has tracked and seen other people spoiled, the General Department meets the police officer and blows his story to the policeman with tears and tears. and told him about a psychopath who drives a yellow truck. The yellow truck pulls up and the officer just walks, talks to the man and the truck travels without problems. The actor appears and says why you didn't arrest him? And then the truck travels over the police officer ... after the truck stops, the road stops about 20 meters long, while the actor tries to drag the policeman, but he is too heavy. (At that time) At that time, the truck lifted back and ran over the police foot twice. The truck then moves out. Why didn't the actress have a gun behind me. (After which he fires the policeman almost twice, because the psychopath was burning in his life) As a mouth that did not kill him (Duuuumb) and twice to finish the job. * Roll eyes * Immediately he turns away to get into the bathroom that explodes and when he climbs near the roof, he turns around and the policeman is no longer ... OK ... <br /> Another example: The headmaster responds to a woman trapped in the bathroom , she spits on the floor like a gallon of blood covering about 1/3 of space. (Probably more) After he leaves the towel to grab the towel, he comes back and everything is gone. : / They don't explain why everyone is disappearing. Dark dick stupid. <br /> <br /> I like horror / thriller / gore movies, but it was just too stupid. I lost the brain cells watching this drift, and you shouldn't be too.
