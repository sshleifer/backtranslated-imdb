If you are a reasonable person and you have seen films before, you will not be able to tolerate this idol for more than 20 minutes. And if you stay there for longer, this is not because you would be waiting for akshay or paresh (not govinda please!), But because you value your money too much and you want at least a short sunshine in a multiplex in exchange for the money they kidnapped! It is hard to believe that a director who gave us a cult film, like HeraPher, may fall to such a level .. well if he is repetitive, but now he comes out of all the third prices and expects us to laugh because he has brought him to Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumari. ..! No, sir it doesn't work now .. especially for this stupid script! Even comedy films can have meaningful scripts (Lage Raho Munnabhai anyone?). <br /> <br /> Govinda doesn't have a lot to do without being able to comment .. Akshay Kumar was bored, Paresh Rawal cracked some of the worst jokes possible. Lara Dutta was a real chance to act on it, but she's not unhappy ... the only one High Point Movie (Maybe) is a Tanushree actress! But he's only there for the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> I don't think this movie is worth more space ... (probably not so much!). So the last warning - don't look at it!
