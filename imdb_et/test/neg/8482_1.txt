OK, about 11 years ago, a fantastic, funny movie "The Mask" came out, and everyone loved it, and now, 11 years later, this mask returns in this awesome movie? Wrong !!!!!!!!!! this movie was the stupid movie I've ever seen! I mean, when I rented it, I thought I'd like to laugh so hard that I pee my pants first. but after I saw this "sequential" barley even split. I don't think about the director or the pain of this movie, but what a waste of time and money. so the whole plot plot was for this little baby that has a part of his mask, and this evil man is after him for some thing, because that's all I really got, I would have added some more stuff so it would be bigger than 2 stars 10.
