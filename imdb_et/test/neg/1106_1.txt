I love this type of film in general. But this time I found that I wanted to hit the screen. Because I can't do that, I just complain about it. It was completely idiotic. Things that happen to dead children are very cool, but the living people are absolute idiots. I'm an adult man, quite big and I can protect myself well. But I don't do what a little girl does in this movie. The mother in this film is also careless and careless with her children. I wouldn't be so angry about her and her actions, otherwise I would have liked the flick. Whatever number he was, take my advice and hurry up everything he sees until the end. Also, someone else has become ill with such dark films. Anyway, you can't see what's being filmed. As an audience, we are impossible with the actions on the screen. So why can't hell be seen at night?
