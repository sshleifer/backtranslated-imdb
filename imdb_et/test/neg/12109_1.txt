You would even say that this film is the best work of Sebastien to tell you everything you need to know about a man. Sebastien is pathetic, silly, not the best of fun but very popular on French television. When looking at some of his performances is simply the torture of a person who is usually formed, then his first (only hope) film has proved to be the worst. The excuses for rape by Sebastien (the victim falls in love with his aggressor) are not only in the wrong place, but are clearly unacceptable. I advise you not to bother with this picture (or any future function of Sebastien), you would simply lose your time ... There's something on the French television that doesn't smell ... and that's Patrick Sebastien !!!
