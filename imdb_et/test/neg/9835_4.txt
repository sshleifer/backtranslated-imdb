Girl Lovers Lane is one strange little low budget movie. On the surface of the film, the film tells of a bitch (Brett Halsey) who spends his time looking at a young child named Danny (Lowell Brown) and a girl, Carrie (Joyce Meadows), that Bix will meet who would like to watch her. There's nothing too interesting (Bix goes out with Carrie, Bix gets out of Danny, Carrie's father drinks a lot, etc.) in about 10 minutes when the movie is murdered. His father blames Bix, pulls him out of prison and almost kills him. Now their roles are reversed and Danny has to record Bix. <br /> <br /> While I was reading IMDb comments, I thought maybe it was just my reading more about Bix and Danny than it really was, but now I see I'm not alone. It was obvious to me early that Bix and Danny had more relationships than you usually see in the 1959 movie. However, the homosexual nature of these relationships, although never publicly expressed, is quite obvious. Their living and sleeping arrangements, Bix's reaction to finding Danny in bed with a prostitute, Bix's inability to cope with Carrier, and at the end of a phone call when Danny tells his parents that he was "a friend at home, are some examples of moments leading to the inevitable conclusion that their The relationship is more than initially in sight, I'm sure they exist, but I can't think of the movies I've seen in the 50s that homosexuals scream loudly than it is. is bored.If I wrote earlier, 90% of the time does not happen much in the current time, and the actors are not good enough to give Lovers Lane a lot of sparks. One exception is Jack Elam, his crazy Jesse is what is enough the biggest problem I had with the film was the motivation of the character and the logic d and the Bixi are immediately accused? But crazy with Jesse, who has probably been pursuing Carrie throughout his life? Gee thinks he asks Jesse where he was that night? His father has seen him plagued at Carrie's dining room, but he never thinks Jesse might have anything to do with his daughter's death? There is not much logic there. And what about Jesse's confession? Danny grabs Jesse's baby and that's all you need to force a confession to Jesse? A real tough guy, huh? Why would he admit it so easily? And if he admits, does anyone think of him? It is terribly nice for Jesse to stay and not go away. In another reality, he would never have entered his guts and would have been like a rabbit if he had been killed for murder. The fact that a girl Lovers Lane is asked to accept these ridiculous actions is something I don't want to do. In general I give the girl Lovers Lane 4/10.
