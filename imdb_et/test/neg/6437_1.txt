If this is considered to be the real life of London, manufacturers must be on a different planet. <br /> <br /> It's the most depressing, suicidal, darker, dingy, dirty on television. <br /> <br /> Everyone is fighting, everything is nasty under the underlying tones, nothing is done for real reasons. <br /> <br /> If you want real life images from London or the UK, this program is the furthest from reality. <br /> <br /> There is no good word for this program. The only certainty is that it is a great fight at Christmas Eve. <br /> <br /> Even the characters are absolutely incredible!
