Woof! Pretty boring and they could also shoot in black and white, so colorless. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a rolling text that explains cryogenicity and asks if God or Satan is behind it. There are some protests outside the cryogenic laboratory. Some people rob the bank and many robbers and guards are shooting. One of the predators' father organizes the freezing of his son. At first, there are many jumps from the scene scene that introduce the signs without knowing how they are related. <br /> <br /> There is a power outage and cans containing frozen people get into the flash and they appear as zombies. They all wear a silver mylar-type costume, and their skin is dark green and wrinkled (no idea why they look so bad - frozen, apparently, did not preserve their appearance) and they have silver eyes. They move by killing people, sometimes hitting like zombies, sometimes moving like ordinary people. <br /> <br /> Linda Blair always keeps up with what I am not sure about. I think his character works in a cryogenic laboratory but he is not very important for the plot and his role is very small. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with some shooting frames with a piece of text that tells us what happened to the next characters are pretty stupid.
