Let's see. What hurt me? Particularly long dance scene at the beginning, watching people who spin around so much, I got dizzy ... Without showing where the music came from ... The whole part of college graduation that had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Or maybe it was that every scene lasted about fifteen minutes longer than they had to. What this movie is. And the most troublesome aspect is the bad guys are so bad, so apparently terrible that it seems like the director made this movie to another grader. "These people are bad ... These people are good". Every time a movie has its own heart on my agenda, I am next to me. There's a scene on a roller skate that seems totally inappropriate. The long character and the Russian prostitute love scenes that seem more like a rock star than her sexy groupie. The character of John Hurt, who is part of a long beginning, drinks and disagrees with the naughty bad guys. His death scene could very well be a fool of history. And I hear everyone, even the heroes of this movie, talking about how nice the cinema is. I think it looks washed out. See "Heavenly Days" if you want to see gorgeous courtyards. This movie is even worse than anti-hype. This is pointless. The epilogue showing the hunter was almost as stupid as the prologue. Battle scenes are annoying and dizzy. This movie is really bad. Avoid it if you don't love bad movies because it's their king.
