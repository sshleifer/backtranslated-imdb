This movie may be the first Puppy, but it definitely forgot to die when I saw this stupid movie, I wanted a refund. It was a bad series for Puppet Master and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks it was terrible. For some it was great, but for others it was a snore-ville ticket and the boy is right. The dolls didn't even do anything or kill people. People shouldn't see it, so I warn you that you can't see it. You are disappointed even by fans who love the Puppet Master, it was a waste of their time and it didn't make so much money. But even killed, but one or two, very pointless. <br /> <br /> 1/10
