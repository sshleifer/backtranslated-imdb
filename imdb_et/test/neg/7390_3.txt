"The King Is Alive" is the misconception of the film that arises as a self-indulgent author's excuse to transport a number of actors in the deserted Namibian desert, where he can play a big-dogma domo and film his selfishly created, silly, burnt-out drama that ignores the real forces of human nature, market demand, common sense and even good art. In other words, it is one dumbassed flick and if you don't believe it, your repentance will follow it. Only film heads, critics, dilettants and the like. (D)
