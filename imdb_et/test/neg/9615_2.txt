Oh dear - how Alfred Hitchcock (Northwest, Spellbound, 39 steps) can get out of this nasty, it's next to me. Don't worry if you are looking for hidden depths or deep meanings. It's just terrible, poor and cheap. One redemption function is the home life of the investigator-inspector - his wife pulls out as a gourmet chef and constantly serves his hostile culinary experiments to his poor husband. It's fun and almost saved me into the movie's "terrible" clip, but the movie as a whole is one of the most unpleasant things I've ever seen. I believe it was Hitchcock's last film - maybe someone was trying to tell him something.
