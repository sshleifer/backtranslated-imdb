Beware, My Lovely (1952) Dir: Harry Horner <br /> <br /> Production: Filmmakers / RKO Radio Images <br /> <br /> Credulity-firing thriller from Collier Young's and East Lupino's pioneering manufacturers' team called Filmmakers ( Lupino bumps into some illegal direction). <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan is "dangerous" and East Lupino is a "woman" in a "dangerous" female film. Ryan plays Howard Wilton, a tightly wounded psychotic master (noooo, Ryan? I know, hard to believe). Lupino is a lone widow, Helen Gordon, who hires Howard around her house. Things go down there when Howard makes Helen imprisoned in his home. <br /> <br /> Howard has an unpleasant secret, not to reveal it. You see, consciousness is a real challenge for him. Preserving it. He has the unfortunate habit of dying and finding his employers. This is part of the film's problem. The nature of Howard's psychosis is so extreme that it is almost impossible to believe that he is free from the city to the city, even in 1918 (when the film is set). He can't remember anything that happened ten minutes ago. His violent, threatening, antisocial tendencies are based on the smallest and most common things (young girl, flirting, war deficits because refusing her service is forbidden). I don't know how he even interviewed Helen. There are other uncertainties. If you were locked in a deadlock in your house, but still left some time, couldn't you figure out how to escape? <br /> <br /> Ryan thinks I'm defeated. He seems to play his hand. His series of series and spasms, and tightly rolled dementia, have everything in place - a robotic feeling for them. At this point he probably played this character, to some extent, ten times and shows. We are encouraged to empathize with Howard (I didn't do it) through the humanities shown, as he has stopped in the music box and in his group associated with a group of children who don't understand him. Lupino just has to act frazzled and trouble what he is more than capable and does. <br /> <br /> There was one thing in the picture about it; what would be the possible solution to the conflict? So, of course, disappointment was steep and ineffective. A little interest was the recurring motif where the camera tries to capture Howard's reflection (in mirrors, water, Christmas tree decorations). It showed something that happens or goes on the head. Horner (1953 Vicki), who made his reputation in production design, does a good job of making the house feel in prison. Also credit, always a reliable RKO art department house at work. Ultimately, the basic principles are principals who all have much better films for their credit. <br /> <br /> * Â½ of four
