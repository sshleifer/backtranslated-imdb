I was really surprised that someone takes so much time to evaluate such a bad movie. At the beginning of the movie, it was the truth. Partisan "AF" was launched in 1943 when two communist pilots from Croatia's Ustashi AF left with their observers according to Breguet 19 and Potez 33. The aircraft saw some steps in staging and hand bombing, but did not last very long. One team died and the other survived, the pilot died later when he drove to Spitfire Vc. The real partisan squadrons were created when the RAF separated two of its (Yugoslav) Spitfire Vc and Hurricane IIc crews, who were crewed by the Ex Yugoslav royal air force pilots, and handed them to Tito forces on the Isle. Even those who never participated in air-to-air activities, but strictly for ground support. So the film was one giant cow manure, lightly and at the lowest point, otherwise not at all bad, director. Sometimes I was present with the fate of filming the last sequence of the film, when dozens of German planes (522 trainers from Yugoslavia, also used for flying sequences) were destroyed at Mostar military airport. Pyrotechnics was impressive, and the sculpture that the film crew had served abundantly was even better. Otherwise, the film was a shameless lie and a funny contemporary audience.
