This film was a horror film made by Mexico since the late 60s. It's not that good, but not so bad. There's a lot of stupid and it is padded pretty much with nudity and violence, but he had a plot and at least tried to hold it (even if the plot was the same fucking Franken-inspired "don't bother God's domain" b - fare). Some wrestling was mixed with women's wrestling, but it was done in Mexico and wrestling seems to be popular in Mexico. <br /> <br /> The plot is that your doctor wants to save his son who dies of leukemia. Other doctors have not given the bad person any hope, but the father has the idea of ​​transplanting the heart of the gorilla so that his son can save his life (I don't know, I'm a lawyer, not a doctor). The graft works, but the boy boy becomes human, who terrorizes naked women and kills anyone who gets his way. There is also a sub-block with a policeman and his girlfriend, who is a wrestler (it didn't really add too much, but if they want to throw some masked female wrestlers here, that's a good reason). <br /> <br /> The film was such a cheap but not too bad day for a b-movie. The plot was basically simply recycled and there were some things that were not well connected to it. But this movie is a kind of fun (I don't know why, maybe because it's a Mexican horror movie and is out of my usual bad movie diet). I think it may be because it is a mixture and porridge of some very strange things. <br /> <br /> See if you like cheesy foreign movies, nudity, and female wrestlers.
