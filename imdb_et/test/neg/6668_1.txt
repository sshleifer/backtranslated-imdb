I felt I had to add a comment after breathing the second comment. I saw this movie as a child by my ignorant parents, waiting for Norman's witty comedy of wisdom. Instead of what you get, this is the worst British sex comedy, where Norman (Norman!) Plays swingers with the aim of getting as many birds as possible. Absolutely typical for the genre - poorly filmed and behaved, the similarity of the script to the worst double participant, and very vague hints of buttoniness. And all seemingly on this special steel film reserved for British low budget films from the 1960s to 1970s. The only memorable thing is a tediously memorable topic that still jumps in my brain after 30 years. <br /> <br /> Finally, in the last scene, you can see Norman naked - running around the world. sand and frozen. I think anyway - my mother pulled me in the cinema. I saw it a few years later and I guess what it was. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan or an interest in a small man and his career, you will apply it. The 10-foot-bargepole rule for this. Believe me, you don't have to see the back of Norman's wisdom.
