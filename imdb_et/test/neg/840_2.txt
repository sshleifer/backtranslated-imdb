I don't really know where to start when watching a movie as a pathetic review when Ernest goes to Africa. In addition to two or three good laughs that are scattered throughout the film, there is nothing positive about destroying this half hour and life. It is unbelievable that someone was able to round up a group of people who want to act, film and edit it in the trash, and even more incredible that this is the eighth installment of the Ernest series. <br /> <br /> During the film opening credit, we see Ernest next to various African objects, such as wooden masks and African animal leaders, making faces and gestures that will probably make most of the 3rd grade youth laugh. This opening plan gives the viewer a taste of Ernest's frequent humor tests and shows how his comedy falls from 95% of the time. <br /> <br /> The first thing that really hit me about this movie is how bad it is. In the film, everyone is a typical C-film actress, but Linda Kash is particularly sharp. He is a play of overactivity; all of his lines are shocked to the inhuman enthusiasm that you find only in high school. Most high school students would probably have been able to exchange these participants and provide a more powerful result. Jim Varney shows at least one comedic ability at any time, but for most movies he just acts as a complete retard, trying to be humorous, making a stupid face and speaking in different voices. <br /> <br /> Ernest Goes in Africa begins in Africa, where the archaeologist has stolen two priceless jewels from an African tribe. The gems then return to the United States, where an unknown man sees the running of several churches through a flea market. He hides them in a "two dollar" item and then runs from the scene. Ernest is looking for a gift to buy for Rene whom she likes, so she goes to the flea market and of course purchases invaluable gems. Later he takes them back to his house, paints them and glues them together to make yo-yo. He gives yo to yo, and he explains that they can never be together because he is just a middle circle, and he wants an adventurer. Rene and Ernest have been tracked by imitators and then taken to Africa to keep them in prison. <br /> <br /> Most movies don't really make sense. When Ernest is in Africa, he gets out of the truck to drive him and land in the rivers. In the next scene we see him as a Hindu servant called "Hey You." Her skin is dark and she is wearing a backpack. First of all, I thought Jim Varney was playing another role in the movie, besides Ernest, but I immediately knew Ernest's idiot. Hey, you started talking. <br /> <br /> Another scene that I find completely ridiculous is the chase of an African wilderness car. Rene and Ernest have been taken by the ostrich farmer truck and the guards who follow them. About twenty miles per hour driving on a fairly straight track, both hunters shoot in Ernest, who is at the back of a ostrich truck truck. Ernest, on the other hand, throws ostrich eggs into their ostriches and their leader. Competitors will never hit Ernest during a five-minute chase, but Ernest will be able to hit them, hit them and their driver on the face, turning their car off the road and exploding in a giant smoke column. I should also add that Ernest has two eggs at a time, a big bra. <br /> <br /> The set is also extremely bad in this movie. There is a big part of the film in which Rene and Ernest are walking in Africa, trying to find civilization. During their trekking, we see them walking through fields and jungles, which would probably have been fired anywhere in the United States. Fields are just ordinary grasslands, where there is no sign that they are all over Africa (they could have at least digitally included some African trees) and jungles look like the rural areas of Connecticut with papier mâchè skulls, vines, and thorns hanging of wood. According to IMDb.com, the movie was actually filmed in South Africa, but I wouldn't believe it at all. <br /> <br /> Continuing the movie, Ernest jokes after Ernest's joke. The rest of the film doesn't make any sense either; African tribes all speak English for some reason, and Ernest is later challenged by the "battle of truth" led by the henchman, who is suddenly dressed in equipment similar to ninja, but at the same time somewhat reminiscent of slavery submissive. The victim has tables of axes, swords, knives and camps before him, while Ernest has a table with a sandwich, teddy bear and some other worthless object. But Ernest wins the battle and somehow saves the day. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is painful to look at. I was not able to deal with it in one session; I had to stop halfway and make some productive hours to compensate for the lost brain cells when evaluating Varney's humor. They should really give the surgeon a general warning that people will know that they are actually a bit slower when they finish the movie. I have to say that none of the movies I've ever seen can get close to anyone as Ernest goes to Africa.
