This film would have had a lot of potential. Certainly, with today's technology, real special effects could be expected. However, movies are not only made with special effects; This film did not have both! <br /> <br /> First of all, let me tell those who are upset about it, not to follow the Bible: why can't a film get an artistic license from a movie? If you want to know the story of Moses, read the Bible. I've seen very few movies that follow a real story. Watch the film about your artistic qualities. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, you will inevitably compare it to the 1956 version. That's not happening with it. Heston and Brenner had PRESENCE. They became their roles. You can't see it here. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not compare, you stand by it, then this movie is too hasty. The parts where the scene should be developed are not. It gets boring. <br /> <br /> My advice: skip it and see another one. Like campy like the other, it's a better and better movie.
