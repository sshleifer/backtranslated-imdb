At the beginning of this movie, I doubted it would be a bit more than a regular B sci-fi flick. But as it progressed, I began to get interested and I saw the whole thing. The premise is interesting, original and has a classicization. Unfortunately, this mediocre movie was done by common factors that make a potentially good movie a bad movie (bad action, low budget, etc.). I am interested in how this would work if it were a good actor and a great Hollywood budget.
