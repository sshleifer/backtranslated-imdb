This is the worst film I've ever seen. This movie is so bad, bothered, sparse in appearance, ill-illuminated sets, ridiculous deeds, toddler and dirty, sequenced activities. About ten minutes. After that, you reach the remote control or power outlet to end the movie experience. Although it was obviously done with the collective production language of the production and actors on the cheeks (please God), I found that Jack Frost 2 is so terrible that it is invisible for more than a quarter of an hour. If you have not received enough time since then, you must be against drug abuse.
