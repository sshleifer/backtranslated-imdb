I've heard that Novot was compared to Memento because they both rely on the main characters with short-term memory loss. Well, it's like comparing the silence of lambs and Friday, 13th, when both made a character who killed several people. They can't be more distant. <br /> <br /> Novo is a cop copier in a company with short-term memory loss. Her consistently followed by another gentleman and her boss likes having sex with her in the office. In the year there will be a temp, who will be involved with him and may / will not use him for sex. Needless to say, she has a lot of sex on the sex screen. <br /> <br /> Wait, there's more. There's a boy who runs into a troubled amnesia man and it's obvious that this boy just bounces on him. And there is a laptop that the man tries to remember important tips. <br /> <br /> I admit that I am not one for foreign films. I do not mind reading the subtitles, but I mean that sometimes it removes one of my favorite films: a great dialogue. Since they have to translate or I can not understand most, I believe they will simplify what the characters have to say. This movie was no exception; the dialogue was just, blah. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it was interesting enough to keep me in 98 minutes. Weird, yes, but then again I don't live in France, so I don't know their likes / dislikes or lifestyle. (For example, I think this is acceptable if the father is lying with his son in the horse with his son, which must be a cultural thing.) Fortunately, this man was not 2 hours to look back on this man and move on to his treatment. toward. Because when the "secret" is learned, was I really? Well, then. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend somewhat decent action, good view and soft porn for sexuality (like every 2-4 minutes), but if you don't have this type of scene, I would always leave it slowly moving and memory between the restorative film.
