Scary, foolishly wrong film about corruption in Louisiana's buying and selling company. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the state of Louisiana seems to be corrupt and intuitive. A member of the English Department of the College can only sign with X. <br /> <br /> When it turns out that the directly investigated senator (Victor Moore) needs to be investigated, everyone in there is trying to blame the innocent but silly character of Bob Hope. <br /> <br /> Is it a wonder that in 1943 Vera Zorina did not receive part of Maria's "Who Does Someone's Tolls?" <br /> <br /> Of course, corrupt officials, along with Hope, are trying to show Zorina images to Moore to destroy him politically. Moore married the restaurant manager he had insulted when he demanded a ham sandwich. He thought the reason he was upset was that it was a Kosher restaurant. This is a sense of humor in this movie's absolute mess. <br /> <br /> When Hope tries to defend himself in Congress, he will start James Stewart's "Mr. Smith goes to Washington". By this time, the film is too much to find a good solution. <br /> <br /> Music and words are both absolutely terrible. This song, which praises Louisiana, was singing differently, is absolutely terrible. Irving Berlin had something to do with the music of this terrible movie?
