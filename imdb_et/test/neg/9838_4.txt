Here is a movie that was so pedestrian 90% that it had no right to get so complicated and depressing. Did the director suddenly decide to get an auteur, 80% through making this movie? Yeesh. SPOILER ALERT This thing usually starts for young people up to the age of 50; there are drifters, good girls, bad girls, gangs, kindly old canteen and city slippers. Things follow the expected path until about 15 minutes before the end, when the only pleasant character is killed and the hero is accused (it would not be so unexpected if it was the main plot of the movie ... but all this stuff will happen and untangle! Then things will become strange Kindly the old encoder forms a mob and wins the hero's bloody cellulose. The presence of a hero's friend somehow pushes the testimony of a true killer - resurrection, horrible city nut (whatever the real universe will soon be suspected, even if the anti-hero was found). <br /> <br /> We will be somewhat weak at the end of the remainder of the film with about 10 minutes of events. <br /> <br /> Even more strange is the demand for this movie to play homosexual enthusiasts, but by constantly presenting two men. Perhaps it was expedient - perhaps Bix's resistance to settling with the girl was more due to her sexuality (which should have been repressed in the 50s and should not be discussed or even recognized) if her need to be "drifting". If the director's intention was to spin it into sexual yarn, it would drift because he felt he had left sexually; that his fatherly attitude to Danny is not really a father but a husband; that his inability to stay with Carrie has been rooted in a sexual revolution that he doesn't even understand - it could have been clearer. Instead, we get this very strange homoerotic and behavioral alchemy that is completely heterosexual. <br /> <br /> These young men sleep side by side even when they get the space to spread it. When Danny is proposed (and once in bed with her wife), Bix slips out and takes her away. Danny pays Bix's way (sure there is another explanation for this, but it still strikes the chord every time Danny Bix buys lunch). Finally they live together. Not when Hitchcock's "Rope" has been so blatant in homosexuality, but denied it. <br /> <br /> MST3K did it right. In addition to Jack Elam, the film is not very commendable.
