I haven't laughed at the theater for years. The only problem is that the purpose of the film was not to make my throat laugh raw. <br /> <br /> This movie is completely full of bad CGI, absolutely awful dope, absolutely terrible * and enough geek references that make the whole thing down as a complete cheese. <br /> <br /> The player and geek-type girl myself knew all the obvious game references in this movie and also the geek STUFF, which was just a candy to the eye (Steamboy poster, t-shirts from Thinkgeek.com and j- list.com) and that didn't redeem the movie at all. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have been good was the types of ghosts that had been badly targeted by the CGI to make it look like they were out of the game and stolen by Japanese horror movies. <br /> Frankly, it was a lot of fun and something I'm looking for at the midnight TV show on the Sci-Fi Channel Movie. Don't wait any more and you have a great time. Just do not get the soda or spit it everywhere you get great features: "Why did you refer to this game in our life? WHY?!"
