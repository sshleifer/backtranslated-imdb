The "true story" (yes, the same thing that funded the Columbus expedition) of Katana's royal Isabella's oldest daughter, supposedly, is mapped to her moral obsession and degeneration with her husband, Philip's main district, Philip. known as "Handsome" (and which was inevitably played by the Italian stump Daniele Liotti, his most butterfly and chubby). It is the end of the 15th century, the beginning of the 16th century. intrigue, betrayal and looting. It drips from end to end to destructive desire. But when La Reine Margot succeeds in brutally looking at sensuality and merciless, throbbing intrigue, La Loca is simply not drawn. It just feels like a big budget soap opera, which is lower than average, lazy or too eager. Liotti looks positively boring and Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala in the title? although fair, can he ripe for the right talent? just seems to be trying too hard by turning back and fourth of the two-dimensional groove that spoiled the end of teenage hysteria. Some of the supporting pains are OK, except for Manuela Arcuri, another Italian pin-up, weird and beautiful, but not really an "actor" to talk about. In fact, I couldn't resist myself in any kind of character, nor did I feel I was strongly negative of any supposed villain. What is the waste of an important movie budget! Unfortunately, it is just as rhetorical and dance-dancing, dancing rather as a source of inspiration for other films than its source material - history. It seems to me that such an exciting and complicated historical era deserves a much higher filmmaker to wake it up.
