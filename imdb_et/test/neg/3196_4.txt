I saw a big movie about this movie I'll talk about later and then on the list, and I thought I could go. Basically, the common downward lucky bartender Randy (Matt Dillon), his stormy cousin Carl Harding (Paul Reiser) and the murder investigation of Detective Dehling (John Goodman), have seen their dream girl (whether married or not) and they would do something would like and be with him, even die. All three met / saw him "one night in McCool's", a bar that Randy worked for, they don't know each other, but not all three can stop thinking about Femme Fetale Jewel Valentine (Lord of the Rings Liv Tyler). All three tell their stories to someone they hope to listen to their rather intense and revealing stories. Randy speaks nicknamed Mr. Burmeister (Michael Douglas who made the film), Carl psychologist / psychiatrist Dr. Green (Reba McEntire) and Dehling's priest Jimmy (Richard Jenkins). They acknowledge all the details of what they are willing to do, their sexual contact with him, and finally they are all concentrated in one place, all with the intention of being with him and all those involved in the final shootout, leaving one dead, one escape (and finally dying) and one stunned and unexpected man whom he chooses (but at the same time obviously this is a sex-obsessed Douglas). Also starring Andrew Dice Clay in Utah / Elmo and Sandy Martin as Bingo Vendor Woman. If I had to pick a favorite moment, it would definitely be what was mentioned in 11 with the Cool Hand Luke of the 100 biggest sexy moments where Tyler copied a woman who washes cars all over her and Goodman was very sexy! Besides that, not the most memorable film. Okay!
