***** Classic **** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Tragic <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Grandma is not for everyone. It is a widespread violence, lively octopus eating and unimaginary story. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a person who has been kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years, released Oh Dae-Su to find that he must find his master within 5 days. Now, however, the story may seem startling, but after that swelling and looking at the original blood image, this bitter blood and powerful film will develop. <br /> <br /> Its management is average and by no means standards that South Korea's thriller should have. Oldboys scenes are parallel to dull humor and poorly written script. <br /> <br /> Oldboy is performed repeatedly with thin straw performances that can only be ashamed. <br /> <br /> Decision: <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, but its scope and vision are not clear enough to look farther than the fog in the gray abyss. <br /> <br /> * Tragic
