Like the beauty of the jungle, Jessica Alba sees a gorgeous smile and a funny film over the fabric, but unfortunately, the only two are worth watching. If theoretically we should look at the narrative. <br /> <br /> The piece is thin and hard to believe. As beautiful as Jessica Alba, she does not add any spark that she injected into a reliable "Dark Angel" series. From Dark Angel it seems that Alba is just a candy of the eye (but what's eye-catching!) Is the only reason she puts the movie. unlikely, of little nature (or its nature), that we would like to take this 109-minute driving time with this world. Despite the short working hours of the films, he still feels long and overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> It seems shameful that talents like Brenda Blethyn, Emily Mortimer, Bob Hoskins are wasted on a brutal narrative that barely raises the pulse. This film seriously loses trick, exotic environment, more than capable, beautiful cinematography, and the opportunity to use civilization themes and dualistic concepts. But there is little narration to talk about, not drama, any idea that we look at the story of love, more lust and a woman who rejoices men without questioning. Let's face it, if Jessica Alba allowed you to sleep with her freely, do you really think you can focus on learning a tribal language? There is a big problem in stopping both infidelity and what female characters are restricted and reduced. For example, take into account the fact that the character of Jessica alba passes through the mental and physical misery of pregnancy and her forbidden love, but all we see is her beautiful and curvy one minute, then cute and curvy, with a child, next. br /> <br /> This is a regrettable situation when you see that a movie with a promise does not live near that potential. I could write infinitely movie mistakes, but it does it to me. The film looks good, it might have been a beautiful film, but unfortunately it wasn't.
