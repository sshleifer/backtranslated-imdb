"Seven Returns" have some good scenes and Elmer Bernstein's score is as fast as ever. However, it is a boring film because it just doesn't let us get involved emotionally. The lack of Mcqueen really makes a bad impression, and the fact that his character here is played by another (little known) actor is strange - in a bad direction. No characters are developed so we don't contact them - and we hardly care if some of them die. This sequence is a satisfactory but poor imitation of the original.
