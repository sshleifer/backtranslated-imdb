This movie could have been a decent transformation and gosh knows it's been tried (or Ms. English sample). Creating talented films should be the creation of talented films with a successful and experienced writer / director. However, the experience of Mrs English - her IMDb bio - is confined to the work of television and is clearly evident throughout the film. found the most unlikely of this film and kept it even part of its potential: it seemed and seemed to be made for television. To give some credit to Mrs English, many of the jokes that just didn't work on the movie screen were terrible on TV (and maybe she would have laughed). So many camera uses and lighting would have played fine on TV but seemed uncomfortable or odd on a big screen. If the whole movie was cut into a mini-series or sit-com, I think it might have worked. But it is a cinema and unfortunately the English talent didn't interpret it. I scolded so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors and writers that I felt like I was out of the theater. Meg Ryan is his usual perky, cute himself (except for the terrible plastic surgery he has had on his face), but where was he able to use his talent? He has made films where he does not produce his stereotype role and did it well ... but not here. Annette Bening just seemed to be moving around - so great talent and so bad! I enjoyed other women in nature, but they were more cartoons than substance, and it was sad to see. What worked in this film in the 1930s does not come until the 2000s, and no one helped the pr. If only he (writer, director and producer) got help, then I think it might have been good. But that wasn't the case. <br /> <br /> It's so depressing to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director, and the feeling is that it's a waste of time and money! This New York comic that I saw yesterday is relevant: some movies are at the meeting and the caption says "Let's remake the classic worse!"
