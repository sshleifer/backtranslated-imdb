My spoiler is in my pants because thinking of this movie made me so angry that I was beating myself. <br /> <br /> When you finish watching it, you look at the TV in confusion and horror. Then your shoulder has a soft faucet and a voice hisses: "You will die within seven days." You turn around and one of your best friends is there for absolute hatred against what suggested this movie when you were Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> I don't lie: it's the worst movie on Earth. I saw it from 5 of my friends, all 18-year-old boys, and these were our reactions: -One person started to cry and punch himself - one person yelled and went out - one person got up and hit the door again for more than an hour later - One person just dazzled (it was me) - One person began to seize insecurely as if he was both a cerebral and a Tourette syndrome - one person went into some catatonic trance and did not answer our voice for more than twenty minutes <br /> > The movie is really so bad. There's one part where the retarded operator is actually traveling (holding the camera), but the manufacturers decided to leave it. Seriously, you hear him terribly and swear when he hits the ground. There is only one special effect, and it's special, as a slowed-down child trying to solve Rubix Cube is special: the camera rotates so that the action on the screen (action, n. Some muddles lost 80 in the corn field) freaking minutes) no barrel roll. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances should this be monitored, and the film itself warns you of this fact. Do you know what the reverse is? "Some warnings should not be ignored." I honestly believe that distributing this film to the public is a sick practical joke for producers. This does not mean, however, that you should pass it on when you see it in a movie shop - it would sit on another poor mammal's shelf. Rather, buy every copy of what you can get and send to the people you hate.
