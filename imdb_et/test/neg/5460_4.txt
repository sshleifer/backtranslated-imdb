I was also disappointed with this film. For starters, the things that happen to him do not seem too terrible for me (Sorry chauvinist PoV). As one of the ladies' prisoners said, "Most men __ pay to be in your position". To whom it responds "But this is not a _my_ option". OK, OK, a fair point, so how bad was it? Please let us know. But now kicker: He won't let _anyone know before the end of the movie (invisible). Not his girlfriend, not the mentor, not the police, no one. Instead, he will come up with a brilliant plan f * ck * ng for every girl she knows to know a tattoo (or something) of one of her prisoners. I thought she had enough sex in her captivity for just 12 days? Isn't it time to take a break? For me, he, to put it mildly, broke the badly-suggested actions of the "incredible stop" movie. I took the book when I looked at the corner of my eyes in the last half hour.
