I got a copy of this movie for my 21st birthday friend, which he probably bought for 99p from a favorable video line. <br /> <br /> I've never been so disappointed when I was watching a movie, it was annoying, Adam West was wasted (literally) and I can't remember it back retroactively. The lack of my enjoyment grew to such an extent that the second rolled credit crushed the cartridge and hung the tape around the living room. Just for a good measure we put the cover on.
