Froggie is upset that he never has a big party like any other child. Spanky and the gang are trying to fix it by giving him a surprise party. Don't know that all the decorations and preparations are for him Froggy sabotages everything just to find out too late that the party is for him. Bits are working, but I don't think it really works as a whole. The problem is that we all know where it goes and because a lot of humor needs some surprise to make it work. I think in a strange way the film is a kind of mistake. The kind of thing they actually thought could have been more than a false function. It's worth trying if you lower your expectations
