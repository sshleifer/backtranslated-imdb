With a strange coincidence, I have started this step right after watching Brice de Nice and it was good that many movies could not have been worse than Brice de Nice, so I was looking forward to something that would make me forget this terrible flop. 117 I'm disappointed again - I don't know, maybe it's just a translation issue, but since "Diner de Cons" I haven't seen any French comedy that I would call very good. Even when I look at IMDb comments, OSS-117 high notes are only given by people from France ... <br /> <br /> For me, this movie hasn't really worked - in some parts it's as funny as real Bond movies In other jokes were a bit too predictable or too horny.
