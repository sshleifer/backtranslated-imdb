I've seen several stages and adaptations to the film in Alice's wonderland, and it has to take the cake to the absolute worst. My family bought the DVD unexpectedly and couldn't even do it in the first half. Later I went back and forced myself to see the whole thing (it was a Christmas gift for me) and it was just terrible. <br /> <br /> The only redemption factor (and not enough to redeem the whole show) is Mark Lin-Baker, who plays Yiddish with a Yiddish turtle. This is one of the few moments that has a real charm and can be taken somewhat seriously. In addition, the songs are half-hearted, the melodies are half-hearted, and even Meryl Streep is unable to look good.
