Savage Steve Holland wrote and directed his second film, One Crazy Summer, John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong, once again in a supporting role. Cusack and Bobcat Goldthwait have recently graduated from Cape Codi to stay at Goldthwait's grandmother's summer. Along the way, they get to Demi Moore, followed by John Matuszak and a motorcycle gang. Soon these three have tried to save the house, which has become a lobster restaurant, with a spoiled family who keeps the "job" dirty. The film contains a number of funny vignettes such as the millionaire dollar radio gags and Godzilla skit. <br /> <br /> Like Holland's first film Better Off Dead, John Cusack adds immeasurably to the film. Otherwise, it is a film full of viable situations and idiotic characters (unlike originality). Moore sings a few bars at nightclub with some dreadful synthesizer. After some time, the Goldthwait gags and Armstrong were never a caliber actor who appeared to be something other than class Z stuff. The tow truck twins are extremely annoying and unpleasant when they are obviously intended. It is more a hit or a flaw, a kitchen sink comedy that could have used a better script and direction. * 1/2 of the four stars.
