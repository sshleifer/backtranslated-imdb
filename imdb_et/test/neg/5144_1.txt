Maybe the worst movie may be. At least plan 9 from space was funny. I can't believe they talked to someone to actually put that money down. Complete celluloid waste. Before that, I saw the respect of Christopherson. I think someone needed a tax deduction. Please stop for those who do not suck who did it before they suck again! This movie should be avoided by anyone who is not in the LSD, or by my mad cousin, who demands that we be part of Native American. If you're in the woods and the owl starts talking to you, see a psychiatrist. There's no need to make a movie about it.
