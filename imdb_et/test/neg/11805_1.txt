No one can say that I have not been warned because I have read comments (both user and external), but like most of us who attracted horror films ... curiosity got this cat. (Come on, we all scream the people of the movie, not to go into the dark room, but you know that horror aficionados always die to find out what's there, even if we know it's bad). <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this movie was angry with me. Not because it pretends to be real (who cares ... tricks are allowed) or because the actors and the dialogue are so flat (is it an unusual event in horror films?) Or even because the film is so bad (and I am polite here). What really got me crazy is that the movie is not just about taking BWP, but that it's a half-hearted lazy! <br /> <br /> I don't believe in holy cows and if they think they could be tempted by BWP, they didn't even try. The film made little effort and care, and it is the most frightening sin in horror (or any) movie!
