Do the following: Get a copy of this movie and your friend. Make a friend $ 10 so they can't sit through this movie. They can't direct their gaze or disturb anything. Now look at your friend. Win or lose, you get $ 10 for entertainment. <br /> <br /> It frustrates me infinitely when people see the movie and give it quickly to 10, or sum up their thoughts to "suck". . (And when asked "Why?", Then they react: "That's why." Arrgh.) That's why this movie is there. My only goal is to say, "It's! It's a terrible movie! It's one in ten!". <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> In recent trends, movie parodies have forced them to become more formal, this film does not match every aspect. That's not funny. It's not fun. And for some parodies it's totally inaccurate! Terrible action. Unknown dialogue. A pointless story. Terrible "special effect". One INANE gag after another. And to make things worse, there is not even free, free nudity, which makes it even more valuable. <br /> <br /> This movie jumps from idiot, stumbles over the fools and lands first on the moron. Even me, who loves good "control of his brain door," found himself physically irritated by looking at it. This movie is not even a "hard ticket to Hawaii" so terrible-it-good bad ... it's very bad. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I really challenged a friend to look at it as described above. Not only could she do it completely, but she had a headache and she needed a few minutes later because she felt a little sick. True story. <br /> <br /> I couldn't stress this rating any more ... 10 out of 10!
