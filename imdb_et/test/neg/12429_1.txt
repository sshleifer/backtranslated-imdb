Something strange is happening in Loch Ness. Water is crystal clear or cold. Huge robotic plastic monster comes up and kills Scottish! What is this movie? First of all, I love to read stories about Nessie, the sea monsters in general. When I saw it for sale, I thought it was a cheap hanging of jaws. No. It was terrible! The story was meaningless, 100% garbage, the only side was the cold mechanical Nessie they used. It was full of inaccuracies, wrong locations, and bad things. Not worth your time, just leave it on the shelf (or garbage). According to another comment, this film was filmed in Cailifornia, not in Loch Ness, which was great for Nessie fans.
