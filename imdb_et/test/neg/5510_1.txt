Really terrible. Obviously, Star Wars is trying to make money, but there is no excuse for this shining garbage. The style goes missing before the middle, the characters are forgotten and the child is such a non-talent that everything he does is a camera. The alien planet they land on is actually naval stocks at Long Beach, California. <br /> <br /> This movie made me physically bad to watch it. <br /> <br /> During his career, Roger Corman has made some good movies, but there is no excuse for it. <br /> <br /> 0/10 - IMDb won't let you reset.
