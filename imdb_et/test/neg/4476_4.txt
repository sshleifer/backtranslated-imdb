Talk about your nature. Hardly a B movie, but what hay ... horn and lesbian sex. According to writer and director Cody Jarretti, this is fun fun. A chemical company throws waste from fish farming that causes mutants. Hot Kristi Russell stars like dr. Barbara Michaels, EPA agent sent to investigate this environmental dilemma. He just happens to enter into a lesbian relationship with barman Trixie (Ariadne Shaffer) and their love scenes are about as good as this movie. The human-sized frog encourages chaos; causes a car accident, rape a chief of the chemical industry, raping a girl in a football game in a football match, rigid with a runner in a football game, rape a nun ... before being shot twice under the chest, the antidote was found to be ready. Special Effects ... well, not special; a boy in a rubber frog without showing the genitals himself. Do you still want to watch it? Go ahead, but admit the bribe.
