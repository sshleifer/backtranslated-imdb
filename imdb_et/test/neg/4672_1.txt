I like action movies. I have a bad dialogue and softspot for a wooden "B" clip. So, I have imprisoned my brain to come up with one of my guilty pleasures that was worse than buggy. I can not. It would be hard for you to put most of the cr * p than this Bruce Willis vehicle. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is a story (and I use this concept loosely) by the Super-Drillers team. "flies down to destroy the asteroid before it destroys Earth. Realistic? Not quite. But who cares? It's glowing. I'm not exploding. <br /> <br /> Small spoilers: <br /> <br / > The film starts with a couple of scenes designed to introduce the threat and characters Bruce Willis is the leader of the team's tough nails, and he spends his first bit of time on Ben Afflec with a weapon to forgive his daughter to sleep, for some reason it didn't make me laugh. It was forced, like everything in this movie. <br /> <br /> The team is invited because they are the only people in the world who can drill an asteroid. Okay, I'm ready to accept this assumption when it reaches us - the expected meat in the movie More events for humor, where every character goes crazy, nuts before the crazy bounce. Again, flat. Finally, they get off. Here's where the movie really came out. They reach the stone and work. Would you believe it, nothing works right and everything k is in the background with a stop !!! Who is! Ten, nine, eight ... one - Oh, a surprise surprise that we saved a day ago! <br /> <br /> And I don't even start with dirty camera work. When I saw it in the theater, I thought I was sick. I can only assume that they are trying to cover the spectacular performances that have been missed by uncomfortable performances by cutting off a different picture after a few seconds (and from someone who raised MTV - Mr. short attention). <br /> <br /> Just when I thought it wasn't going to get worse ... wait - there's a tear-jerker that's been made to hit, making the rest of the movie a virtual citizen. <br /> <br /> Summary: Witticisms were not wise. Plot - well, I said I'll let this go. Operation was bad. Really bad. Even Billy Bob couldn't get higher than the script, which was worse. Camera work - again bad. (I didn't even mention a loving scene from dumbs in the history of movies - think about animal cartoons). <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10. (I'll give Steve Buscem a half point that will make me smile against my will and half a while I was able to watch the beautiful Liv Tyler and try to ignore his exemplary performance. This is by far the worst movie I saw in the theater ... ever.
