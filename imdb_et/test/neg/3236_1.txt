Was it a film based on a novel written by a modern literary god, Koontz? I refuse to believe that this studio bought the rights to this movie using the Genius' name of Koontz. Since my eye was big enough to require a great print, I haven't read this book because I was at least twice a year since first reading. I missed the book a lot and couldn't find it in a big print. <br /> <br /> I was hoping to rent this movie, at least to get my substitute observer pleasures, but this movie was travesty. Due to fine plot points, none of the books by Mr. Koontz, or the most decent authors for it, seem to me to be compressed for 1-2 hours. <br /> <br /> This is a clever network, cable or other wizard who buys the rights of this novel and makes this book a multi-part TV movie, a mini-series, right! <br /> <br /> One letter out of five - could I downgrade ...
