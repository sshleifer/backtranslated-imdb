20 people rated it 10! This ballot box was filled better than Christmas. Talking about turkeys, here is a traditional story that hopes to get the current craze of poker back to piggy - without success. I said completely about a linear setback and when I say "I said" I mean WALKING to DEATH, this movie will never let a picture be used if the words can be used to display. <br /> <br /> Stu Unger's childhood admiration with maps and his associations with hoodlum could be an interesting film material, but the director manages to take them out. Under no circumstances did I know Unger, which is a genius on maps that threw it on all other forms of gambling where he was not so overwhelming. Of course, this will lead us to triple musical assembly, the inevitable downward spiral of drugs, the disappearance of the family, and eventually his redemption (sort of). Great awakening!
