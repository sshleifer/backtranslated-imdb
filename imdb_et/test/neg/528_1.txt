I wasted 35 minutes of my life on this turkey before I gave up. The main character is completely helpless and amazingly insecure, but his resentment is not humor. As soon as he arrives in Germany, the screenwriter draws an old "there is only one room, you have to share a room with a beautiful girl" stunt. Come on, at least you could let them develop their relationships a little earlier. See "It happened one night" to see how to do it right - or thousands of movies since then. <br /> <br /> The actor is constantly in tertiary level and the improvised dialogue should have remained on the floor of the cutting room. It tends to be without a plan at all, despite the fact that the film telegraphs the destination of the relationship from the moment Greta is introduced. <br /> <br /> The first song at the table is a little funny, but a bad song. The rest of the songs (well, to be fair, I only heard them in the first half of the year) are just pointless and terrible. Most singers are painfully tuned, but in no way deliberately humorous.
