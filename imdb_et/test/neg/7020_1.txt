This movie was so terrible, so boring, so badly failed - it took a lot of work to do such a travesty for sure. I love Lucille Ball, but she was completely in that movie. Too old, unable to sing, sounded like a truck dump even when NOT singing - and the biggest sin of all - he wasn't kidding. NOT LITTLE. The studio walked on foot with this leg, and to destroy this fabulous screen version of the music of a fabulous performance, some other parts of the body deserve to be wounded - or maybe they had already lacked these parts. This may explain it. But if Lucy thinks she has the right to be a part of SINGING, that's the saddest thing. It is very good to know your limitations. Even a legend can't get out of such a stinker and still smells like a rose.
