Well, every one of you, but I thought that Gibson's Hamlet was the most divine-terrible delivery that I had ever seen ... as subtly nuanced as a paper bag, and inspired by telemarketing speech. The only reason I looked at the end of the movie was that I kept the hope that it would heal or unintentionally funny. No luck. <br /> <br /> There is no disrespect for casting a cast or Zefferell's performance, but nothing can break the protagonist. I've seen Hamlet well-pictured as an African princess, an animated lion as a harsh and foolish warrior, a romantic poet, and so on. But IMHO's portrayal was just a lack of wealth with the weakest hams.
