I hate this movie !!!!!! I've never seen such a perfect trash bin ever! I live in France, so it turned out I was at the forefront of watching this terrible movie. First it seemed cool, like something damn about the wood that rubs people. Unfortunately, it turned out to be something different: a good start for a girl who meets a boy, and all that is not, a girl gets threatening messages hidden in her bathroom cabinet (ridiculous). And onward, the movie starts to slip downhill very quickly, with a lot of despair in the thrashing process. The movie ends with sacrificial druid and old ugly, smelly creatures who come back from the past to kill some people. Then I started to ask a lot of questions with my head: why do they bring the hell out of this ghostly monster? Do druids look like maniacs dressed in linen? Why did they even bother doing this movie? The "climax" of the movie was so funny that I smiled through it: "terrible" smelly monster fights two young women (who seem to be kung fu masters) and the professor slips into two or something. What surprised me that the monster was so slow and involuntary in battle, wasn't it supposed to be a god of war or something? Anyway, it was a bad thing to kill the movie. Short condensation on the contents of this movie: Kung fu chaos + druid stones + mysterious murders "Ã  la thriller" + ancient prophecies + dirty devils + old clumsy boneless war god + nutty professor = complete and perfect, sick, boneless, worm eaten, GODFORSAKEN, GODDAM, GODDAM , USED, FAKE, WANNABE, LUDICROUS SH * T !!!!!!!!! Things I learned from this movie: - Old war gods are negligible at kung fu. - All young women studying archeology in France are kung fu experts. -The professors are so durable that they can survive if they are cut into two from the harvest material without injury.
