Val Kilmer is almost anywhere in this movie - he likes it! He may play 30 seconds of screen time and his role is completely irrelevant. After seeing the movie, I couldn't tell you what role he plays in the movie !! ?? OK ... they suck you in the first hour, immersing you in dark underground tunnels. Spooky movies shot in dark underground tunnels suck most people for the last 30 minutes to an hour. Then you start thinking, "Why am I watching this?" I remember how easy it is for a driver / writer to use a dark underground labyrinth to make a movie. Just shoot people in the dark tunnels and have an immediate "break". But this is where this movie goes! We all know what's going on at night, but there's nothing in the dark, but darkness. The story is even worse. Apparently, the film is based on the film that I learned from the "after" film. However, the film uses such a poor dialoug that it has not been obvious during screening. I still don't understand what the writer / director wanted to say. Some children underneath the earth under the misleading sister in Russia? Why? Are they in our time - at the same time as the characters? Are they ghosts? <br /> <br /> It was an absolutely terrible movie that drew me to write my first IMDb review to warn others to avoid it.
