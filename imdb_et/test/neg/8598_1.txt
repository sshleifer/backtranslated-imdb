The most uncomfortable so-called comedy I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> In no way is it fun to bold Twin Town's naturalness <br /> <br /> Vegas I, as usual, but this script is so terrible predictable so well in English in the worst way (in recent years all these English movies were terribly big). Ireland made at least commitments, the big films of Braveheart and Trainspotting 2 in Scotland stand out, and Wales had a twin city, Zulu, the last days of Dolwyn, Torchwood, Doctor Who and Under Milk Wood and so on. <br /> <br /> Comedy is a number of colors, actors are dead men, because there is no characterization and originality, and it's just so unusual <br /> England is left behind, no matter how gloomy the bottom the movies they produce. This is an old-class system that destroys English movies. Oxbridge graduates endlessly created clich√© scripts for working class people they never lived with. It's pathetic. Monty Python was not funny and nothing about Oxbridge. <br /> <br /> Let Jonny Vegas and Peter Kay, Rob Brydon, Billy Connolly, or write your own dialogue and forget that the archaic unsuccessful class system lets people in the working class and the real talent that goes through the system will be written over and British and English film industry rises again, what next Prince Edward writes about today's Oliver Twist?
