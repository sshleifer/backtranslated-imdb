One thing I've noticed about the British horror movies in the 1970s is that they don't stick to repeated viewing. Add a counter to the list <br /> <br /> A large part of the drama of this movie rotates around the plot at the end of the revelation. If you know what revelation is, it becomes quite flat. It opens up with a pretty good hook, but after that, it is processed with the long everyday conversations of the two old women. Correct me when I'm wrong, but how many people watch the horror movie, waiting for a few old women to talk a little? The only interest in smoking is ONLY in the HIGH City. Some people have mentioned it is an anti-war or anti-war movie, but watch carefully and you will see that every time a squaddie comes on, he can kill. Rather odd, given the attitudes towards smoking, it was not as hysterical as it is today
