Uggh! Hanna-Barbera in the 60s and 70s! What are the horrendous and invisible cartoons that these cages brought us! In fact, it is a shame, as "Hanna-Barbera" meant quality in the 1940s and 1950s - because they made so many great Tom and Jerry cartoons. However, due to the major cost-cutting efforts of the late 1950s, cartoons generally became poor and budgets were cut. In fact, MGM was fired by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera and replaced by a team of Czech animators who had never seen the original cartoons! So at the end of the 50s, the team was at work and decided "if you can't win", join "em" - and started making terrible little cartoons - with terrible animation, backgrounds and writing. /> <br /> It's unfortunate, but the team's crappy cartoons worked too well --- making them rich and the most successful drawing artists in the 60s and 70s. During this time, poor production values ​​were once again the norm and a long list of very forgetting cartoons was created. In this case, the incredibly bad INCH HIGH PRIVATE EYE - a totally unforgettable and stupid idea. If you want to know what the exhibition was, the title says it all. <br /> <br /> Rotten to the core and strong evidence that our production team had complete disdain for our children!
