First, it has nothing to do with Kung Fu's 18 best weapons in Gordon Liu. I mention this when my Kung Fu theater introduces a DVD to a completely misleading picture on the cover, a false plot on the back and continues to mention (no idea why) Young hero starring Hwang Jang Lee. In addition to the introduction to the history of the 18 weapon styles that the monk speaks to when opening certain children, and the usual mysterious handbook that everyone has, the weapons are never reappeared and the struggles are all boxing. The hero is Lee Shao Hwa, whom I have never heard before or from any other participant. The film mentions another director, Wu Yuen Link, and one IMDb list. Other actors include Wang Fu Quen, Wang Wing San, Chen Fei Fei, Wang Ki San, Suen King Kai and Hwa Yue Suen, who look after the footsteps of the film. The struggles are reasonable and frequent, but not big and the stars don't have much charisma. The end result is just a fool, and the film seems to end sharply as if it were boring with it. River landscapes and training sequences are slightly different than usual. Unfortunately, a pretty sister dies not a very irritating (though acrobatic) boy.
