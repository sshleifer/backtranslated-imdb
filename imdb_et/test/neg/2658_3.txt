With so much great chemistry between Kristen Scott-Thomas and Harrison Ford, but every time the story of their relationship began to gather momentum, the script cut off and engaged in some irrelevant sub-plot that didn't do anything for that story. Indeed, the sub-blocks had no story at all. They were similar to commercial breaks where you looked at the trailer of another movie. <br /> <br /> The writers (or someone who checked the writers) obviously did not trust themselves to write a convincing relationship and the inner life of their characters. They seemed uncomfortable, except when they threw in some battles and bar fighting. Or maybe they did not trust the audience to pay attention to the story of a man and a woman trying to understand their relationship in difficult circumstances. After all, we all know how boring "Casablanca" was. Perhaps, if the relationship between Kay and the Netherlands were more developed and allowed to play, the writers would have known how to end the story. This movie is disappointing that it doesn't do more with its great actors who gave good results but could have done more with a better script.
