This is a typical college comedy and its average. The story is OK, but not very fun. Its about an unhappy man named Reno, who loses his job, gets his car ripped off and then his uncle dies in the stripbar. She got a girlfriend (nice btw. :-). Anyway this uncle will give him his lord LA and mercedes legacy and soon Reno and his girlfriend will move to LA for this new house. The problem is that they need some roommates to pay the high rent for this house, so the movie opens ... <br /> <br /> The movie starts with OK and has some funny jokes here and there, but suddenly the movie takes a turn straight to hell ... The end is BAD. Really BAD. It destroys everything about the movie. You know what I'm talking about when you see a movie ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
