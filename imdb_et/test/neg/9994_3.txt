In this film, you are invited to look at going into moral and emotional functions that do not want to start. What was the idea of ​​making a movie then? To show that it would have been better to be in COLD BLOOD - a book I admire, otherwise, to keep the integrity of our hero healthy? Hardly. At the beginning of the film, he behaves in a party exactly as he does after reading his triumph from the book, so that his decomposition is a matter of degrees. Should we take enough care of Capote to take seriously his claim that he and the murderer Perry Smith are relatives spirits, the first being all breaks when the latter was not? The situation of Mr Capote did not touch me at all, I am afraid, so if it was a central idea, it was wasted for me. But even if I could understand why filmmakers visited us with this pointless project, it would be boring, as he did. Hoffman gives a bravery to the emotional impact, while Keener and Cooper are so warm and interested that I missed them more. Scary disbelief.
