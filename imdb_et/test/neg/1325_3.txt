I don't know, maybe I just didn't have such a movie in the mood, but it was full of loyal melodrama. It was too long and seemed at least somewhat scattered (given, I didn't pay much attention ...). For a more entertaining description of the Battle of Stalingrad, see Enemy at The Gates. True, some pretentious people scare it because it's a Hollywood movie, and don't show a "war-sharp reality" like this "wonderful foreign film", but it's a better stream and is just more fun to watch. In addition, there are already enough "sharp" warfare films, and it seemed to be amateurish. But hey, you like it, so go straight on; it just wasn't for me.
