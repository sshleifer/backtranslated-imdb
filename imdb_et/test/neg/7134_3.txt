I liked the first The Grudge. It really pulled me out and had something that made me want to see it twice. It continued to do something about it. There was no creativity, nothing new or original, not something that really sticks to your mind. People are dying because the shadows are a scary ghost and boo says. And most of the time it wasn't even so scary. <br /> <br /> Drawing this movie is a dead end. Amber Tamblyn is a good actor but he was not given anything to do and Karen's death seemed really unsatisfactory because it came so fast. I was also disappointed at Kayako's mother sub-site. I thought he might give some way to fight, but he dies in hand - hair? - Kayako. It was such a stupid twist. All in all, it is difficult to recognize the signs you know in a few minutes. Everything is in the same way. And they can't do anything. It does not recognize these cruel destinies. It's just boring because you know what's going on. If they had something to fight against it, it would have been added even if they failed. If there was hope, it would make fear more legitimate. Now you expect them to die. <br /> <br /> Kayako was really scary on the first film, but this time we saw him too many times and it took part in it. I was still scared in some scenes, but I used to be familiar with the eye and blue. Of course, the makers realized that this would happen if they added other scary ghosts. Yes, I was afraid of the school psychologist's scene - even when I knew where it was going, as soon as he said, "I've been to the house". Nice touch. But Toshio wasn't scary at all in this movie. The non-blue Toshio was much more black with my eyes and the empty foam that first appeared in the first film. The blue boy, sitting in the corner, does nothing for me. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters seemed really unnecessary - the infamous milk picture of a girl I don't even remember. I'm not afraid it was just "Huh?" I'm not sure if the schoolgirls were really necessary. Karen could have brought grace to the US. It could have killed people related to their lives, everyone at a funeral or something like that. However, it would have been boring to see them all die, but it was really annoying to introduce so many independent people. I hated the "I don't call you mom" scene. The questions of Aubrey's mother were equivalent. The little boy was a sign. <br /> <br /> The Ju-On sequel was much more frightening. For example, there were some new twists - dreams and reality blurred a lot more - and even if it was a bit behind me, I was somehow satisfied. I have to think a little and think. This movie only gave cheap fears.
