Being one of the founders of my regions, an attractive film club (including the monkey / chimps and the orangutan), I look at this film from a non-human film perspective. After that, all the monkeys have a summer, 100+ day monkeys to do what they do best, cause mischief, shenanigans, hyjinx, solve human problems and teach us about ourselves. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough. In short, the poor boy needs the money he wants. Fortunately, there are some monkeys (chimpanzees) who have the head to get the blood of Boba Fett or the dog (Duane Chapman). As the boy tries to catch the monkeys, he learns himself, his family, grandfather, the local weird, flirting with a girl who is twice as old, and learns to deal with temptations of the beast that someone is pointing to them a shotgun. br /> <br /> There's a problem there. So much focus is on the boy that chimps just can't get the time they want. Chimps is not as talented as chimp (s) playing Jack M_P in trilogy or legendary orangut playing Dunstin or Clydet (1 or 2). So don't look at this movie that is waiting for the next big thing in the Chimpi genre. Chimps hit some sweet flaps that the film needs more. A copy of the poor family is an epic scene and destroys everything they did so hard. Serious monkey movie lovers alone want to rent a movie for this scene. <br /> <br /> So closing the movie is not a serious monkey movie enthusiast. I do not recommend this film to families because it encourages the child to rebellion against their parents. I can only recommend this movie for renting adult monkeys and rented children.
