* SPOILERS! * When I saw this preview, it looked like a good old-fashioned feature film. I love bluegras music so I couldn't see it. When we rented the movie, we read back and it sounded even better. The film was pretty boring in the first half, every time and then the song. Then (I write it embarrassed) came the love of the lesbian I saw. I thought it was more than friendship with friends, but I certainly didn't expect nudity and longer-term sessions. I watched it with my mother and I was quite embarrassed because I chose this movie. But besides that, it was a good movie. The actor was good, the actor playing from Delad was great. Frankly, the soundtrack was the best part of the movie. I don't care to see the movie again, but I bought the soundtrack one day after seeing the movie. Subsequent extension plates. If I were you, I would skip the movie and just get the music.
