The Petites Coupures plot was definitely a surprise to the observer. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> After 48 hours, Auteuil's teenager loses her wife's affection, trying to beat Scott Thomas to continue catching another female character The rear of the car and then finally strikes his trouble. <br /> <br /> End of spoiler *** <br /> <br /> wha ??? <br /> <br /> The only rescue arm in this flick is Kristin Scott Thomas. Like Charlotte Rampling, she seems to be * natural * in the French cinema. I hope that one day Fran√ßois Ozon may point him out where he can show his true talent. <br /> <br /> There are some good French movies, such as the remarkable Le Colonel Chabert, who is asking for a DVD. that is what is chosen. <br /> <br /> Avoid this. <br /> <br /> zzzz ..
