Usually, if I don't see the sample in the original race, I'll find it later with a cable and realize it's a pearl. "Gimore Girls" is one of those rare exceptions. I'm glad I missed that. <br /> <br /> I really despise exhibitions that fill the room of actors every minute with rambling, stupid, boring torments. That's one hour just about that. Mother, Lorelei, made me wonder if she was bipolar and her lithium. He never stopped talking; every minute every second, talking to every person with whom he or she communicated. Worse still, his speech is childish and soooo, like Valley Girl. He talked about men, hair, mother, clothes. Like, what is sitch? (situation). I watched this example three times and still can't get the point on this series. It's not comedy, it's not drama, it doesn't make any sense, except for three generations of women in one family like "Girls" from Planet Mars. The men in the comparison are intelligent and show this play. When Lorelei ever existed and tried to stop me from talking, I have to get rid of her. Obviously, he doesn't know how to talk and listen to someone else. He also does not know how to really notice the existence of others. <br /> <br /> In one show, Lorelei comes home from 10am. He got the date when he followed the man who met at the auction. She goes to her daughter's room, where her daughter asks how it went. He talks about how the boy was bored. His date somehow got some words. Lorelei complained about how the man was not talking about talking. Hopefully we managed to find out how happy it was. <br /> <br /> Another person commented on how mother behaves like a teen and her daughter is an adult personality. Lorelei even dresses like her boyfriend. It's probably 40-something mother dresses and looks like she hit the mall with her high school palettes. <br /> <br /> I thought that "Just shoot me" would have followed this show because it was exactly what I felt.
