This movie was terrible. It's that simple. It's actually the first time I left early. This turned out to be okay: I had a very nice conversation with the two most charming girls when we all waited to finally give up the mess they called "movie". <br /> <br /> Where to start. Bad behavior, bad jokes. Faecal humor that I just can't stand. Sorry, the tatt, pee and dwarf are not * funny. Have you seen the headline? This scene pulls for nearly 5 minutes, with two "heroes" striking and distorting each other, which should be humorous in itself. It is not like that. <br /> <br /> In addition to body fluids, violence and baptism, you don't remember much. At least not much good. I was really disappointed with this garbage. Or let's face it here: considering that I'm really a big fan of "British" (ie black) humor, I was angry. <br /> <br /> So, do you want my advice? Three words: don't look.
