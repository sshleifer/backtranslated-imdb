I was a Buffy fan and hoped it would end correctly when Angel got another season. But when the end came closer, I stayed with it. And what did we get? This episode called "NOT FADE AWAY" was the last one. <br /> <br /> This episode was so disappointed. This is the worst way for this series. Why didn't he get a happy ending? Why were some of the main characters dead? Why didn't Angel Become a Human and reunited with Buffy? No. The angel must sign this blddy piece of paper that he never becomes a human. How stupid it is and <br /> <br /> The end is a rocker. <br /> <br /> What could have been worse? The Buffyshow started as big as Angel, but the hole in the Universe ended so dirty. Someone should put the man who wrote the episode of the episode and make sure he disappears into hell. <br /> <br /> So don't bother watching it, it's so bad, it's painful! Totally one in 10.
