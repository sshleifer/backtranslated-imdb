I just finished Watch Watch. I thought some of the film was more than some unlikely. Operation was not too bad and the plot was not bad. IF, as they say, there was a devil in the details. <br /> <br /> Some examples: <br /> <br /> 1) The bleeding of Charlie Falon's (Sam Elliott) bandage came from behind the arm when it was his fingers that were bleeding. <br /> <br /> 2) Would a detective destroy his murder victim from a very well-lit area? It seemed very silly to me. <br /> <br /> I am not unusually funny about the film, but in my humble opinion it is definitely not recommended for me.
