After an intriguing start, this little drama quickly falls into the ranks of mediocrity. The beginning of the film shows that two women (Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner) meet each other as they wait for their boys to come home during their holidays. Natasha Gregson Wagner is a beautiful looking actress and she plays Louise; a cute girl whose beloved boy is all round the entertainer; the music, the movies you call it, do it. Although she talks to another girl, Carla (Heather Graham), about her wonderful boyfriend, it soon turns out that the similarities between these two male friends are too many ... and it is obvious that two girls are the same guy. Heldeke. Enter Robert Downey Jnr, two girlfriends, while some poor guy somewhere goes without it. Downey plays such a guy as women, but men find reluctantly annoying; he is basically a mummy boy. The worst is also; the phone sounds like a mother all the time, constantly showering her girlfriends with ambitious (though empty) promises etc. It is enough to make a normal man sick. <br /> <br /> The film deliberately hangs the triangle of triangle love films like Jules et Jim. This movie doesn't work; mainly because this story is so incredible. Seriously, when two women just discovered they were the same guy ... they didn't talk about it. The other reason why it falls is that it is just that complicated. The end result of this film is not over, especially with the claustrophobia that this little apartment puts in; but all the films disappear in the masses of dialogue; a poorly written and poorly communicated dialogue, ie. The film is also massively articulated; it is simply not plausible for people to act in such a movie after they have found themselves in such a situation. Robert Downey Jnr is one of many things wasted in movies. With Natural Born Killers he proved that he could give great performances and that is what this film could do. These two women are not wasted because no one has expected anything anyway, but Downey would definitely be better off. In general? Waste of time. Don't worry, look at Jules et Jim or Natural Born Killers instead. This is my advice.
