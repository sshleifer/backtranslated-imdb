The third and final big screen from the very popular ITV sitcom of the early 1970s, HOLIDAY ON THE BUSES is just as durable and crude as the previous two efforts, and looking from the perspective three and a half decades later, it is truly in mind that even one movie was produced in this franchise. <br /> <br /> As a plot, Stan Butler (Reg Varney), his conductor Jack (Bob Grant) adventures and their terribly autocratic inspector Blake (Stephen Lewis) after receiving their bags from their usual workstations at the bus station. find a job with similar posts in a holiday camp with the Stan family (Doris Hare, Anna Karen, Michael Robbins). <br /> <br /> British cinema had earned a high reputation in the 1960s with a remarkable reputation, but much of it was due to American financial support and guidance, which unfortunately approached in the late 1970s. very few episodes) became as rare as Mick Jagger in a stable marriage, and Britain's cinema went through cheap budgets, foolish and pointless sex comedies (CONFESSIONS series, COME PLAY WITH ME) and loose, elongated cellulite versions for various TV shows. most of the time (this is one of many outrageous examples). Only DAD'S ARMY and PORRIDGE came in quite respectfully in this respect, the first success of the first ON THE BUSES movie (it was in 1971 pointless to think now!) Led to two successive queues. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the TV series itself was a cheerful, mature, non-PC vulgarity that was reasonably tolerated in the half-hour sitcom format, but reaches three times the length of patience that goes beyond patience. It is ironic that HAMMER FILMS gave this endeavor because it almost resembles a horror film literally: ancient stumps, attacked, poorly timed blow and terrible, poor production values. <br /> <br /> Sending cheese to the British camp camp is here completely lost to the above-mentioned elements, and the most bizarre, if not terrifying, to see the obviously 50-year-old Varney and nose-nose, a long tooth Grant, who can instantly win the youth women hardly in the early twenties, while laughing constantly with their tenderness and flat jokes. Wilfrid Brambell's (STEPTOE AND SON) aging Miss Hare romance also doesn't help, and even if the film lasts about 1 and a half hours, it quietly pulls to a depressing degree. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this latest film in this most terrifying film trilogy and TV series ended at the same time, with the aftermath (DON'T REALLY WATER, which the critics shone and ignored by the audience) in 1975. Most of the leading players were not seen much later, but the worst affected was Bob Grant. with other mental problems for many years suicide in 2003. A sad coda sitcom, which was the most popular of this era (it is not outdated too well), and should have stayed the way, not three financially successful but artistically hopeless big screen hybrids that diluted this TV colleagues happy memories and random values. <br /> <br /> RATING: 2 and 10 out of 10.
