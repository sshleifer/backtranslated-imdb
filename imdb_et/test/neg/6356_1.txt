My first question is not a terrible act, not a scary writing, it's management. The cinematic choices are some of the worst decisions I've ever seen. Why does every single bad boy have to move slowly? I started hitting myself with a rubber hose. Camera shots do it so you don't see what's going on. I was just about to turn this movie off because of Jalal Merhi's accent when it put a sex scene so I thought it might get better, but it wasn't. If you rate the special effects on the A, B, C rating scale, do I have it around W or so, and did I mention the actor? Wow, it was bad! And all of the experience of "Waiting for a DIE" is the blatant misuse of vocabulary, "MATRIX JUST GOT DEADLIER". comparing this movie with the Matrix is ​​just a WORST comparison I've seen. If you haven't seen this movie, don't if you're not looking for a good reason to win your head against the wall.
