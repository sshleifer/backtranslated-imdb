I've seen this movie twice, once a couple of years ago in college and again this weekend. Although I despised this for the first time, I decided to give it another chance. Terrence Malick is an obviously recognized director and it seems that IMDb viewers think at least very much about the film. But unfortunately, it seems that my taste hasn't changed at all. <br /> <br /> Where to start? First, the story of Linda Manz is terrible. His voice is so irritating with such a terrifying New York accent (do not try to convince me that they are talking in Chicago - they are not). She admitted she was just sitting and talking about random things that didn't make her a talented actor. He doesn't even work! I came to IMDb, waiting for him to split because his presentation is just so ridiculous, but people seemed to like it! He's just unappealing in every way - I kept hoping for Malick just to kill him. The other actors were good, but certainly nothing special. Adams was probably the strongest, but he also had the only decent part. Except the old boy - he was pretty good. <br /> <br /> How could the Shepard character be so ridiculously stupid? He bought the "brother and sister" act because ... why would he buy it? Bill and Abby made every effort to be funny, as if they did not realize that their life depended on very platonic behavior. It was just incredible. And finally, after a considerable time, the farmer suddenly realizes that "Oh God, they're together!" Then he goes with Bill with a gun, but he seems to be driving Bill and coming to the mortal wound. <br /> <br /> Talking about the foolish (and bold) character of the characters, I say lazy). Of course Bill must die - can it be more boring than getting a police pond? Abby continues her happy life, arrives at the train and feels really calm about how things worked. And the ugly narrator finds his dead friend by chance and they are traveling to the sunset. But that's okay because Malick never gave me any reason to deal with the characters. <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, this film draws endlessly, with no real plot twist or no development. I can't believe it's just 94 minutes - I could have sworn to sit in my seat for 3 hours. Sudden rose damage was like throwing the Bible on my face; I'm completely metaphors and clues, but it was completely up. It is clear that the message was, "Do not marry for money or bad things happen to you." Very original. <br /> <br /> I understand that "Heavenly Days", like all Terrence Malick's films, is a work of art. And I definitely agree that cinematography is just stunning and magic hour shots add a unique aura to the film. But I have more than nice pictures to enjoy the movie, and it just didn't do it for me.
