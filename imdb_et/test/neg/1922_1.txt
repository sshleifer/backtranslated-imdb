*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** HERE / (2000) 1/2 * (out of four) <br /> <br /> Mark Piznarski's "On the Ground" movie containing the most recycled material 96 within minutes. In the literal sense, every contest, cliche, and familiar plot is here somewhere; there is not just something unique, original or fresh. God, what a tempting film is over; I wish I saw the movie during my theatrical performance last year, so it could have been on my worst list of years. This is a movie where the story makes itself immediately apparent and goes down the opening credit, and the worst, takes it seriously. "Here on Earth" is probably one of the most frightening, painful movies that will come to pike in a while. <br /> <br /> "Here on Earth" is a teenage heartbeat, so it must include some of Hollywood's most valuable young men who are attractive and inexperienced to accept the role of the film as bad as it is. Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett are different from the description and take the lead with the storm. Klein plays Kelley, a lofty and desolate student with a rich father (cliché number one). He must stop the false pretender and take part in the footsteps of his father at the Ivy League College (Stuart Wilson). It creates a "I don't want your life," a cliché in which the father tries to control his son's life as a son resist. Throw Kelley's dead mother who committed suicide for some time. When his father brings another wife home, he is brutally asking for his intentions ("no one can replace the mother's cliche number two). <br /> <br /> Josh Hartnett plays Jasper, a character on the other side of society at Kelley. His family has a local canteen. Enter your long-term interest in love, Samantha Cavanaugh (Leelee Sobieski), the canteen, who covers her sister (who doesn't have any purpose, not to check the next scene) when Jasper and Kelley act like childish moles, driving their cars and ( oh no) eating meals causing a flame to ignite it. (Conflicts between rich and poor are considered clichés to number three.) <br /> <br /> The chase of a runaway car puts both Kelley and Jasper into a well-established and credible conflict. They get into trouble with the law, but because this film feels the need to exist, the local judge sets them an alternative to earning time: they have to work together to help rebuild the canteen. <br /> <br /> Two boys work hard in the summer, growing strongly and getting a nice tan. Samantha's eyes are trying to fly Kelley and romantic sparks. Jasper is jealous, but wants what is best for his true love (number four in the cliché). His parents (Annette O'Toole and Bruce Greenwood) disagree with his little romantic triangle (cliché number 5), but he continues two periods of Jasper without a second meaning. His father is also a local sheriff, as surprising (lets count on a melodramatic nuggetkligee number six). <br /> <br /> The romantic feelings between Kelley and Samantha are considered to be seven. But Samantha's relationship with Jasper has never been defined, so how can romantic tension be? If the film wants to bring Samantha's choice between two young men, we have to see both characters on both sides. The film depicts Jasper as "legitimate love," Kelley. It is clear that Jasper loves him, but it is clear that he does not love him. It kills the romantic tension at the beginning of the story. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski won't harm you here; but his charm and kind performance are not suited to double character, like Samantha. John Hartnett is also right for the role of Jasper, but the film doesn't give him anything except Kelley. Chris Klein can give himself a name here; he spends a great deal of shit, sweat and overwork. Unfortunately he does not show his actor's ability, perhaps because he has very little. Supporting cast is much more talented. Bruce Greenwood delivers the best results in the film, but he doesn't have enough time to record anything except for a few moments. I also enjoyed Stuart Wilson's performance, which fits perfectly with the role of a rich and controlling father with great social status. <br /> <br /> Then we rely on Samantha's knee problem exactly one hour and ten minutes later (another spoiler. What it is, it has a serious incurable disease (another drawing, about eight). His terminal illness brings two competing young man with friends, well, at least I think that's exactly what the purpose of the movie was to show that losing the two noble love can bring both together (cliche number nine). <br /> Klein practices his valedictoria speech to show that his character is more than a low stereotype, but we have seen it so many times before I prefer a rich character rather than a deeply sentimental one who hides the real feelings (cliché number, whether it was ten)? the conflicts between Kelley and Jasper "Your mother" is triggering a fist fight when they rebuild the body. "Armageddon" has been restored, such as scattering Samantha and Kelley, horny as hell. I slowly rolled her fingers around her body, naming regions after US cities (why not name that number). The film uses alcohol as a means of increasing romantic tension: Drinking Kelley makes her fool when she struggles with Samantha's date, Jasper, but the next day she only wants to dance (cliché number, oh no, I lose the count).
