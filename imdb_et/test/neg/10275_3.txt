I know my summary is very harsh, but this movie is very limited. It would be difficult for Joe to get stuck in this film. The whole movie consists of animated loggers who work and dance on floating logs. It's all done with very splashy and artsy colors and the film can be a great show for patrons in the art museum. However, if you do not like this art or you are a Canadian who loves your home movies, it's probably impossible to stop. I have quite a high tolerance for such a thing, and even I had to force myself to look after a few minutes. I can respect the work that it did, but it is not convincing.
