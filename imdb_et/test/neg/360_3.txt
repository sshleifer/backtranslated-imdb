This is the story of a manic policeman who for some reason has a young college stud and his companions. If they inform him of their supervisor, who alternately stops psychiatric assessment, he or she will be able to torture them in psychology when the children are hacking into the department store and opening the door. Only, they lock in the shop with a weird one. Anxiety and chaos are going on and children are running around trying to survive until morning when they can escape. <br /> <br /> 'Dangerous game' would have been a successful cat and mouse psychological thriller, probably as it was set in another place. The idea that a psychotic policeman alternates with a department store for innocent teenagers just didn't work. Especially when he faces his contemptible harvest quite often and does nothing serious. There was no real confrontation that would be enough for such a story, and perhaps worked better than you would say, for example, that the teenagers were loose in the neighborhood and left themselves with this strange (especially when it took a few days for it to make them more and more paranoid .. although it has been given, even if it is a cliche. <br /> <br /> It's also a shame that he wouldn't have had a better thriller, given the young Australian funky cast characters. Even a light-hearted adventure, regardless of the craze of the cable inside the picture, could even have changed its more satisfying picture. Instead, it started fresh and confident that it had many sequences of activities, but ended up ridiculously.
