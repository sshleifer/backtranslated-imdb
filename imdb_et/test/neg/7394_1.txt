The tourists from Western tourists in Africa suffer from the failure of these planes, so they are forced to jump by bus to travel across the Namibian desert to get back to the nearest jumping point for civilization. Not surprisingly, the driver's compass doesn't work, and they find themselves staying in the abandoned ghost town that was a barracks in World War II. They find some kerosene (useless when it fills its bus tank), a storage room full of poisonous carrots in tin cans, and a mother tongue looking at them indifferently. One of the spouses who seem to be on the ball in terms of survival techniques will get help. They have to remove the tires from the bus and burn them if they have not returned after five days: hopefully someone will see black smoke. <br /> <br /> Is it interesting? Definitely, even if it sounds like a * Phoenix flight * or any number of movies in the "abandoned island" genre. It is therefore surprising that * King is alive * is number 4 (if anyone still reads) in the ongoing "Dogma 95" series, which, when I remember the ridiculous "Dogma 95 Vass of Chastity" correctly proclaimed "Genre Movies" is strictly verboten. Sorry. Anyway, you can say it's trying and being all the fun and things to compensate for the fact that it's a genre flick. Yes, it won't take long for a group member, a charming old-time actor, to sign - from memory! - Different King Lear * roles, well, paper rolls. The idea is that making a game helps you lose time. All this really contradicts the advice of the escaped survivor to remain optimistic (did the old actor ever make a live theater theatrical report *), besides that this activity was a colossal waste of valuable time and energy. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I really don't know how to go. It is so monumentally stupid, so full of absurd situations and signs that it begs rational criticism. Full disclosure can be a timely moment: I despise this "movement" of the Danish film almost irrationally. I think my face even turns red when mentioning Dogma 95. First of all, if the word "dogma" is in the title of your movement, you have already lost me; Secondly, in this particular case, the demand for movement to cancel an individual artistic achievement into the hypocrisy of the recipe, if you think that the filmmakers are robbing here of one of the greatest works of the INDIVIDUAL Writer who has ever lived. (But, undoubtedly, the Dogma crowd believes in Shakespeare's works in the Elizabethan Metropolitan Consortium, such as Oxford's Earl, Francis Bacon, Walter Raleigh, and the Queen itself.) <br /> <br /> Hell, Maybe I've forgiven the whole company played a scenario for fictitious purposes (attacking valuable dogma - now that it would be subversive!). But the film takes itself very seriously, and soon will be divided into clich√©s related to the genre in which it unmistakably belongs: people who turn against each other; men grow beards; unavoidable deaths of some major players. Everything is straight. "Is that the end of what is allowed?" Well, not quite right: we also have to suffer from DV sadness. Because this is the second rule of Dogma 95 Vow of Chastity: only hand-held digital video. Some friendly tips for the Danes: Your "move" is in trouble if your finished product has a worse visual quality than the average high school graduation home video. Professionalism belongs to the artist's tricks, right to his individuality. "Artisan" and "Artist" are Mr. Words, Mr von Trier: Not every jackass with $ 100 in hand can be a filmmaker. Pass on. And by the way: let your Dogma directors credit your movies while you're at it. The fact that * the king is alive * gets credit while the man (or girl) who is actually filming it is not just a little hypocritical. <br /> <br /> Durable. 1 star out of 10.
