Sorry. I hired it because I thought it was a bitter harvest (1981) that was recommended. After the terrible appearance of Patsy Kensit, I checked the recommendation and discovered my mistake. OK, it's traceable because the main characters are very sexy, but the actor is terrible. Stephen Baldwin is waiting all the time to understand, given his co-star. Does Patsy compete with Liz Hurley for the title of the most obvious useless actor on the screen?
