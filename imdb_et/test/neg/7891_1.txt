This is a film that talks about a black man who buys an airline and makes an airplane over Africa-centered. They even represent the owner not only under the control of the air carrier, but also to control the airport's part of the airport. One day, this guy will win $ 100 million the next day you see him, he will drive all over the airport, like the airport owner. Everyone calls this movie a parody, but nothing about this movie speaks of a parody! This movie is a flop and will remain forever at Wal-Mart's $ 4.95 trash. <br /> <br /> I can't even understand why MGM is $ 16 million for this movie. This movie does not even guarantee direct video status. Writers (one black and one white) should be blackballed forever from Hollywood. Not only are they stereotyping black, they are portrayed as ignorant people. I would be ashamed to go to a movie that keeps me down. Don't waste your time at a video store, wal-marts, pay-per-view, or Sunday afternoon when a movie is shown in TBS.
