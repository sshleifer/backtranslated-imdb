Historical films always take liberties - conversations have been developed where no one can actually say what was said, customs are customized so that they can be understood by a modern audience, and so on. This movie is not. The only scene I really remember is when our hero surprises the assassin who falls into his chamber in the evening. He's in contact with a dangerous intruder: "I can't remember sending you to room service." The main value of entertainment is its inferiority; I suggested putting it on a "turkey" shelf in my local video story.
