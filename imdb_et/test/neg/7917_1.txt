I loved all the dogs going to heaven so much that I went to the theater and I don't remember the film's disappointment. The story bounces worse than the annual manure. I mean, come on! How could Carface imagine that he could get much more revenge on him, no matter how angry he was. Plus represents Satan as a CAT?!?! How can a clich√© be? So much story. Is it any wonder that Don Bluth, Burt Reynolds, Melba Moore and Vic Tayback would not touch it with a 10-foot pole? The animation was completely sad. The colors were all washed and I can't read how many times I saw the objects that were supposed to be solid. It was supposed to be the worst animation I've ever seen! I usually like animated movies but not BOMB!
