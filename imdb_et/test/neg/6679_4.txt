STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> As a boy, Mark Goddard (C Thomas Howell) sat in power for his family, including his hero's father (Jeff Fahey) brutally murdered the criminals he was trying to humiliate. With the inner desire to punish the lies that grew up in this field, Mark uses the suspects he is forcing and gets into the hands of many bosses. But then he learns to understand the "Justice Incorporated", a secret group of men and women led by a secret man (Ed Lauter), who are serving a punishment that fits off the law. life can be harder than he thought. <br /> <br /> Sweeper gets out of trouble because we have seen exactly the same plot that was made before (and better) in films like The Star Chamber by Michael Douglas and Magnum Force with Clint Eastwood. The title doesn't make any sense. But we also have to fight with the full laugh of the film, including the scene where the daughter's headphones can kill her killed family - a finale involving riding a bad boy starting off the road and ending with a Wright Brothers plane, as well as some ridiculous actors and very clever, pretentious scripts. But here and there are some cool action sequences, and the movie's unintentional laughing will definitely keep it in the pulse of life. **
