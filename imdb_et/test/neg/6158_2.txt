This film does not work on many levels. The script is first unsuccessful and if I understand it, if the script smells, there is nothing to solve it. The plot is boring, after the first 45 minutes, I watch a DVD counter telling me "how much longer?" Cinematography is quite terrible. I'm not sure how bad the DVD was, but it looked like a copy of VHS. It was also bad sound. I understand that it won't get a 5.1 remix, but iodine, it didn't seem like it was Dolby Stereos, which was almost ten years of cutting this movie. Slipstream was too similar to Mad Max and Blade Runner for convenience. It is extremely disappointing because of its effective special effects and the lack of quality dialogue. If I remember, the cursor activity took place in the last 20 minutes, usually in the first 20 minutes. Most people are confused about what the hell is going on until the last 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The music in the movie was partly excellent and then in others. Elmer Bernstien did a score, but it sounds like someone else's hand to hold on to "other" things elsewhere because it doesn't match the overall good orchestral score (with some synthesizer music.) <br /> <br /> were big actors, Bob Peck, Mark Hamill, Ben Kingsley, Bill Paxton. And they did an excellent job that breathed life into their characters. (Well, Paxton's character was pretty stupid and the whole movie was in his middle. I'm not sure if the heroic hero is a good choice for the main character who wears the movie.) Again, a big mistake with the script. br /> <br /> Thank you for the goodness I watched this mail order DVD, not the theater. In general, Sci-fi fans or Paxton or Hamill fans are the main disappointment. 90 minutes of your life, you never get back.
