Quentin Tarantino once said that in order to succeed in the film industry, you had to do your Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. The writer / actor / director Larry Bishop seems to be a little too literally with Hell Ride and created a dirty tribute that borrowed too much from his visual, musical, camera, and time-changing storytelling. But in order to imitate the Tarantino movie correctly, it must be creative to build creative conversations; Unfortunately, Hell Ride's main track element is his scary attack and a vulgar monologue that only works to attract audiences and confuse them while they are only participants for participation. <br /> <br /> Anti-Hero protagonist biker gang, The winners are made up of several weatherproof vigilants who bring their trademark of bona fide justice to their illegal roads. Leader Pistolero (Larry Bishop) has been bouncing on revenge and fires. Gent (Michael Madsen) simply tries to balance his chaotic, psychotic life symphony with the leadership of all who cross his boss, and Comanche (Eric Balfour) follows an acute loyalty and mysterious past. <br /> <br /> The frightening front is a Deuce (David Carradine) master who drives far, though not far enough, and Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) spits poison and a little explanation of his tattoos, while the harpoon gun and general disappointing life. Although these characters may seem interesting on paper, when they are forced to get into a frighteningly failed dialogue, all the cool traces disappear faster than financing the next Bishop movie. <br /> <br /> Hell Ride is full of shortcomings and inadequate opportunities; And because Bishop's main influences are Tarantino's conversational movies, there are many. The first twenty minutes of the film are almost incomprehensible and will probably become so meaningless. By the time Pistolero's main is rather inserted and certain phrases move into nausea, you pray for both death and the ability to turn off the sound. Even Dennis Hopper has trouble turning off such a cool dialogue. <br /> <br /> Have you ever repeated the word or phrase yourself repeatedly, that it just doesn't sound right or even make sense? The bishop starts from there and keeps the madness until you envy the characters on the screen that their head is broken. And when the dialogue ends, the nude woman's oil wrestling and cucumbers are treated. I'm not sure what Bishop is hoping to achieve, but I doubt he found it. <br /> <br /> Hell Ride wishes to pay tribute to Quentin Tarantino's films, Robert Rodriguez's films, and every film that violates the violent and cyclical devotional attitude of cyclists. But even though its intentions may be noble, a terribly worthy dialogue and a hyperstilized timeline-mangling editor prevents the audience from investing in general tough signs. By the time we think of the mystery of the motives of the characters (and this may be some time before you even realize that there is a solemn mystery), it's just too difficult to take care of. And while all the people on the screen are obviously fun, they have completely ignored this entertainment translation audience. <br /> <br /> - Joel Massie
