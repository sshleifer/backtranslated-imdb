I think the park is fun and I have no problem if they take pictures to the people on the left, but you think after taking the whole movie to attack celebrities to risk your career for the illegal war, and then GASP has the right to think that they will give up. and the bastards destroy the earth or two. in the bush, it seems that these men get a pretty fool and a mess, as it is. <br /> <br /> Gore is a fair game, but please, what do Republicans have to do, how bad they are up to f ^ & k up state before these guys end up acting like maybe they're not just trying to do the best they do can, and that they have done some real screwing ... or maybe just go after the rush limbaugh ... hes a good target ... or even just joke on condoleeza rice teeth.
