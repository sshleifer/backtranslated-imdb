Don't know. Poor music (and I'm a boy of reformed eighties, so I would be some good things to do). Brother is a parody, not something that keeps us, except to see what the horror of the eighties draws. The tour operator is trying to bring a thing to mankind but does not give enough time. Wahlberg is okay and Aniston is sliding. We know he doesn't need any money. Is this the only role he / she fits for his summer vacation? He must definitely miss his tip every time it appears on VH1 - which is just a bit less common than Ozzy. It's hardly qualifiable as a TV movie. It's just hard to believe it was actually in the theater.
