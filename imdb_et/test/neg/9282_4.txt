I watched this movie with great expectations. The obstruction on the back showed it was nasty. But it was quite annoying and a bit unsatisfactory. Violence was nothing I haven't seen thousands of times, the gore level was just average (remember that you had probably seen more than Hollywood in the last 5 years - maybe even more), and at no point was I even feeling let the frighten scare. Again, the CAT 3 film has not lived with large windings until its leap. <br /> <br /> Please be sure to rent this movie, but don't go to expectations. I'm so eager to get into the horror of all of Asia, but I'm always disappointed. I loved Ichi and Audition, but then again, Miike is standing alone now. <br /> <br /> Please inspire me ..... there is a huge cluster of jaded genres who are nervous with quality horror!
