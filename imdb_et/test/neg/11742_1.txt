Van Sant copies Hitchcock's masterpiece that has been shot, including some modern facets: walkman and Anne Heche's nudity. If you do not have a great desire to see Mrs Heche naked, there is no reason to see this instead of the original film. Hitchcock's masterpiece is much better, and Van Sant does not realize that the original shower scene is even sharper in concealing nudity and gore. Ask Janet Leigh about it. Operation is also much thinner and the technical aspects are much less impressive.
