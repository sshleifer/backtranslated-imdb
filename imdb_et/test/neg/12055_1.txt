But I can't say how I feel this stack of steaming. Where to start. There is no movie quality. I've seen clearer pictures of America's FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS! Operation is poor, gore effects are fine. The clown mask is the best part of this movie, the story is repetitive. Same thing over and over again. At least on Friday 13 or HALLOWEEN we mostly stay with one main character. There are no main characters but victims. Man, let's get to the worst part now. The final survivor kills the clown and finds it was one of his friends. When the police finally arrive, they do not believe in him and he is locked in the rubber space. What end do you call it, crap. In my opinion, there is no excuse that the horror film has a bad ending, it was just sloppy writing. Sorry, "It must end badly, it's a horror movie." or "We have to stop it badly to leave it queued" is just flat excuses and that's all. I have to give CAMP BLOOD to THANKSGIVING TURKEY.
