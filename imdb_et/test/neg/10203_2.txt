Hulk Hogan and Zeus are terrible wrestlers and terrible actors. Hogan for some reason was popular enough to get a movie that I never know. If not, then, for Mcmahon's peace, this stupid film would never have been made. Maybe someone gets a good movie pro-wrestling. No Holds Barred is not this movie.
