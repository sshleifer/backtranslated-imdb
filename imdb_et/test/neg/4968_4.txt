How did it score 6.0? Are we so horrible fans that are so bad today, so many if there are so many, and I repeat “just a few”, redeeming quality, we get too excited and give an estimate that is just a little too high? The director has a certain visual. No doubt. But between some decent pictures he forgot a good story, mood or fear. It was a very slow first act, lazy killing the scene, annoying and flat characters and a very stupid and very incredible twist. And what about depicting American teenagers in so many such films? Do they always have this stupid, irritating and so divine # mn superficial. I don't remember teenagers as I grew up in the Netherlands. With all things in mind, this movie can no longer be given out of 4 out of 10 ratings.
