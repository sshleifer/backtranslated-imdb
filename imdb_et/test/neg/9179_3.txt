Fred Williamson, one of two or three top blaxploitation stars. Cynthia Rothrock, one of two or three of the best American female female activities. Imagine for the first time with these two movies! Now imagine THE WORST movie that could be made for the first time with these two compositions. Welcome to "Night Vision". Of course, this film was made in 1997 and they both went to their prime minister, but that does not mean they no longer needed - they just needed good writing and direction. They didn't get here. Rothrock can't throw a couple of punches to the end, but this movie is so cruel that you probably don't see them awake. (*)
