As others mentioned, can there be another reason to see this movie when you see the former "Wayne World" star Mike Myers play an important role? The story is interesting, but it has no development and has been sabotaged by loose ends and bad characters. If there were good pictures in Ireland, this would be another reason. Instead, it focuses on a small normal village that is probably surrounded by Emerald-Isle's 'green pastures', often shown in Irish films. If there was a cultural "spice" to admire the "Irish personality", it would be worth seeing, but it could have been shot in almost England. Too bad for Myers, but it doesn't like or satisfies everyone's heart, who ever wanted to visit Guinea.
