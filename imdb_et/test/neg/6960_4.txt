A decent, but overestimated, dramatic thriller, the film tries to portray the spiritual spiritual enemies of the tortured artist. The problem is that none of the ratios shown on the screen are plausible and plausible that it has been thrown out of the window. The nature of the title is so difficult to relate to changing that it is impossible to imagine any sign of an emotionally invested screen. The conclusion is also quite predictable; there are definitely enough clues that are offered in the move to pinpoint where the story is. By fully choosing your beliefs for situations or relationships, the film itself works well (especially by the leaders) and manages to create a pleasant tension when the story is manifested. The metaphorical feature is some space of thought, and if the script had been stronger, there would certainly be a potential that could have been better utilized.
