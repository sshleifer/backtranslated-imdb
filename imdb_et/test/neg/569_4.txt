I liked most of the dialogue, I liked it, I thought it worked well. I especially liked Ellen DeGeneres' perfect death. <br /> <br /> What didn't work for me was: (1) a pulled thing with a younger man (too long, too unknown to Helen) (2) seemingly endless cinematic cliches that are mostly visual but also include re-reading the love letter (the content should be a mystery); (3) young woman feminist-scientist and ironically, fireworks scene (no wonder it reminded me of this terrifying way to make American Quilt movie); (4) a worshiping policeman who smells "forever" everywhere (there's no clich√©!); and (5) an embarrassingly romantic little town setting. <br /> <br /> I would have preferred the film to investigate more convincingly (or even glorify) the source of Helen's bitterness to add much more DeGeneres character. the elimination or reduction of various intergenerational items and the life of a small town are somewhat less critical. this film, which unfortunately is clearly mediocre.
