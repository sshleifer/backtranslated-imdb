I have this movie. And it's very hard to find. It is a unique small budget small gore flop with a doctor looking for the perfect companion. It feels like it's really humorous and the budget is surprisingly good when it looks like a $ 500 budget. The director is allegedly a gore captain. I wouldn't go that far, but maybe during her. Generally in a 6/10 gore chart.
