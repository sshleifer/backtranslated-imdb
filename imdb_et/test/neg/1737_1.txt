Worst.film.ever Nothing more to say. Aaron Carter is completely repulsive, and the rest should shoot down his agents immediately. It's a really terrible terrible movie from start to finish. I wish I could describe many (many so many) mistakes in describing movies, but I can't be distracted / too angry to make the right sentences. In short, I hated everything about this movie and not "so badly about my good" ways ... <br /> <br /> It was an empty dragon. <br /> <br /> Gavin
