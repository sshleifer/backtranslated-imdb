This movie would like to be such a shocking, brain and intense film that many others have successfully done in their genre, but it is not. At best it is confusing and absurd. When the twists finally appeared, not to say "Ahh, I get it!" I did something "Okay ... whatever." In my opinion, the film, when it detects the twist of a large plot, should not use a setback to prove that it gave some tips that would allow the viewer to identify the truth itself. But this film has a setback; and here's the kicker: it flashes back on scenes that weren't even in the movie! <br /> <br /> The characters were stereotypical, unreasonable and completely ridiculous. I think the "steamy" love scenes between romantic leaders were the most intrusive and uneksxy, what I've ever been in a movie that wasn't porn. It seems that the director went to the shocking and kinky scenes with love scenes, but they were really just stupid. Don't let me start with a bright accent and second level kits. I think the film was placed in New Orleans, but in addition to the above-mentioned accents and the harsh city view, the film would have become in Anytown, USA. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: Don't worry!
