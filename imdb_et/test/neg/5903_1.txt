This film could have been so much better. This is a beautiful story that has been erected in very busy times, but still it was so badly done. Leading participants have done great jobs in the past, and they usually do enough work in this film. Although sometimes their dialogue seems to feel and forced. Management could have been shorter. Most of the criticism should go to writers who took a good story and made it annoying. In short, there are thousands of much better ways to spend 2 hours.
