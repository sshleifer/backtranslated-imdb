Unlike the reviews written here, I didn't get angry with this movie. This is a movie that could have been much better than it was. Not Oscar material, true, but much better than it was. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot had a good hook and a passing line. This movie was badly written. AND TERRIBLE MANAGED AND MANUFACTURED. I mean, how much is irrelevant feedback? Why were we there? What exactly is the point of the opening order? The manufacturer (s) seems to have looked at the American beauty a few times several times and thought "I will use it in a feature film!" I thought this movie wasn't working well. Wesley Snipes did a good job, just running in the wrong direction. And when that movie hit the production room, things got worse. In my opinion, the main actor was the same problem. Some of the other acts were suspects, yes, but it was a small budget flick. Again, I would say that it is up to the director to select it and correct it. Or perhaps you should see if you are a student of the film and want to see what not to do. <br /> <br /> 3/10 and it gives him praise.
