This movie is probably the worst movie I've been watching for a long time. The action is so wooden that the door could have done a better job. The plot is ridiculous and low, and the actual "rugby" is far from reality. I still can't get a "haka" that is portrayed in this poor excuse for entertainment. I'm not kiwi, but I know that only Haka can be filled by a Maori and not a non-American white boy. <br /> <br /> I assume that it was made for an American audience so low and "Disney's end" excusable, but hardly ever tried to bring out the basic rules of the game except for the prison, where the main character suddenly takes over the American football game and gets everything Play Rugby instead. The only thing about this movie was the final credits. It would be less painful to spend toothpastes in your eyeballs for ninety minutes.
