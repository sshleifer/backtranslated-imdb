This short was the last and only short short of director Del Lord. The problem: it was rather weak and the coffee shop was a pretty short copy of the short "busy friends" (1944). The query scene was pretty funny and the beginning of the cafe part. But in this short there are many strokes. For example, why are the stocks hidden inside the garbage when the police come? In the transformation of "Money and Hash" (1955), director Jules White confirms this, and the reason why the trash bins are hidden is because there is an armed force between police and armored robbers. The scene in which Moe has problems with oysters was previously made by Curly "Dutiful But Dumb" (1941). The Spooky part of the house wasn't all that great except for the fun scene outside the spooky house. Up there was nothing to do at the end. Rating: C-
