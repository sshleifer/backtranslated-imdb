And you know why? Because they thought (or at least the horror made by fans) that a number of unpleasant, unpleasant, screaming teens, some stupid demons (where do they come from? What is their purpose? Who knows?) And the dark mansion is all you have to do horror movie. Needless to say, they were wrong. You also need a script, some logic, some rules and some inventions. This flick is one scene that lives by its reputation (of course, a lipstick scene) and a couple of funny moments (a description of a child's brother from his mother's biscuits, Linnea Quigley "doesn't look at me" scene). It also has more embarrassment than any movie I watched after the last "Reservoir Dogs" vision. Every fourth or fifth word is the word "f ***" or "b ****". Then, when the movie starts with four false scares in your first 5 minutes, you don't know that something awaits good filmmaking. (* 1/2)
