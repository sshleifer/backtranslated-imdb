In another accident attempt to make the fastest masterpieces of television in Hollywood cash, Peter Segal has created a monster. Excluded from context, if nobody knew Brooks' work before viewing, the film would be a big big movie that is not sure if he wants to be a fat joke and a stupid comedy, or just an ordinary action movie that has nothing to go on. However, as the young generation Y'er, who just spent two months when he was in the five seasons of the 60-year-old Get Smart TV show, this film was bothering me from the moment I entered and saw Steve Carelli dragging. Backstories, an agent of 99 plastic surgery and 86 as an analyst who had previously become obese, destroyed the complexity of the original duo and colored their flat boring reassessment. It seems that the scriptwriters, who cannot be really funny both in dialogue and in the situation, fell back to Don Adams' famous lines, the return fat camp, which referred to Carelli's part in the office-style camera corners, and female chauvinism, which falls flat on her face. <br /> <br /> For those who have seen the original, the authors of this film thought they contained some memories. They talk about Herbie, Fang (now a worthless little hairy dog, kept in Carell), a shoe phone, a silence cone and his classic red car and doors and phone that introduced the show. Classical music is back, but now everything is updated, generally worse. The silence crown is now some strange blue telinetic force fields, the control headquarters are right under the museum, which retains Control's past. The film does not have any creative random technique and it replaces it with the charming army knives. A lot of "humor" in the movie Carrel hurt itself or some other injury, regardless of whether it spends two minutes shooting by accident, or beating by a security guard or throwing airplanes. At first, Smart had offended the great enemy, attacked him without success and try to communicate with him before he started to powder. In this he attacks without success and gets pummeled. It seems that the scriptwriters did not realize that humor was created through dialogue, rather than meaningless violence. It's like they took the names from the display and cut out everything that did the first place. <br /> <br /> The poster hides Carelli's face beyond Hathaway. The same movie will disappear from all the things that could do it. They intertwine classical music with dramatic action and romantic music in high budget films. When the original feeds the bearing power, it replaces the quality with massive cgi explosions and pow-sound effects. I was really waiting for it because I finished the original series only two months ago and it was among all five of my best shows. But it was a tremendous disappointment. Credits say they collaborated with Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but in all the things I read on the Internet, they missed out on the writing process. In conclusion, if you want to spend your money on low-value money and respect for that name, go to it. But be prepared to have no ride, how you remembered it. <br /> <br /> PS: I forgot about George Bush's humor. They mention "Nuculor" that fall asleep in the art, the president works for his vice president and appreciates solving the real problems. If you hear the same jokes you heard about 3-4 years ago in a big budget movie, make your money here.
