Lord, suck it. In the 1960s, there is a definite sexual revolution that can interfere with the sexual assault. This movie is an example. I lost how many times women hit, beat, whip or praise on film. And then it is all the time that women in the movie imagine that they have hit, hit, whipped or punched (you know they want it, right?). Sometimes it's a seemingly safe part of playing fetish. Of course, this is not obvious, but you are waiting for the heroine report to the authorities that he has just been raped. Instead, we can hear his lecture by his rapist about his inability to let go. <br /> <br /> The scene of any movie that talks about failure (a straight, white, married man in the late 1930s), not a teenage lesbian woman studying with a chip on the shoulder so you don't get the wrong idea). <br /> <br /> Perhaps the good thing about this movie is that it reminds us of how bad things were just a few decades ago for women.
