There are only two reasons I look at this show ... I invested time in earlier episodes and Col Tigh. Because all Sci-Fi fans who love the new BSG will give me a break! Go read some of the classic Sci-Fi novels by real greats or watch some milestones and TV shows from the past days and see what these BSG writers are. Their only trick is "who's the fifth in the silon." Poor writing and really, really does not mean character development. If Adama leaves or tries to take power or shouts again, or discovers the inner father, he would have had to be one more time ... ahhhhh! And Roslin has the same annoying character that has ever been aboard the ship. Turning off with him. I could care less if it was six months before they were concluded. These wannabe writers were the first trick of the season. If you don't know this, you just don't know the writing.
