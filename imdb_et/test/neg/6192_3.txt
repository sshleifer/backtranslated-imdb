This is a film that sheds light on the Palestinian struggle against the Israeli occupation in Palestine, but it does not show the real feelings of the people at this time and how they were deceived to return home quickly, not mentioning the killings committed by Jews such as Der Yassine. how they tortured and killed and destroyed the Palestinian freedom fighter family, but it lacks credibility for a real Palestinian fight and something for the Palestinians, but it has something to suffer. Palestinian citizens who arrive as refugees in nearby Arab countries are focusing on the person in the film who is now and his story is seeing a movie. The film simply speaks of one person's life and has some nudity scenes that are not relevant to the story.
