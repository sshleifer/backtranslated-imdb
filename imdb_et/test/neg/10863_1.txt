This movie makes "Glitter" look like "Schindler's List". Indeed, Tarantino and Weinsteins must carefully consider their names before they are placed on the product. Green Lighting by P.O.S. this way, regardless of the friendship involved, it's just a bad business. Larry Bishop must be kept away from the film camera at all costs. The writer / director / producer / actor Bishop shows that his skills are not sufficient for these works. The southern vanity project, "Hell Ride", usually allows good actors to chew the landscape ... at least when the camera is not focused on the bishop's weak attempts to steal every scene he's on. The last three words "Hell Ride" are STINK, STANK, STUNK.
