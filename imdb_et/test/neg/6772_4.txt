Danny is not sorry. <br /> <br /> He makes the same mistakes and is no longer interesting to watch. First of all, I felt dependent on myself. My heart went to him at first and somewhere along the line he went over the line. It is almost the same as continuing this behavior to keep the show going and at the same time seriously endangering the life of your life and your family, especially its children. It is difficult for even a poor boy to even get harm. I think he has to look at this exhibition, maybe he might have the chance to save that marriage. I don't understand how Gretchen is staying with him, and I don't know how much to show and how much love is. Danny, get a life - new that is! ... and don't get me to Dr. Gary. What's with her and her face? His skin looks like it reaches max. Moreover, the appearance does not mean anything, but it does not seem to be particularly impartial. I also think he will keep it for his financial gain and often not for Gretchen or Danny. These people are a little confused and everyone reminds me of a dog that drives behind his tail. sad, very sad. Get yourself together.
