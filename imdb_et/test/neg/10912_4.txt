Cujo is a giant, lovable, gentle and loving. Bernard, a member of the Camber family, at the opening of Cujo rides on rabbit fields and through local wood somewhere in Castle Rock, Maine. The rabbit disappears into the well and Cujo stays in his entrance. The rabbit disappears from Cujo's eyes, the angry Cujo starts to peel and wakes up unwittingly to wake up and disturbs the colony of bats, one of which bites him. Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace, like Dee Wallace) interacts with Steve Kemp (Christopher Stone, Dee Wallace's real husband) who discovers her husband Vic (Daniel Hugh Kelly) who works in advertising. Obviously, their relationship becomes tense. Fortunately, this is all young son Tad (Danny Pintauro). Joe Camber (Ed Lauter) fixes cars into a dwelling house, which is a farmhouse on his farm. Joe is planning a weekend with one of his friends, Gary Pervier (Mills Watson), when his wife Charity (Kaiulani Lee) wins the $ 5,000 lottery and decides to see his parents with his young boy Brett (Billy Jayne Billy Jacoby). When he arrives at Gary's house, he reaches Joe's dead floor, goes to the kitchen for help, and his dog Cujo, who has now kidnapped the attacks and kills him. Donna and Tad drive to Camber to try and get a car. The place is abandoned, except for Cujo, who is now completely rabid, mouth-blowing, the color of his fur with red blood and pain. Cujo attacks the car to try and get to Donna and Tadi, luckily the windows are at least sure, at least for now. Donna tries to start the car, but it's completely broken down, they're both caught up, but hope that someone can save them. Cujo is in anticipation, ready to attack and kill someone who crosses his path. Director Lewis Teague I thought the film was a bit slow for my taste. The first half is burning, the other half is a steam head, but I still felt that it was a little sneaky and unmistakable. Everyone involved is doing well, I have not complained there. Technically, film is OK, photography, music, special effects, editing and generally well done. The big problem is the Don Carlos Dunaway and Lauren Currier script, and especially its first half, most of which seem to be padding to stretch the time. Knowing the 90-minute clock seemed longer. It is also somewhat predictable. Cujo when a monster never scared me, I just can't find a sliding overweight St. Bernardsi scares me. I think there's nothing really wrong with that, but I don't think I would hurry to see it again. Average, not too bad, if you find a copy that goes cheap or free for T.V.
