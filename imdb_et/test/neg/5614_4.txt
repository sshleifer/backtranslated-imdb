"Kicked in the Head" is all about Corrigan's character, twenty men who want to find himself, and his participation in a handful of exotic characters. This slim and ambiguous story, written by Corrigan, has a self-sensitivity and a scenario that is an odd low budget indie. Nonetheless, and with some tedious skipping of the Hindenburg scene, the film has an amazing, peculiar charm that can appeal to people with a similar sense of humor in some small ways. Not for everyone, not for most, but perhaps for some fun. (D +)
