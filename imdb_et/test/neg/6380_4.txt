This exhibition has shown that the true colors of the Democrats are now in power. It never led to the world in IQ, because anyone who thought he had intelligence was programmed to think in one way (which is a scary thing). <br /> <br /> Comedy Central moved it & it is back in time when Democrats took power for a reason, because now that Democrats screws - which are just as Republican - Stewart no longer takes those shots. That's why both this and centrifuge ratings fall. <br /> <br /> Basically, most humor is now flat or stupid Sarah Palin's jokes - what all the ratings come from comics now tells. The underlying facts speak for themselves. Jay Leno's exhibition, which has made the same type of humor, is on the verge of cancellation. Letterman & Conan & the following shows are down. <br /> <br /> So Emperor Stewart is not alone. The problem is that some of them start taking real hangs of democratic democrats in power, they can raise their ratings in haste, because the best humor is always at the expense of their power. The Bush years proved that because the ratings of this exhibition & Colbert, & Letterman & Leno were higher there. <br /> <br /> O'Bama has done one thing, proving that these exhibitions must be ready to take on the power of the people who want to flourish. Right now, the Daily Show & Stewart is sagging, but maybe they will get lucky and have Palin chosen as the first woman president in 2012. Then the flat Palin jokes will become the rating grabbers.
