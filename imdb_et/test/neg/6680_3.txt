I was interested in this movie because someone had made Bj√∂rks "Bachelorette" with beautiful video clips. So I watched the movie. And it's really amazingly beautiful. Animation masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this story is not up to date. It starts well with interesting drawings of people who are in the possession of the roses of the roses, but suddenly lift the lifts with water and lose their walls, people float and ultimately, without a reason, are flooded with a car in Utena and enjoy high speed tracking. <br /> <br /> I like a lot of anime because it has the ability to make alternative universes, but this universe is just stupid. When you watch this movie, changing the sound is better.
