Well, this new version of Mansfield Park seemed to try and take on the unevenness of the 1999 version of the theater (directly copied some of the ideas in fact), but brought things down a bit to bring it more into line with the original story. Unfortunately, the result is rather weak and schizophrenic, production. And like all other versions of Mansfield Park, Fanny Price is not the place to find it. Instead, it is a strangely child-like bleached blonde who runs around and never represents a character. At least in the 1999 film, what they call "Fanny Price" is definitely a rebellious tomboy who is too good for his own. This "Fanny Price" is a complete mystery. One day I would really like to see the dramatization of Mansfield Park, which actually includes the depiction of Fanny's character, as he wrote to Jane Austen. A sweet, kind, compassionate girl with a terrible person and a weak constitution. He is in a reserved manner and painfully honest, but also strongly, faithfully loyal, extremely intelligent and remarkable in his convictions. Just a little late in the flowering, he is not going to make the transition from uncomfortable adolescence to a young woman he has acquired in his eighteenth year. And he doesn't want anything more in life than to be really useful to those he loves the most. This is a wonderfully complicated character, which I look forward to one day to see faithfully.
