When this show first aired, I admit that I'm interested in space and space. With an open mind, I looked at the first two episodes and, of course, rejected it as being meant to last for no more than half a season. I was recently watching A / E and seeing this garbage advertisement and I can barely include my surprise. I really hope people look at it for a laugh and don't take it seriously. The characters are really some of the more ridiculous and directly laughing on television, scripts or otherwise. This is obviously the creation of ratings, so I have to give credit to the creators to create and maintain a fan base, but I really hope that no one can see it seriously.
