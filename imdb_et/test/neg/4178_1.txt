If you are looking for a sensitive stroke in the summer, Dark Harvest 2 may be your ticket. The production values ​​of this movie are extremely high (it seems to have been filmed with Sony Handicam and edited by iMovie), especially the sound effects - they sound directly from the "Spooky Halloween Sounds" CD! The scarecrow cover, although it doesn't appear in the movie and otherwise doesn't matter, is terribly realistic! From the beginning to the end, you look when a man is looking for his daughters purposefully, trying, MAISE! When you climactically stop the movie, you see well ... you have to look at yourself. <br /> <br /> What I really want to say here is not the 1000 factories of this movie. I rented it because I thought it would be a funny "Troll 2" but it is not. I cried after watching this movie because I realized I had spent it (and I found the $ 4 I spent on renting it). I really slept for 20 minutes and I still knew what was going on.
