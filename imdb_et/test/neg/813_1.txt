I was given this film and I have to admit that I'm glad I didn't pay for it. <br /> <br /> At the back of the box, it seems like a sexual triangle. women are trying to attract her. But the reality of this movie is far from that. <br /> <br /> In fact, the main theme of the two other characters is the victim of cruel and sadistic rape. There was nothing interesting about that. <br /> <br /> Even films such as Lambs and Wild Things (which the box tries to compare to this movie) were rivets due to unexpected turns. and alternately. <br /> <br /> But Jaded doesn't have it. It focuses on rapists and diseased relationships with one of their boys. And the video tape that can prove the victims' story is true. <br /> <br /> Although it shows that rape of the same sex is possible, it is not a movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> If at all possible, move this movie at all costs.
