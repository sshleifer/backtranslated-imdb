Very hypothesis, sliding, nervous interpretation. <br /> <br /> They've got "because it's modern, it's up, slippery, and so on". trap. <br /> <br /> "Romeo and Juliet" made this idea a lot more successful, but I think it's time for us to move beyond this (periodic piece vs. elongated film). <br /> <br /> Just because it is a "modern" repetition does not mean that the film has to look like a magazine ad or has something to do with drugs or weapons. <br /> <br /> Macbeth would be a much more powerful film than the words of honey. Read your Shakespeare. Read it out loud. Ask some questions about your Oxford dictionary. Leave the movie closed. Or don't, but you are warned. <br /> <br /> Sorry for a super-long review. IMDb made me do it.
