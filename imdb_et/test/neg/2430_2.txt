First, when does this story happen? This must happen after the first movie, because Kuzco knows that Pacha and Chicha are their third child, but it can't happen after the second movie, because Kronk doesn't get a girlfriend or a woman or anything? You never see him at the show. <br /> <br /> Why is Kuzco going to school? The whole plot of the exhibition is that Kuzco goes to school to get the emperor. But wasn't he an emperor before that? And who is the emperor when his emperor is? Shouldn't it be Yzma? Or was Yzma already fired in this era? And if this is true, why does he expect him not to become an emperor? Plus, you know in the first film that he was trained as emperor of private trainers from birth. So he should know what he's doing. <br /> <br /> Kronk. Why is Kronk a student? He's about 25 years old, who marked it in the first film. She is an adult who goes to high school. Do they all think he's a moor? I really like Kronk, but I think because of her age and because everyone knows she works for Yzma, she should have been a teacher. A teacher at home would be a teacher right away on her alley. <br /> <br /> Malina is very unlikely. She thinks Kuzco is a love / moral compass. But for a long time, she comes out of the bossy and knows it all. She usually says I think I like "I should be proud because I'm pretty and smart". <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is ESP for Kuzco and knows if he is in trouble when he cheats, or even when he sings the Hot Hot Hottie song with his head, although he is happy leading, newspaper and school. keeps A + straight in all its classes. <br /> <br /> He seems to be more interested in using his joy to make Kuzco the right thing and do well in school. In fact, he seems to be more of a mother to Kuzco, a love of love. <br /> <br /> Yzma. When I tried to fail Kuzco before buying Yzma, he became Caesar. Not sure how it should be fired and all. Yzma seems to be the first movie for every new episode. In almost every show he shows that he will appear in Kuzco, in the hope that he will fail from the class. (There are only 3 times that I think it didn't happen.) The jokes about Yzma's aging aren't as clever as they were in the show. And the classic jokes about Yzma are used to death at the show (like "Pull Level, Krunk!", Skateboarder and Lab). <br /> <br /> Also some other points that are not reasonable in this series. The fact that giving Kuzco something that everyone behaves like this task makes him pass by the class, but he seems to give him all the tasks assigned to him. So why is one task so much? <br /> <br /> Seriously who reigns in the kingdom when it happens? Do they have a consulate or steward? No one ever sees the kingdom when Kuzco has not brought back his abilities or Yzma is an emperor. <br /> <br /> Why does Kuzco go to a regular peasant school? Shouldn't he learn how to lead a country, what to do in the event of war or something that will benefit him in the future? I saw how ordinary classes are like agriculture (so he would know how to prepare a country for famine or something), but tie the knot? How is it useful? <br /> <br /> Now I know someone says, "But this doesn't make sense, it should be funny." Then they should have more funny things. All the funny things about the show have already been made in the film. Also, when they notice some of these huge holes in the parcels, why don't they like them in the movie? (For example, if Yzma and Kronk enter secret laboratories before the explanation of Kuzco and Pacha and Yzma and Kronk, they cannot explain how they got their first.) <br /> <br /> There are some good points, it's nice to see some characters from the first movie series like bucky and monkey error. Pacha and his family are still very good signs with a good feeling of the ground. I think this series would be fun for younger children. Finally, the series is not as good as the film based on it, but it can also be useful for younger children.
