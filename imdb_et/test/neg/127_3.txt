I love sci-fi and I'm ready to offer a lot. Sci-fi movies / TVs are usually underfunded, undervalued and misunderstood. I tried to do it, I really did, but it's a good TV sci-fi like Babylon 5's Star Trek (original). The "Sci-fi" setting cannot go beyond silly prosthetics, cheap cardboard kits, clean dialogues, CGs that don't match the background, and painfully one-dimensional characters. (I'm sure there are those who think Babylon 5 is a good sci-TV. It's not. It's a clich√© and uninspiring.) Although US viewers can feel emotions and character development, a sci-fi genre that doesn't take yourself seriously (cf. Star Trek). It can address important issues, but not serious philosophy. In fact, it is very difficult to look after the characters here because they are not just stupid. Their actions and reactions are wood and predictable, often painful. Earth-makers know it's garbage because they always have to say "Gene Roddenberry's Earth ..." otherwise people won't continue to watch. Roddenberry ashes must turn to their orbit as it is boring, inexpensive, poorly edited (looking at it without advertising breaks) to pull Trabant into Trabant. Spoiler. So, kill the main character. And then bring her back to another actor. Jeeez! Dallas again.
