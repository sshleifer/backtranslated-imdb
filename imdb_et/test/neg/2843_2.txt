First I thought it was going to be a bit of a comedy when I had seen the body in the bath when the lad was standing there shouting again and again, but when the film went on, it became more and more flat. The plot was stupid when the man was upset that house prices had risen, so now he quit to call some radio psychiatrist and break his rage because he has nothing better to do. Then the law is involved and desperately tries to feel that they really care about who the caller is and go out to follow this man. One suspect is accused after another. This movie is terrible and Adrian B. and his wife's slow-moving love scenes are boring and just made me a movie. Avoid it!
