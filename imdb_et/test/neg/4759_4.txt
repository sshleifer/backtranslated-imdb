A ridiculous comedy with an armament direction. I love one comment here: "Couldn't do today". Well, nor "Philadelphia story" without a car or two. However, does this mean that the picture is worse than the worn out wear? I don't think "Susan Slept Here" was good for every generation and should live peacefully in the memories of Debbie Reynolds-buffs. The story of this scenario is not sparkling, which puts on a much younger girl for "script research". Dick Powell makes his farewell design that was embarrassing to him. Reynolds is hot. Produced by one Harriet Parson, who gives his famous mother Louella a number of nuts. * 1/2 from ****
