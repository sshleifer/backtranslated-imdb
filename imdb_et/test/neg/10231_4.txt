I had to rent a few movies for my little cousin for the new year and he picked out the Swan Princess: the secret of the fascinated kingdom and the little mermaid 2 and we watched both movies when he was sleeping, I thought I'd get a few comments. :) Although this is a very cheesy comic, it wasn't so bad. You have to admit that these plots are new to the children and can be a great introduction to these stories. <br /> <br /> Odette finds that Derek has kept Rosthoe in secret and she tells Derek to destroy her immediately, but she's a boy, usually she doesn't do it and tells her she can't achieve magic without her help. When a witch named Zelda gets them, she finds that Derek pulled out the last spelling words she wants to use to destroy everything, and she kidnaps Odette to get this information. <br /> <br /> Princess Of Swans: The mystery of Enchanted Kingdom is silly and predictable, but for children who would like to say honestly that it goes. It is so rare that we have these clean cut cartoons now a day, so I created the film somewhat loosely. It was just weird seeing all the voices suddenly change, I grew up first, so I think it was just sticking to my head. <br /> <br /> 4/10
