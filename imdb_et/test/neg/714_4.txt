I think Herzog's documentary work is very uneven. Fata Morgana, a companion piece of the lessons of darkness, not only contains a harrowing spectacle, but primarily the author's attentive eye. Compared to looking for amateurs, the aimless pans on the left and right in the desert, which you would expect from any handycam equipped with German tourists, ran out of the car window, taking all kinds of meaningless images, wire. fences, abandoned buildings and dirt spots that pass through the lens in random order by joining the thinners. At one point, Herzog faces a group of sandy cattle, but the picture is very similar to you and I, perhaps worse, a camera that reflects from one flock to another. A documentary that attempts to be a visual party, a hypnotic, surreal tour of a schematic landscape, has no disciplined visual organization and conviction. It is all over the place, half-hearted and tedious, the Mayan creation myths mentioned in the voice, another text in the Herzog story of literature. Fata Morgana jumps alive through a strange series of meetings. First of all, with the man and the woman playing the music in the room, the man who sings with a distorted voice through the microphone, both apathetic in their own functions. A man with a turtle. A group of old people trying to get out of some holes in the ground. In addition, it seems to have very little substance to offer or visual glory.
