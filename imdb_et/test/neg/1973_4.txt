A fairly transparent attempt to succeed in the flourishing British club scene, a sort of film that promises in some departments, but does very little. Perfect thriller plot (which is only to bring together club sequences), variable action and a pretty ridiculous script, everything stops sorted from when director Jovy apparently anticipated. <br /> <br /> Although Jovy is sometimes superfluous (especially when frequently used dance music is used), it shows its potential and the lack of anti-drug notification is extremely refreshing. All in all, however, the film is a wasted opportunity, and the prospect of a big club movie is out there. Traceable, however.
