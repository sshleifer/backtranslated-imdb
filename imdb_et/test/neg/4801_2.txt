This is the kind of film I mean, why anyone should have done it from the start. This is a movie that I don't understand how people put money into it, how a rental store can put a DVD on the shelves. This is the film I blame myself for renting. <br /> <br /> There are good B-class movies and I will not reject the genre. When they are good, they are keen on action, have well-written characters, and acted well enough to take care of them. The effects of some movies support the film in many cases and you may also like originality. There is almost nothing about "Coronado". Theme and script are at the level of cheap comics - just a clich√©. Impacts are cheap - and I don't care that the movie is small - you can do a lot with a small budget, but you need some talent. There's so much consistency and other redirects than in ten other movies. You don't care about the characters, you don't laugh and at the end of the movie you don't know if the parody was deliberate or not. The only quality I have found is the landscape, there are some good places that are worth a much better film. <br /> <br /> 2/10 on my personal scale. So far the film is the worst.
