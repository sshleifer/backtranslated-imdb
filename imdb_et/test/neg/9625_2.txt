Well, that was a sure waste of Dave McKean's talents, wasn't it? Don't do it wrong: when it comes to graphic design, Dave McKean can be the best in the world right now. The layered, textured look that he can do with just a few pencil lines on untreated paper makes efforts like Peter Greenaway and David Fincher as they are: hackwork. McKean has been in the godfather revolution in the form of comics, films, even magazine ads that lend a distinctive collage effect, which he is at the forefront. <br /> <br /> But this movie? It's junk. Complete junk. These Gaiman's story is, unfortunately, exactly what Gaiman has given us because he hung up Clive Barker for the first time: pseudomytic, over-inflated dreams, populated characters with titles in all capitals. names. Everything is allegorical, insofar as it is impossible for anyone involved to get any drama, emotion or empathy. People make postulations by talking about puzzles that remind us of what Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead might have felt when Tom Stoppard had suffered halfway through his composition. Really, Gaiman, take over yourself. You are not a prophet. You're a poser. <br /> <br /> McKean's control does not help - his pace is weak, taking a full half an hour to deal with the main picaresque plot, and then just a single series, none of them gave any weight. Monsters do not threaten because they are not hidden, just thrown on the screen. The plot will not be used because we do not care about very small protagonists. Half of the dialogue that is exposed to the front of the shirts and masks everywhere is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Some visuals are beautiful and I'm sure fans will lick it up. Damage. Really think of the good work that McKean could have produced if he hadn't caught up with this flat project. <br /> <br /> Rating: D / D-
