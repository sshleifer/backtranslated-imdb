Seriously, all of these Satan reaches Earth's movies, always involving Catholics. Why Lucifer is never confused with other denominations. <br /> <br /> The plot is that Asmodeus (played by former Jason Vorhees Kane Hodder) is a human (but wasn't always a demon) to get this young girl who is her sister pregnant with her child. Except maybe he's not his sister. The plot is not clear, and they combine those scenes where he sees a reduction in his problem. </p> His father gave him a gynecological exam to prove that his hymen is still intact .... Eeeewwwwww. His sister (who plays to wash and wear much worse Denise Crosby) concludes that this is a sign from heaven. Congratulations! Well, the daemon child takes the mother's body for a joyful ride and chooses a truck driver, his boyfriend's boyfriend and his friend, followed by a former military priest whose mission is to kill the child when he was born. We discover that Asmodeus is actually a Catholic cardinal who works the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The end is pretty much incomprehensible and if you could make it so straightforward, you have a stronger stomach than I did. (I stopped the movie a few times, it was so terrible.)
