I can't stress how bad this film is. This director took all the cheap small unitselligents to make these people look so outraged. Why are their clothes so dirty? Why could you get a new course on earth to play a crack head? You should be banned for the rest of your life by Buddy Giovinazzo. <br /> <br /> I am serious about this fool who wants to let real actors and strokes like a smart joke. Why would you ask Clark Kent for a gap? Why are they screaming so much? Why is everything so? Why are these kids so dirty? No one would want to be so messy? Not even a baby horse. <br /> <br /> You have to grow and never make movies.
