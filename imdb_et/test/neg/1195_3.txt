If the League had tilted this script, the supporters would have just turned and said, "No - you don't have the money - it's terrible". As a gentleman's fan, this is their poorest outing. Not very funny, not particularly entertaining, little laugh out loud. They exist, but they are little and far away. I felt the format was tired and really dragging. The film suggests that the writers are forever celebrating and showing. As for the film. I felt that Xmas had a better production value; FX is generally quite poor and it is obvious that they didn't film in Royston Vasey (they filmed it cheap in Ireland). The musical result is weak and the dialogue is terrible. Also, the TVs of characters remained largely out of their TV equivalents. Baths and Edward, which are much underused (again), just did not feel. Disappointing really because I was hoping for a lot more fun. It was really just like the 1970s comedies, where the majority went to Spain ...
