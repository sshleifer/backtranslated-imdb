From time immemorial, music (the second from the movie) swelled and it was hacking the movie, I knew I had a very long journey. Horrendously clichÃ©d - (I laughed a lot and knew how the plot ended in WELL before the end) - they didn't use Louisbourg particularly well and costumes and hair were very terrible. (My special favorite makeup is that the only way they can see Depardieu's age is that he put a wig wig on him. I can continue the ridiculous inappropriateness of music for a long time - the film could be significantly improved with the 18th century score. /> <br /> (ETA: AH, this is a terrible moviemusic man, Patrick Doyle, who is responsible for the score - let's say no more! He shouldn't be allowed near historical films - he should stick to the settings of the 20th century.) <br /> < br /> Visit to "Significant People" was also a lot of fun, especially for his little visit to Madame Pompadour, who wasn't particularly convincing. I thought Michael Maloney, James Murrayna, was the only actor who appeared in the century. He stole the show absolutely For all 30 seconds he was on the screen, he tragically saw that the film could have been. <br /> <br /> The scenes of love had some heat - both leaders were stunned together. <br /> <br /> The most terrible scene of historians is where they are on a big dinner in Britain before Wolfe sailing, and he raises his glass and says that the first two rows of "How is it around the glass" or "Why soldiers why" would be toast. Absolutely irritating failure in history, much better off. Thousands of people know the fucking song and thousands still believe the rumor that Wolfe and the company sang it (probably drunk, not all such a bunch). Daft.
