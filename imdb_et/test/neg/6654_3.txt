Well, the plot is fun, but it's full of stupid. In conclusion, the cop / father wants to save his son from cancer, but the only way is to get a transplant from a criminal (Michael Keaton). <br /> <br /> Well, the offender agrees that he escaped the hospital transplant took place and the police and police-father should not shoot their son to rescue the offender. (dead criminals - not transplanted dead son). <br /> <br /> Well, this movie doesn't have the brain of the police unless they ever heard of TAZER to kill the offender without killing him. the end of the movie, as simple as it is. <br /> <br /> But if all crazy and stupid, including 2cops death and some doctors burned pretty badly.
