Not only is the VHS and DVD covers (at least in Europe) showing a scene that has nothing to do with the actual plot of the movie, the actor is so bad that the film shouts. If you have nothing to do, you are with good friends and you want to laugh at a movie that should be serious, see Tycus and Peter Onorat, a man who will teach you how to knock bad guys in empty boxes! Shame on Dennis Hopper, following the example of Travolt, playing his own "battle ground". For those who want to watch a good movie about destroying the earth with terrible force, please do not pick Tycus, but do it yourself and check out "Armageddon" for him 20 times!
