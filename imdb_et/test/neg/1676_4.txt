A child-like puppet worker, to introduce the public to children, goes a long way when he discovers that children in hospital are victims of dreadful abuse. This movie has some of the worst unspeakable monsters you could ever meet. A non-exploitative film that is specific to the risks of child abuse. Apparently harmless, Mr Rabby takes his hands when the police seem to have been sterilized because there is no evidence to blame the angry parents for their terrible abuses against their children. Children are emotional and zombie-like (..because of their abuse), parents out loud, inconceivably harsh, despicable and warlike. Especially mothers are so obscene, you are rooted to fill them. They are essentially unhappy people who take their children to frustration. Our detectives are tired of many, frustrated by the whole court process, how police procedures often fail to blame those who are competing for their children. Though the crimes themselves are terrible, the film is not explicitly dirty on the screen. I would say it is a man-child unbalanced in Tom Basham's performance, slipping into psychosis. Between Basham and Mr Rabbey and his guardian, there is a rather strange sequence of dinner tables just after he killed the parents responsible for the death of his child, how he lives in fantasy and how what he just did has left an indelible mark. mark changes in behavior, pretty impressive work, innocent scary). Peter Renaday is Mrs Hayes, a detective responsible for murder leaders, expressing her face as a strain that takes her toll. John Ashton has come early to the detective Matthews, always raising Hayes' tendency because he is unable to follow the instructions, not to mention how he thinks parents have abused their children. A puzzled, modest blues score that seems inappropriate for such a movie. The controversial conclusion that even children can tolerate so much. Slowly moving too slowly to my taste, but I feel Basham's eyes effectively before he takes care of the business, patiently waiting for him to prepare for the strike.
