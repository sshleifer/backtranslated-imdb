I found this movie completely and completely incomprehensible. I knew some of his facts about Caravagggio, but here they were twisted and puzzled. The pictures were strangely interesting, but I was looking for more biographic and / or critical records of Caravaggio's life and works, not a LSD drug trip. The dialogue was very confusing and jumped from time to time due to the use of trains, calculators, typewriters and cigarettes. If it had been labeled "with an artistic film", I wouldn't have bought a DVD; Now I have a DVD that I'll ever watch again and who would buy it? I prefer traditional movies, not those that require translation or explanation. Thumbs down this one for me!
