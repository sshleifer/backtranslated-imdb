There are good films and there are bad movies and there is also Moscow's zero, so bad film that makes one month an attractive alternative to an insurance seller. <br /> <br /> With an inconspicuous plot of hell gates that open in the maze of Moscow tunnels, the film depicts a repetitive and pointless picture of little girls running through tunnels, around red lights and strange wall shadows, none of which helps to frighten or frighten. tension, but instead reacts: "They go with the girl (or the lights)" from the viewer. <br /> <br /> Head of María Lidón, who, for the reasons that I am just ashamed of, was settled on Luna, the movie stars Vince Gallo as Owen, an American priest who travels to Moscow, looking for Sergei (Rade Serbedzija), friend and colleague who is lost in the tunnels. He is helping out with the help of a number of local people, except for Oksana Akinshina, the Spanish actors who are trying to push the accents of the finite Russians. <br /> <br /> Along the way down the road some members of an underground leather-covered religious mafia led by Portable Val Kilmer, whose career seems to be in such a free fall that he has used to appear in such a dreck, and a Sage Stallone (Sly) son) who seems to have been cast simply so that Stallone's name can be added to the movie tent. <br /> <br /> In addition, the troupe tries to move through the tunnels with a comic drawing card and by following repetitive techniques or by dusky young girls that aren't much. The dialogue is routinely exchanged between English and Russian, where participants exchange each language frequently and the whole conversation in the second half of the second half, the only visible reason being that they liked adding a frustrating dimension to the viewer. and above, trying to find out what a crazy, clumpy story is. <br /> <br /> The only thing that Moscow will get zero is its title, which could only have given a more precise description of this film when the word Moscow was omitted.
