Well, I have to admit that this movie brings some occasional laugh to my face. OK, but it doesn't make it a good movie. Most of the characters are terrible stereotypes and truly convincing. Not all of them give great exhibitions, but some are really trying but unable because their characters are poorly written. A perfect example is Julia Koschitz: she changes her eating habits from one conversation to another, she does not drink alcohol for the next champagne, she feels too beautiful for most people (actually she is), but still looks like "perfect" fit and refuses to give some "more realistic" boys opportunity and so on ... The end is very cheesy, although I like one last scene when everyone finally stops talking and the director gives us a chance to catch the soul again. Shoppen is basically a movie that offers some cheap laughs (mainly because it's sex and relationships, I expect) and maybe some short entertainment. Nonetheless, the whole picture is one big stereotype and nothing special about it.
