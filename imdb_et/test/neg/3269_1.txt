I saw "Caddyshack II" when I was ten and I laughed mainly because of the horse scene. I should have realized that the film was as empty as ... I can't get a good comparison. It's stupid and not really funny. The cast members of the original, who did not decide at this stage, probably made the best choices they ever made in rejecting it; why, oh, why Chevy Chase came back?! And how on earth did Jackie Mason, Robert Stack, Dyan Cannon and Dan Aykroyd take part in this brush?! I bet every person who had his name even remotely associated with this spam (such as a caterer) is ashamed after redemption. So, it's all over terrible, terrible and all that. Avoid it as if you were an Ebola virus.
