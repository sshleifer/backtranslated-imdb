We were now chosen to torture us with its nasty American propaganda. I didn't like the fact that most American viewers admire it and Europeans hate it. This exhibition has been made for Americans - it's too stupid and full of hate and clichés that need to be taken elsewhere. Almost all those involved have to return to school, action is completely predictable and bad, the script is circular rubbish. Operators work close to zero, etc. <br /> <br /> You are alerted. They don't even have "innocent joy" entertainment for those driven by iq = 0 people. <br /> <br /> Do I want to enter negative values ​​for administrators? Someone?
