this fourth installment of the series is the last to get a theater release, although it seems to be a direct video movie.it's OK, I think, but something special. operation is the worst in the series. and like the third film, there is not much imagination. The sentence "Alani Smithee led" is also a good one. Smithee is a pseudonym leader if they don't want to do anything with the movie. , this is an acceptable film in the Hellraiser series, but not much more than that it is a slight drop with the third number, and a huge drop from the first two. Hellraiser IV: Bloodline is 4.5 / 10
