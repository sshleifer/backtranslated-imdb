This movie is a waste of talented people and a budget for Hollywood. It made me think that all the people in the movie would pay him a favor because they were in that place because they were all places and wasted talent in the movie into a terrible trash. This is an artificial plot that is simply pathetic, unrealistic and even fun and interesting. The only thing that kept me in mind was the many big names in the movie that had to open up without any revelation and had no action or good features to help make the film confusing. I was expecting to have some good things because all these people were cool in other movies. But it never came out. This movie should be in jail as a punishment, but it would be cruel and unusual. You are shocked to see so many recognizable faces that drag such a terrible pathetic script with flat lines and terrible bad behavior. This film reminded me of a complete waste of time with many recognizable faces of BIG TROUBLE (2002), which also went off the breastfeeding scale.
