This HBO original is quite simple and pretty stupid. Armand Assante, who again makes a bad Stallone imitation, is Ray Wellman, who has just been out-con. Everything she wants is her old girlfriend, Lacy, played by young Marcia Gay Harden. Unfortunately, Ray has put Lacy together with Elliot, played by Sam Neill. Even more complicated questions are that Ray's old Cell buddies want some advantage and they rob Lacy to make sure they happen. Ray and Elliot compete, despite their mutual reluctance. <br /> <br /> The following is violent and slow, but Marcia Gay Harden shows us why he won the Oscar in the future, he's not polished here, but his raw emotion sincerely and some pretty clear naked scenes make it worth watching. Almost. <br /> <br /> Rent "Fever" (no title is suitable for the movie) as your fan, otherwise skip and be thankful, the stars went to better things. <br /> <br /> Note - this is a difficult "R" language for language, violence and nudity.
