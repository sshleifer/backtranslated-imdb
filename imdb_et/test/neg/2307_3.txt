The film is based on Jacqueline Susan's best-selling novel. It's about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law) which is a ruthless TV anchor that reaches its way to the top. It describes his love life, focusing on Amanda (Jodi Wexler) and Judith (Dyan Cannon). It also shows his complete inability to bet on someone and instead every woman he can get sleeps. read on. But this movie seems to be like "Resting from the Wind"! This is a textbook example of how to customize a movie. First of all, they bring together the novel terribly. The book deals with Stone's inability to do so and it became clear why. Here it has grown up ... and ignored. There is also a really contrasting scene where the woman is cruelly beaten. This is in the book - but there is a reason for the film being completely excluded. And the book was about three women - not two. Don't even start with homophobia. <br /> <br /> Adapting to side effects is pretty terrible. The law is simply terrible, because Stone - very woody and boring - you don't really know why all these women are after him. To be fair with the law - another actor, but he had a very bad accident before shooting started and the law came in at the last minute. Wexler is terrible as Amanda; Maureen Arthur is really amazing as Ethel Evans; Shecky Greene is unbearable as Christie Lane. Only three shows stand out: David Hemmings (who has a great time) gets to the camp as a gay photographer; Cannon is really great and Robert Ryan is just great. Also Dionne Warwick sings a memorable song ("He Moves On"). <br /> <br /> It's bad, but I looked at the whole thing and it is (in a stupid way) fun. I also give him 3. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline is also a newspaper publisher at Susann.
