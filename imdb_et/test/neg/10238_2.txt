Sammi Cheng & Andy Lau is back in with her 3rd film - YESTERDAY ONCE MORE - directed by HK action player Johnnie To ... The fans of this action film are disappointed that the film does not use one weapon. In addition, Cheng & Lau's fans of previous films who want you to love and love would be disappointed to say that YESERDAY is not as close as funny or pleasant ... <br /> <br /> Mr. And Mrs. To (Lau & Cheng) is a divorced couple ... so wealthy HK citizens ... so incredibly overwhelmed ... both just happened to be professional thieves - "two birds with the same bracket". A couple of years ago, they left the inability to find a middle ground for sharing a predatory ... Now he's married again ... with a rich heir son - the whole mommy boy (Carl Ng) through and over ... Soon-in-law-in-law (Jenny Woo) is suspicious of Mr To's past and thinks she is marrying her son for family jewelery - an invaluable ruby ​​necklace for heirs ... <br /> <br /> The necklace is stolen ... best of him? ... or is his ex-husband, Mr. To, how to sabotage marriage to steal jewelry for himself? .. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie about two love-loving or reviving love ... its about two layers that are always in love, but have somehow thought of understanding ... they pride and greed over them ... <General / YESTERDAY is one part of the whim / hay movie and part of the tribute to the classic Hollywood glamor of its golden years - ie Cary Grant & Grace Kelly EAT SHORT ... Johnnie That she's driving too much to Cheng / Lau chemistry from its earlier films ... hoping that Cheng / Lau's enormous popularity and fan base will be well-founded for this third film .... I think Sammi Cheng is one of the most enjoyable and charming entertainers. & Lau is definitely an Asian cinema for Tom Cruise ... <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed their first two films and I find the Cheng / Lau pair similar to the 40's and 50's classic Hollywood couples. but YESTERDAY is very unexpected ... terrible writing, ridiculous situations, product placements, and all subplots and supporting characters were not necessary ... come to think about it ... this movie was unnecessary ... if you just love fame ...
