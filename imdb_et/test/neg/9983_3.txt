The 210 minute version (extremely hardcore, or so I hear) or the R-rated version that will appear in theaters? Of course, both are terribly awful. Peter O'Toole and Malcolm McDowell have both argued that they would never have made the film (the last of the two men reported this in an IMDb interview!), And I see why. Nothing but a soft porn girl and a pointless experiment on the plot. <br /> <br /> Nothing else except cheap stunts and foolish scenes. I liked what McDowell himself said about the movie: "It was like a moment when I was staring at, admiring my mule or something, and the next scene would be two lesbians who go for it." <br /> <br /> How correct. <br /> <br /> What a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
