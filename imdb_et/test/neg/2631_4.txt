I happened to get this suspicious "horror" momentum late on a Friday night, I wish I went to sleep! Tell me .. Should a 3-foot long raincoat covered with a gurly bicycle give you some fear? Not here, but Mi-low is still able to beat Antonio Fargas, who is three times his size (?) Uh-huh. And the end is so pathetic ... it just leaves you hanging up to go on, something you ever do! I found myself asking, "Is this ??" <br /> <br /> Action is about as good as getting it for a low budget movie. The above-mentioned Fargas offers decent performance; but this is my conclusion that Jennifer Jostyn may be one of the worst actors ever entering the city of Tinsel! Of course, cute face, but bad action. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1
