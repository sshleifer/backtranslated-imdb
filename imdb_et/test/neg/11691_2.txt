Moderately interesting start, some pretty scenes from 16th century Japan and a promising idea. But filling? After about fifteen minutes, the recollected reference is "Cannibal Women in Avocado Jungle". Really. "Oriental history" specialist who doesn't speak any Japanese language walks on tatami without removing their shoes and is usually like celery? Please. It looks like a student film: the kits are kidnapped, show (except perhaps the title characters) close to the tree, the plot completely arbitrary. At least "Cannibal Women" was funny! It's best to follow someone who knows something about Japan, just to look incredibly repeatedly over your face.
