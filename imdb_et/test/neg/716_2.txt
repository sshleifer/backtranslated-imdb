Of all the post-1985 films by Perry Mason I've seen, this is my least favorite. <br /> <br /> I admit that I have never loved Diana Muldaur as an actor. He only seems to know how to play one type of character - a woman with a hard bitten career who has some unspecified chip on the shoulder, which makes it extremely difficult to express compassion in any way. This is no exception - it works by form. <br /> <br /> The only thing that captures this movie in my opinion is Scott Baio as a prosecutor's serious performance - I found myself rooting for him, and this movie is worth seeing alone.
