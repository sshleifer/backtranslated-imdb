After I saw it, I concluded that it was probably a chick flick; later I learned that Keira's mother wrote the script so that it pretty much confirmed it. However, chick flick can be liked by men; it does not seem to be, and in fact does not seem to appeal to women (looking at the unpleasant incomes of the office). One thing that I believe both sexes have agreed is the stupidity of the scene, in a film where the analogy is between the birth and the pain that is amputated with anesthesia. Although men do not give birth, we realize that it is a painful process; but this is a natural pain, but amputation is definitely not! Women understand this even better. I suspect that a woman tried to make a feminist statement that has a bad taste. In fact, this movie has a lot of things with a very bad taste. Although films are nowadays known for their poor taste, it really "looks" in this department. It could have been a good movie showing Dylan Thomas's fighting during World War II; and how strong was the feeling of the men who somehow managed to serve in the army. The mother of Keira's screen writing attempts to show how this mood was used against Dylan, but really drops it. Instead, we get a chick flick on how two young mothers bind; in some sense. In some sense. Maybe. Somehow. Note that the soldier (wife of Dylan's wife's friend) will be sent back home after home delivery; but it is not clear whether the war is over! Many things about this film are also unclear; and though I have said that I am doing it again, because it seems to be the central motive of this confusion.
