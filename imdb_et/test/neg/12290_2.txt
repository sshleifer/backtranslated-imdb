You saw it in a video store and thought I'd give it a try. Sounds like a good story and the cover seemed good. It was so. The characters seemed good and the actor who played "Noel" was the most convincing, although he didn't have a hard time in the movie. I really find it difficult to give a movie a bad rating, but that's one minute that gets it into my book. As the film passed, I wanted to get it better, but without results. It was a good thing asthmatically. Sound and lighting was good, but the actor in this movie was killed for that. It was like watching a low quality soap opera. I just said, "I can't believe they've released this step like". I stopped the unreliability several times that it was so bad. I want to say so much, but I say it simply, everything else, mostly, was good, it worked like the last paragraph that really made this movie.
