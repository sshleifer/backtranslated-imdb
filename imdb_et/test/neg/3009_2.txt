Most of the movies I really like are art price tickets and rarely appear in the top classes of the office. That means I found "Northfork" completely incomprehensible. I don't know what it was. By writing a New York Times about a different film, Stephen Holden remarked that some people think they think they can throw anything on the screen and that it works like a fairy tale. I thought this review several times during "Northfork" viewing. <br /> <br /> On one to ten scale I gave twice.
