This movie was sucked so bad, I couldn't even look at the end. Milo's voice was too low and I didn't understand what he said, as well as some of Kendra's lines. Also, where did he get all these wedding dresses; it was very impractical. The film could not be identified from Milo's drowning and how it made people ridiculous Dr Jeter and his practice. Overall, I was disappointed that I could not give this film a zero rating, as I categorized this film alone, I felt that I deserved it.
