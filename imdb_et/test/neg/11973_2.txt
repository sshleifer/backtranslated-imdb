Wow! Here's another direct-video-scarecrow movie to make cinematographic masochists happy. If cheap direct credits do not tell you that you are a good rider, then you will be tragically tragically "writing" certain. <br /> <br /> A diabetic child can be linked to a legendary scarecrow as part of his initiation to the baseball team. Then the scarecrow starts nuts and starts to hit people. Can I say more? This film largely consists of the cheap effects that make it look like iMovie (note that this is a horrible color inversion) and actors who probably weren't good enough to see Cinemax's special late afternoon. In fact, it is not fair because the actors did not have much room to work around the hesitant script. The parts of this film really look like a parody, especially when one character takes its guitar and starts playing the worst song people have ever done, with the worst lip-sync ever coming. "Gore" is also a big disappointment. In most of these B movies, there is a thick layer of cheap Gore FX to make up for the story and disruption. Here it is so cheap that it is not even fun. This movie actually makes "Jack Frost 2" much more fun. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is the "worst thing you've ever seen," then you are probably not in the deep world of direct-video-B horror. Regardless, this film will give you a lot of mental anxiety, regardless of your background.
