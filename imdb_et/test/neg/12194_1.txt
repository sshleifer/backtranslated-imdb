What is the idea of ​​this movie? It starts as a single movie, then changes the journey, deceives us with the resolution of this movie and ends up as another movie that is nothing but a pale, pale impression of so many other scramble-horrors. The overall impression is confusion in every sense and great hub. The Tarantino scenario, the two men who have previously given talent, the direction of Rodriguez, but who now believe in their leap and assume that everything they do must be good only because they did it. But it doesn't work quite that way. You are only good if you continue to do good things. There are so many questions to ask: what are George Clooney and Harvey Keitel in such a meaningless dreck? Clooney originally makes an intriguing bad guy? completely merciless and effective? and it would have been interesting to see where it went. But, of course, we never do. And the vampire movie Clooney becomes completely different. It's not smart or witty, it's just bad, bad work. Keitel looks easily sick all the time and no wonder. Did anyone in the studio look at the script before the project was given a move? Tarantino is completely unpleasant as a murderous sexual deviation (and why he, as a writer, assumes we will find a rape, a merciless murder and a murderous hostage funny). At every level? except technical? this movie stinks. Avoid.
