The plot of this movie is dangerously thin and the only "star power" when we call it Joe Estevez. I don't know what's more shocking. The fact that this movie was made or the fact that some people gave good comments on it. If you see the cover of the video, you can read them. Someone even said the actor / writer could be the leading lady of the 90s. Yes! And Joe Estevez may have more money than his brother Martin. If you want to check it anyway, I suggest you check this version of MTS. At least you laugh a lot without being crazy.
