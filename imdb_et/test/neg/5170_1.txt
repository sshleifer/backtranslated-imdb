There is no doubt that the Kokoda Trail represents a truly major event in Australian military history, which is the brave defense of Australia against the cruel barbaric Japanese army. How does this film ignore the story of "Fuzzy Wuzzy" or New Guinea natives that Australians helped them carry out military operations there . The film does not provide a reliable report on the Australian soldier and his behavior at this event. It is an uninformed modern view of what was like. <br /> <br /> Again, the Australian film industry has not given this important chapter in Australian history what it served. This is the worst thing about making a film in the absence of any cinematography, bad scripting, dialogue, sign development, and the scene of the jungle war of clich√©s. <br /> <br /> In a meaningful perspective other than the Japanese army, this audience will not be able to be ruthless and cruel by poorly trained and poorly trained Australian groups fighting insecurely. <br /> <br /> The film failed because most Australian films attracted a significant Australian audience because they stayed in the droves. br /> <br /> I'm not going to join a conventional parochial garbage to say its big because of his Australian film. I'll either say good work or leave it to someone who knows how. This government-funded film is just another failure of Australia's rich and spoiled rich children. <br /> <br /> I will give it a zero point, because it is the descendants of their truly great Australians and their immense sacrifice. What a disgraceful waste and disrespect, and I know that this review brings more negativity to the film show team and most of the reviewers, but I am right in my opinion and that is what Australians fought for our freedom and which include freedom of expression and the right to express freedom of expression.
