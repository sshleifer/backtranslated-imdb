After the success of Wrestler's vortex (see my review), Mickey Rourke had this "pearl" head straight into the video. Each copy had been rented for several months and I even heard a good sound around it. So months later, I caught up with the movie network and sat down to watch it. First of all ... one of the places in the movie (the island of Walpole) is where I went regularly as a child because we lived very, very close to the reserve. Yes Yes? That's why coolness ends with this dud. I mean, the story is decent enough to justify the four, and even the direction is not bad, but the performances are just terrible and totally ridiculous for some truly wasted stars and Mickey $% # @ * &! Rourke plays Native Canadian / American hit-man?!?! What was the name of the Lord when they thought? He doesn't even look like Native Blood and his attempt at generic native accent made him look even more ridiculous. They could have gone to this story somewhere ... they could have hired a local actor or changed the character of Rourke, how would a white man be raised by local parents? Instead, they made Killshot a complete and complete joke. <br /> <br /> As you have hit Mickey Rourke's "stars" at Killshot, I use this concept loosely. I never loved Rourke much, although his Oscar winning was enough. It shows and affirms that she doesn't like her. He looks boring, constantly bored and his flat attempt to portray the Native is to limit the insult I think. He does a decent cold blood killer, but then the story never explores that part of what the story is completely upside down. Diane Lane, although it is well-respected in Hollywood, turns to another drab. He has had moments, but he usually does not take any performance. She looks like she's going to be big, but when she's not, it's even more disappointing. Thomas Jane plays his defensive wife. I've always felt that Jane deserves a bigger career than she has. I think his blood has a star meaning. Everything said and made his presentation at Killshot is not really bad. He does not take things too far and he is so harsh and almost heroic. He and Lane can have a decent chemistry, but he doesn't get much of his character. I have absolutely no idea why Rosario Dawson A) didn't have that movie and B) at all. His character is absolutely useless, and he had no point in making a plot or a story to give him an equally bad result. I have rarely seen a character that supports such incredibly useless. The only redeeming character and performance in this film is that given by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a dirty mini-killer who wants to join Rourke's scorer. Gordon-Levitt is crazy and entertaining and his character is engaged. Had the film been completely out of it, it would have been cracked. It stores it literally. His competition is almost worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Oscar appointed the director ... who's waiting? Yes Oscar nominated director John Madden (I think a football coach could have done a better job). I've never seen Shakespeare in love, but I remember the critical appreciation he got, and it surprised me because the direction in this movie and the characters was terribly terrible. Scriptwriter Hossein Amini hasn't done anything I know, but apparently it has been written for the next Jack Ryan movie, and after that confusion I can't even imagine why they would like him. I understand that it is based on a novel and I really hope that the novel is over this mess. A small action and a hockey attempt at a man and his partner who has been emotionally charged and confused with what they get. there is no reason for yourself through this pain. I did it for you and still feel pain. 4/10
