Barney is just terrible. Like many other exhibitions say about this show. I don't agree with them (I don't). Because I hate this example as much as they do. They use children who look like they are in sixth grade, cheesy plots, terrible dialogue and really funny special effects. Not to mention the great purple dinosaur itself. He makes all other outfits like the winners of the prize (Sesame Street has won awards that I know). Please just look at Sesame Street, Thomas Tank Engine or even Teletubbies. Avoid this and that movie (which I also watched). They are both extremely dirty and not suitable for anyone (even young children).
