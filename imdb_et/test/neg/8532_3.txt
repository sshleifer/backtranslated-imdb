Despite a completely misleading advertising campaign, it turns out to be a flick irritating clich√© with a completely unreliable ending. Clue # 1 for all who are considering this turkey: Sam Raimi didn't drive it. Although movie ads play their part, it is actually one of four producers. It's too bad for someone to be talented because Raimi has promised to use his name in such a bad film. I don't think he'd ever run anything like that; this task was left to Pang Brothers. <br /> <br /> The scenario of this movie seems to be combined with many other "horror films" so you can find "absolutely" the original content of "The Messengers". "What we get is the scene here and there, paired with" Pulse "that could have come from" The Birds ", one or two" others ", etc. Almost every scene, almost every line in the dialogue The whole thing alters such a predictable movie that almost everyone understands that "the surprise ends" long before it comes. <br /> <br /> It is time to point out this The advertising campaign, which focuses on the idea that only children see ghosts, has nothing to do with this film. In fact, everyone can see ghosts. it came out with this campaign because the film had a unique angle to get any cashmere that would otherwise be completely inadequate. Now you know, so don't be fooled! Maybe this movie is the most reminiscent of the participants' chemistry. not just o All interactions are clumsy. Along with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes (just what is the man who was murdered by his whole family still lurking around the small town where the murder happened, somehow? Does anyone think he might have arrested him?), It all adds deeply an unsatisfactory ghost strike that can surprise someone who is over ten years old with cheap shots: loud noise, visual flashing and something that goes out of the closet and shouts "Boo!" Everything we get this time is another badly made film about the spirits that try to warn people out of the house. If there is a message that "Messengers" are giving, it's "Don't waste your time with this movie."
