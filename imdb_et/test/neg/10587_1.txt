I was expecting this film to be a terrible god. Like "What dreams can come up" or "Truman Show" or anything. Well they sold it for 3.99 pounds in their local DHW and had Giovanni Ribis on the cover, you know you can't help but love him, and so my friends dared to buy it. and I was sure it was a trash. maybe this is the only reason I can sit through this movie because my standards were never so high.
