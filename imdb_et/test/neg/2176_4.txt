Adenoid Hynkel, a serviceman of the First World War, will rise to Toumania's ruthless dictator in the coming years. He creates an aggressive, anti-Semitic war machine and grows a small toothbrush mustache. Sound like anyone you know? <br /> <br /> Based on Hollywood security, Chaplin uses this soapbox to inspire Europe to receive weapons and against Hitler and Mussolini. Given that the United States had more than one year of neutrality in 1940, and that it did not want to break into European civilian behavior (remember, Hitler declared war in the US, not the other way round). Surprisingly, Chaplin was allowed to spread this inconvenient polemic. <br /> <br /> The story includes, on the one hand, the vulgar and reptilian Hynkel, and the terrorist rule that he misconstrues, and life in the Jewish ghetto, where every person is friendly, humane, courageous, etc. etc., Chaplin is Hynkel and he also plays a Jewish hairdresser, a little hero of the ghetto (The Tramp in all but name). Needless to say, Chaplin writes, directs, marks, writes music and makes meals. <br /> <br /> In 1940, there was no complete truth about the Third Reich, and Chaplin could be forgiven for nothing less than perfect historical foresight, but even according to the standards of the day that Hitler was wrong. Comedian and sentimentalist Chaplin is trying to ridicule Hitler, making Hynch foolish and unhappy. All this is his humanization. If Hynkel is not a very militant soldier fooling with a large pistol and upside down, he becomes rather pleasant than despicable. As a dictator, he controls the technical innovations of his subordinates, which do not work (parachute hat, bulletproof uniform, etc.) and these passages are meant to think that the actual Nazis are incompetent and can be ignored. In fact, the Hynkel regime is cute and pleasant with this worshiping body. <br /> <br /> In fact, Chaplin's day was over when he made this poorly thought-out polemic. In his heart, he was still in the dinosaur of the silent screen (see humor, such as half-conscious on the street, up or down), or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings. The hero Schultz is designed to be a benchmark for European dignity against which Hynkel can be judged, but Schultz sees operetta rather than Nazi. Is it somehow believable that the Schultz figure (if there is one) would say to Fehrer's face, "your cause is doomed because it is based on the stupid and merciless persecution of innocent people"? And how can Schultz get into the basements of the Jewish ghetto? If he is the subject of an exhaustive dummy, why does he continue to wear his Ruritan uniform? Chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka, but the Nazi concentration camp he offers us is hopelessly aging. As usual, Chaplin thinks as a "silent" comedy set loosely tied to narrative clothing lines. The poisonous demolition takes place with storm-catchers, shaving a man to Brahms and the world ballet (see that the segment is filmed upside down). Just like the ghetto's people are impossible and the Jewish refuge in Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic, so Hannah is literally too good to be true. Brave, defiant, inventive, hardworking and (apparently) beautiful, he is a ghetto in the cage of Judaism Canary. "Gee, aren't I cute?" he asks, after Barber gives him over. The answer is too cute. He doesn't ring the truth because Chaplin has made him a caricature. "Wouldn't it be wonderful?" The speech that Chaplin puts into the mouth is typical for the author - too word, too emotionally amazing. <br /> <br /> Jack Oakie is great as a Naphton, a fascist dictator of bacteria. He brings a comic to the procedure, but the weakness of the film remains. If Napaloni is stupid and ineffective, how can we be afraid of him? And in any case, the reverse train beating is a trickle of a fine Chaplinesque example of a gag that has stayed much further away from his comic book. <br /> <br /> And where did the Jewish hairdresser get this impeccable Hynch uniform?
