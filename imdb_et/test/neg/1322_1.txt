What a happy movie. This is undoubtedly a Class B movie. The German elite StormTroopers is attacking Russian bunkers massively like the old WW1 battle. Action is mediocre, the plot is thin and mowing. Sometimes it's hard to see where it goes. The sequences are pretty worthless (if one exists), except that they use WW2 authentic devices / vehicles. This is NO WAY at the same level as "Saving Pvt. Ryan" or "Platoon". Lots of valuable attempts to develop a character that doesn't lead anywhere. An old theme with a good officer / bad officer is very predictable. Even the action sequences look like a 12-year-old child. I could have been better directed. Too bad it is the same man who made "Das Boot (The Boat)" because it was a good good movie. He had to participate too much for this success because he lost his shortage of touching the film. I bought it on a DVD, it is better to rent it.
