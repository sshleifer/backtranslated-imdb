Dracula 3000 or Van Helsing "Dracula Revenge" (Cheap cash with another vampire) when I saw it is a master class, how not to make a movie. A collection of dirty labels that contained a misdirected aboard a previously lost cargo ship "The Demeter" in the Carpathian system (which is later upgraded to the Carpathian Galaxy) and wakes up in relentless evil (in this case, a script). The film is an odd horizon of events and any slow vampire movie. <br /> <br /> **** Spoliers Follow **** After many production company logos and credit sequences, which most of the budgets have to be blown up, we open a cheese-speaking speech from Casper (silly name) who plays Captain Abraham Van Helsinki ( the real name) and instead of developing the actual character, it describes the twists of the twisted, incomprehensible team. Van Helsing exploded into sport and carries the body warmer in the 80s with respect to Mr Han Solo (I think). Now and again, Demeter's captain appears in a mad video diary to tell us any consequence with a pronounced German accent (unfortunately, subtitles are not included). The team Mina puts an abandoned ship (alone) with an armed weapon and a thick eastern European accent that talks to Van Helsing on her ship's bridge (which is basically one glittering wall). A gas mask with a rubber hose glued to the front, I will encounter what can only be described as a black fashion jersey that constantly slides with the camera. Why does this happen because the vampire has not yet been made, the meat has never been explained. It brings a trembling camera that drives me along the corridor until it runs into Humve. Maybe Will Smith could have been writing Humvee lines because most of them are composed of Humvee, which reminds us that he is black every ten seconds and saying that the word "ass" is enough for the Guinness record when it is all "DA hood" accent (this is 3000, "DA hood" even exists?) One of the main problems with this film is that it tries to pretend to buy it for 3000 years, because Demeter looks suspiciously like a Soviet-style ocean ship Tanker Maybe the film crew thought there were hammer and sickle symbols everywhere and a sexy poster next to the Lenin box and explain it as some futuristic communist comeback. Team clothes look like they were attacked from the Oxfam collection box (sealed since 1993) and they are armed with teeth at the latest by the 20th century automatic weapon (plus 3,000 zing a year if they were fired), which of course is by no means against health is the past (in the future) because the simulation professor has not only glasses but a wheelchair ??? My God, what happened to all the genetic engineering things. <br /> <br /> Professor is an interesting character because he is a direct kidnapping of alien resurrection, who had his own badge that tells a man in a wheelchair wrong. who wasn't killed strangely). Fans did not take Profi as he fears in many scenes. If I had been poisoned by a chariot on a Soviet ship, everyone left me because I was so funny. I'm afraid too. <br /> <br /> During the UN-dramatic I chase scene, profiles (feeling) "it is disturbing". The rest of his lines are also amazing "bugger" and "We all die" X 100 followed. <br /> <br /> Will Erika Eleniak appear as Deputy Director General (what happened to the first officer)? what I thought it would be tired, a standard problem, a heavy nervous, pointless, "don't go up if I don't tell you", beat up 10 stuntman super-babies at once, but this is a Z-flick so it basically carries a strong low-cut and even tighter leather trousers. Coolio's performance increases the zinc factor by 90% and is a tent line, but fortunately he dies fast. Although she seems to be holding her heart on the right side of her body. <br /> <br /> After riding up and down the same corridor using Soviet-style controls and sitting in Soviet-style dressing rooms, the team gets into the bugger of their ship to find a more interesting team (probably). Why Dracula is even mentioned is not known because the main bad boy is Orlock, which is Space Transilvanian for "fashion crimes" because he doesn't have a big swollen, dirty shirt and even a larger starch collar that makes Hammer Horror's vampires slippery. Orlock stops to explain his entire story (camera) to Erica Eleniak, but cannot kill her in another alien resurrection. His back story is a load that does not need to be repeated. Since the budget cannot afford the fighting coordinators, special effects, original music, script (not written by the chimpanzee) and even the right end titles (the first list I saw was the same characters but completely different and the Italian names), the movie starts destroying any peace of mind that you started. The team is fortunate enough to fight back with a computer that has hidden, millennia-old references to kill fictional creatures and some handy 20th-century pool images they found in the rest room of your ship (your "holodeck"). The end is terrible and a bit suspicious, whether they ran out of money or when the former councils demanded their ship back. I walked into this movie knowing it was bad, but overlooked how bad it really was.
