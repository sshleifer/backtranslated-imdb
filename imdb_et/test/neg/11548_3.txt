This unintentionally amusing 80's TV movie is based on the assumption that sex bomb Donna Mills (in most terrible wardrobes) is a neglected housewife, torturing her sexy past as a cheerleader. He escapes his empty life, fantasizing about the occasional sexual encounters of one of the many attractive men he meets, eventually giving his fantasies and giving it a little side, even though everything he really wants is to restore his flaming flames dull man James Brolin. <br /> <br /> There are many ridiculous aspects of this film, Mills' first invasion of co-production (later, after he left Knots Landing, he found great success as the queen of the trashy TV movie starring in the 90s melodrama He usually played some kind of victim who had clearly decided to wash his hands perfectly with the evil and entertaining connoisseur he'd played in the knots for so long. The most entertaining are the fantasy tricks that have been filmed as if they were meant for soft core porn (wind and smoke machines, backlighting, porn music), but because it is an online TV movie, the scenes are all very clean and ultimately not very sexy. <br /> <br /> Less ridiculous is the terrible dialogue that carton characters are forced to proclaim (poor poor Cicely Tys) is like a mandatory psychoanalyst, or Veronica Cartwright as a mandatory best friend or even pre-Babs James Brolin with this soap style that is put together with a fist.) <br /> <br /> Of course, as with all such films, we learn that all the problems can be solved by psychotherapy and then the film just becomes foolish if we briefly examine the causes of Mills' shocking behavior (as if it just didn't just want a good shag!) <br /> <br /> Free.
