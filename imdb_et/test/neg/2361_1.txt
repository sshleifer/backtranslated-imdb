I can't believe how this cruelty managed to capture the cross-sectional hearts and thoughts of the "bright young people" of my era, but I'm sure I wouldn't want it. In my opinion, this is an inaccurate, ill-acted, weakly written, pretentiously directed gumpf. Short trips to the imaginary reality gap with any humor to death. Situations are unpleasant exaggeration, which makes the sparse characters even more unbelievable and despicable. Romance is boring, the end does not satisfy and destroys the only sensible drug information in the film, and a simple plot ('Withnail and I', 'Fear and loathing') is being tested outrageously with an uninteresting film motion. In short, this film is an outstanding visual attack that has no skill or initiative. I condemn this ashes in the history of history and pray that it is there.
