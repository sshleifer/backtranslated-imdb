This is by far the worst film I've ever seen. It has been a few years since I saw it, and since then nothing has gone and I doubt that this film will ever have a bad film like this. He is catching up with a variety of movies, such as "Nell" (!) And just joking about it. Whatever you do, don't rent or rub it and if someone throws it on you .... turn around and drive differently!
