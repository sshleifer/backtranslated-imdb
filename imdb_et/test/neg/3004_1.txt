This kind of frustrating thing in the film, which has a true size potential, is that it almost enjoys a heavy hand. We are talking about the allegory, the metaphor ... but the truth is that you cannot overpower the fact that there is no plot or real character. is ... even if we never understand where they are going. Happy pretentiousness carried me every time I tried to understand the truth in this film. The whole style and substance. Of course, this is a matter of taste ... but I would never take on the confusing modernist character of the symbols and splashes of Jean Cocteau or Renoir's spiritual clarity. But if it works for you, I'm all about it. I think art is a personal thing.
