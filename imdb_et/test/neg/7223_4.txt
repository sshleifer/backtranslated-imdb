Richard Donner shows his liberal credentials with this ridiculously overwhelmed, simplified attack on South African politics. It is not like America would be the cradle of racial harmony and brotherly love - and the irony is that the film is a city that was home to Rodney King and praises Police Department, which made so much community relations with its cruel racist behavior. So the tying of Donner's salt and pepper, which is obviously late = developing teenage crushing to one another, does its job, without respecting the rule of law or the rules of evidence, and no one is worried because bad guys are white South Africans - certainly a worrying example of police racism per se? In Rudd's (Joss Ackland - an extremely insidious) office, the interior design has been designed and illuminated so as to be as close as possible to Fuhrerbunker, and if any stupid filmmaker ignores this point, he and his men are regularly called Nazis. . For me, the only bright spot in the film was when Mel Gibson turned to an anti-apartheid demonstration headed "End Aparthied Now". Intense irritating Joe Pesci is introduced to the franchise to take part in the boys' weights, constantly observing them as a poorly trained puppy. It would be tolerable if he had the furthest chance of getting a concrete coat, but unfortunately he remains irritated for another day. Miss Patsy Kensit seems to be in her own world, maybe she doesn't think her luck is against Mel Gibson who has little trouble wiping her mobile home into bed, which seems to be somewhere on the beach to wash. The thing they're coming out of is the many helicopters that come to Mel's caravan enough to keep the US Army in Iraq for six months. Fortunately, he has a pet dog who is not afraid to cause sexual intercourse as they go for seconds, and his bark warns them of an upcoming attack. I hope he got a special bone as a reward. The film runs (without Mel's dog uninterrupted) from a Nazi merchant ship to Germany (sorry, South Africa) when Mel and Danny murder so many championship members that I lost hope. The effect of the bullet hail Mel lives, waving his partner's hands like a small child with a wise and benevolent father.
