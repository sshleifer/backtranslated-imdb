Perhaps this is because I read Peter Straub's wonderful book before seeing the film, but I was very disappointed with this film. In my opinion, the filmmakers removed everything that made the story interesting and unique, and replaced it with more common Hollywood-style elements. <br /> <br /> It's too bad, too, because this movie is amazing, especially Fred Astaire, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, Melvyn Douglas, John Houseman and so far unknown Alice Krige. They're not really worth it to do. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was all halfway, but my friend persuaded me to end because he was sure he'd better. He apologized to me at the time of the closing credit.
