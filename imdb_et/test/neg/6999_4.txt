Dare Rudd (John Wayne) and Sidekick Dink Hooley (Syd Saylor) are traveling goods that can't stay in one place for very long. In "Helltown", boys are redirected to Montana, where they meet Rudd's cousin Tom Fillmore (Johnny Mack Brown) who offers them work. It's tough to see guys wearing aprons when they start with a herd, even though Dare becomes self-conscious when Miss Judith (Marsha Hunt) goes to camp. Judy is a Tom girl, but the attraction between her and Dare is early on. <br /> <br /> Fillmore has a flock of herds to move around, encouraging the bold to ride, in part to prove he doesn't have to fill up. Meanwhile, bad boy Bart Hammond (Monte Blue) is on the lookout for Fillmore cattle, but if his henchmen do not flock, he will be easier to win the money Dare paid at the end of the trajectory. Combining Dare with a robbed card game with his man Brady (James Craig), Dare will start to lose money after his hand. This is only when Dare can't show back to the Fillmore beach that Tom is going out to find his cousin. Cheating, Tom, Dare, and Dink High Tail Exposure before the bad guys get hold of. Sorority, a few years after Wayne's West Peoples Lone Star Productions. This changes the Lone Star formula only slightly; Wayne gets the girl at the end of the movie, but here she tried. There's a big runaway horse in the arena where Wayne rescues Marsha Hunt, where Johnny Mack Brown's horse makes a full saliva flow. Syd Saylor is working on a comic ball, doing his best to sell lightning rods to unsuspecting victims. He replaces the familiar face of George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt, the clips of Lone Star movies. John Wayne's charisma begins to evolve here, preparing him to jump to the superstar he finally achieved. <br /> <br /> "Helltown" was based on the novel by the legendary Western writer Zane Gray. If you are looking for more movies based on Gray stories, try "Fighting Caravans" with Gary Cooper, "Light of Western Stars" by Victor Jory, "Drift Fence" with Buster Crabbe and "Desert Legacy" by Randolphiga Scott.
