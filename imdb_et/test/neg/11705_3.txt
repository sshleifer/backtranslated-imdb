I have not seen the same movie you commented on here. First of all, I think they should have a serial-based Ghost Story if they were filming it at all. The interrupted version they came with was terrible. I felt that the performances were nice and so much of a story was that the performances of masters such as Astaire, Douglas, Houseman and Fairbanks seemed to be a tooth. However, Alice Krige was a great Eva. Craig Wasson is a good actor but he was just the main character. The decision to lead Patricia Neal and shorten her role was not good. Imagine what Anne Bancroft would have done with that character! I blame the script, which was bad. Production values ​​were blind and the pace was slow. Disappointing, pedestrian efforts. The book is one of the five biggest temporary / horror novels of the 20th century, IMHO. But the film was disappointing, though it was a great introduction to Krige.
