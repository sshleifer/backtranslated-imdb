"Embarrassing" is the only word to describe its ridiculously terrible production. From the gross disregard of the source material (certainly from people familiar with mythology) to the total predicted inadequate production value, this is the whole mini-series train wreck. <br /> <br /> Cast (which includes some good players that I am sorry to do, gives an illogical dialogue with the same general "Europe" accent that is so common for bad epics. The worse is the lack of originality in almost all other aspects, from costume and designs (styles from all time and space at the same time) up to the score (which seems to mimic so many recognizable classic stories as well as the "Lord of the Rings".) The most offensive are the visual effects that prove that if you can't do them well, Then write them out. <br /> <br /> It felt to me that I saw another legendary story: cheap "adaptation." Maybe one day, someone would do it right.
