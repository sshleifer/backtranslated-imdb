I don't know what the Chasidik movement was for this movie? I saw this movie a year ago. Community And I can tell you that this movie was offended! It's so far from reality, it's scary! The director could hire Chasidik Rabbi for a brief consultation before he made the "Realistic" movie of ultra-values! For example, Meir's Davening (morning prayers)! Or Jewish Weddings or Mikveh (ritual baths) customs. <br /> <br /> The film is full of technical inaccuracies, but it's not me that bothered me. It's the spiritual side. Orthodox are portrayed next to the Taliban. A woman is powerless while men are the supreme rulers! Please, nobody can force a Jewish girl against Chup! We, Orthodox, also live by the law (Halacha), which clearly states the responsibility of a person to his wife. Neither beating nor rape! And no man (even a rabbi) can type in Mikveh with his wife. And it is not for Balan to put his hand on the head of a woman when she takes a ritual bath, so it's a good idea to wear the whole body at once! The Director clearly tried the Ultra Orthodox! But could he do that at least in a nice and educated way? <br /> <br /> Love Story? Cute! But not trustworthy. The dialogues are long and boring. The end sucks completely. For all this drama I was at least hoping for a nice end because all this session I felt like I was doing it! Obviously, someone tried to make a cozy film of calming consciousness for less attentive Jews or non-Jews, maybe .. (look at these fundamentalists, they're both evil and average ...) and they'll succeed! The long thing is short: hoping for a nice Europie (Kane-level) movie, instead of a tradition that was unrealistic, unrealistic, mistakenly guiding spam. I mean, today we are living in free time than ever before. Everyone has the right to choose. Malka chose rock singer.Rivka made her choice. Many people who have not watched these days choose Orthodox Judaism. Because in this enemy world religion can be a nice gateway!
