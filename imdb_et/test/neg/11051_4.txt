Jove by what is holy confusion! Revenge, love for bleeding, mechanical game-like struggle, incessant and completely unnecessary violence, somewhat primitive "music" that grabs the victims, big "surprises" (which is actually "revelatory" as the titles of the National Enquirer). Add some bad camera movements that look stylish and creative and have already impressed the crowd. The totally undesirable popularity of this film shows that the pop subculture has reached not only the achievement of the last few decades, but also the dominating taste of the impotent audience. (For a deeper knowledge of people's suffering under mental illness, without Oldboy's vulgar excess, I recommend the older Dutch / French movie "The Vanishing." <br /> <br /> There's nothing good to say about this movie. Actually there is. A famous scene where the hero (really a hero, an absurd father who sleeps with his daughter and then tries to forget about salvation?) Eats a living octopus, which is very useful for casting the best actor: octopus itself. The bad bad beast who has eaten could not survive and act just to get another worthless diploma for the "best actor" at the Cannes Festival. <br /> <br /> A festival, by the way, between Moore's propaganda nonsense and its worthless, somewhat exotic wonder, became a coat of arms and a ridiculous festival. <br /> <br /> Sic Transit Gloria Mundi!
