Regardless of whether the overwhelming social message of this film - that justice is acceptable - is justified, I was more offended by McConaughey's closure application. In the drama of the courtroom, the final report of the counsel of the counsel is pretty much the core of the film, and if the problem is just as difficult to solve, it is given to the public and the jury. Basically, this means that the audience considers the white girl a rape offender as a rape of a black girl. I find it very offensive. As for the rest, I found that action is reasonable, except for Sandra Bullock, who seems to have played her usual effervescent self (not actually working in the drama of the courtroom), but what is the point of the message of the film as it is. It tells you that vigilante justice is good and blames you for racism if you disagree.
