This movie is one of the worst films ever. I'm such a movie is not in the 100's; it deserves at least 60 or 70 seats on the spot. It's not just a movie that I find bad when it's a campy-fun MST3K way; it's just bad. This is one of the few movies I really do, actually HATE. Freddy Got Fingered is the same category of bad. <br /> <br /> So this story is that the daughter (Gugino) goes to California to go to school and return to Crawl (Shore). Learn to be a farmer. Then the boy tries to set Shore so that the girl leaves Crawl and goes back to her. It ends and the audience on the left can leave. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of this movie is to make Pauly Shore expensive for the camera and try to be funny; but I would say about 100% of the time he doesn't. Their terrible inaccurate and outdated view of farms and agriculture is insulting and worthless in this film. If you think you can see it: don't. Once I saw a movie that seemed to be watching it for 5 or 6 hours. If you have already seen it; you have my compassion.
