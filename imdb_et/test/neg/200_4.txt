I was in Toronto's Wrestleman VI as 10 years old and the event I saw was quite different from what I saw on the Wrestleman collection DVD I just watched. I do not understand how wwE has no rights to some old music, as most of these songs are created by WWF because they should not worry about licensing and usage fees that prevent SNL from showing season kits. It's pretty stupid to slip it out, but for me, Demolition will personally hear Wrestlemania, which was a memory that I never forgot and had no DVD. What is their point of even having rights to this great video library if they have to use it so drastically?
