I saw this movie in New York at New Festival. It was by far the worst film. This is the use of uncircumcised full front nudity and a delicate script and direction that does not devote to "Maurice" and does not decide that it is a flick of LaBute, I felt: "Why should anyone destroy a perfectly cast cast? "There is no irony and a vacuum with a feeling that causes the time when the film itself starts, that you want to wipe your face as your mind and heart look for what could happen in the movie, but not. I wish the director and editor had re-edited the film, because there may be more stories that could otherwise be released from the unpleasant experience.
