As long as you keep in mind that the creation of this movie was an incentive for copyright and is not meant to be a serious release, it is actually surprising if not totally terrible. I even liked the theme of music. <br /> <br /> And if ever, the nickname Joel (or Mike) and MST3K bots call it, that's it! Look at it with a clever ass bunch, and you're on time. Brew, win some great jewelry and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Obviously, getting a copy of a bootleg or downloading it requires shareware, but if you're in IMDb, then you're probably pretty likely. Good luck. <br /> <br /> And look for my favorite item .... where Dr. Doom informs FF that they have 12 hours to fulfill their wishes, and he actually gestures the number "12" at the same time .... this is like "Evil Sesame Street" .... hoo boy. <br /> <br /> ... and, of course, Mrs Storm, who says, "Look at you. .. Fanstastic Four" is just so warm from the heart .... laugh, you cry ..... > <br /> So if you love schlocky Sci-Fi, it's fantastic for you!
