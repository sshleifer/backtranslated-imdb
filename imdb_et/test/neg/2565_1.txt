I don't know the rest of this movie, but personally, I'm dead and tired of Steven Seagal. When it was over the law, it was a great movie. Wahoo. Now in Patriot, Steven Seagal plays Steven Seagal above the law. I'm tired of not changing the face. It's the same character, from time to time, from time to time. He needs change. This movie was probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. Calling it an action movie, it gives almost too much credit because there are too few activities and they spread far away in the film. I think they wanted to go to some drama, but it was pointless to try, because the film is something, but the usual nervous eye-Steven-Seagal we've seen thousands of times. Losing a new look and a pony tail is all I have to say, I definitely don't want to watch this movie in any form, go eat, fuck, rent Barney goes to Vegas, but in no way rent this movie prescription to give Seagal an excellent result.
