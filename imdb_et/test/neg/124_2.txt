STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Former New Orleans killing police officer Jack Robideaux (Jean Claude Van Damme ) is for Columbus, a small but violent city in Mexico, to assist the police in their efforts to halt large heroin smuggling into their city. The culprits turn out to be the former military, led by former commander Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord, otherwise known as Jase East Enders), who uses a special method he has learned to fight his opponents in Afghanistan. But Jack has a personal reason to take him down, pulling the two men into an explosive final showdown, where only one lives alive. <br /> <br /> After his death, Van Damme arrived high, showing he was able to do the best in the market. Although it was a much more drama-oriented film that The Shepherd has returned with a big blow, there is no brain surgery that made him famous and has unfortunately produced his worst film from Derailed. It's not nearly as bad as this movie, but what I still said is a boring, predictable film with very few exciting activities. What little is mainly about some sliding fight scenes, trying to look cool and trendy with some cheap slo-mo / sped up effects attached to them that, unfortunately, instead of looking for despair. As a filmmaker from Mexico, director Isaac Florentine has tried to give Robert Rodriguez / Desperado a sort of feeling, but it only adds despair. Robert De Niro was an actor that couldn't be good. As a villain, the Lord should not wait for the baby to leave. In the beginning, he gets a little dialogue when he fights for an American accent, but gets inevitably a better end. All supportive pains are equally blissful and do nothing to make the movies strong. <br /> <br /> This is one shepherd who has been parked for a raft. *
