Amnesians who remove their clothes from a hat drop (or blouse?) Are about the only views on a film that is otherwise slow and determined. Although the main purpose of the story is a lot of possibilities, they are never developed satisfactorily and the exposure is almost non-existent. Much of the film is just a journey through multi-storey clinic / hospital corridors. The overall effect is gloomy and sterile, with THX-1138.
