People seem to be interested in showing that there is a pathetic life at the exhibition that has no purpose whatsoever. I give my sincerity to NBC for these serious efforts to make new changes on television, making free-of-charge exhibitions free. They seem to always find great success, like the agency. When I first started seeing it, it seemed to me that it could be a blow to the blow. But after a few episodes, I really felt like going to church and donating to every penny in the bank for miserable people shown by these poor, poor and shameful areas. And finally, where they show Earl and the bed in bed, it seems to me that this exhibition is trying to show life to bad things, like street beggars or people who fight for rent and have no idea what the real world of normal people in society is. I look like I always look nasty when I look at the person who lives in this show. It's like a Venetian beach in California, beautiful, but so many hobbies. Believe me, I am not a rich man, middle class and not a pure freak, a bit sloppy, but it seems to me that the exhibition just doesn't look like all the terrible people who were there on one leg. I just want them to show a little more class, not all dirty and dirty and trailers, and just below average life, it just seems to me pushing me down. For me, this exhibition is nothing more than an exhibition of what not to do in life, what not. It also shows that education is the most important thing you have, because apparently they don't have an ounce of smart. It's a teacher.
