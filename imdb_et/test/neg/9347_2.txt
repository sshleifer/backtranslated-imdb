After countless disappearances from TCM UK, I decided to review it through the sci-fi / adventure / camp generation, because I knew I would be thoroughly stupid - but it was also amazingly bad! Anyway, perhaps given the appropriately given characters, the script removes many sci-fi titles in recent years - SOYLENT GREEN (1973), ZARDOZ (1974), LOGAN'S RUN (1976; to the extent it was filmed with some self-made sets!), STAR WARS (1977), ALIEN (1979) and MAD MAX 2: ROAD WARRIOR (1981)! The type is simple, but not exactly interesting: it can be inferred from the title that water resources have changed on the planet where it is all happening - so the heroes of our dirty animals take the ice to steal blocks from the tyrannical Templar (!) Rulers. Also included is a beautiful princess (Mary Crosby, daughter of Bing) in search of her father, the risen king; By the way, another famous offspring is cast: Anjelica Huston (John's daughter) as one of the pirate band - fortunately, the actor's mistake is forgotten in accepting such a role after winning the Oscar (under his father's instructions, no less) for PRIZZI HONOR (1985). As STAR WARS had a "Supreme Commander" by Peter Cushing, the filmmakers decided to own their own - 78-year-old John Carradine (who saw some operational table during his short scene)! <br /> <br /> The most notable bits (for all wrong reasons) are: an alien who uses the toilet; castration machine; clumsy (including karate-style combat) of inevitable robot companions; horse slave / eunuch makeup that heroes wear at one point; repeated attacks of "space herpies" (whatever it is); climax, where the stars pass through the characters (Crosby gets pregnant, is born and sees her son grow up in 30 seconds, while the leading man Robert Urich himself is replaced by John Ford's stalwart) Hank Worden for this scene!) - by the way, the jumps taken here ( intend to celebrate the passing of time) is not only unsuccessful, but even irritating.
