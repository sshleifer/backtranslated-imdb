After restarting old Columbo films, I started thinking that they would get the same voice from me (6). But apparently I'm going to see the differences in the movies now. This happened in some previous episodes that showed quite genius leadership, and it shows it, but negatively. <br /> <br /> The movie was so boring that sometimes I found myself busy watching not on paper (never happened during the Columbo movie!), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to watch. Management seems too pretentious. "Oh-so mature" scenes with a neighbor girl are wrong places. And in general, the lines and plot are weaker than the average episode. Then the scene where they discussed whether the trumpet (who was wrongly blamed) is a pure horror, really stupid. <br /> <br /> "Prelude" should, however, be given some applause. In this episode, great attention is paid to how the murderer tries to protect his alibi and conceal evidence, and so on. But unfortunately, it doesn't focus on how Columbo discovers it. And the "proof" that eventually ends with Columbo's race is the least sparse. <br /> <br /> Rating: Located between 4 and 5
