What I was hoping for (or even expected) was a well-known "stop motion" design and extreme slow motion, extreme zooms, and all-embracing fish eyes. In short, art is a) finding interesting visual events and b) capturing them in such a way that the human eye is not capable of being reproduced so that the human eye can see it. The other Qatsi hits did. <br /> <br /> I was just wondering how to create it all with a title. <br /> <br /> By watching the movie, I got the feeling that the focus in this third part was the message and not the packaging. This is good, especially since the message is so valid. But I already knew this message and it seemed to me nothing else left. More than half of the film was sun-certified or stained or postered or converted through another filter. It seemed like a video camera effect, but you never use it. Many pictures would be more beautiful without filters like giraffe and zebra. One could say that "technology or any human malicious source is hidden from our beautiful nature," but why use this seventies to symbolize it? At the point that this cheap-looking effect had been in the line for more than 10 minutes, I was ready to leave. Hope that the rest could not BE that I would stay bad. But then there was a slow movement: slow motion is good because it gives time to analyze the moving image. But if there are no more than 24 or maybe 50 or 60 frames per second, then simply slowing down is not enough. Please register the slow motion faster, as was done by some laughing people in some cool and splashing water and drunken singers. I admit that archive images cannot be changed again, but I had already seen a lot of such material, it could have been done without it. There is a lot of work to be done to find the archive material and the impact has not been so easy to implement and organize. In addition, a lot of work was mixed with each other. This shows that the creator did not want to extend the film or save himself. But I didn't like mixed pieces a little ... It was sometimes a nice or even smart idea, but its implementation was inadequate. Computer-generated images didn't bother me so much, though outdated. "Bit" streams along the circuitry (in the first part of the movie) seemed newer and were nice. Mandelbrot is always fun, the fractal mountain was less. I was delighted to hear a cello that plays an important role in music. Slightly fewer vibrates at certain moments would have been compatible with Glass music, but it is a matter of taste. Like everything above, of course. I hope that another Qatsi story will soon be available, where computer images play a less important role and inspire someone to enter again. <br /> <br />
