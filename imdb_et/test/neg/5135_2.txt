Yes, I did it to the end. It was quite difficult. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought I was even a director. Working ... well, I don't even know what to say. I thought the girl who played Emilia tried her the best boring, sometimes crazy and sometimes predictable dialogue. <br /> <br /> I know it was a small budget, but hollow sound and lighting made it a 100-minute listening tape. <br /> <br /> I'm not even talking about the end ... <br /> <br /> The best film was music. <br /> <br /> It is said that I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Even for lesbians who don't have a lot of movies at all, it doesn't waste time. If you are looking for a sad lesbian themed movie, check out the children's lessons, lost and shy or high art. All of them leave you depressed and gloomy, but you don't have to suffer cinematic hell in this process.
