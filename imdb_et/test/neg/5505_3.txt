In general, I am a fan of Jess Franco's filmmaker, but for some of these films I really find it difficult to understand the motivation behind them or even the reason for their existence. For example, like this sick puppy. "Sadomania" has no cinematic value, it is badly made without any plot and contains some of the most unfavorable movie clips that have ever been recorded on film. This is another dirty film where rape, lesbian activity, and violent torture are everyday routines. Guards are bolder than prisoners, and the institution is protected by an impotent governor who only gets a sexual alarm when he meets a girl with sex! Girls are all beautiful and naked in the whole movie, but you can't really enjoy this sight when all the perversion takes place. Undoubtedly, the barbaric game of hunting (you might guess what it catches), the duel of death in custody and the prisoner, and the image of a poor girl whose needle is injected through her entire nipple is emphasized. Auch! Avoid this sick confusion and save yourself from two baths to wash off the laundry.
