**** Spitfire (1934) John Cromwell ~ Katharine Hepburn, Ralph Bellamy, Robert Young <br /> <br /> Mountain Katharine Hepburn (like Trigger Hicks) is a religious backside of a litter woman. "Starting 18 years", he starts to attract men's attention and responds to tossing stones. The arrival of the Dam building team brings dreams of romance to Hepburn. He quickly draws the attention of protester Robert Young (John Stafford), who hides his marital status. Hepburn is also interested in engineer Ralph Bellamy (George Fleetwood), but for various reasons; Mr. Bellamy wants to know more about Jesus Christ, whom Hepburn worships. <br /> <br /> After Hepburn uses the power of prayer to heal a child, people in the neighborhood have doubts that he is a witch. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't that serious, Spitfire could be more fun; it is an atypical and wildly inappropriate vehicle for your star who is absolutely convincing. Of the leaders, Mr. Bellamy is the best. However, Sarah Haden (like Etta Dawson), who appeared in George Cukor's performance with Louis Mason (like Bill Grayson), highlights the best. Whether Geer (like West Fry), "Grandpa Walton" in the 1970s, has a small role to play. Unexpected end helps.
