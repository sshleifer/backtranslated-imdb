Like most, I rented it after I heard universal praise. And despite the strange, inexplicable moments of COUNTLESS, I was very interested and entertained through a 100-minute movie. Then the two women went to the performance late in the evening. The rest of the movie (which is another 40 minutes) is even WEIRDER as the first part of AND is totally inconsistent and dug with what I already saw. Then the film ends sharply. Nothing was reasonable and I'm a pretty smart guy. None of these other user comments were reasonable even when they say "SPOILERS". I have no idea what they say. Someone Dreams? Not real? Then, what's the idea of ​​a 2-hour 30-minute movie, if it's not "real?" Or is it real? I'm forced to make a choice. So: <br /> <br /> [a] The film is a brilliant job at MENSA level and I'm just too stupid to understand it. <br /> <br /> [b] The film is strange for the strange and just doesn't make sense. Anyone who loves it tries to save the face and pretend they get it. <br /> <br /> I choose [b]. Turn you on, I'm going home ...
