Another Indian legend you never heard before is open. As the name suggests, this is a terrible wraith who likes to swallow the skeletons of those people who are still using them. As usual, ancient burial sites (can you say, "Poltergeist?") Disturbed the clich√© of greedy landscapers for construction work. <br /> <br /> CGI, if it had been better, could have had more impact on deceptive search, but they looked into the budget, and it shows - a comic effect. Probably, the unleashed creature was supposed to hold its first multiple killings, which could have added some mystery or a threatening doom atmosphere, but the hidden director decided to show us what it looks like in the first five minutes and it was not impressive. Deaths are just badly done, again with dirty CGIs. I think the ancient spirits will always kill using cheap special effects. As for the "victims", they look at them laughing every time they scream silver. It is always obvious who gets it: only a few lines will appear, strange noise, CGI points flying, the nature of the exit. Repeat (several times). <br /> <br /> However, there are some tracking scenes that contain a monster that actually watched this thing. Unfortunately, it seems that the director uses them as devices to retreat (so it is used too often) if he doesn't think about what his characters are doing. In general, it's pretty stupid, but I'm worse. This flick is cheap, but it's a strange look.
