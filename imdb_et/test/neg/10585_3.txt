When a losing teenager is bitten by an insect, she becomes a superhero Dragonfly ... <br /> <br /> Superhero movie is the newest movie that hits the screen. Unfortunately, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved with the airplane !, Top Secret and Naked Gun films), it still suffers from the mistake of the last spoofs ... mostly it's stupid than fun! The error lies mainly in gags. It's not just funny. Some jokes do work, for example, a nail gun, but other parts just fall. For example, X-men looting or the entire farting order. Blazing saddles it's not! One of the most important things about the best junk movies, like an airplane, is that while the dialogue is extremely funny, the mostly played game is completely straight. It even makes it more fun. Even when simple dialogue is in the foreground, there may be some funny things behind casting. Again funny. Another important thing is that they all have a font to hang the rings. As a result, the so-called plot of these films rarely exists. Another mistake in these films is that some scenes were funny in the original versions and in most cases even more funny than spam! The cast is trying to get into the required spirit, but it is difficult to work on this unpleasant dialogue and scenes. <br /> <br /> As the latest junk movies go, it's not as bad as Epic Movie, Date Movie, or a terrible encounter with Spartans, but given that some of the people here have made good, funny movies in the past, it's not good enough .
