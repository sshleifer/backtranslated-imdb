I have no idea who the others are, but this movie is just terrible. They must support Joe Pesc when he is a minor. Feed and exchange movies like studios with Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey and the like. Joe hasn't even carried a gun, plays a little character and gets SPOILER - (looted). So much for a movie around Pesc. The only semi-memorable scene was a bad comedy test when they were waiting for gas. When you watch this movie after reading it, I warned you. Please stop and don't lose your life for 87 minutes.
