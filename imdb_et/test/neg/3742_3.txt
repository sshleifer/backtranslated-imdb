This movie had a few funny parts, but mostly I wanted to go ahead and change DVDs and watch the "Malibu's" I had in my collection instead. At least I would like to know that there was something funny coming up and giving me something to wait. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this very low budget movie. And I do not understand the movie by its budget. It just lacked originality and was too predictable. I wouldn't want to rent or even watch this movie and I am usually a repeat offender. Participants were forgetting. The story was half-thoughtful, and it left me with an insatiable desire to laugh. Finally, I looked at Jamie Kennedy's white boy Gangstat that itched comedy.
