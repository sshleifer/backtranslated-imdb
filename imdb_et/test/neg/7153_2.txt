This is a tea film. At least this movie is yellow and I think it refers to the road (?). I can't say much about editorial. This is bad action, certainly their English. The camera looks like a boy does, there is a bomb with a counter and suddenly falls from the sky in the sky. Because it was such a cliché that we actually smiled all the time - and that was the most fun movie. This movie should appear in America, but I'm not sure if you should go because it may indicate that quality is produced by us. Explosions seem boring. Basically everything is up. Everything is just too much: yellow quality, sound, baby, etc. Find all parts of the cliché in other movies, put them together and have a delivery.
