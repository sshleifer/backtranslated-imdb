Killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1. Bad operation, bad characters, annoying clown, bad lines, you call it. To be honest, I am not all surprised that more people have not seen this movie. The only reason I looked at Killjoy 2 is because I wanted to think that filmmakers learned from their mistakes. They didn't. This movie is just as bad, if not worse than the first. This clown .... this damn clown .... I hate her! I hate him so much! And I don't hate him because he's a good villain ... I hate him because he's annoying beyond faith! I hope that filmmakers will understand after trying and failing to improve this film again. The last thing we need is Killjoy 3.
