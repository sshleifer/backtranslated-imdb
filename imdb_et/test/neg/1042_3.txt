For renting it wrong, I thought it was another movie with the same title, and I realized that I had rented it for some time. <br /> <br /> Fast chart line. A couple, composed of an artist and a photographer, rented a studio in Los Angeles, Joe Estevez, which still boasts that her brother Martin Sheen could actually be ACT! They find a bed in a forgotten room, but the bed is haunted by a nasty searcher of sera in the 1930s and his last victim. Their ghosts live in a couple, first increasing their sex life, but eventually they become more threatening. <br /> <br /> Which means cheap R-rated sex scenes, cheaper thrills and a waste of time.
