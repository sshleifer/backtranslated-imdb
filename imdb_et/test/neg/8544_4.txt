The expedition party, consisting of continually slipping and nasty wounds, goes into a dangerous African jungle, looking for treasures in diamonds as well as lost young lady named Diana (luscious brunette-viewer Katja Biernet, clinging only to hostile yarn that shows her a lot of hot form body) worshiped the goddess of a deadly primitive tribe called Mabutos. Director / scriptwriter Jess Franco is generally unable to inject any style or vitality into any blah and curving procedures, allowing him to move at a slow pace, often in an agonizing slow clip, and to play rare scenes with the lack of skill and panic. Lousy dubbing, excessive amount of grainy "National Geographic" animal animal stuff, groovy, jazzy lounge score, terrible acting, conversational, uneven narrative, cold soft core sexual scene and static photography also do nothing. Fortunately, the vision has a delicious free nudity to relieve tedium to a reasonable degree: in addition to the pleasing Biernert, both Aline Mess and the fierce high priest Noba and Mari Carmen Nieto as a companion, the deceptive Lita are also really simple. eyes. The beautiful jungle landscape is very nice. But in general, this picture hardly increases the color that can be observed and thus immediately unforgettable.
