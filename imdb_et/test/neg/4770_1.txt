My review is divided into the questions you should ask yourself: <br /> <br /> 1. Plants that eat people have been done repeatedly. Nintendo has used it all from Mario to Zelda to Metroid Prime. It has been used for a much low budget in the 50s, parallel to the lowest Godzilla franchise. And this brings it to a whole other cheese level with TALK. I don't know anyone who walked out, but I know a lot of people who created a hysterical laugh during this part of the movie. I was one of them. Does horror music deserve a little bit better than this heap of ridiculous fucking? <br /> <br /> 2. Marks could have been copied / pasted from Hostel or Wrong Turn or Wolf Creek or some other movie with bad luck collage children. However, it is called "characterizing" when the film takes time to tell clich√©s that hundreds of characters have been in the past? Do you ever want the film to have characters that were not just forgetting the pieces of meat on your feet? <br /> <br /> 3. It was not daunting. The guy cuts his skin. The Lord! (Not.) The guy gets his legs broken. The Lord! Fork! (Not.) I've shown such movies to my mother who hates everything to do with horror because it makes her sick, and she said, "I've seen PG movies worse about it! So why was it rated R? <br /> < 4. Here is the only plot that the film / book has: collage drink, have sex, naked, fine, bleeding and finally die - this is probably the most typical example of cheap, pointless fear film, but people call it "mature"? ..? <br /> <br /> 5. I don't think I've ever seen anything less original than what I looked at in a beautiful mind. <br /> <br /> Have you ever sat and wished horror genre, the most diverse genre in there, would do something ... well, varied? Something really original? <br /> <br /> I just want more horror movies to be real horrors, not just cheap collage partners to whom a movie has been put with a couple of dragged fake / 10
