PERHAPS SPOILER !! Well, I've seen it at Cologne Film Festival and I have to say it's ridiculous ... Sorry the author and the writer and ... whatever, but it's the worst thing to try to make a good movie I've ever seen ... if u ve got 5000 times the chance to get away from their enemies and don't do it .... its boring ... there are movies in the movie that give the impression that they have been forgotten, eg they are in front of a security chamber, they ask for help and someone sees it and calls police ... if there is a cut and .... NO! ... the killer gets off his head and 50 seconds later he acts like nothing happened ... not his zombie movie ... and finally the final ... BIG END we promised. hmmmm, says that take a little guy who always wanted to give the world one of the best end in history so badly that everything goes wrong .... im not going to vote for "1" because the actor is beautiful ...;)
