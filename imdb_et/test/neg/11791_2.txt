I think that in 1961, this film had to be "cool", but looking back (45 years), it is as silly as it is for entertainment! Particularly special effects are well done with the T.V series, which began in 1964, but on the big screen? I once had the same fish tank that was just as exciting! I have to agree at the end of the Octopus scene, where he combined himself with the sea view. Obviously not well staged ... or trained! All in all, it is pretty bad, which works with dirty special effects and I still recommend it - laughs for fun. This was probably one of Irwin Allen's greatest films and I think he thought a lot. Barabara Eden played T. Genis "Genie". Micheal Ansara was his wife. Now it's the coolest part of the movie! I always liked to see the real life of Spouse and Spouse teams in the same movie. Neat!
