This home-made horror film tells a guy who kills people using the motif of Edgar Allan Poe's stories. The local police have fallen for a couple of years, so the FBI has now taken over. They know exactly who this man is, but apparently no one has thought that his house is swinging because it is the place where he hangs, runs around in his vintage clothes and tortures casual locals. This way, the FBI chick is kidnapped, which includes his father, a former local police leader. First of all, all the funny college kids have decided to stay home and smoke a lot of weeds. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the FBI agent strikes and runs like a little girl, and no ugly college guy thinks he'll just stop and swing boyfriend. Dead End Road is mostly overpriced and sometimes underestimated because it has a low budget, produced with friends, with stupid points too much to cover.
