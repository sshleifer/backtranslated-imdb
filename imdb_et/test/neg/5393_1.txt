Like many, it was a bunch of manure on my eye when I was surfing the channel. This is a horror movie set in the woods, it has a stupid title, but hey "Michael Rooker" is in it, and he has been part of some big horror, I know he wouldn't lead me wrong ... Ugh! The most offensive part of it is that I actually watched it. I see that director Johnny Martin is a stuntman, well this stunt just sucks and how he got some actors to do this anhydrous bowel movement, is the biggest secret of all ... I understand Casper Van Dien, but embarrass, Rooker. Your good name in the horror is faded forever and your representative must be fired immediately. I'm sure this stool's nugget is available on DVD, but if you enjoy the .99-cent menu at McDonalds, you'll get more money there.
