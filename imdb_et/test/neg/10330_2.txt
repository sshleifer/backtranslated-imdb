Sandra Bullock is my favorite actor ..... But this movie was so terrible that I couldn't somehow worship the whole movie incredibly, that I actually look something so dirty. Ha ha. Sound editing is terrible, they're trying to create too hard ideas. Because they are just weird and stupid. Script is taken. Acting was terrible, the wire was not very good. Very unreal, even for a movie. But this is a 20 year old movie ..... so I'll give it a bonus point. And yes, the music was terrible. But we all have to start somewhere. And presenting these things is such a hassle ..... 10 lines of minimum ... trouble. Well now I know why I couldn't save this movie movie .... I had to buy it offline to see it ... a good thing it was just $ .58 cents ... though shipping was $ 2.59. Oh well .... I don't recommend anyone who owns a movie ...
