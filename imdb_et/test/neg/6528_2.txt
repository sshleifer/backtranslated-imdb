.... and now I am up to episode # 7. I really hoped it would be over now (not to mention the cancellation if all the things related to the show, including the actors, were in some ways accompanied by toxic waste, somewhere else in the middle of the ocean never to be seen), because this series is really terrible. <br /> <br /> To be listed under the comedy genre, this program is the most misleading! It's so hard to believe that Ben Elton could write something like that, maybe it would point to the contributions of many other writers that he had previously joined. In some episodes I never even laughed! <br /> <br /> Oh, and I can't believe Ardal O'Hanlon actually stopped his "hero" and started doing it because his decision-making skills were obviously damaging this day - maybe he just can't read and did not know how bad the "blessed" scripts are. Don't do me wrong, 'My hero' is not a masterpiece, but it's a million times better than this spam. <br /> <br /> And just to make me resent, I bet that it will get the DVD edition well if there are so many great TV series that won't release!
