Dorothy Provine does the opposite: she grows and grows. I didn't find any subtext. The "incredible shrinking man" and other films in this film were parables during the period of radiation, nuclear war and other horrors. The growth of Provine is due to a computer / robot that does not. <br /> <br /> And who manages this computer, but Lou Costello! I like some of her movies with Bud Abbott. But even though it's a pretty bad movie, he's doing good without him. Gale Green is a great foil. <br /> <br /> Green plays a great city strike. He's Provine's father. He plans to be a mayor. So when her beloved daughter begins to cope with the problems, she removes it. He won't lose him exactly, but will give up his long-time admirer Costello. <br /> <br /> It's quite unlikely: Costello is a local garbage collector. <br /> <br /> Special effects are minimal. And the military sub-block is extreme.
