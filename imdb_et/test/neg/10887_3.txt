SPOILER Wolfcreek meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre .... if you have seen them, don't waste your time with it. A typical movie, nothing new here, except SPOILER's visions that just add a fluffy plot. I recommend this movie if you have nothing to watch and it is either this movie or stare at the bare wall for 1.5 hours. The only semi-interesting part of SPOILER is when the chick starts to drink in an empty sheriff's office, I say it is interesting because at least she used this fluid stereotypically instead of starting to get hot to kill the bad guy, even though she went to the road. All in all, flat, bad and not worth the effort.
