"Catchfire" or "Backtrack", as it is sometimes called, is not very good. That means it's bad. Jodie Foster had already won the Oscar. Why does he agree? I do not know. <br /> <br /> The hostage / robbery ratio is not plausible, even if it is a normal psychological phenomenon in real life. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie is the scene where Hopper and Foster ride the boat under the Fremont Bridge (Seattle Bridge), which means that the traffic had to stop for the bridge to open. I had to wait until this bridge repeatedly drops, almost all on the bus. This is not a pleasant expectation. This film caused unnecessary waiting for the bridge and the world is a worse place for it.
