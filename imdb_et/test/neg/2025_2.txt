The efforts made by Scene Steve Tesich on the other side (following wildly resurrected BREAKING AWAY) are summaries of clich√©s, coincidence and dour melodrama. Maybe he lived some of it; if so, I am sorry to say that he could not dramatically dramatize it dramatically. <br /> <br /> In his honesty, his talented director, Arthur Penn, hasn't helped much. (BONNIE AND CLYDE, LITTLE BIG MAN), but cannot inject any energy or blood similitude into the Tesich narrative. <br /> <br /> Casting fights as well as possible, but is exhausted by weak motivation and dialogue. Cymbals should be reserved especially for Craig Wasson, whose frightening presentation requires the imminent disappearance of his leading man's career, as well as the disgracefully untrained Jodi Thelen, who is a highly unlikely "femme fatale". <br /> <br /> Everything seems to be longer than it is and all the points made are heavy and obvious. See Arthur Penn's earlier 60's, droll and elegant ALICE RESTAURANT; that's all that's not.
