This movie is pointless / silly comedy on the line of a plane or naked gun, but it doesn't even come close to the two because it lacks originality and a bit more intelligent jokes, but rather just the same throwing old simple jokes. <br /> <br /> You can find some references to other movies, from my head I discovered Dodgeball and Rocky so you can have fun with it, trying to find out which movies are <br /> <br /> Film also sometimes laughs, but nothing that can cause injury, so nothing is very funny. <br /> <br /> I liked the IPod character in some ways (even though some of the jokes made with him are common comedy 101). <br /> <br /> I think this movie (and like most crap / silly comedy) depends on mood, so if you think you are laughing at any joke to watch this movie. If you have a serious mood to forget about this (re) watch Airplane instead, it will definitely make you laugh
