I have to say that I was very happy about this movie because it was the production of "Happy Madison" by Adam Sandler, and I've usually attracted such a stupid humor. <br /> <br /> There were some funny moments at the beginning of the movie, but this movie didn't have everything that makes a good movie. I understand that many movies that are not realistic may still be funny, but this movie was unrealistic and not at all funny. Action was terrible, cinematography was very bad, the plot didn't make any sense. I can't overcome the fact that 3 stylish older ladies are even working for such bad writing. Overall, I was very impressive with this movie and I don't recommend wasting $ 5 on renting it.
