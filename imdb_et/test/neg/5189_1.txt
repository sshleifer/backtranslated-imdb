About 20 minutes of this flat apology for the movie, I realized that it reminded me of some kind of irritant at work who always talk about very flat jokes or doing very inaccurate things because they think it's funny and trying to attract everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie is featured in Trac's Lord Starring, he's not as bad as the actress, but his lines aren't funny, and SHE'S NOT FULL <br /> <br /> The actors are some of the most divine-terrible things I've ever seen, except Lords, a girl who plays Casey and maybe a colonel who looks strange. I can't imagine why a retired army colonel would like to start SNOWBOARDING ACADEMY. Do they even exist? <br /> <br /> The budget would have been better if these women were attracted to full-length porn. <br /> <br /> "Freddy Got Fingered" is currently 3.5-point, "Frostbite" has 2.7. I am confused that these two films will be within 1.0, FGF is a "godfather" compared to this garbage. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars
