This movie was terrible. John Wayne is sometimes a brutal actor. The female woman in the role of "Maura" did a good job and tried her best to make the scenes unbelievable, despite Wayne's pointless, one-dimensional, action. Seriously, did you see him when he had to talk in his dream? It's ridiculous. And his character became such a terrible person on the other side of the film, and then he did nothing to reconcile his behavior and is still forgiven by all, including the nobility, without even as much as "excuse". The story was absolutely incredible. We had to believe that two adult men, such great advancements in their respectable areas, sabotaged work and threatened the lives of innocent people just because they didn't like each other? You can pretty much randomly choose any scene and it probably leaves your head trembling when someone pays money to make that movie. It's too bad because the only other Wayne movie I've seen is a shootist and Rio Bravo, both of which were great movies. If you don't pay it, don't worry about it.
