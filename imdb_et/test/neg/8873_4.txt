The actors are so strange that it is almost impossible to distinguish them (Pauline Kael said: "Participants are names, but they are truly anonymous") and the special effects are very bad. They simulate the weight of the people and recycle the trick that lets Fred Astaire dance in the "Royal Wedding" ceiling (but none of these men are doing well enough to make it a convincing face). <br /> <br /> The low point of the movie is when one character, the grandmaster of an airplane, tries to convince another "industrial giant" to come with him in a six-rocket consortium, and he shows them a Woody Woodpecker comic that explains how Rocket works on 2nd class level! (And think Robert Heinlein worked in the scenario ...) <br /> <br /> The only advantage is that production design succeeds in communicating with the sensitivity of "amazing stories" and even this is much better in the later movie by George Pal When the worlds come together ", which has similar bad behavior but is much more fun. But Pal's best sci-fi movie must be "The Time Machine."
