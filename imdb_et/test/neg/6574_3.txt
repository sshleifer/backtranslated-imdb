I think that after Leonard Nimoy had successfully managed to "search for Spock" and "Voyage Home", William Shatner thought he was going straight. Although he is a competent actor, he shows here that he is not just a good director. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is hard evidence that supports Trekkies' arguments that William Shatner is an arrogant egomania. Because even though his character, Captain James Kirk, was always the most important role in "Star Trek", he seems to be the heart of the movie, two more important characters, Captain Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy, right there to support him, and other characters are just there to add comic relief. <br /> <br /> The plot is that some emotional Vulcan outcast called Sybok thinks about people and releases the pain inside the bottles from the traumatic event at the beginning of life that changed them forever. Thankful, they will join him in the effort to make the whole world in pain and therefore in peace. Sybok and his followers lead the building where a peace conference is held between the Human, Klingon and Romulan diplomats. It still attracts a company built there, as none of Starfleet's other ships are "experienced commanders" (frankly, if Starfleet had traveled, Klingons and Romans would have had to conquer them years ago). Sybok adds a company team, except for Spock (who is the secret of Sybok), McCoy and Kirk. Sybok tells the company to step into the "center of the universe" to meet the "God" who is apparently speaking at every race. However, it turns out that this is only a small unit when it requires the use of the company, and Kirk asks, "What does God need with a star ship." The unit is destroyed, but not before Sybok realizes that he has been lied for years, sacrifices his life and earns Spock's death after businesses destroy the unit and also inexplicably Sybok. <br /> <br /> OK science literature is not realistic, but at some point, rationality must be applied. Why do people just follow Sybok to free their pain? Why are all humanoids defined by one traumatic event? I have definitely brought a life free of trauma. Why doesn't Kirk try to rebell and betray his team after joining Sybok? What was the place where Sybok sacrificed himself when the torpedoes intend to kill the unit? <br /> <br /> So the plot is weak. Another problem is that Sybok, although played well by Lawrence Luckinbill, is poorly portrayed. Just because he is an emotional Vulcan, it doesn't mean he should act just like a human religious fanatic. Shatner (who was both a co-worker and a director) could at least have developed a dialogue that would fit into the emotional Vulcan. I think he feels that all emotional situations are like us. Gee, I think that means that Klingons should say "no" and "no" more often than "no" and "no". And cardasans should not extend their sentences because they like to talk (yes, I know it's sad that I know it). Please ... each ST competition uses a unique dialogue. Why is Sybok an exception? <br /> <br /> The only thing you can't complain about is. I've always known that "Star Trekil" is a big actor and this movie is no exception. Cudos also goes to Leonard Nimoy, because at his old age it was necessary to play the embarrassing Spock. <br /> <br /> Some other things I didn't like: <br /> <br /> Shatner and late DeForrest Kelly twice show what bad singers they are in this movie "Row, Row, Row your Boat" singing. I think Shatner wanted to silence his singers with his singing power. What he did was prove his point. <br /> <br /> Uhura makes a fan dance, but wearing nothing other than bark to pull some men into the trap. After all, the dreams of all our men are full of pictures of medieval ridiculous women dancing naked. <br /> <br /> Comedy is all well and good if it doesn't affect Star Trek too much, but if Scotty falls into the object of Enterprise and KO, it goes overboard. <br /> <br /> Kirk is the only team member who can reject Sybok's offer to free his inner pain and look at the deception of God's accuser. Even Spock can't drive them either? Maybe these scenes from Shatner were his character, so many suspects. <br /> <br /> The concept of a God-depicting entity was used more than once in the movie Star Star. Be creative, Shatner. <br /> <br /> Speaking of naturalness, I was not particularly attentive to hanging out "Star Trek: Next Generation" music. <br /> <br /> Everything, pretty bad "Trek" movie. If you're a Trekkie, look at it once because it's "Star Trek." Otherwise, see "Star Trek II: Khan's Wrath." That's better.
