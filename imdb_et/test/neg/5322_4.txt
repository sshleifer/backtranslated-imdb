Finally, there is a boring mystery-thriller that can theoretically sound very loud. The ridiculous script is full (MINOR SPOILER) of people who die and then come back to life when the plot requires it, and the director doesn't seem to be able to work with energy and tension. This "movie" title is "the only semi-memorable" in this annoying movie. (* 1/2)
