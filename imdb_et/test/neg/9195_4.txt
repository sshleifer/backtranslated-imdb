As much as I respect the firefighters for what they do. I was impressive and boring with this movie. Action was OK, but Joaquin Phoenix was the worst choice to say the least. <br /> <br /> What struggled me most about this movie was Celtic music that was on the beat and on and on the worst. film. Leadership and consistency were pretty bad too! <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** For example, after the fall of Phoenix's character, there are several stories and it is badly injured, he can barely talk to his captain on the radio. Then he can miraculously capture over a huge space covered with cracks and fire to punch a human-sized aperture with a double-thickness brick wall using only the foot length of the chipboard ???? And when all this is up, it gets very weak again and breaks down. <br /> <br /> Has anyone noticed that there is little or no smoke in the whole movie when you see Joaquin fires and people rescued. I think smoke should be quite thick in a flame-occupied building. <br /> <br /> I was also tired of looking for a search and rescue team who shouted, "I need accessories here!" <Br>> <br /> I thought I enjoyed this movie, but I found it a weak attempt to represent the real life of a firefighter. The goal was there, but honestly I think this film could have been so much better. I couldn't help but think that the producer tried to fill the deadline with this movie and had to speed it up to the theater. More time should have been spent on editing and making sure the film had a good stream. <br /> <br /> Special effects were impressive in some scenes but disappointing and almost ridiculous. Such as Jerry Bruckheimer's film. <br /> <br /> Call me critical, but I just don't see what's so great about this movie. At least it was not as bad as the "Ten Generations", which is by far the worst film I've seen in recent months. <br /> <br /> I really hope there's no 50 ladders out there!
