This is another adaptation of Charlotte Armstrong by Claude Chabrol: the first was "la rupture" (1970) (from the novel "Balloon Man") and it is a pity that no one cares about it. This is Chabrol's sleeping place and I invite all my fans to see it. <br /> <br /> The "Chocolate" horse was not as strong a detective story that started. I read it 20 years ago and forgot about it. good things first disappear at the end of the mistake. It is a confusing Chabrol film that contains elements of flowering (about 1969) and a lotta from eighties from tongue-pieces, "poulet au vinaigre", not one particularly memorable job. <br /> <br /> Some of the disappointment comes from the pain: it is a worryingly bad collection: Jacques Dutronc plays like a zombie, Isabelle Huppert shows up as a somewhat limited actor, finally quite vulgar. It worked "une affaire de femme", it is not here. oth is good and unremarkable.Actors from the past, say, Stephane Audran or Michel Bouquet (both "la rupture") were brilliant and contributed to Chabrol's unique atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The story itself is not indistinguishable: starting as some "serious" "la vie est un long fleuve tranquille" (after the clues in the very funny movie of Etienne Chatillie), the movie continues and continues after a ridiculous psychological drama. an anist who, after he learned about his hostess of evil, agrees to drive the car along a dangerous road. <br /> <br /> As he makes too many movies, Chabrol often releases turkeys. to look at one of his films, it should choose it from all his stuff. <br /> <br /> It seems that Chabroli's bourgeoise satire has finally given a leniency. The average detective story that Chabrol completely surpassed, he should say it to Audran, "They have so much money!" here Chabrol has lost its bite, its strength.
