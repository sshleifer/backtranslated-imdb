This film is full of sentimentality, unprofessional flying, which makes the pilot like me cringe and irrelevant material. Why, for example, introduce Rachel? He has nothing to do with the film unless he allows his "Follow Me" truck to escape and fall to Dorinda's fence. It must be one of the stupider sequences in many movies. The second is at the end when the aircraft (whether it was B-26 or A-26? - both signs) is left as props and would not be closed. It will serve the plot naturally, but reveal that it would be a terrible spoiler. As it is, the aircraft would have begun to check the taxi. The end (again, avoiding spoilers) involves a lot of too many talks - like the beginning of the 30s with all their latest calls. Here, Dreyfuss just strikes in and on. The end also includes other violations of the aircraft protocol radicals and a couple of unlikely / impossible attributes that I do not describe. What a boring and divergent effort!
