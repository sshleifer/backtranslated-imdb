"The Day of Completion" was published in 1981 in May, when the height of the craze of the film was stuck. Earlier this year, fans had gone through "My Bloody Valentine", "Just Before Dawn", "Friday 13th Part 2" and "The Burning", and theaters were still waiting for pictures like "Halloween II", "The Prowler" and " Happy Birthday to Me. I've seen all of these movies, and from the 1981 popular snipers, "Ending Day" is the worst. <br /> <br /> What is "Ending Day" is practicing poor and low budgeting with bad, bad writings, meaningless characters, meaningless scenes, unnecessary nudity, cheesy dialogue, and experimentation that didn't work so well. And who could forget about the classic 80's disco of music that plays in the entire movie (the music of the opening scene is rivaled only by music that plays in the chase scene). However, when renting such a movie, one should be aware that this information is in this movie. Why is "Ending Day" not considered classic like "Halloween", "Friday 13", "Nightmare on Elm Street", "My Bloody Valentine", "Burning" or "Prom Night"? Why are fans still looking for these movies, but are they ignoring it? <br /> <br /> When slaher films have to succeed, all other regions are running. Nothing is worse than slow movement and "Ending Day" is moving quite slowly. The most difficult part is that there are many ways to speed things up; there are many meaningless characters introduced and never allowed to be a suspect or a victim of murder. There is a weak teacher, a stressed principal, a cunning secretary, a clever schoolmaster, a helpless detective, an alcoholic father, a meaningless grandmother and a mother to an earlier victim who is still sad. All of these characters can kill kill or kill cause, but they are all wasted. The worst part is that the story focuses on them, and sometimes it marks the whole scene to refine their character. But what? <br /> <br /> What amazes me about "Ending Day" and its little fan is that people aren't surprised by death scenes. Fans go wild to death scenes, such as "The Burning", "Washing Machine" Death "My Bloody Valentine", Kabob's Death "Happy Birthday to Me", Reverse Death "Friday 13th Part 3" and Hot Tub Death "Halloween II" and Even a Car hood of death "Madman". But where there is respect for some truly unique (even cheesy) deaths on "The Day of Graduation". One victim goes to the boundary with a sword, while the other can throw the sword at them like an elbow. The best death involves the nails under the landing mats. Why aren't such deaths famous in the genre, such as the deaths of the most popular films? <br /> <br /> "Ending Day" is trying to be a big and unique movie, but there is only logic and lack that really destroys the whole experience. It's not the worst of its kind (try to check out "Don't go in the woods ... alone") and there's a bit of tension, besides, it's just what the fans are looking for (blood, gore, nudity, sex) and nostalgia), but "End of the Day "never remembers the biggest movies ever made. It's not a budget issue - almost all Slasher's have a low budget, but it's a matter of ideas, creativity and craftsmanship. It's all making any type of movie ... <br /> <br /> Recommended for heavy-duty fans. General horror fans may be a bit bored and people who are not at all interested in fear at all should be clear. This is not the worst film ever made, but it is by no means the best.
