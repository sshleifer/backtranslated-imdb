I love my martial arts style, it's fast, close and so fast, but it seems that his films are becoming more and more a crime-based lifestyle quality and less meaningful ... I thought he had to bring out a deeper message. At least some films had a hidden meaning or agenda with good character, but the rest were so far away. I was very disappointed. Martial arts also suffer. I hope to see more dedicated Segal in my future movies. This film also lacks the story, too many gaps, so the idea disappears. Too many things are secret without a solution.
