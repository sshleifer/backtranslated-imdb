Thats right I can't look at Comedy Central anymore just because I can't show it for repeating ads. I'm telling you the truth, it's a terrible show not because I've offended it, but because Carlos Mencia is one of the worst comedians I've ever seen. I'd rather look at Carrot Top's George Bush impression when I look at this hacking skill. And believe he calls himself the greatest. Even if he didn't steal jokes, he's still bad when he tells them he's both timed and unfair. I remember one joke that he said, "Why do white people go camping? What does that mean? Are all the white people rich? Another one I didn't think was when he was falling in price and he talked to some fat boy:" You should know how much you pay for the fridge, you are fat "and the fat man saw the saddest of his face. But what does it mean? This" fat person "is always looking for refrigerators? These are just two of what I saw in my ads, God knows What is his show. <br /> <br /> This show is similar to Epic Movie and Date Movie.
