It is clear that Andreas Bethmann wants to wear Jess Franco's crown, while Lina Romay, the old man of the cinema (at least cinematically). Romay plays in this modern, ambitious W.I.P. film. With some exceptions, many Franco films have been produced and directed intuitively, in a hurry. Shot is not always cut and sound mixes can be terrible. Looking at "Death Angel 2" (aka "Prison Island Massacre"), I asked myself whether Bethmann was deliberately trying to copy Franco's patent loss, or was he just naturally dirty as his mentor? Is this movie deliberately bad, which would win by itself, or is it just bad for neglect? After the attacker is forced to give a weapon, his rapist fills his mouth, then he fills his vagina with some drugs. Later, he is driven to a rocky prison for reasons not explained and subjected to workers and other prisoners. Because it is a WIP movie, there are lesbian scenes and a lot of violent behavior. Gore is also bloody and sadistic, with pleasures like tooth extraction and scalping (Olaf Ittenbach). The action is quite terrible and the struggle scenes are flat, but there is a love of sleaze in every frame and an understanding of what trash fans enjoy. Unfortunately, the flat script makes a certain movie. So, despite numerous atrocities, hardcore sex, and the appearance of Jess Franco's guest, the experience is empty. But isn't that what most of Jess Franco's movies are?
