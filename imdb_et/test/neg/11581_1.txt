I can now admit that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. And it doesn't speak a little because I find myself somewhat affine when I talk about the movie. But it's not bad. This movie is so terrible that it's not fun, it's just bad. <br /> <br /> This is almost impossible to review. There are no strong points and nothing positive to say. I'm just talking about a few points that are sucked. First of all, CGI must be one of the worst I've seen. I can't believe this film was made in 2005, CGI reminds me of something I would have seen in Babylon 5 when CGI was new and fresh. This is an incredible poor. Secondly, all the actors seem to belong to the worst day soap. And looking at their followings, I see that I'm right ... Third, they can't compete with the huge reptiles, they're not compatible with the other technology they invented in this movie: the endless AMMO pistol! Seriously, Michael Par√© fires 100-200 times without recharging in every other scene ... As it wouldn't be enough, there are also shapes-shifting planes! At first, they are the usual F-16 fighters, in the next scene they are something else and in the third scene they are again F-16! If you buy stock shots, don't mix it! Frankly, there is much more to say, but I think I will stop. You all understand what I'm saying. Frankly, I didn't think such a movie was done anymore. It's like something Ed Wood would do. Completely unknown quality, not caring how it looks ... It's almost amazing in all this terrible. If I could give it 0/10, then 1/10 is the lowest score. So that's it.
