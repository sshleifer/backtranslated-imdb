Earth is destroyed in the nuclear-holocaust. Well, parts of the Earth, because somewhere in Italy there is a pure purebred band - those with no radioactive contamination - occupied by a massive mansion surrounded by lush areas, waiting for the next chance to contaminate the contaminated blood. . The final performer is the story of one of their victims, Alan (William Mang, who looks not surprisingly much like Kurt Russell), and his efforts to set up legally punished hunters led by Edra (Marina Costa) and Erasmus (Harrison Muller Jr.) . Alan has been taught to kill a former NYPD police, Sami (Woody Strode), who usually hangs on his pupil's moral support and canned meat. Strode is the best for the film, although it doesn't look good at all and only appears about a third of the time. As far as the story is concerned, it is blending elements of better films and stories, including ten small Indians, the most dangerous game and escape from New York. Final Executioner moves at a fair pace and offers reasonable entertainment to fans of less discriminatory acts.
