Bone Snatcher is about a group of miners looking for a lost crew of miners in the Namib desert. When they were found, they were nothing but pure bones and they could not have died more than six hours. The story keeps you interested in exactly what caused it. The characters are good enough and the actors are pretty good. <br /> <br /> About an hour and ten minutes, if you find what is causing the bones to cleanse, you sigh "oh, it's really stupid." Until then, the movie was pretty good, and it's shameful that he took such a bad move. So I can't recommend this movie. I gave him 4/10.
