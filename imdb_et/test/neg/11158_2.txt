At the end of the day, one of the worst high budget movies I've ever seen is. Muddling Direction, a curved script loaded with flat dialogs and empty plot holes, fast fire MTV editing, and poor performance. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the End of Days is not traceable. The film kept me interesting because I found that the newest action of Ah-Nuld sliding ridiculously stupid to be so sluggish and silly when it comes to logic. Without a sense of logic, the film dies faster, so at the end of the Days a huge ticket office was earned in its second week after opening in the US. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to explain in detail why the movie's logic law is broken at the end of the day, but here's a lot of trouble with this movie: <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) <br /> <br /> After the devil leaves, the restaurant explodes without any trace of how he did it. There are no fingers, there is no energy gas or anything to ignite the fire. Arnold and his annoying touchdown Kevin Pollack, which has somehow magically emerged as the name "Christine York" after investigating the victim's body "Christ in New York", the database computer and viola, Christine York, is the only person with the exact name in all New York ! After stopping my belief. <br /> <br /> How did the characters of Arnold's character come in later in his movie? I laughed loudly when I felt that the better-turned-evil mother was the same actor who played the babysitter William Shakespeare's Romeo + Julia. His ironic transition from this film was completely fun when you could imagine. <br /> <br /> All unnecessarily big explosions and attacks. What did you get from Arnold Schwarzenegger's vehicle? <br /> <br /> The devil took the man's body, which consists of meat and blood, but it is not visible to poetry and explosions by treating it through the body. Of course, this is impossible. <br /> <br /> When the devil demonstrates the illusion of an apartment, Arnold's Christmas tree is supposed to be an illusion and * falls physically on it. The devil is able to break the brains of the human being and turn the victim almost 180 degrees, but he could not kill Arnold's character as he always intends. <br /> <br /> How the devil's parents died and why the evil New Yorkers are never explained after Arnold's goal and desire. <br /> <br /> In order of speed, Arnold and the Devil are aiming to get the train wreck from the subway without any damage at a short distance. This is beyond my understanding, because the force would be enough to throw Arnold and his desire violently and die of deadly wounds in seconds after the stroke. <br /> <br /> Arnold is suffering from a brutal beat that has been punished. Damn it and put it on the cross to hang against the wall, but the devil forgot to forget to take time and the chance to kill him for convenience. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, after the devil took over the man's body, is Arnold his bodyguard? Is it coincidence or just an example of bad editing? <br /> <br /> Arnold's reasoning that gives rise to worrying dialogues in particularly ridiculous scenes, such as "YOU ARE A NEED FOR COMPARISON WITH ME!" is the perfect bait for MST3K, just like the Eraser classic line "You are baggage!". <br /> <br /> The whole theory of 666/1999 is completely ridiculous. So the pseudo-religious attack on Christian theology, which includes the end of the world at midnight, and the fanatical killers who know the desires of the devil's object. <br /> <br /> (END SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> It is very ironic that at the end of the Days, divine profanites abusing the divine are being stupidly used by Christian theories. The level of violence in the film is excessive and terrible and is therefore not necessary for servicing the plot. Here, the factor is giving the director an excessive promise. He certainly does not know how to make a single action film from the Air Force One scriptwriter who only had to write a script for a large sum. <br /> <br /> So the end of the days is a precious film with no redemption value, except for campiness - the worst of Arnold from Hercules in New York. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
