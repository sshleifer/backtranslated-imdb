I should explain that as far as this trend of ripping an Asian horror film is going, this shutter is over HÃ¤mar and Dark Water, but it does not achieve the same atmospheric pressure that Ring creates. While movies, like life, do not exist in vacuum and are therefore comparable to other temporary / thriller / horror films. Frankly, I don't write long synopsis here, and I say that this movie is trying to build on the music that caused "astonishment" fear, not the atmosphere, and the "ghost" itself is not really remarkable. The plot is quite common and predictable, and there is nothing to write home. Although there are some intrusive scenes that are creatively frightening, most of the movie is pretty vanilla. If you liked The Grudge and it is a mess, you can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Rating: C-
