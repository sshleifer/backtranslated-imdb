Initiating a local sports team involves taking beginners to corn fields and guessing what? There's a scarecrow who murders people there. Only one beginner survives, but remains a coma because of diabetes. At the same time, the scarecrow begins to kill all involved people one by one. What are the Peacock Scams Secretly? Will they find it out before the scarecrow gets them all? This is a low budget movie and it shows. Sound is fine, but the picture is really bright. The plot / script really sucks and is quite pathetic and not logical. Operation is really bad and sometimes just ridiculous. Cant really say a lot of special effects cause is not so much, but few are in the range of bad OK (low budget that is). There's some nudity and it's probably the only thing the movie looks like (that is, if your horny teenager, if not, leave this movie together). One more waste of time and money, so you can't see it. Also for hack'n'slash fans.
