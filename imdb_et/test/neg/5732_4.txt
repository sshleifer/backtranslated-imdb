Sometimes it is deliberately combed, otherwise inadvertently foolish (as in the opening place where the woman is "informed", raped and her family killed, just for the sake of exposition), this film is ultimately not funny enough and not competent enough (as a simple adventure story) to be truly enjoyable. I'll leave you to decide what might be highlighting, but the low point is probably the foolish struggle with a metal dragon. Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for Sonja with her fresh face and a firm, slightly muscular body (and I think her dark red hair is great for her), but Schwarzenegger gives one of her little colorless performances like Calidor.
