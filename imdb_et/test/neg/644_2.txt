Some Plot Spoilers Front. <br /> <br /> The Nashville Network's "Rebirth of Men's First Network" is a complete disappointment, as is its adult cartoons. The new Ren and Stimpy were just terrible, at best mediocre "Gary Rat" and "Stripperella" pretty passionate. This comic is usually boring; when "Ren and Stimpy" suffered from surpluses, "Stripperella" lacked any decent shock, funny harmless gags, clever gags or gags. The concept is bad at the beginning: Pamela Anderson, a stripper-cum-superheroine, saves the "city" from silver tutors. This cartoon seems to respect the higher nervous superheroes, such as "Darkwing Duck" and "The Tick", but without their cartoons and good writing --- or even a good scenario. "Agent 0069" tries to silence the buggy and sexy, but he's not, and this comic can't do him one or the other, this series is falling. <br /> <br /> See your recorded episodes "The Tick", and see what a real superhero spoof art is.
