Lance Henriksen paid for it. I hope it was a lot. <br /> <br /> Former US National Champion Gymnast, Kristie Phillips begins with art teacher-secret agent Charlie Case (because it is very common for munchkin gymnasts to get government spies ...) <br /> <br /> There is a truly hysterical opening stage where Charlie's uneven bars routine the Eastern Bloc by a competitor. Here's one of the most ridiculous stuntstenes I've ever seen ... and they want you to take it seriously! Don't worry ... she sticks to her. <br /> <br /> Everything after that is just a messy, spy movie obstruction. See the training class stuff for the first fifteen minutes, then start the cover.
