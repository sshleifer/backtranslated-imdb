OH MY GOD! After such a promising start, Critters repeated 2 karmic rules about what was going on. It is clear that at the time of making this film, very few things were thought and what was with Scott Grimes in front of his ear. It should have been the last expedition to Critter's prey, but more was a waste. That's the big reason why I didn't see Critters 3 and why is every bad movie series in space an episode? (Critters, Friday 13th, Leprechaun Room, Hellraiser, etc.)
