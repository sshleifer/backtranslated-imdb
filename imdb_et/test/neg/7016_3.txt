Who the hell was the "bright" (?) Idea of ​​pouring Lucille Ball into this movie ??? It should have been Angela Lansbury's child. At least Lucy should have duplicated her singing. <br /> <br /> There is some compensation for the fact that Jerry Herman's result is well-preserved, except for "It's how I feel young", and we get the original Broadway cast members from Jane Connell and Bea Arthur. I think Robert Preston had to be given a song, so worse "loving you". In general, I think it was pouring the wrong redhead.
