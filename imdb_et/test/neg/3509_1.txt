I saw this "movie" partly because Netflix had a lot of good comments and I supported a valuable lesson. But not a lesson from ethnic diversity ... the lesson is "Don't trust reviews". <br /> <br /> Yes, racism sucks and people are complicated, but the people who really see this movie are those who are the least drawn and least affected when they see it. The only reason I think there are many good comments is that it is viewed by people who are not used to thinking or who have seen their first thought-provoking film and in some cases think Haggis invented its concept. In fact, he basically made this film, which should be called "Rassism for Dummies", as emotionally as possible, to give people who do not spend much time think about the impression that they have discovered some basic truth that has ever been covered with film. Zen and Motorcycle Art is not ... Post-school special for meaningless masses cut into bite-sized burnt ham-fisted pieces to make it easier to swallow without excessive self-consciousness. <br /> <br /> Just as they would all represent the worst possible extremes, just to make us happy that we are such good people because we don't know them with characters. Let's face people. NOBODY identifies these characters because they are all clippings and stereotypes (or predictably opposite stereotypes). It has worked well (even if the dialogue is cruel) and cleverly done, so much that you don't think to ask "where is the beef?" until you can say that the film is sliding. The scene of the burning car was well done, like a big part of the movie, but it didn't end in the end. <br /> <br /> The messages are very heavy and "behind the scenes" the producers are clearly looking at a different film because there is very little laugh in this film, even if it is for funny parts. I must emphasize that this is not entertainment, more than a lesson of high school diversity ... we call it racism "blood on the road". They could even show it in high schools if it wasn't a "lateral" shot by Jennifer Esposito. <br /> <br /> In this movie everyone has a jerk and everyone is learning a lesson (except for Michael Pena who gets the best role but the most predictable events). <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie, with poor writing and good actors. t handle everything but feel free to hit the story .... painted with a crayon. <br /> <br /> Crash is a frustrating little thing that creates emotion, but teaches you something when you already know that racism and prejudice are bad things.
