*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> One of the worst films I've ever seen since The Village. Insulting any intelligence at all. Poor written and amazingly lively. No one, especially in Los Angeles, is talking about how these characters are doing. Not fine at all. If the idea behind this movie is to say "we all have a bit of a big problem inside us", it does a terrible job of explaining the obvious. His point was not clearly the basis, but the character of each of these films was AMAZINGLY STUPID. The car lift scene changed me from walking and rescuing, and with the danger of not forgetting WHITE off the DUTY Rookie COP that pulls out the hanging black thug and ... I could go on. Awful, just terrible.
