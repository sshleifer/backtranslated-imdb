It is rare to see a movie that captures every aspect, but "Caligula" must definitely have this title. I'm not sure what's more terrible; violence, sexual perversion, actor or plot (or serious lack thereof). Two and a half hours in principle follow the notorious resurrection of the Roman emperor "Caligula" to reach the throne. and shows the cruelty and perversion that he allegedly committed to power. The actor is inanimate and boring - but it's just the tip of the iceberg. Obviously, knowing that this film was seriously affecting something legitimately interesting, the directors decided to throw as much nudity and orgy as possible. But don't be fooled, these scenes won't loosen or focus on the fear of this movie. The work of the camera is dirty, the dialogue is ridiculous, in fact you should congratulate Malcolm McDowell (playing Caligulat) for keeping straight faces through such distant lines. And then there is violence .... <br /> <br /> If you intend to foresee a movie, it's ready. In the film, some atrocities have been committed (not only through writing), but from nasty violent acts, which are few points or goals other than the setback of the viewer. This is just the purpose of the movie. It is to be wondered how the makers of this film thought that goodness, necrophilia and castration (just to name a few) would be pleasing to anyone. If it ends after two and a half hours, then this movie will not take any disturbing pictures and knowledge that you have ever seen the worst movie. <br /> <br /> You are alerted
