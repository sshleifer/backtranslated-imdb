The devil's men represent what turned out to be the covert obsession of the 70's obsession with the scenes of the last time just before Halloween, pulling the rule book, a fire and a hit on a plate glass window. br /> <br /> For a short story for a short cut, a couple of enterprising Greek filmmakers boast their chance to nail together a new movie franchise containing unlikely double female, wisdom-American researcher Milot and embarrassing but heartfelt priest Father Roche. The exiled nobleman is mixed in some satanic jiggery pokery, offering tourists sacrifices to the extremely amazing image of the minotaur, and only Milo and Roche can stop him! <br /> <br /> Or something like that. <br /> <br /> Reality, however, is terribly boring, frustrating and loaded with wasted opportunities. I doubt that young filmmakers blew most of the budget to get on board Donald Plesance, Peter Cushing and Brian Eno (for the soundtrack) and hoped that the audience of the English-speaking world would suffice. <br /> <br /> It's not. Fucking men look beautiful, confident, camera work and fantastic places. The Eno score, though basically just one chord drone that he probably pulled out in the afternoon, is suitably atmospheric and the film is loaded with a 70's crumpet, including the fact that Australia sorts Fawlty Towers and uber hottie Jane Lyle from the Death Island. But there are positive ones. The failure of dreams through this, looking at the corn cave, is his head and Pleasance tends to try his best, but never quite right. Milo's character is terribly weak and unlikely to get worse. <br /> <br /> Okay, so it's not that good. But the film simply refuses to go anywhere. There is a hint that the local villagers are in the possession, but that they are fair to them, but that they never do anything but look for the glass eyes. Maybe they were just tired? Just when you are sure that things will come with a head, Milo and Roche interrupt the Baron's satanic party with ridiculous ease, sending him to meet his maker. Minotaur's shape is silent and hey presto! Satan is defeated. <br /> <br /> Yes, right. <br /> <br /> The man's optimism that the devil's men could be the first in the series of films, grabs his father's last line in Roche just seconds before the ridiculously rushed end. <br /> <br /> "Who knows Milo? Maybe one day I can call you again to help Antichrist hit." <br /> <br /> I am sure you will put this call to Donald any day.
