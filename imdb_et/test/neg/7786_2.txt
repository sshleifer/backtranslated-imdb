If the BBC's murder thriller is this heterosexual dysfunction, you know who the killer is: Homosexual. <br /> <br /> Who murdered a sexy blonde teenager (who is also a pathological liar) from school? Let's see if it could be a mother who (with all the common sense) allows her teenage sons to visit behind her serial-killer father? Could this be the son of a mood impressed by his father's nonsense attitude towards women? Could it be a serial breaker himself who seems to be able to manipulate the events that are on the boards, la Hannibal Lecter? Could this be a mother's boy, a school teacher whose affair with a former student led his wife to suicide? Or could it be a boy-daughter who goes to school for all the mysteries, causing poor misery? No, this is not one of these likely suspects. It's ... Homosexual! <br /> <br /> The only secret to the viewer is guessing who is homosexual. Of course, this can be someone because the only qualities of Homosexual are shameful secrecy and the tendency to murder and otherwise make life difficult for ordinary people. Homosexual is the invisible root cause of diseases in society; only when this person is exposed and eliminated can the broken family come back and things get back to normal ... no matter what it is. <br /> <br /> As for the majority, both Jemma Redgrave and Robson Green are now officially the dates of their sales. The world can admire when it never sees on the screen, but as long as the BBC has the roles of a woman and a misguided man under attack, I think they will come back in such films.
