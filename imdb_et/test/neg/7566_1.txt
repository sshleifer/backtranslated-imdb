There have been a lot of movies, living in an American dream. And that's one of them. <br /> <br /> First, there is a lot of wrong on the technical side. The sound is bad, I had problems understanding here and the dialogues there and camera positions could have been better. <br /> <br /> They really tried a good movie, but for example, the part where they show how Jonathan's dream loses is very bad for girls, drugs and alcohol. The actor is also very poor in all the characters of the film. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time watching it from start to finish and couldn't wait until the movie ended. <Br /> <br /> If your expectations are low and you're a bad day, look at it. If you act for a deep story, it's not your movie. <br /> <br /> Normally, I wouldn't score 1 for this movie, but 4.5. But the reason I gave it 1 is the use of bad sound and camera, not to mention bad scenes with a cheesy effect.
