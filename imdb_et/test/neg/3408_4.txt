Solange is not a great Italian thriller. Get ready for the spoiler - the main suspect, Professor, didn't do it. But is it really a spoiler? No, because you know he couldn't be a murderer from the beginning; he and one student saw the first murder. So there is absolutely no tension about whether the professor is a killer. The final explanation of the mystery is long and tedious. The solution is interesting, but it goes somewhere. The rest of the movie (and it's not a short movie) isn't just interesting to keep your interest. Even in the "false accusation" tradition, the police fail to blame the professor seriously and the killer is never after him. Bored, boring, boring.
