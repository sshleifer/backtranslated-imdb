Could be the worst film? Even Ed Wood, in his terrible worse situation, couldn't do anything bad. Cheesy, stupid, long-haired, redundant ... and these are good points. I saw this in the trash in the early 80s when I started to get bored, and actually sat the whole thing without blowing out the brain, although it would probably have been a more pleasant experience. I actually remembered it because it was so bad. It makes me sad because some of the best leaders started with making TV movies (ie Spielberg) and it was a great way to get their starting material out to the public, but this cute killed the whole process.
