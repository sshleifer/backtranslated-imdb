I saw this movie at our crossroads film festival and waited for it because it was filmed with Mississippi and starred Karen with black. I was seriously disappointed by the cumbersome script that never flowed, and the obvious lack of effort from the participants and the director to understand something about the culture they were trying to portray. How did Lee and Griffin get such deep friends in five minutes? Which of these two was under the girl? It was unclear. And it seems that there are some laws about southern accents in Hollywood, and rarely do you hear anything far away from the southern sounds of the south, despite the terrible situation, "it must be as they sound, just soften the" r "approach to dialogue, many times, if the participants lose it completely. Particularly during the "emotional" scene of Aleksa, New York Street sounded loud, and nobody sounds at all. The Walt Goggins character was supposed to come from the town of Morgan, Louisiana, but it didn't sound like a mixture of new orleans and cajun accents. Another terrible point seemed to be the writer's desire to make all of us feel that every person must have a homosexual urge. Before I start here and I am accused of homophobia, I have enjoyed many movies that have gay love, especially "punks", "when love comes" and "b monkey". But it seemed to be a man's desire for all young men. Well, Tennessee williams has already dealt with this base and did a lot better job. So, I don't know if coin brothers get regional accents and culture in Minnesota and Mississippi, why can't anyone else? What a waste of my time.
