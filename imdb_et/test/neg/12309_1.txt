I've seen some bad things in my time. Half dead cow trying to get out of the high mud of the waist; two car collision head; a thousand plates that crush the kitchen on the floor; people who live like animals. <br /> <br /> But I've never seen anything as bad as a cat in my life. <br /> <br /> This film is worse than 911, worse than Hitler's worse than Impaler, worse than people putting kittens in the microwave. <br /> <br /> It's the most annoying movie ever, easy. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a joke, some complicated jokes and Mike Myers was perhaps a high cocaine sniffing drug-related betting junkie who lost a bet or something. <br /> <br />
