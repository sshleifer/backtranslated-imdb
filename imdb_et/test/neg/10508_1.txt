DO NOT avoid this movie. Just because it is so bad that it is completely fun. This is probably the worst film I've ever seen, but it was so bad that my friends and I could laugh at the moment of every movie. Sometimes we actually talked about whether this was a bad goal, but we're pretty sure it's not. The characters do not look like they have already developed, the landscape is constantly changing in the middle of this warehouse, and Vampire Assassin reaches about 6 climates to fight enemies before finally getting to the vampire. You also have the opportunity to enjoy one and the same face of the Vampire Assassin because it does not change its expression despite its obvious attempts. So if you want to watch a movie that makes you laugh hysterically, I suggest you do it as long as you openly go. Don't wait for a good movie, wait for the worst ... and that's even worse. I really want to buy this movie and put it on my comedy film selection. Next to Anchorman.
