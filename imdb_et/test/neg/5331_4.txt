This is one of the movies I watch every time it isn't because I like it, but because it's so bad I can't take it off (like Battlefield Earth or "3000 Miles to Graceland") . For the first time, I was looking forward to waiting and waiting and laughing and not being able to get up to about 3/4 of the way through the movie when they harass the harassing police in their underpants and handcuffed them in an uneven manner in the park. In addition, the jokes are not funny, the characters are not funny, their failures and missteps are not funny ... add it up, this is not a very funny movie! Not even at a high level! And what is the reggae soundtrack? This is a movie about two white browns and music is all reggae. It seems inappropriate, isn't it? If you like a good workout, this is for you. If you like good comedy, look elsewhere.
