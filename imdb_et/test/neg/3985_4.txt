I saw this movie shortly after watching Moonlight & Valentino Elizabeth Perkins, Gwyneth Platrow, Whoopi Goldberg and Kathleen Turner. There are many similarities between these two films. They both have big lies and good acting. They both have a very different sister who is very different, offensive stepmother, female friend / trustee, emotionally inaccessible father, dead mother and surprise player. Both films have characters that suffer from the changing concepts of life, and both films suffer from a "love that conquers all" sentimentality. They both add a small titration with Cameron Diaz in black underwear and partly back to Gwyneth Paltrow's nude. <br /> <br /> Both films seem to be viable as if the filmmakers were market research and said, "Ok, there's a market for women's stories, so I'm writing about two sisters with an offensive stepmother?" In other words, instead of the drama resulting from the truth of this relationship, this relationship is to the dramatic situation invented. It seems to be forced, the characters do not seem real, the relationships are incredible. Solving tension between characters is easier by simply excusing the years of despair, leaving everyone feeling warm and foggy ever after. It's not just real. Romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> The characters in In Her Shoes are slightly overstated as Moonlight & Valentino, especially the stepmother. Sydelle Feller is so bad that it is hard to believe that her father would stay with her or even marry her first. <br /> <br /> If you liked Moonlight & Valentino, you probably like his shoes well. Some performances in both, in fact, actors bring the depth of their parts, which goes beyond the settled sentimentality of the scripts.
