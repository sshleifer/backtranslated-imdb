I just don't understand why anyone ever shows one of the biggest subway areas in a country (Houston, Dallas, Austin / San Antonio, etc.), they mean a person like someone wearing a worshiper / cowboy hat, talking with a draw, zeroing in fashion and driving a truck on the way to the "salon" or his next hunting trip, rodeo, skeet shooting or land music concert. I've never even seen a small town police driver ... anywhere in Texas. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that it is not done for artistic reasons or comedy ... they are really serious and I think the average person is too stupid to find out. Bad scripts and equally bad show it off. This exhibition makes funny exhibitions in the past, as Knightrider looks like a high level of entertainment. At least the Knightrider had a talking car.
