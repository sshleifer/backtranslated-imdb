I had to read that I know why the hidden birds sing my English class and we watched the movie after it was finished. After watching the movie, I'm sorry. It took full effect of the book. The scenes didn't make any sense in their sequences, the actor was terrible and it seemed as if the writer had actually picked up the book, but chose a rock instead. I was outraged at how the movie ended. Almost half of the book was cut out and certain aspects were crucial to Maya's personal growth. If you've read ... Caged Birds, this movie will destroy the book's experience, so warn you not to see it.
