Barbershop 2: Back in Business was not as good as it was original but was the same funny. There were no small things in the film that were kept in the original, which made it much more enjoyable. Back in Business seemed to be just one worthless order to make money with a very thin plot. Cedric's dreadful excuses for setbacks destroyed the film and seemed like a bad way to try and get the audience more adaptive. In general, Barbershop 2: Back in Business was a sequel not needed, without the originals of charm, soul and spark.
