After that, it will get touted and let itself through the head. Given the regrettable situation of this film, it is rather a sequel to the film that apparently was not needed. <br /> <br /> What really irritates Robocop 2 is that the makers probably didn't understand why the original was so good first. Robocop (7) was a witty, living satire about bad movies. Robocop 2 is just a bad action movie. <br /> <br /> Thin dialogue, especially for the annoying, shooting final, it attracts little interest and has no original energy or spirit. Amazing ads, which are now a bit tasty ("Warning: Continued Use Causes Skin Cancer") seem to be the only offspring. And calling the new designer Nuke is not so subtle or funny as the original family board game, "Nuke? Em!" <br /> <br /> Stop-motion animation? the weakest element of the original? This humorous sequel is not taken into account in the credit sequence, which makes it even cheaper and faster. Ah, humorless? You can say. But what is a funny mayor, or how does Robo rethink the snapshots? Yes, they are attempts to lighten the light, as Robo has made a screwdriver ("we are only human") for the punchline, but none of them are laughing. Like the rest of the movie, they try to attract and pamper entertainment. <br /> <br /> The third and final series of the series (imaginatively named Robocop 3; 5) saw Peter Weller leaving, replacing Robert John Burke, who is in good demand. What is tuned to language and violence was the obvious assertion to the kiddie market; Too overvalued with social conscience and Robocop's new found hands and jetpack, the final film was never meant to be a masterpiece. However, the direction and flowing pace of Fred Dekker's fluid make it a pleasant throw. <br /> <br /> Robocop is the right movie. Robocop 3 is a sequel that you could look at if there was nothing better. What leaves the second film in the middle of the hanging, imperceptible edge of the image. A franchise that has nothing to say except for the pocket cards that rose up. Irvin Kershner is not Paul Verhoven, just like the comic artist Frank Miller and partner Walon Green are not writers that were Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner. Good as a limited term for tragic waste. 4/10.
