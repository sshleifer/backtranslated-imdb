Peter Hunt started a very talented film editor and was first in the lead when he directed James Bond's "Her Majesty's Secret Service" (which many Bond fans considered the best in the series). Other titles of his filmography include an epic scale adventure films such as "Gold" and "Shout At The Devil", both adapted to Wilbur Smith's novels. "Gulliver's Travels" is strange in his movie list; it seems strange that the director of Hunt's style and expertise decide to direct such a film. Jonathan Swift's classical satire's semi-lively action / semi-animated retelling, the film looked twenty years outdated even when it was made, and frankly, just not working. And there is no damn thing that Hunt (with his usual eye for quick action) or the star Richard Harris (who usually enlivens the most dirty roles) can do to save it. <br /> <br /> Lemuel Gulliver (Richard Harris) is a great medical student living in Bristol, the 17th century. His father (Norman Shelley) wants him to go to London to do his good fortune; but Gulliver prefers the idea of ​​getting less wages, but much more adventure than a ship's surgeon's ship, called "antelope". During the trip, "Anteloop" is blown out during the storm and hit the reef. The ship sinks and everything is gone, except Gulliver? who finds himself washed in the kingdom of Lilliput. When he comes around, Gulliver finds that the strange land where he is washed to the shore is incredibly small, not higher than his toe. He looks like a giant to them. They persuade Gulliver to help them in the war with other small people living on an adjacent island. But Gulliver doesn't like being manipulated for war and devastation, so he plans to escape ?. <br /> <br /> Harris will leave the whole movie here. His first pair of scenes involves other players, but when he is in Lilliput, he is wasting the rest of the movie, moving across the knee, and working with his animated colleagues. The idea of ​​blending animation and animation was not new at that time, but it was definitely not much. Some Disney movies like the Song of The South, so dear to my heart, and Pete's dragon had broken the idea, but it was still pretty much in its infancy. "Gulliver's Travels" is not a very animated film, but the scenes between Harris and his comics are at least competently made. Sometimes the film tries to be true to its satirical origin (there is one scene where we find out that Lilliput has been fighting for its neighbors because of eggs!?! - and it seems that wars can start over the most ridiculous things). But in her heart it is a lot of children's films and satirical records are hardly alive. Have you done better things during your career? "Gulliver's Travels" can be filled in an otherwise empty afternoon, but it is also a forgotten and underfilling experience.
