Earlier review is quite a target that Altman was not with this film. I haven't seen it since its initial release, but I've rarely spent two hours in a theater that is so unhappy and disappointed when I was with this movie. If any pretentious community theater tried to make a sci-fi version of Ingmar Bergman's film, it might come out as such. I can't give me anything, because Altman has done "1", but this is probably the lowest career that has had significant heights and lower. I would have walked out, but if the paid film critic, I couldn't. (Think of it the next time you enlist movie critics.)
