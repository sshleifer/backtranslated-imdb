How could someone who liked previous JP movies even stand within 1 hour? There are so many stupid things about this movie that are annoying! I remember when I went to see JP as a child, it was my favorite movie and franchise, actor, SFX Music, direction! all fantastic, JP2, in my opinion, was pretty much the same, except for some really foolish moments (like a gymnast girl who attacked the raptor!), but the whole is a watchable and sensible movie experience. <br /> <br /> The third doesn't make sense! It should be a sequel to Carry's JP2 and yet it magically includes new things for the franchise that would have been impossible to miss between the previous two films! for example: 1) "new" mega Spinosaurus - seriously what the hell! This thing follows them wherever they go, they can't get out of their presence and in the lost world (the same island) you see it once? do you hear that? does anyone even claim it? NO! It's ridiculous !. The character of the two previous films was and always is T-Rex, so what does d (urr) irector "Joe Johnston" do and does? Kill it! As soon as you see the huge T-Rex in all its awesome terrifying glory, it can kill you and you will never see it again - the new Dino city has an excuseâ€¦ where did it come !! ?? no explanation! and don't start me all over the satellite phone-in-the-dino stomach! 2) Just when you start over, how stupid Spinosaurus you see Raptors, after their new "Punk" discount, they seem pretty reliable! * Phew * do they make this movie trackable? ... ERROR! now they talk to each other! and apologize to them in this movie, not in the first and second, ... wait ... Evolution! - Yes, millions of years, just a few months after the end of the second movie, amazing! they should have grown up with contradictory thumbs and created tools !! OK, I don't want to say about the plot anymore because it rises towards my nose so I close it: Jurassic Park is a classic, JP3 is a sad imperial who gives a series of original fans their favorite franchise was very and really dead after watching Monstrosity ( no pun). Avoid this movie like a plague
