ZERO Stars **** - <br /> <br /> Endless Descent has absolutely no redeemable value, be it ridiculously bad behavior, ridiculously terrible special effect, incompetent direction, stupid script or gratingly annoying musical score. It is such a pathetic production that makes me think about how such a film could even focus on the studio's green lighting. deepen into something other than saying that it is about a number of people trapped under water and killing many fake creatures. <br /> <br /> Let me know in detail what is so terrible about this flick. First, action is simply terrible. Jack Scalia is ten times worse than Sylvester Stallone, which is hard enough to get as it is. Supportive performances are not really better. And what is the actor Luis Lorenzo, the man who plays the chef, Francisco. He has a high voice and accent that sounds like comedy, not sci-fi horror. <br /> <br /> Special effects are even worse. The creatures vary from strange eels to giant starfish and "most". Effects look like something you would see in a muppet movie, and I don't think I need to go on this issue. <br /> <br /> Director JP Simon has little cult status because of all the terrible movies. I'm sure some will end up in an endless way of Ed Wood, but I don't even think it's so good. All he does is dirty, especially the camera. The man can't control the movie, that's all there is. at first) starts to look masterfully. Either way, just stay with Abyss.
