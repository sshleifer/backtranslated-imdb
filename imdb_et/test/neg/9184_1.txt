"Wagons East" is widely known as John Candy's latest film when he died in the set. That's just so sad: not just that Candy was wearing a deadly heart attack, but that was such a tough film. Seriously, I don't know what they were thinking when they came with this joke, but the flick has no redeeming qualities. It would have been like taking all the unused scripts to stupid visitors and mixing them up and filming. No wonder John Candy didn't want to make a movie; Perhaps his contractual participation was what he did. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the idea is that Candy has made it much better throughout her career. Certainly he had already graduated from Michael Moore's "Canadian Bacon", where the United States declared war on Canada. Just stick it up and you can say that Candy has finished her career with respect. Richard Lewis - who was in the previous composition Candy Eugene Levy in absurd but fun "Once after the crime" - he did this lace piece often by guests who appeared in later years "Countdown with Keith Olbermann".
