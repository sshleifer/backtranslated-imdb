Before I break this movie, please note - I LOVE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. This story is one of the best romantic adventures. The film that looks at Jane Gray is very good and Broadway music is the hottest thing. So, I thought if I heard this movie came out, it would be nice because it was a BBC movie. <br /> <br /> My surprise was the weak, totally silly story that UTTERLY failed The great story was not. There was no deep love that made your heart slip when Percy left the room and Marguerite sighed when her husband left again. <br /> <br /> All of this was a confusing plot and a lot out - blue sex and violence. <br /> <br /> Me! What a terrible movie! <br /> <br />
