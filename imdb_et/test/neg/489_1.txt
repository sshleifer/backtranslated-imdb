Includes spoiler <br /> <br /> But if you did not fall as a child and then used it as a football, you agree with me that it is one of the worst and fun series. In the middle of a woman who, as a young girl, beat her father, who also killed her mother, she spends her time drawing, but waits for her to draw her superheroes and continue to fight crime, so she is "painful", so wise. is really OK, but it's just how it's done, Jesse writer and director has no idea how to write a script, just listen to a monologue that contains the hero's 8-year version and it seems to be written by a 30-year-old man while his a father who sports with a big mustache just walks around the house looking at anger, just showing how bad the character is, especially a bit where he gets angry in the first episode and starts repeating the phrase "no longer", keeping his wife's head from marble before killing his marble The next banghel effect and just her terrible action, like everything she can convey, is angry, but is great, even after she goes to her daughter's waist a bang that is all done with him that slows down and frustrates slowly. Episodes can easily include a good clean, clean scenario that lasts over 5 minutes, but the oh does not want it. Little Jesse eats postmodernism as if he had just eaten Donnie Dark and then died. Nonsense camera jerks, all at odd corners, overly repetitive lines, and even meaningless sequences will just interfere each and every time to fill the remaining episodes. All in all, the idea is not bad, but how it is done, there is also a good-looking fat guy who doesn't come out well and is great, I just want to hug my Lil on a fat cheek so they can look so soft. The character does not exist because the main owner simply says that the first philosophical sounding thing that comes upon his head, even though they are all contradictory. All in all, however, it is basically s ** t <br /> <br /> Indiana Jones 4 much better, also type "Jehovah" into your tube, the results may also cry to you for the beauty of the world. you hear lots of cheap sex jokes, mostly gays.
