Unusually cold and silly director from Sydney Pollack. The soap board rotates from a adorable couple who loses an airframe, leaving their spouses to one another and connecting themselves to their intimate level. Writing a romance novel is slow, although I thought Harrison Ford and Kristen Scott-Thomas were good. Slick's production is of interest, although the plot remains on the same surface and never builds an emotional momentum. As a result, the airport's peak is "so what?"
