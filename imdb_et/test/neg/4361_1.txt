... first? Killjoy 1. But here's an overview of Killjoy 2: <br /> <br /> (includes a spoiler so readers) <br /> <br /> Oh my. Oh, my, my. I'm starting to tell you that I have no hope of a good movie. Given that Killjoy (the first film) is undoubtedly the worst film, there are not many promises to come. <br /> <br /> As expected, it didn't. <br /> <br /> The deaths were even on the cameras as on the first film. There was absolutely no eye candy, and every single tip seemed so fake that I wouldn't be surprised if they had a kindergarten class. <br /> </p> Hm, for starters, the film wasn't even a length of features. It was only an hour and eight minutes long (68 min.), But then it ended soon. In fact, this is the only reason why this film was not as bad as the first, because the first was longer. <br /> <br /> Normally, I don't give any spoiler comments, but since I don't do it, I want someone you go through to torture this movie, I will destroy it. Not that there is much to ruin. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the end. KILLJOY IS BOTH KILLER EVER. All the usual sera are killed in frightening movies, with explosions, firearms, weapons, etc. Guess what kills Killjoy to kill? F *** ING-GLASS WATER. There is no lie. Finally, the girl took a cup of water and threw her into face. Then Killjoy began to yell and they tried to look like his face melted, putting the dried rubber on the forehead. Then he put it there and the people went to sleep. <br /> <br /> Now let's play the actor. VERY TERRIBNE. Even no man was the least credible. I don't even know what to say except they look like they just hired some hobbies living in the streets to act in this movie. $ 100 for making this movie. They had nothing. Most of this happened in the woods, which wouldn't cost them anything to film. The participants did not make any effort, so it is obvious that they were probably "free". They had no special effects or nice props, and they probably used ketchup for blood. Damn, who am I kidding? Apparently they didn't even spend $ 100. They probably spent $ 3.29 on a ketchup bottle and that was the case. F ** movie with a budget of $ 3.29. <br /> <br /> After Bob, they couldn't even rent the police. Finally, the girl wakes up after Killjoy's death and says, "Where is she?" and the main woman replies, "She's gone." Then suddenly a fatty nervous guy whose scars are on his face is coming up with a mobile phone, saying, "You have a phone call." The girl answers and says, "Oh, mom!" and smiling. Then the buggy guy walks to reveal that he is a cop. But he has khaki pants and a normal button on a green shirt. Hell, this was probably a sign that the director got when he was in a 3rd class security patrol. Then they all went to reddish brown and dropped off when the credit ran. They didn't even get a police officer, so they just got a red blazer. F ** relative. Killjoy didn't even have the first movie ice cream pack. <br /> <br /> Killjoy is undoubtedly the most spontaneously gay EVER. If there was a slasher who was wearing a hot pink spandex and wearing a rainbow flag, then STILL wouldn't be as gay as Killjoy. Killjoy is not so funny (and believe me, he tried to be). <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is the extremely flat threat posed by one offender. Someone commented on a boy that he wasn't going to the third grade, to which the boy replies, "I'll show you the third grade!" threatening way. It must be the absolute worst thing I've ever heard. "I'll show you the third grade!" <br /> <br /> This movie does not even work "as bad as it is good". It's dirty. If you didn't do anything bad and you feel so guilty that you want to punish yourself seriously, DON'T watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Remember; If a burning homosexual clown with a huge black afro tries to worship you (and try to kill you at the same time), throw him some water. The housing is closed. <br /> <br /> TERMINATION:
