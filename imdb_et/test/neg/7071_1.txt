This movie was such a confusion that I actually compensated my friends whom I saw. The only reason I went to see was that my friend was an apprentice editor. <br /> <br /> I am sure this movie was supposed to be campy, but the approach was so hard and handy. self-reflective, it turned out to be really smooth. Judd Nelson celebrates as an attractive garbage dumper. His life is hell and it is worsened by his nasty and overwhelming companion Bill Paxton (whom I feel embarrassed - this was a gifted actor's truly delicious role). A happy accident will change Nelson's career prospects and consequences. <br /> <br /> Humor action was bright, predictable, and often fundamental and tasteless. Wayne Newton is novice in reporting, but he adds something - comedy or otherwise. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a very weak and natural test of camp humor that goes over the lead. At least you could laugh out of plan 9 from space. It just makes you think who thought it was a good enough idea to fund and film. One of the worst bombs you ever know.
