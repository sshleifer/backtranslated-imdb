My parents can enjoy this example, but I can't find that humor. What is such a funny dental spouse who impregnates her hygienic assistant and the oldest daughter who has been impregnated by the captain of a high school football team? Absolutely nothing! Sometimes it is a shock that people today think of as humor. Blame it at exhibitions such as "The Dating Game" and "The Newlywed Game" that bring the issue of sex to the forefront of the mid-1960s. Of course, the series has its touching moments, it is not yet an excuse for the content that otherwise went into this series. It's not like "I Love Lucy" family oriented days about five decades earlier. <br /> <br /> The answer to why this series plays on a lifetime cable channel is because the brass of this channel thinks that women can be related to the character of Reba! I don't like the character of Kyra's daughter, Reba Hart. She is best described as a ditsy and busty teenager! Funny, I don't know if an actor who played Kyrat; Scarlett Pomers is in real life that he is not acting. Who plays Christopher Rich, a former dentist, is not much better. Barbara Jean, played by Melissa Peterman, is in her own! Van and Cheyenne characters are also very annoying. <br /> <br /> The other thing that bothers me is why the creator of the dingbat-of-a-series, Allison M. Gibson, decided to set a series where I live 25 miles away; Houston, Texas! Reba McEntire is not even from this country, she is in Oklahoma! Why did he decide for a season or longer to hear that random music sounds like a snorting pig? What I mean is where we hear the baritone sax, played with the drums that accompany it, but the melodies are basically moody!
