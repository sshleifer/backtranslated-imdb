For some unknown reason, 7 years ago, I watched this movie with my mother and sister. I don't think I'd laugh with them before. This movie was so bad. How the after-effects are produced is beyond me. It was a while since I last saw this "movie", but one impression that he has been with me over the years has been: "They have to find a script from the cheap trash bin on the back of the film studio." they sucked enough and made it worse.I'm pretty sure they spent the entire budget on camera work and the so-called "special effects", and then they left a 13 cents script AND pay for "participants".
