I'm not from America, I usually look at this exhibition on the AXN channel, I don't know why this seized channel is bleeding in such a prime time slot. Creating a Hollywood Money Bank Jerry Bruckheimer, this time he is spending big money on a small screen. In every episode, a number of people with two crew members travel from a large sum of money; where the camera teams are shooting. I do not know who the devil gave to this exhibition the foolish idea. There's nothing to look at, in all episodes we see people running like beggars, sometimes yelling, crying, twinkling, jerking the camera ... is it harmful to the eyes and ears. The most disgusting part of the competition is that the audience will finally know that every team member cannot enjoy their race / travel experience. Despite the fact that the manufacturers' ratings have been put together, they offered the idea of ​​geid's inclusion in one exhibition, sucking up American reality exhibitions. <br /> <br /> Nothing to watch, better switch to another channel. <Br>> <br /> Amazing race = nasty show.
