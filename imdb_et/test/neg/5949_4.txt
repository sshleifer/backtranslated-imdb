Anthony Perkins and Sophia Loren are in this ca. 1840 Western. This alone will not help a ridiculous story with countless historically incorrect elements. <br /> <br /> Byrl Ives is a convincing 70-year-old tyrannical patriarch, egomaniak, who swears to see his 100th birthday. His natural dances in the party given to his neighbors make everyone know (this man is SEVETY SIX?). Always baptizing the Bible verses, it requires respect, while the sons and friends are away from their righteous beads and emotional cruelty. <br /> <br /> At first, the love affair between Perkins and Loren is absurd, but it becomes an incredible end. There's a lot of drama, but not enough to make you feel good. This story was obviously written for the stage, even when it was filmed. Perkins whistles "My Bonnie" in the 1840s, although the song was not produced before 1882. <br /> <br /> Critics who knock Sophia Lorens' "English command" are quite small. I found her English flawless and completely audible. As a Neapolitan, Loren speaks of a clear dialect that was often duplicated by "true Italian". But his "accent" hardly affects how he speaks English. As a first-generation German American, I can understand the efforts of those who learn English as a second or even a third or fourth language. <br /> <br /> "Willingness" is a classical sense of drama (or even tragedy). For my enjoyment, there is a lack of logical story and general "payment" for the time invested. The fans of the stars do not want to miss it, while others tune at their own risk!
