Welles' memory and genius innocent offender, this pointless collection of self-conscious improvisation on a big subject should have locked in the store with a number of other unfinished Welles projects that nobody has ever seen. Now we know why! To add further insults to past injuries, duplication of American language by amateur American duplicators, and even a big man, only spoiled the mistakes of stories and construction. Just like every weekend, some good-hearted Spanish souls gave Orson some pesos, a 35mm camera and some negative films that were left out of some other production and told Welles that they would drive to Spain's countryside and hold something and everything. until the stock ends. It is true that if Orson himself designed the film himself instead of the infamous Jesus Franco, he could have thrown 85% of what he shot but we never know. As Welles never took the time to change his job here, and somewhere along the way he or his heirs promised someone, he is not entirely at fault for the offender. Those who want to prove that Welles was happier in his early days for younger men because he surrounded himself with John Houseman, Herman Mankewiecz, Greg Toland, Bernard Hermann and Robert Wise did not need to prove the inadequacy of adults as a mess of the film. In his sad age, Welles was able to do something when he needed a few bucks or pesos, including selling his artistic soul. This fuck definitely got it!
