This is one of the few films - perhaps the only one - that really haunts me for years. It was the first time I ever saw people tortured, so much so that blood flowed from their mouths to their teeth and shout, etc. It was brutal; the worst thing I've ever seen on film. <br /> <br /> Dr. Clement Molloch, played by Joseph Mayer, is still one of the worst characters I've seen on film, and I've been watching thousands. He was so sadistic that I would never look at this movie and wouldn't recommend it. He makes Hannibal Lecter like Rogers. If seeing tortured people is not your entertainment, stay away from this movie. <br /> <br /> I know there are many sick people, many of them are professional film critics, who probably enjoyed this, sick story. This is a "B" movie that is still a silly dialogue and some of Bronson's wood. This is not one of his best efforts. Even if it were, there would be so many terrible scenes that you wouldn't want to see. Trust me in this.
