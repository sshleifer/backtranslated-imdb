The only reason I watched it thanks to my letters, CASPAR Van Dien, Micheal Pare & Eric Roberts and Catherine Oxenburg * & Jeniffer Rubin, All capable actors and has produced good results. NOT THIS TIME, the story of a weak serum killer, you might think who the killer is in the first scene. In all aspects of this disaster is not very desirable, my rating is * 1/2 POOR
