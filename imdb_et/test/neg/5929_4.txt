It is said to be the last film in the left-hand series, which is the idea of ​​a fundamentalist preacher and writer Tim LaHaye of what we can expect in our future in the last days of planet Earth. If that is the case, we can expect the activist presidency in every sense if Barack Obama becomes president next year. <br /> <br /> The fantastic Fourth Revelation is all about one change, Arnold Pinnock, who would know most of all that as a supervisor in life with Derek is now Minister Clarence Gilyard. Brad Johnson, like an anti-Christ pilot day and a Christian at night, is there with his daughter Janaya Stephens and the ace-researching reporter Kirk Cameron. These are the only four people in the world who have separated the true nature of the UN Secretary-General, Nicolai Karpathy, and are once again throwing sand in his machine. <br /> <br /> This time they are an ally of the United States, played by Jr. Louis Gossett. He has one harsh time for hell, especially the RPG attack by the immigrant party for presidential elections, which killed Vice-President Charles Martin Smith. That's right, the rooms are vice president. Nobody really messes up here badly, because everyone, including those who do harm them, knows that the President and the Vice President are NOT traveling together. <br /> <br /> It all takes the whole movie to convince Gossetti exactly who Karpathy really is. The film is again best Gordon Currie like Karpathy. <br /> <br /> We can still see another left-hand movie, the door left open, although people assure me they've run out of source material since Tim LeHaye. I think as long as they make money and these players do not work in the mainstream industry. And there are some unresolved test questions that include Brad Johnson and Chelsea Noble, who are Mrs Kirk Cameron in real life. <br /> <br /> One of the fantastic four dies in this movie, so whether it is fantastic three or whether they're still fourth. Keep tuned.
