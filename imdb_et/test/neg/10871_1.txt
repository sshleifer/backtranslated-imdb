Larry Bishop manages, writes and manages this soft core porn, prints less of a biker movie that has nothing to do with it. In order to call it one of the worst films of 2008, it's a kind of garbage that I spent in theaters. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. For the most part, I felt sorry for the girls who thought they were making a feature film when they actually do porn. They walk in the set for four days, say some sexual traits to nasty old men - thirty years older than those - then take off their clothes and run naked for four days when they set. I can only assume that it was only Larry Bishops how to do it. You see that you are shooting directly at girls' asses. After being shot by the bishop, he was hit by a random chick and grabbed his most intimate parts as if shaking his hand. How this mess was even funded is beyond me. Why Tarantino is out of his name, but he has slowly disappeared since 1994, so I can't say I was surprised. After 15 minutes you get that terrible feeling that only terrible (and I mean horrible) movies. When you see it in theaters, your feeling increases. After 15 minutes I wanted to cry, being so stupid and wasted, not just my time, but my hard earned ten dollars. There is no redeeming quality or one moment in the film that creates a reaction or shows any tendency for these people to have an idea of ​​what they are doing. If you don't see naked women so often, I think this movie would be for you. If you are eleven, you probably like it. You can't even laugh at it because every idiot that makes a laugh for the fuck they did. Operation is terrible, writing is terrible, production is terrible and management is terrible. It's not even worth your time to rent it to see a car accident. Stay away, stay very far. You should not even read these comments. I shouldn't even write it.
