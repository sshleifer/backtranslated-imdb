At the beginning of "Loggerheads", three pairs of seemingly unrelated characters are introduced. To make things even more confusing, we are informed (through the titles on the screen) that the action takes place in three separate time periods (between 1999 and 2001). It takes a lot of time, but finally we can see how these three pairs are related: Mark Austin, his 20th young man, gay and HIV Positive is alienated from his conservative parents Elizabeth and Rev. Robert Austin. <br /> <br /> Mark is now a drifter and arrives at the seaside town of Kure Beach, North Carolina, where he meets gay motel owner George (sensitively Michael Kelly) and finally gets together. Meanwhile, Mark's maternity head, Grace (played by Bonnie Hunt), has reached her life, where she has decided to find the son she had adopted for 17 years for adoption. his strange son, if he did not answer him (despite the concerns of his wife's homophobic minister). Director / Writer Tim Kirkman tries too hard to create dramatic tension scenes with little to find. Take Mark and George? They are both sensitive souls with little to agree. The tension when Grace opposes the director of the Adoption Agency, who is forbidden by law to give her any information about her missing son, is also a mild contradiction to her mother who denies that she disagreed with her when she becomes pregnant as a teenager. No spark rides between Elizabeth and Robert, because a good admirer has certainly insisted from the beginning that she has no intention of reconciling her son. <br /> <br /> "Loggerheads" is similar to "Brokeback Mountain" because the gay couple are good guys and straight men (such as Kure Beach policeman and admirer) are bad. The biggest drawback of the film is that there is no communication between Mark and one of his mothers (and thus a dramatic conflict). Mark is already dead before birth or adoption have the opportunity to agree with him. <br /> <br /> Kirkman's theme is both tolerance and the appeal of family members to express their heartfelt feelings before it's too late! Kirkman's feelings are mostly good, but they do not make a good drama. Loggerheads is moving forward at a pace without new revelations (or arrests) concerning issues such as AIDS, adoption and homophobia. Ultimately, "burrs" fail because of the lack of originality.
