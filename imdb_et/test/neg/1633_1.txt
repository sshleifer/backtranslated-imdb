Why was this movie made? Are sadists producers so easily deceived that they give them money to create methods of torture, like the so-called "film"? I love the bad movie as much as the next masoch, but "Cave Dwellers" pushes it. It is seriously physically painful to look. The plot is something of a guy called Ator, who is a private snowball for all this time I had to fight against the warriors and save the princess to win a bad man who needs to find a better hairdresser. Maybe I got this plot wrong because it has been for a while because I looked at this stool, but really, do you care so much? Oh yes, the private snowball also has a silent Asian sidekick (who isn't?). Who's not funny. <br /> <br /> In any case, the private snowball struggles with invisible people, visiting some caves, all in the name of a good king, so personality-free that he makes Al Gore as Jim Carrey. Then builds a private snowball hanger (yes, I'm serious) and gets a girl. Yippie-kee-yay. It's cheap, inadvertently stupid and pointlessly boring. Why am I not surprised that the director made porn? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: OPEN. Ator steals some of your life and you have no funny "so bad-good" speeches to take with you. Bad Ator! BAD! Aak! * gags *
