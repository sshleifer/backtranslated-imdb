I was an extra opportunity at this airport in the first 15 minutes of the picture; I was one of the fleeing (mostly Mexican) refugees who fled to Tucson on Ryan Fields. At one point we were standing in our turbans when we waited for another shoot, one of my companions turned to me and asked me what the gear was. I told him that it would be a remake of lost horizons, but a musical one. There was a long pause, then he replied, "Man, this movie sucks." I thought he was pretty sensitive. I had a good time and a bit of money, but even some interesting personal memories that have been added to this movie can't sit all over. <br /> <br /> If you ever saw "The Swarm", you get a lot of this idea. You see many famous and talented people who are wasted on the idea that it is just BAD. The idea seemed to be that if you throw enough money to the movie and rent enough big names, it is not a good story and good writing is needed. Just turn the big crank and the product comes out. It's not just worth it.
