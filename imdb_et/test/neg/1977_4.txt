I give this movie 4 the reason I am a hard fan of the video game series. The graphics and animation are great and it's nice to see Sephiroth in Gang's CG form still cool. Acting What I've Ever Seen (I've been watching an epic movie) <br /> <br /> The film seems to be so much so oriented that it even makes fans blurred for cloud and cloud. the clouds mentioned so much that it didn't want to see him in this movie. <br /> <br /> The villains have a prize for the worst villains (I was more scared to the wicked west) <br /> <br /> All the other characters in this movie are just put on a movie to hit the fans and don't take it further then if <br /> <br /> wtf is with chilli chally ??? <br /> <br /> Summary: Waiting for 9 years for this movie and that's what I get with a big pointless and boring cut scene where I ask a square cenix driver to shoot a responsible man who burns a copy of every movie and everything one who has participated in it and the creation of new ashes (it would be nice to make a movie in live-game and original game)
