I was very excited when A&E first came to Paranormal State. I thought it might bring some more interesting ghostly evidence. Production value seemed good and I love this logo. Then, after a few episodes, I began to realize that this exhibition might not look for evidence but had a strong religious agenda. you can't even make a teapot with the camera but everything is scared. Then there is a ritual of Christ that saves everyone. <br /> <br /> There is also very little focus on other team members. The whole exhibition focuses on Ryan, and he feels one of those people who tell you about brochures about churches on the street. Really, it should be in a Christian network. I was very disappointed.
