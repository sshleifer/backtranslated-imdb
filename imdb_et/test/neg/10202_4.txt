... looking for a "so bad for a good" movie from cheeses, I have repeatedly laughed at different films in the first fifteen minutes, but have to be disappointed and boring at the end. Not this time! My eyes tears, my stomach and cheeks laughing so much during the film. Of course, Hulk Hogan is a subparant and the plot is completely predictable, but everyone dives into this movie knowing it all - everyone who wants to rent it is when it is Hogan, who breaks the can, which is a bunch of "YEAH BROTHER" and "WHATCHUGONNADO" drives his notorious goat's mouth. And while Hulkster's screen is a little bigger on the Hulkster screen, the final cheese seekers are definitely not disappointed when the stapler's pearl is. Laugh laugh.
