This movie comes from the same name Long Running ITV sitcom. Sitcom lasted about ten years and brought Rigsby, Phillip, Alan, Mrs Jones & Vienna to our screen. <br /> <br /> Then in 1980, the film version hit cinemas. Now that he did, Richard Beckins was dead and replaced only when I laughed at actor Chris Strauli. <br /> <br /> I felt that it gave the film a different feeling. has preferred it not done because Richard was the key sign. It's like a porridge movie without Godber or Mackay! -Vu! The TV series had previously seen many parts. Now that you saw the movie for the first time, not the series, you would have a different sense of it, then a serial fan! <br /> <br /> Said Leonard is definitely up and making a movie like on television The movie has recently lived on a new life on DVD and is usually above ground on a quiet weekend. It is a good film crack, but Rigsby fans may feel like you see it like before. <br /> <br /> While saying it's worth buying / watching <br /> <br /> 7.8 / 10
