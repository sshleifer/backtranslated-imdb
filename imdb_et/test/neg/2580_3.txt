Patriot (something to do with Mel Gibson's film with the same name) came out of Steven Seagal, still saving his film "environment". What is good. But it does not do good. <br /> <br /> When the plot of the movie (?) finally hit, I saw a twist (?), what came to the mile. Seagal's anti-war, mother-care-nature attitude is not very subtle. In the film, which originally debuted in the cinema, it is very similar to a television film, despite Dean Semler's photographer working with a wolf and dancing photographer, with great shots. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal does this as a 1 fight scene in the whole movie and it's totally boring. Because it's a movie, it's obvious, because it's dramatic because it's an environmental message. Avoid as Ebola baptized with plague.
