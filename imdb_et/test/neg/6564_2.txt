Nobody expects Star Trek movies to be high, but fans are waiting for a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes. Unfortunately, this film was a confusing, unlikely plot that just left me - it is by far the worst of nine (so far) movies. Even the ability to watch famous films that work in another movie cannot record this movie - including Goofy scenes in Yosemite Kirk, Spock and McCoy. <br /> <br /> I would say that this movie is not worth renting and hardly worth watching, but with a real fan who has to see all the movies, renting this movie is the only way to see it - even cable channels avoid this movie.
