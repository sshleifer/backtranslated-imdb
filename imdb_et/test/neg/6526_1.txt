OK, first there might be a SPOILER because I don't know what gives too much information. Everything is said in my subject line, but people definitely want to know why it is so stupid. <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie "Yuppies" follows, as they go to a sports game in Chicago but stop it. wrong exit and ghetto. Scary, huh? Well, first, Emilio is driving the world's most overheated RV / Winnebago, which is printed with satellite dishes and such. So these men are going to a sports game (forget what is probably Bulls or White Sox, because they are oh-so-scary ghetto), but they can't even do it down the highway onboard, which would shame ESPN. Yet they are smart enough to serve the experiences that would cost things, but do such sports events even know what to leave for the game they love. <br /> <br /> I gave up the movie in half an hour after that, but the reasons were abundant. They stop GETET, but their main threat to their existence is DENIS LEARY. WHITE GUY. I'm not racist, but I AM. Something REEMBLING in reality - and this movie tried to be a city nightmare - Denis Leary didn't try to kill Emilio Estevez, he'd drive to get f *** out of Dodge! /> <br /> This is easily one of the eternally created movies, although I don't know most of the rest of the world cinema. If MST3K was still there, they would definitely have dedicated to this episode.
