This is the worst movie I've ever seen, so bad is amazing. I'm glad I never saw this black sidekick in another movie: OK, it wasn't his fault that someone gave him these features, but he could have rejected this role and tried to learn instead. How did anyone get the money to put this movie together? Is there a corporation in Hollywood dealing with waste from college students without a brain? "Oh yes, they love it: it's not an incredible plot, some kungfu movements, Chuck Norris, a black sidekick with bad bright lines, cute little Israel (or is it Arabic, or does anyone care?) Boy with a handkerchief and fuck." Brilliant and many thanks to all the people concerned for enriching people.
