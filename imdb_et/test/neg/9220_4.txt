POSSIBLE MINIMUM SPOILER <br /> <br /> This is not a terribly objective review, but I found this movie terribly depressing. Like many Russell T. Davies, it asks more questions than the answer. His best work (Bob & Rose, Doctor Who) expects hope for contradictions and persistence even after the obvious defeat. These uplifting issues seemed strangely missing. I think the fact that I still look at this day, I mean the quality of the program, but the resolution was too small for my taste. <br /> <br /> However, I disagree with the reviews I've read that eventually it seems to be "nailed." I think that each conclusion follows logically from its premise, and the conclusion was a solid personal belief that solved the main theme of the exhibition. Although I have never questioned the progress of events, I felt there would be a lot that could have been expanded. I have also read that it was originally designed as a four-part series instead of two, and it is possible that the cut has done no harm to the finished work. However, these shortcomings appear throughout the sequence and on topics that are sometimes tough or outlined. <br /> <br /> Davies is great for his credit to write this great, and you have to admire its enormous fear and scope. project. The assumption he is dealing with here is stuff for films or novels? it is a bold and ambitious thing to deal with on television. The strong points are Christopher Eccleston, who is in the lead. For me he was and remains the best reason to look. Impression of the Messiah's humanity was brilliant, I thought of provocative and tempting and real credit for both Davies's letter and Eccleston's behavior. I also thought that shaping the reaction of the modern world to the second result is true. So, two stars just because I personally want my entertainment to be fun. I would rather raise or at least disturb my confusion. Do I have a real world around me? when filtered through CNN or newspapers - if I decide to be terribly depressed. There are certainly fewer subjective reasons for evaluating this work, but I fear that my decision on this issue is blurred with my emotional response.
