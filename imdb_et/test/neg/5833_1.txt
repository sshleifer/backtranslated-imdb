It was one of the worst movies I ever watched. The story was about a female prisoner sent to space to save humanity, but what was actually was that the detainee was actually placed on a spacecraft with the nymphomaniac lesbian commander. The whole story was related to sex over and over again. All this material was not needed - just to create a soft porn movie. Of course we had to watch the movie heroin for about 2 minutes. I don't know what all of this was about the real plot of the movie unless I assume that the men are watching it. I only gave it to ten because there was no other rating. Don't waste your money or time - it has nothing to do with science fiction, but rather to watch the young boys' movie to see R&D. The creature was only shown in the movie for over half and it looked like an alien with Signorney Weaver. Bad excuse for entertainment.
