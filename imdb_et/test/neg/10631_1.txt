After having suffered this movie last night, I turned off the DVD player so it deserves a medal to provide the durability to see it in the end. Throughout the film, I felt like I was looking at the fillers in the delivery layers, which you get in a big budget porn movie. The action was rigid and tense, the work of the camera was terrible, and the places and kits were so poor that they seemed to have borrowed them from a local high school "Amateur Drama Society". <br /> <br /> The only sustainable arm of this movie was that it had Amy Adams and Harriet Sansom Harris their credit except that it was a pure drift.
