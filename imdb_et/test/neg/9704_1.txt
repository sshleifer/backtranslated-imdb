Maybe if you have never read any English literature or just looked at the Hollywood version of the book you might find in this terrible movie. It has Shoreditch's director and scripting skills. Adapting to the BBC 1995 is so enjoyable and close to the book as well as between Elisabeth and Darcy. Bingley also acts as a fool and it is imcomrepnnable that he is a Darcy friend. I can't imagine Judi Dench accepting this role, maybe he thought it was a surreal comedy version. There are no big pieces, Wickham's important episode is glossed over. <br /> <br /> Mr Collins, however, is very good and towers over other cast members. </p> The thing is that we didn't see it. Wait for the DVD and use it to keep it open.
