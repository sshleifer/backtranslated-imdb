Of course, I looked at this version of MST3K, but it's not really too bad, at least compared to others that deserve my kinematic hatred. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on a problematic girl who has misrepresented the "reform" school called Girls City. Races, redemptions, and outrages on the way (involuntary). The story and acting are small, as is the action. But the whole thing is, in fact, a bit entertaining when you're completely bored. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, it's just a simple 50-th anniversary, but far from the worst movie ever made. movie (Ave Maria's order was good for me). <br /> <br /> If you have the ability to view the MST3K version, you will not be disappointed. I myself, not so much, but I can think of worse methods of torture ("Spiker" someone?).
