Larry Clark is not known for his writers or director's talents, but he has undoubtedly made important films. Children, Bully and, to a lesser extent, Ken Park all achieve their goal: shock, rebellion, and even nasty. These films are uncompromising in their content and use contradictory nature to reveal very serious problems in modern youth. Children discovered us in A.I.D.S. and youth inequality. Bully touched on similar issues. Ken Park dealt somewhat with sexual abuse and suburbanism. All these films undoubtedly had some frightening effect and left a bad taste in their mouths. <br /> <br /> Wassup Rockers is about the skateboarders of poor Spaniards who drive arbitrarily to Beverly Hills for skating. That's it. <br /> <br /> Wassup Rockers is nothing. <br /> <br /> It has no substance. It has essentially no narrative. And like kids, it's the first time the actors who have been taken out of the movies. But unlike children, none of them have any talent. It's better to act in porn. This film undoubtedly contains the most terrible performances I've ever seen in a feature film. Larry Clark may honor these young men to expose the film making process, but these children are completely worthy, people. Maybe I add that these youngsters probably also produce a soundtrack that contains some of the most terrible intuitive ticks you will ever hear, my advice is a few pairs of migraine pillars before you pop into the theater or you'll regret it afterwards. <br /> <br /> But then this is not the way they would have a lot of scripts. Each line that is proclaimed is artificial, miserably delivered and irritating, all measurable. The story itself is ridiculous. It starts with a reasonable amount of reason, but it soon slips into the only absurdity unexpectedly. Of course, this capricious sex cape starts with a couple of rich white girls, followed by a series of so-called Lichoonish butterflies that are destroyed without cause and eventually lead to a ridiculous climax. The shots last much longer than they need. Be prepared to see how people on roller skates fall for about fifteen minutes straight, longer, longer, if the characters don't do anything, or skateboarding on the streets. But then again, if the script is low on 32 pages, they need as much useless filler as possible. Perhaps Wassup Rockers would have worked better as a short film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I could go on like this. This is the worst film Larry Clark has done. For those who want to see Clark's movie, just for her shocking pederal, look elsewhere. It is by far the herbal film he has made, and it is the worst. It's terrible. Like, Uwe Boll is terrible. Certainly the festival is the worst. <br /> <br /> 1/10
