Alright, how someone really thinks this movie is fantastic, is so far away from me ... I can't even understand how someone can find this movie remotely funny. , and it gets old after a while. This movie is so predictable, punchlines are not funny, they are forced, you look better in the red light area and the story sucks that it's so predictable, you know exactly what will happen. Even the characters don't respond as they should, try to go to the hot chick that is your boss at work, and tell him you hit 2 crazy chicks with whom you live, his answer would not be (smile) "let's get back to work". I never laughed at this movie and I wish I had never seen it and spent $ 3 to rent it, because it is not even worth it. Adam Sandler compiled this film, I lost all respect. All his films are the same, his comedy style became old when Waterboy came out when I knew that Adam Sandler had rented it before ... there was no way I could have wasted that time. This movie is so bad as it can get from all aspects ... ace Ventura wasn't a smart comedy movie, he didn't have a killer plot ... but it was original and it was fun. I don't knock the movie because he has "low level" humor, I knock it because it sucks, it's part of the Hollywood crap. If this movie was presented to a production company and is not backed by "ADAM SANDLER", it will be thrown faster than the used condom. If you want a good movie about pot culture, check out Cheech and Chong or Whitecastle. If you rent this movie, this is a general comedy directed at 14-17-year-olds with tough rock music in every possible section, acting, which makes your eyes slip and stomach and comedy equivalent to watching a rocky friend eating a mcdonald hour and half. Don't do this ... for God's love ... this movie sucks, treats it for what it is, and look at the last Hollywood glory ..... New York Hercules had been the worst movie I've ever seen I am, but it is actually so bad that it is good. Instead, it was a very expensive movie that sucked as much, if not more.
