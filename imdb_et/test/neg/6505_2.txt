Okay, so it was back in 1993. Robert Iscove loosely and John Miglis wrote loudly that it should be based on a real story. It is hard to believe that anyone could be so stupid and blind. Certainly, it was obvious from the beginning that this dame was ultimately received. <br /> <br /> Tim Matheson, looking somewhat older than I remember him, played with an empty headed man looking for romance for his somewhat dull and empty life. Well, it came to him like Tracy Pollan, a somewhat free girl who had kinky sex, her men who could conquer her boys. <br /> <br /> Come on, the phone for sex even in the 90s was an old hat. Can't believe someone falls on this old line. But Mr Matheson seemed to buy it. And it cost him a lot. The most difficult scene was when she finally fled out of her apartment, putting all her junk in the corridor (in front of her apartment) and then she had no stupidity to change the locks. That was when I had enough of this faithful movie. It made me want the dame to have tried me so I would be happy to tell her she needed a hike. <br /> <br /> I'll give this chestnut one out of 100. it was. I think you can't blame the actors. But they were terrible. Did they try to play it directly on the face?
