The story of this movie seems to be worth watching. The actor was flat and the story was not deep. There was too much support for camera work, with some higher points. I have to agree with other negative comments. I just want to read them before buying a DVD. The film can be worth free and you have boring hands before tears. There could have been much more parcel development why there are homeless people in Moscow (ie post-Soviet capitalism, drug use (ie increased heroin trafficking from Afghanistan), more development because the Russian Orthodox revival after the Soviet Union, archaeologists themselves or even more so against nihilism.
