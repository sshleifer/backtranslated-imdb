Now I like Bollywood movies and I am very pleased that they have been successful in the UK recently. However, Suneel Darshan's recent efforts are a deeply flawed film from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a modern Bollywood to take Amadeus was quite exciting, ie up to two supposed "musicians" appear on the scene as if they had ever touched a manuscript in their lives. Upen Patel is a very good looking person and the film plays his narcissistic feelings, but he is never believable as a modern Mozart. Acting everything he can do is stand and pout. His expressions, hair and clothes all look the same, including the scene where he is supposedly "dying", when in fact he seems to have nothing but a sniff. While playing the role of Salier, Bobby Deol is doing his best to enliven a small wooden script, but unfortunately it is just a little angry when he should be jealous of jealousy. <br /> <br /> Bollywood films are widely known for their stunning and color schemes, but Shaklaka looks like drab's BBC drama reproduction. In fact, the closest thing Shakalaka comes to is Hollyo, because it obviously hides a bad script for beautiful people, well, beautiful. "He has not yet achieved mediocrity" - the same can be said about completely forgotten songs. <br /> <br /> In short, Darshan is not booming, banging, walling, or odd. Instead, it is rather confined to the head, in the low hope, to pay your attention to the soft tap on the shoulder. And that's not good enough at all.
