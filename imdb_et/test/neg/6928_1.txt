I absolutely despise this movie. I wanted to love it - I really wanted it. But the man, oh man, they were with Sara. And the father who lived was quite exciting. This is the Shirley temple movie directly. <br /> <br /> I recommend the book. It's amazing. In the book, Sara is honorable and decent, and she does the right thing. He has no bitter bone in his body. <br /> <br /> The film is fascinating and embarrassing. He does little to get back to Miss Minchini. In the book, Sara has such things. He's standing in front of Miss Minchin. He speaks the truth and is not kept. But he does not do the foolish, stupid things Sara does in the film. <br /> <br /> It's really annoying to me that so many here say they love this book and they love the movie. I can't wonder ... did we read the same book? The whole point of the book was personal responsibility, honest and honest behavior, ONLY saying the truth and facing peace and integrity. <br /> <br /> Sara is a happy ending in the book - not a ridiculous survival for her father, but joining her partner who was looking for her. In the book, he takes on this new father figure who loves and cares for him and Becky. And Miss Minchin is not a chimney sweeper - this part of the movie was really silly. <br /> <br /> To see all this poor movie, it will bother me. We praise a movie that respects the tiny, tedious behavior with a few tips from the hat to kindness? In Sara's book there was kind poetry and holiness. I don't even know him in the movie ... he's not in it. <br /> <br /> Good thing, Mrs Burnett is not alive to see this terrible thing. The title of his book is strange and unwanted.
