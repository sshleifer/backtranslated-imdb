I have tried to like this example, I really do, but I can't find any reason why anyone would like it. Stories are weak, the actor is weak and incredible. Every cast member seems to have been accidentally taken out of the street. And it seems to me that the whole exhibition is just a chance of moving Jamie Lynn Spears vehicle. Every episode shows Zoey as a girl whom every girl wants to be her best friend and that every boy wants to be. He is always perfect and there is no one in real life. How can people be related to the character of Barbie's doll? Jamie Lynn acts fairly, but she is not a strong enough actor with a leading role in the series. All fans of the show are just young girls who don't know better. Sorry, if you think my comments are too harsh, but if you find a moment of deep and intuitive moments in this series, which is not fast-paced, please accept my opinions and find something to watch.
