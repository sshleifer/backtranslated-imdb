I thought it would be terrible. But when I saw it. I was wrong. Emily Bergl did a great job like Jason London. Sue Snell was underused and underestimated. Important were ok, Dylan Bruno and Rachel Blanchard are definitely stand-out. As for what teenagers do and how people claim it, it's all wrong. What ever. My friends and I use the term "swank" a lot and I've traveled a car and someone drove when I changed. There's pretty much there. I've never been to a game after a game in a house that is big because it is an exhibition of my light. Deaths are good. The best includes a pair of goggles, a spear and a gun. All in this order. I have to say there are people who hate it, but I'm not one of them.
