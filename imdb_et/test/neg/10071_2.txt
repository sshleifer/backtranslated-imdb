Did people expect "Jurassic Park 3" to be full of surprises? No moment is worth it. Many elements can easily frighten movies ... and it's not a dinosaur! Tea Leon ... I think he's a great actor, but I'm sorry to say that this time he reached the bottom line. I don't know if it happened to a vocal chord when recording a movie ... Laura Dern ... she's ok, but why not see more in the movie, maybe you switch smart dialogues with Sam Neil. Alessandro Nivola - "Have you ever heard something called facial expressions? Fellings, emotions ...". Sam Neil, it's not a big deal. Sound track ... changed this item or gets tired of it. My applause goes to William H. Macy, a talented actor I have never played badly ... unfortunately he can't save a movie, nor can well-created computers.
