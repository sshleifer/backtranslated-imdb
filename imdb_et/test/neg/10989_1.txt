I always say, "Nothing good about a movie". And I have to say it's not a good movie! Drab, boring and annoying. It was like one of those bad dreams that never seems to end, no matter how hard you wake up. I don't like the concept of a movie without words (ie entering a fantasy or a dream world), but there has to be something to capture my imagination, not just the blank images that are the film. There seems to be no character formation and it jumped from the scene so quickly that it was hard to find any story. (Was there even a story?) You might say that the actors tried their best, but unfortunately the sabotage of all the actors' work sabotaged. It seems to be cinematic masturbation ... but it exists for the director and for someone else. Great waste of time.
