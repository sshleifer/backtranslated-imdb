After seeing PURELY BELTER, I came to this site to review it, but not only that I had to review the continuation of Mark Hermann, the screenwriter / director. As soon as his name appeared on the opening credit, I knew I had seen him before his name and, after verification, discovered that he wrote and directed LITTLE VOICE as one of the least rated 90's British film <br /> <br /> PURELY BELTER different fish. This is a grim stereotypical view of Geordie's life and very unpleasant. Everyone is either a beater, a single mother, a shopkeeper, a drunk, or a junkie. Because there are many scenes in the school, the PE teacher is a sadistic bully and it is the closest the film ever gets to reality. Oh, and everything is very unpleasant to the mouth, which adds a gloomy improbable atmosphere. I didn't like much of PURELY BELTER when I looked, and now that I know who Mark Herman likes it even less. With LITTLE VOICE, Herman proved that you can do a fun-loving comedy with northern souls, but I had to ask where his undeniable talent in this film went?
