The original "Psychot" (1960) is widely regarded as the best work of Alfred Hitchcock and I think it is definitely the best film ever. The decision to film a remake of a frame is thus somewhat puzzling. <br /> <br /> The original was cast in the correct way, so there was a lot to live in the process of reprocessing. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates was not the lead. He's too nice a guy who's not very convincing as Bates. I can imagine such actors as Mark Wahlberg or John Turturro, who perform a much better job in this role. Anne Heche as Marion Crane does a reliable job, but we are comparing it to Janet Leigh mentally. Julianne Moore is a much better actor than she shows here and Viggio Mortenson just walks through her role. The best of this new story is William H. Macy as a private detective. <br /> <br /> Although director Gus Van Sant is doing an acceptable job, he can't build the tension that Hitchcock did. And why did he change the basement scene of the house? In the original, the atmosphere is dark and damp and closed, while in this version it takes place in a brightly lit laboratory. And I think the original black and white photography prefers a definite advantage over the color version. <br /> <br /> Perhaps another mistake is that most of the movers have seen the original and know what will happen and when. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that it's not broken, don't fix it. <br /> <br />
