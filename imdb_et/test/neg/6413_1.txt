This is never a stupid movie ever made. The story is ridiculous. His wife and child think he is crazy. Then they don't. Then it turns out that he is and I think they knew it all the time. There is a dog named Ned, which causes some problems, and I think it's all his fault ... so Jim Carey. God knows only why Virginia Madsen took this role ... it's a career downturn. I think its target group is 11 and 12 years old. And it adds up to 23. Or maybe it's for 8 and 10-year-olds who also adds 23. Or maybe it is really stupid for 23-year-olds. Or maybe 32-year-olds because it's the opposite. Or maybe the 46-year-old enjoys it because half of it is 23. I think looking around for about 23 of the Internet would be more interesting than this movie if you didn't want to see comedy.
