Let's start by recognizing that there are undoubtedly three horror films: good, bad and completely embarrassing rolls that make the whole genre comprehensive. Dark Harvest promises a great deal with its Artisan DVD cover, but be sure that this exhibition stops. After harshly unfolding editing, we will soon discover that the film consists of a very poorly written script that is highly qualified (even for a novice film), catastrophic lighting and even worse special effects. Seriously, can anyone afford more than a villain, or did they think it was good enough for Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, so it's good enough for us? Well, it didn't work at all to create a scary cable. In any case, this is one of the films that will make you watch your watch, sigh and glow your gullibility. The timing of each scene is painful, and the whole production has a sense of secondary education (it's thought I've seen better middle productions, just up to special effects). I'm trying to think a bit about ending this review with a positive note, so let me assume that all copies of this train wreck are donated as beverage bottles, Frisbees, windshields ........ "Go see yourself", but it would be cruel . <br /> <br /> Check out the rest of the production company reviews and find the same for each of your movies. They claim to respect the agreement between the film and the audience (i.e. please fans), but all they have done is ridiculous and burst the money on our head (which I am sure they saw very little). <br /> <br /> Sorry, people, high ratings and favorable reviews are probably posted by those who are directly or indirectly involved. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10 because it is the lowest possible rating. Giving it makes me angry.
