I didn't know what to expect when I started watching this movie, and finally I pulled out my hair. It was one of the most pathetic films of the year ... actually in the last ten years. David Dhawan should just give up the director. I've still met one original script that David Dhawan has been working on. It was a bit of a little hanging. I have nothing to restart, but it is just so bad that it even makes you hate (which was pretty decent). I don't understand what actors like Salman and Govinda saw in this script. I read somewhere that it was supposed to be Govinda's return home. If this is true, only God can save his career. Salman just overpopulated. Govinda, who I think is a very caliber actor, was completely wasted. Katrina Kaifil and LAra Dutta had nothing to do with the design-wearing form and smiling without the rhyme or reason. Please leave it off!
