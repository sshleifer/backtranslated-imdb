I would have given this movie 1, but I laughed so much so many times that I had to give her a little credit to turn off the possibility that the movie would be funny. The movie so bad that you think chimps wrote it. You want chimps to have written it. The dialogue is so conserved that only this and the cockroaches will live on future nuclear weapons. The film is exaggerated by its horror of sharing scenes from the original Carrie (really good film) into this scene. Like a taxi driver, intersplicing scenes into a baby genius. Don't try it alone, because you don't enjoy this experience. You'll need to set someone aside to confirm the viewing flaw. The worst actor of the Millennium goes to poor poor Amy Irving, a stone-faced, monotonous, catastrophic wooden school advisor. So far the worst film (see also _Arlington Road_). - FRINK-3
