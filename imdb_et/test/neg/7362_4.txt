Look, I really wanted to enjoy this movie. There were moments when my heart beat faster when the hair on my neck began to rise when my muscles began to work hard. my purse. <br /> <br /> Jaume BalaguerÃ³ and Miguel Tejada-Flores probably don't know the right recipe for making a horror film and therefore used the old amateur method to throw everything out of the pot. br /> <br /> This movie is really The Shining, Poltergeist, Amityville and Hellraiser all rolled. Amazing, I know, but true. All the flavors exist, each one can taste, they just don't blend well. I'm not going under the wrong list of this movie; In short, good cinematography, mediocre action, inferior dialogue. <br /> <br /> - A realistic problem that steals from so many film surfaces and combines them into a single movie, except for confusion, there are several plots that can run at one time during CAN. And what does Jaume do when he gets into this problem? Just like in the fresh English 101, you finish your story with an ellipse, "A little car disappeared into the darkness and ..... END" Oooh, horrible. Not quite. And very anticlimactic. The end left me confused and disappointed; almost empty. <br /> <br /> Get your $ 10, go for renting Shining, Poltergeist and Hellraiser .. scare your pants, enjoy the great time and forget that darkness has ever existed. <br /> <br /> -BJamin
