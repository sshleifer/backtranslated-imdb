sure that this movie has had some funny moments for people with a question, and I know the film shouldn't be completely believable because the film made such a terrifying example, for example, a girl who never goes out like a guy from a million years ago the performances there were so bad. Also, the bad testimonial that they could have worked on at least in the scripts focused more on comedy, which was also a bit of a comedy and was really boring about the first jokes, it was like 10 mins laughter, then old how old it ends on the bottom line, if u want it to be unstable that is confused with fool and romance go ahead and watch this movie.
