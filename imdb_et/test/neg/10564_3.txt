OK, when I say "wow", I mean, "Jesus, please help me." I have an old copy of VHS that was printed before Troma got a copy of the title. The film talks about an alien crash that lands on the ground to terrorize us with a weapon that breaks people into oblivion. LOOK OUT!!! And with that I mean these special effects. There are an amazing number of errors. Action is terrible, but I would say that the only one who is struggling would be a sheriff. The film itself is really grainy and ill-lit. In one particular scene, this day is off and then the beast who shot his weapon behind him at night is hit. Then the day will show again. * Shakes head * I usually like low budget horror movies, but I had to force myself to stop it because I never watch a movie without completing it. The only achievement that this film achieved was an alien who was not stereotypical. So, and only for that ... I'll give him three out of ten. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie if you've had a bad day. When a movie has failed, it is even less pressed.
