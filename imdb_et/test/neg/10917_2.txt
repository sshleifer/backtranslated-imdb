It will take this traditionally simplistic and idiotic Stephen King-based film to finally get out of the starting blocks. About half an hour, unnecessary introductions to various eternal characters and their insignificant personal problems that can irritate domestic women and apathetic pensioners in soap books, but this should be a horror musician (or so naively thought). Mutt does not see all this terrible thing that Leonard Maltin, the notoriously unsuccessful / hopeless and always ridiculous film critic, disagrees with: he thinks Cujo is "truly scary". (I often have to think about whether Maltin is really thick - or just like to make the benefits of his Hollywood friends.) It is both illogical and inconsistent when Wallace lives under attack only with foot injury. And of course, his car breaks down just when he needs to save his life: it is one of the oldest clich√©s of horror films; trust King to use it with minimal effect. The assumption is immaculate, too banal, even in a horror film: rabbi mole attacks the family. Is it all? This kind of thing barely forms a 3-minute sub-bottom plot in your average zombie. I think even Cujo must feel that he is starring in turkey. Mutts have terrible things ... But what I really don't understand is how can people actually throw themselves into the "Cujo" book and read it on the cover? These SK fans must be immortal: this is the only explanation, that is, why they treat time as such meaningless goods. <br /> <br /> Bodycount: 3.
