Bored movie. Poor plot. Poor participants. The film takes place in a room that should be in Morocco, but in some American cities! "Arab Terrorists" are Patriots to whom the Blond Patriot is "Arab Terror" ... DAMN! <br /> <br /> There's something good about this movie (that's why the score is 2 out of 10). The director changes the ridiculous stereotype of terrorism that the media feeds us into everyday reality, the terrorists being Americans (or, if you want, the Western people). <br /> <br /> The movie is divided into two parts. The first part of the movie concerns Dutch travel (15 seconds), while the second part stops in an amazing dark brown room (1 hour and something). <br /> <br /> The Dutch boy will start giving money to a "charity" in Morocco, going out of the ordinary, taking a bus and ending in a dark brown room kidnapped. He has been kidnapped by another boy who is shot after they say, "They're not shooting us". Dutch survivors are forced to play chess with a Morpheus-like Arab boy for as long as you can learn how to play chess! Finally, the Dutch man reveals his plot not because they cut four fingers, but because he is deceived by such a flat game, you should watch the movie! <br /> <br /> Good if you're so tired you can't sleep.
