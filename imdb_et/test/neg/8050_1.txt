"The son you need to try, what I started, stop!" Too bad someone didn't say that who shone this green light! I almost literally pulled my friend into this movie, who showed we were in high school. Now, at midnight the movie in high school on Friday night, you don't expect much, but rather !! And after that years later I see my original opinion. Great special effects, but what !! Quite probably one of the films ever made. If you don't enjoy blood and courage, and you see some Hollywood vets (Steiger & Hunter) make fools stupid. YUCK !!!
