This movie definitely made me laugh, but that doesn't mean it's just funny. Well, then again, it was a lot of fun for me and my friends. <br /> <br /> I doubt there is something in this movie that hasn't been done at least twice before, as well as yourself. All the characters are over-exploited in the film's clich√©-cardboard roles, which do not even require acting skills; accordingly, such skills are not transmitted. We have a corrupt policeman, a ruthless killer who claims to care about his men and their families, notwithstanding the fact that he's not looking for people he's shoots on his forehead so close to his blood. We have a "worn cop edge" so well shown in the discussion boards of this movie; we have an old one-day off-retirement age, almost all of which must immediately be identified as the most likely man inside, because he had the most benefit and did not express a reliable word throughout the film. About as thoughtful as a glass house on a sunny day. The big black gangster king was a copy of all the previous kings of big black gangsters during the film (they could just call him Marcellus Wallace), but just a little tougher and more ruthless, because something must be emphasized that we also know the good films of Laurence Fishburne. Then we finally have a VERY PROMOTED doctor who does not think anything reasonable to do as soon as the situation differs from his normal life and who spends most of the film sitting in the corner helplessly, trying to figure out how to detain the weapon he was given. DO NOT USE IT. <br /> <br /> The whole story is not interesting, not original (it has been used twice before) and this movie can add something interesting to it. There is an initial probe, then a siege, then an attack, then an escape attempt. In the meantime, a number of tense, stressed, blinded policemen and cutters succeed in keeping the police attack team on high-tech equipment and with VISION's quite significant advantage. And again, deep in the night, with a power outage and a snow storm that is over-colored, there is definitely a lot of light so it cares about night vision. <br /> <br /> The best part comes in the end. In the first scenario, which shows 13th place, we see that it is located in the suburbs of an industrial city; factories and office buildings surround it on all sides. From that moment on, the delimited walk may be one hundred meters in the sewer and where will they finally arrive? Some alley that ends right in the middle of the forest! METS! Where did the forest come from? Who decided to put the pine forest in the middle of the industrial area? How is it suddenly over the hill in the last scene of the forest, while in the scenes inside the forest it seemed deceptively FLAT? <br /> <br /> Here I leave the judgment for you and your common sense. Go and watch this movie if you are looking for an unwanted laugh, I really recommend it.
