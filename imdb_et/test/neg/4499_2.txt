Another frisbee, like a turtle that has risen like a wart. More battlefields with people like the tick. Ping-Pong Spaceship. Two kidnapped boys who know how to do everything, including getting into a spaceship. Stronger music. More "Gamera is a child friend". I remember when Godzill and Rodan came out. The movies were very fun because the monsters were actually dangerous to humans. Now they are just a parade of foolish costumes, with very little behind them. Adults are all ridiculous and moral. Like American knitters, children are also bosses (if they couldn't actually get out of a paper bag). These monster films have to be Japanese tools for the partonization of these small diseases. Above all, however, after seeing the three films (over and over the same plot, check the film), the final conclusion is that they are boring. If you haven't seen it, don't worry.
