What a shame that some good talent was wasted. It's a tedious and too self-conscious film that can tell your story half-time. Is it Derek Jacobi who carries two groups? Gosh, who would have thought. <br /> <br /> The emotional end of the payoff was weak and dissatisfied. It is certainly not worth the cushioned length of the movie. I felt quite down. <br /> <br /> The sound was terrible. First, they used song music. Secondly, it was so strong during the dialogue that it was difficult to make words. Only three sounds for team and trainee? There were more people under the credit who were either in accounting or legal. <br /> <br /> Some camera work was pretty good and the actors did a good job with a mediocre script. <br /> <br /> Not at least good use of viewing time for me.
