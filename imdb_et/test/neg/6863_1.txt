I would be one of the few people who have a copy of this classic. But i dont just own 1, i actually own 2. Its good. <br /> <br /> Well, when I say good, I mean bad. But I will try to thoroughly review it. I even looked at the "born ninja" that one of the other reviewers mentioned here compare to. And the ninja was actually worse, but not quite so funny. <br /> <br /> And it's never funny. The whole movie is bad. ALL. The plot is completely stuffed (note "you must keep me alive if you want to find out my wife"). Each sequence is also completed. Our hero danton is more than a hero; he can stabilize people with twigs, take 3 centimeters to the heart at 50 degrees without bleeding, and tie the rope to the tree, which, when the enemy enters it, binds the knot around the enemy's foot, picks it up, and throws him at a height of 50 meters. <br /> <br /> Operation is so bad that it is impossible to comment on it, but it should be rolling for you, especially the dantons jump out of the ground and worry about a bad boy. Oh yes, and bad guys: somehow they seem to revive the movie 5 times. Perhaps it is just that there were not enough participants, but in the film with that caliber? I doubt it. <br /> <br /> "The plot" is how Danton was a soldier in the Vietnam War and now his Colonel has hunted real people to train his mercenaries. The Colonel just rises danton, then fights danton. It's just an excuse for the rambo clone, with most of the movie killing soldiers. And I really can't explain the plot anymore cos no other movie. However, it is still stones. Don't let me get started. Hand grenades that are actually out of the actors' feet because the explosion is the size of the game. Scenes with 5 people who are looking for the camera will cut and back and there will be 7. How danton every time loads the grenade launcher it has the same background, though it is in completely different locations. And the worst part is when the danton pushes the plastic boulder against enemies and one enemy is boulders intact, so he doesn't know what to do to die it halfway, even if he is not touched. It's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But funny. Very very funny. This is one of the few movies I can recommend to everyone, cos, if you can't find it funny, you're 1 million. And for the rest, it's magic.
