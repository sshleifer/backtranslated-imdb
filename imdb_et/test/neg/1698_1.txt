The most irritating thing about "Dies d'agost" (August days) is not just that it is NOT HAPPENS in this movie, but director Marc Recha is nervous to pretend that this film is a tribute to the left Catalan journalist Ramon Barnil. If the name of Barnils is not mentioned a couple of times, then this pretense is completely fraudulent. You are practically learning something about Barnista in this movie, not about the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) or Catalunya's special role in this war. You will also not know what collective punishment for the heroic Catalan people has been won and honored by Franco for years. <br /> <br /> The Catalan landscape footage is of course very beautiful, but "Dies d" agostil "is not such a wide-ranging and versatile collection of scenes to qualify for a travel test. Brave Marc and David's purposeful drift during their camping trips does not create compelling cinemas. On the contrary, the strongest impression is the film made by the distance, the middle-aged hippies, and the film. Don't waste your time. Instead, read a good book about the Spanish Civil War. I recommend Felix Morrow's embarrassing anti-stalinism "Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Spain", which includes a grip on Barcelona's 1937 uprising.) Barry Freed
