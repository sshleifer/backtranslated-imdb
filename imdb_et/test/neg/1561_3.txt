Edge Vs. Michaels-Boring in general (loved the sweet chin music on the chair) 4/10 Taker Vs. Heidenreich-One of the worst encounters I've ever seen, predicted by hell I liked it when the show drove through the JBL wall. 3/10 The World Heavyweight Championship-Pretty OK, which is more than a race from Tripe H, but I was happy to see it after watching the mess. 5/10 Royal Rumble-Good Rumble, liked the brand showdown, the Hassan thing and the end. 7/10 Generally still crap. Why does anyone follow the noise?
