Ed Wood runs around his grave. He could have made a hundred cultural classics for this rainfall. The worst script in memory (it makes "X-Men 3" shine like "Citizen Kane"); most amateur manager; Pre-K cinematography; the most exciting "special effects" (I'm talking about "Friday 13th"); and throw in the futile, rebellious, deeply disturbed order of the maternity department. The lack of talent or sensitivity that puts this garbage on the screen is amazing. The fact that 'industry' can reward all the people involved in this celluloid mature project for future projects should be the cause of the serious disorder.
