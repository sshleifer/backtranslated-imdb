Since 1988, Touch Of Death is probably the most exhausting Fulci movie I've seen so far, and I am invited to join a horror fans' chorus who generalize that his films are getting worse when you get your career later. Considering the plot summary, I waited with this blood with funny funny jokes, but for all this odd prosperity, it seems tedious even in an 80-minute runtime and suffers from poor raps production values ​​and cinematic art. (or lack thereof). <br /> <br /> El Story: Widowed Wines of Gambling Gourmets and Eating Rich (and Strange) Women He finds in the Columns of Lonely Hearts before They Throw Them in Harsh Fashion - Sometimes Eating or Eating Animals - and Stealing Your Money to keep their debtors open. Of course, it's unlikely that only one man would have so many screwed pathologies at one time (addict, psycho / sociopath, cannibal), but that's Fulci! <br /> <br /> Touch is actually cheaper and most sparsely looking for the Fulci movie I've seen. There's hardly anyone, even in the background of the streets. The news publisher who appears on the TV's TVs to warn of a non-existent lie about mania's latest actions is the most pathetic studio on the planet. She will never be able to watch the camera because she has to read all the titles on the unsuitable sheets of paper. <br /> <br /> Some scenes go on and on when the protagonist mimics what he has done or is doing, but the actor is not close enough to keep such a thing, so the main result is the boredom of the viewer . The film also looks delicate and ugly in general. I've read that it was meant for Italian telemovie (did it ever happen on the screen? What was the number of gore that seemed unlikely), and that reek of crappy old telemovie production values. <br /> <br /> It's also Fulc's first invasion of black humor, but it's just too bad a director to make it work. Sometimes obviously joyful or nervous music is used against a terrible scene, for example, when a hero / villain has a dead body in his cellar. The effect is not really chilling or funny or ironic you would like - it is usually simply grasped and dirty. <br /> <br /> Of course, some gore redeeming moments (to wait awake), including killing a woman's harassment (!), just don't leave her life, even after her face is full of a bloody big club and homeless boy who gets the car about five times back and forth. But the most unheard of the touch is all the physical deformities of the fools who are a crazy man. Bearded, hairy mole, dirty harelips - it's not like she's looking for women with these qualities, it's just how all lonely hearts are widowed. Mr. Crazy is secretly grimacing when he created these women. The black humor of such a rosy misogyia may have some lasting strength or resonance if the film is not generally so badly performed. Finally, the lack of death seems like a very lazy, intuitive confusion.
