PLEASE PEOPLE! DO NOT worry about this poorly targeted joke. The direction was completely wrong from the start. Where is the history of his mother's emotional intervention and the general madness in the original family? Why is ED depicted as such a large, overwhelming, angry, hateful figure? What's this mess? The writer and the director obviously did not study history and just wanted to take money in the notorious Gein name. The fools who made this movie really brought a lot of freedom, it's ridiculous. If you want to see a brilliant Gein movie. go back to the miniature classic "Deranged" to see how Ed really was. In this movie there is humor and Ed is depicted more than sad, lonely little man he was, by HISTORY. Where is the background story? We have just set up bad shocks (which are not shocking) that we have seen and achieved more in the past. Take the worst Texas Chainsaw massacre ripoff and add it to the list. It was ten out of ten because the rating doesn't accept zero. I want my money back. If someone sees this movie as "stunning", it can do it.
