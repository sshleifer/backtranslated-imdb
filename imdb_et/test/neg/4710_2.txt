I rented this movie because Elijah Wood has done a good job and I thought it might be a neglected treasure. It wasn't a treasure. I don't know if it was a video, but it should have been directly to the dump. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood fans want it to appear odd without much in a short shower. But no reasonable person would want this script. Imagine Memento, played by teenage actors, but ten times confusing and a hundred times less credible. Example: Janeane Garofalo plays a caring psychologist (probably "keeps the chain of mediocrity alive"). <br /> <br /> Like the false memory syndromes and medication for mental medicine, the movie is not enough enough. The same twin bond creates some too viable scenes of love between the character of Wood and the girl who is all of her who plays the sacred sister of Wood's angry cancer victim. <br /> <br /> Adding this trilacy scenario, Wood's other friends are a mentally ill and kidney, a young black boy with mysterious kidney disease. Kidney Dying Wish Dr. Garofalo Gets Her Walkman. This character's hackneyed feature story is suitable for his re-off-off relationship walking. Usually the wheelchair is tied, there are several unexplained scenes in the kidney that show him that others are surrounded by it. <br /> <br /> Kindey's characterization can be one small detail, but it shows this movie's many other bugs. In any case, Bumblebee will definitely fly, but it will never fly.
