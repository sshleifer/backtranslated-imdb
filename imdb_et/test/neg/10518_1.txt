There are some big Canadian movies. There are some nervous. Last night I watched one mess. It was not a typical Canadian film where he tried to be so different that he was artificial. This movie was trying to be a Hollywood gangster movie. It was terrible. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, I had the feeling that it would be a bad film. It had some of the most exciting dialouge of the movie. For one scene, this voice was over and it never came back. It's always a mistake for me when filmmakers use voice only when they can't think of a different creative way to tell a story. <br /> <br /> I know I'm in the Canadian film industry. but this movie is junk. The prerequisite is that the Sopran episode is not real. Some banker mafia boss fathers have his death bed and commissioned son to do business legit. Not so original. And the workers complain about it, but they just take note that they are going to work soon, like nothing. To be legitimate, they use extortion. Irons. But not good. Then the main character releases the girl somewhat from the show, who had a terrible Elvis wig and a birthmark covering half her face and being raped. Anyway, this guy likes to dress up for some reason. Then the banker grabs the whore if she has a beautiful future woman at home. But he falls for the whore, because the whore dresses like a man and puts on her make-up. She leaves her some pictures of her bra and panties. But she still loves her. He also has no reason to leave his fiancé, but he does to be with the whore. <br /> <br /> The film about the crime and sexual fetish organization was not an act or a sex. It was like a late night Cinemax porn movie without good things. The possible sexual scene was neither hot nor sexy. It was too amateurish. The film had nothing to do with it, but a flat piece. <br /> <br /> I don't think it was an actor's fault. I think they had a terrible manuscript. The most arrested were ridiculous characters. The bad man's name was Uncle Bunny or something. But the name was not important. They were all clichés. Dialogue was ridiculous at the film, and the man's filmmakers laughed at some "serious" moments loudly. Then, the worst. It was supposed to be the cheapest end. If you ever remember that you are playing shoot like a child with either imaginary weapons or toy guns. It was basically the end of the movie. But I was more than happy that it ended, and I had to warn my compatriots in Canada that they didn't waste time or money watching this movie.
