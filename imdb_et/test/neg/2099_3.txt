Looking back from 2006, one of the things I mostly remember is "Snakeamania" on the internet for a movie called Snakes. But the unknown DVD-hanging movie called Snakes was unknown to me after I saw it, I know this best B movie better. <br /> <br /> Plot: <br /> <br /> The man and the woman go to the train to go to Los Angles to get help from the uncle's husband who is shaman. This is because the woman's family does not praise her in marriage, so they have given her a curse that the snakes will "get from her." drive to Los Angles and group passengers including former Narc policeman and some drug traffickers. Will they get there before the snakes take him over? <br /> <br /> Film View: First Effect: I have to say that although some of the smaller snakes look good, the main effects you have to wait eighty minutes! Unfortunately, it is bad that they are killing the good memories of the movie completely (the film makes the 1982 video games next to T2!) One of the things I noticed is that there is no script credit in the movie! and the filmmakers make the film so climatic that it destroys the whole movie. Final view on film: <br /> <br /> The right-hand B-film, which is incredibly bad.
