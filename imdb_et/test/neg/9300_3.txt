Frank Falenczyk: It's not that I'm sorry I killed them; that is, I'm sorry I killed them badly. <br /> <br /> Wow! Talk about swing and disappearance. You have a great cast and a big plot with endless possibilities ... how do you do it? Well, obviously John Dahl has found a way. With a terrifying scenario featuring jokes about funny as malaria epidemic and dialogue so painfully dry, it makes no characters pleasing, "You Kill Me" could be the biggest movie break in 2007. Positive note, Ben Kinglsey gives another great show as a Polish alcohol producer who is trying to clean but the material he has to work with is nonsense. Tea Leon is good as well as Luke Wilson, Dennis Farina, Bill Pullman, Philip Baker Hall and the rest. I think the best way to describe "you kill me" is a terrible movie with good performances. Rating: D +
