First of all, the Mexican werewolf in Texas is misleading, as many others have pointed out. In fact, it is El Chupacabra, a werewolf-like creature, but not the same. <br /> <br /> Production and editing simply sucks. When it was over, I probably wouldn't have been able to accurately describe what Chupacabra was exactly looking at, because whenever it was on the scene (despite one or two exceptions), the camera turned all trembling and you only saw the monster face clearly. The special effects were ridiculously bad, but it must be expected from a low budget horror film. <br /> <br /> With terrible production comes bad actors. Now a couple of rather credible performances (Erika Fay and Martine Hughes), but then there were bad actors (everyone else) who seemed to have no emotions. Then there is a terrible actor (Sara Erikson) who gives me one of the two worst performances I've ever seen in the movie. I mean to my god, he was inexplicably bad. <br /> <br /> The plot was very simple. Basically, Chupacabra is a small Texas city that kills local residents and a group of teenagers are waiting to stop it. Even if the plot is so simple, a couple of plots could leak into the hole. <br /> <br /> Anyway, terrible movie. However, if you are looking for a movie to entertain and laugh with your friends one night, it would be pretty good. My friends and I had the time to watch. Probably the second worst movie I've ever seen, 1/10. Awful.
