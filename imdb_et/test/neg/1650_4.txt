Desperate, somewhat average witty, infantile humor is the guy in this city who turned to the story of a wannabe farmer. It's not terrible enough to turn to the Will Ferrell crowd and not interesting enough to wear the feature length. Most of all, I can praise "The Law of the Son", which means that it mostly avoids the toilet. The main problem is that not all characters are warm and Pauly Shore is so abrasive that he is the most unlikely hero. There are some entertaining bits that cover farm animals, and that's it. The story that exists is both simplified and predictable, making the "jury duty" a "wind". - MERK
