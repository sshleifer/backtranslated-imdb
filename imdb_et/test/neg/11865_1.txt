It seems that all the companies that enjoy the taxes imposed by Romania give a picture that disappears since 1994. They have hardly tried to get the oldest car that was created, but they never take pictures of Lamorghini, Ferrari, Aston Martin, and all the new Mercedess that are in some important countries more. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that they filmed in a Bucharest district where they had the opportunity to delete the streets and put garbage on people I don't know, maybe the '90 clothes that make them feel so stupid that you understand the script, maybe the other one was purchased from eBay or worth. movies in the US and make good money there when giving us a little and a shame in our country. I have no reason to believe that anyone understands the message (outside my English --- sorry)
