Although it is a well-produced television film, Dying to Love You reeks with low quality melodramatic glory. <br /> <br /> The film opens for Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson, looking a lot older than I remember him). who is a distressed businessman who leads an empty, lonely life after his wife Ruthie (who looks suspiciously like Roseanne Arnold) leaves her fast. Now all Roger has his cats .... and his ad in the newspaper. <br /> <br /> Once his ad has been answered, he will call Johnnie-Elaine-Lisa to be irrelevant if I want to be-Lawrence. Then ... they have phone sex. <br /> <br /> I am not sure where you are or when you were born, but I remember having sex in the phone at the end of the 80s. I'm sorry, but it was trashy. <br /> <br /> Soon Roger and a wide hook and a whirlwind. They fall in love, visit the zoo to see the gorillas, and then in another room with sex with Roger's son. She binds her to bed and seduces her. <br /> <br /> Roger is just so stupid that he doesn't understand that Johnnie-Eliane is just a bimbo that loves to sleep. God forbids women to sleep with only one man. Soon a strange phone call will come up, Johnny Girl wants Roger to marry him at an absolute speed, and he will keep his former husband who beat him. It's funny to see that Roger believes in him all this thing. It is as long as the frumpy co-worker tells him that he is going through his stuff like a nervous housewife. She takes her crappy advice and see she finds the cafe climbs on fake ID cards and wigs and arms and cross section. He immediately takes the suit to the police and was arrested. Although all this jazz, he still loves the wider. He speaks so many lies, his language seems to be burning when he tells the truth once. <br /> <br /> Roger continues his life and meets an ugly woman named Angela, who looks like something from Gremlins 2. She also has a child and Roger loves her. But something in Roger's subconscious keeps him in contact with Lisa Rohn (if it is even his real name) and he goes back to see him. <br /> <br /> Now Lisa's "not going away" she "earns" herself out of prison and shows Roger at his fingertips, and his son Matt is so busy to control him, he pours juice on the whole floor . IL 'Rog is so stupid, he throws Add out and doesn't even change locks. Boy, if all the people were such fools, I don't even write this review. Ending this movie is so funny, you don't believe. <br /> <br /> Tim Matheson is a TV-ready movie. he just sees such a mound in such a movie. He's a little woody and stiff. The dazzling Tracy Pollan is doing well and his trampiness rings. She is very beautiful and I see what Michael J. Fox sees him. <br /> <br /> This movie is great to watch when you're late at night, but then you can fall asleep as it is boring and boring.
