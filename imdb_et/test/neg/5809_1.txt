This movie is on Welcome Home Roxy Carmichael for the biggest bins ever hit the silver screen. If these boys were not Adam Sandler's gay friends, this script would have come where it should be: like some big movie films that fill toilet paper. I hate this movie, it makes me hurt people. I admit that I have high standards, but honestly I would look at Step Up 2. The sad part of Ultra was when I logged in to IMDb and read that the bins gave this movie a rating of 6.9. This is a testament to all the slowdowns in our society that are going to look at horrible movies that are only hours and a half long guns, glands and weed jokes with little or no originality. After this rating, I see that I would recommend that Tyler Perry's pain house be for you all who enjoyed this movie; There you can see some high-quality humor about the same level of terrible embarrassment.
