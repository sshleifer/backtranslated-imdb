This movie has a number of well-known actors that I usually like, so I had at least modest expectations on renting a DVD. I was very disappointed. In fact, I went off some snacks in the last half hour and I was somehow getting back to the kitchen rather than the TV. Performers' performances, where the poor are pretty much over the table, and no film environment felt very convincing. Almost all scenes had a "just movie" feeling for them, I just sat there to hear the director "CUT!" followed by a team that talks before the scene moves before the scene. <br /> <br /> Because the movie is about gangsters, most of the symbols are harsh and mobile. -Boy's attitude is played so badly that it just seems like a joke. Permanent drilling with guitar strives to emphasize this atmosphere, but if the same track is played for the 18th time, it just adds that the whole thing is already heavily forged. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was just a really bad script, maybe it was just bad. I'm not a film critic, I really find it rare to see something that is really good, but it was just bad, no matter how objective and forgiving I was trying to be. Don't recommend, not even rent!
