Don't believe in hype. If you have great hopes or have waited for this movie to some extent, you may be disappointed. Even fun and talented Steve Carrell will not save this badly written, too long-foolish spy strike. For purists (original TV fans), this film is similar to the original characters and effects. Agent 99 and Maxwell (except their names) are not just the same characters. There are several separate references to the original, but that is not enough to convince the fan that it is more than a bad shadow of the TV version. For those who do not know the original TV series, you may not be disappointed, but you are likely to be bored. There are also some cheap Hollywood political shots (really pathetic and so typical for election year). We left after the first hour and were not alone. Some left in 20 minutes.
