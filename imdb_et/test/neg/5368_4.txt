The atmosphere of this exhibition is great. There are lots of great gatherings, but that's where this show fails. There's a way to build a lot. You see a constantly terrible device that makes you feel like something nervous that comes out of the corner and then .... nothing. Something over and over again. You hear many stories of people who talk about terrible events, but you don't see them. They appear at the doors of their nations, talk about their deep and emotional past, create flat devices, and find nothing! there is nothing in this exhibition that makes me believe anything paranormal. I laugh every time they need a "terrible spirit" that we, as the audience, can't see. They are released from a spirit that has never been, and all are put under a clean, small package. An exhibition that seemed so striking and had such a great potential leads to one thing ... Nothing!
