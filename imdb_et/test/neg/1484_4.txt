Maybe it's time for us to announce the 2007 cinematic crocodile for the International Year! First of all, a ridiculous "First Event" that touched the name of the plot Gustave (!), Who decided in the Burundian swamps. Then there was "Lake Placid 2", a low profile, and a TV post for a forgotten original. Thirdly, this incredibly derived and enjoyable piece of the Aussie horror, and finally, I can't see the promising "Rogue" yet. The latter is probably the best, taking into account the involvement of the upcoming Aussie horror talent Greg McLean (Wolf Creek). "Black Water" is certainly not a complete waste of time and film, but it is another pretty useless survival flick that is disturbing the embarrassment of real life with horror. Excuse me for the inconvenience, especially since I know honestly people who passed this trial, but depicting the three stars in the tree and whining more than one hour is not just a skip! Three young people travel through North Australia and decide to spend one day fishing in remote sex areas. It won't take too long before a giant and wild crocodile falls into its small boat and drives the guide. Grace, Lee and Adam can barely escape from the hungry teeth of predators on the tree. Even if he remains invisible most of the time, he is patiently waiting and makes it impossible to leave the sex alive. Yes, it sounds like a lot of "open water". Replace numerous invisible sharks with one gigantic invisible crocodile and the inevitable Aussie tribe with the open sea and there it is. Well, "Black Water" is at least some rare moments of excitement and one of the most impressively designed water monster. It must be said that the croc looks stunningly fabulous and you shine hopelessly every time it leaves the water. The three-way cast does everything they can to keep your characters interesting, but how do you achieve it by sitting at the tree all the time? In principle, the concept of events causes a number of limitations, such as limited images of fantastic shooting locations, dialogues and friendly drawings.
