Just before I wrote this review, I found that "Komodo vs Cobra" and another movie called "The Comodos Curse" were both Jim Wynorski. This may explain why they are movies of almost identical spaces. They both have a military-led island, a colonel, who is worried about covering his tracks more than his employees, competing people who reach the chopper, conveniently located anywhere on the island, and gigantic komodo dragons created by amok with genetic tests. What are the differences? Well, the island's invaders are now capitalists who want to reveal the secret of the government and there is also a giant cobra, so the title "Komodo vs Cobra", although the conflict between the two monsters is hardly relevant. story. "Komodo vs Cobra" is more or less expected due to its title and channel origin: the Sci-Fi Channel. Although every time and again you find one that may turn to you for one reason or another (I liked a movie called "Komodo"), I hardly doubt it is. <br /> <br /> "Komodo vs. Cobra" is not only a boring film, but it is also one of the least enthusiastic sci-fi flicks I've seen for a long time. Some of these films have air for them, which shows that filmmakers made at least some effort, but I see very little here. This has been shown again because it is just a "Commodos curse". The CGIs of the monsters look like they came out of the second level video game, the cinematography and the misc en scene are bad, the working ranges are passable to bad, the action scenes are empty and then there are some parts that are frankly unforgettably bad. I see many movies where a person fires a gun several times without reloading and I can handle it. But in this movie, where Michael Paré takes one thirty-eight handguns and fires it without stopping for fifty times, without reloading, I laughed at first, but even then it became just tiring. That would be "action." A monster appears, people screaming, Paré's fire is interrupted without reloading the gun, and no one eats. <br /> <br /> "Komodo vs Cobra" is a very bad movie. The only thing that is worth mentioning in a charity way is the only thing that is Michelle Borth, who is not only very beautiful but a surprisingly strong performer. Even because of the lack of tricky dialogue and enthusiasm in the scenario given to him, Michelle Borth managed to crowd out a surprisingly good result and I just like that a good actor, like him, can get stuck in junk. Obviously he took it for a fee, but it doesn't help his career.
