Despite the fact that "Adam's House" is intended for the mainstream gay movie; jw.org en Anthony (John Shaw), a gay curious and great cutie-hunk and Adam (Jared Cadwell), who is openly gay and the other looks; that Anthony and Adam have been in the movie for 41 minutes (this may be enough for many) for a whole minute of wonderful, convincing and naked love (sorry, not the front) - even though you give up your thumbs, "Adam's House" is terrible movie from most other film making standards. Big thumbs down. Shaw's and Cadwell's acting abilities are either sophomore or otherwise suffer from a bad script, direction and editing, or rather lack thereof. Their love scene, however, is convincing and may be more related to their truly being one, taking into account their remaining scripting and action. his film making skills are on the wall. <br /> <br /> So the script and its absence are thumbs down. All in all, there is a bit less action for Shaw and Cadwell. Alexis Karriker as Nina could have been the best, except for the restrictions above. The absolute worst and afflicted was Thomas Michael Kappier, who was Albert Ross, Anthony's father, who didn't even have the quality of primary school. He really represents a colossal casting mistake. <br /> <br /> The players in the new cabin owners are also worthy of really bad candidates. <br /> <br /> If only production, editing and posting were as good as a trailer, this movie would have been something else. The Hague presents well-assembled scenes that drew me to renting a movie. That and the hope that this geek-centered film was supposedly outstandingly played and favored at gay film festivals. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is big under your thumb. <br /> <br /> Is it worth buying / renting and looking at it? Only if you have an irresistible yen to see the naked love scene, and a couple of minutes of half-assertive dialogue between Anthony and Adam. Or if you really enjoy watching bad movies.
