We saw this in a favorable basket at local Asdas: Â£ 1.50 per DVD. reading the whole coating that has been plastered over the entire cover, saying how it is "mountainous", and it was very good, cast, we thought it should be a great film. <br /> <br /> So we bought it, took it home, pulled it back to the DVD player, sat back and waited until the funnies start ....... and waited ....... and waited ..... and waited a bit more. > <br /> About 90 minutes later, though it seemed more than 3 hours, credit was rolling and it was the end. <br /> <br /> What hope - even paying 1.50 pounds seemed to compete. God knows what Caine, Richardson and Gambon thought when they said "yes" to it. And like Moran: As much as I liked Black Books, Shaun from the dead and his comedy trips, I felt he was out of the depths of this movie. He tried too hard to laugh, probably thinking that if it were to keep the characteristics of his black books, it would work here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was shot back. After some time, the gags gradually fell, and then it just became an irritation. What is ashamed, because I believe that by giving the right part, he can be a very good film / character actor. <br /> <br /> To sum up, actors did not act !!! <br /> <br /> ** / *****
