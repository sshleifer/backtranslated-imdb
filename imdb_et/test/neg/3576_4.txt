In New York, a private school for her class and mother will arrive in the morning near Christmas to see her daughter play. Then they go shopping and later return to their gorgeous apartment in Manhattan. At night, they move in a dangerous neighborhood to a simple apartment where they prepare drugs for distribution. On Christmas Eve, his father has been kidnapped by buying his daughter's Christmas gifts, and his wife is desperately trying to raise the big money to pay for the ransom. "R Xmas" is Abel Ferrara's deceptive film. Words do not have names, they are anonymous, and perhaps his intention is to say that there may be drug dealers in your building on the neighbors' chest; or that drug dealers may also have families and may be a loving person; or that there are many dirty policemen, probably worse than criminals; or is it just a crime to apologize? What ever! But this humanization of criminals is a terrible message and I really didn't like this movie. For example, in Brazil, many drug dealers and criminals help their communities through a lack of state in poor areas and slums, but this process does not make them a citizen. In this movie, we see a loving upper class family during the day, offering drugs for lifestyle, but destroying members of other families is not a story, and it is impossible to feel compassion for any character. Finally, I wanted them all dead. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Gangues do Gueto"
