I like CKY and Viva La Bam, so I couldn't resist it when I saw it in 1.99 pounds. This is Bam Magera's debut film, written by himself and by Brandon Dicimaillo, and celebrates the entire CKY team (Ryan Dunn, Raab himself, Rake Yohn, Jenn Rivell, Don Vito, etc.). Brandon is also responsible for the artistic direction, one of the greatest achievements of the film - its colorful style - but also the progress. <br /> <br /> Basically (very loosely), Ryan Dunni is followed by a girlfriend Glauren (played by Jenn). Vilo (played by Bam, named Vilo Valo at any opportunity?) And Falcone (Bran) play their best companions who re-trick different tricks. <br /> <br /> It's a bit like CKY movies, but a linear story (which is really very common) and bad action. His strange, usually supercarmatic gang, seems to have been sucking his life when they know what they are going to say next. <br /> <br /> Functional and scripting is usually quite terrible, but the other half of the movie is much better than the first (90 minutes is slipping though), and there are a number of redeeming factors like Tony Hawk's Camel, Dicimaillo's Sub-lines like " The Futurstic Invention Awards and Diamond Bike, the soundtrack is also very strong (not ALL cKy and HIM - in fact, Bomfunk MC steals the movie in terms of music usage). In the second half of the movie, the feeling of fun is much more real - especially since Don Vitol has a very prominent role in the last half - and it seems that he steals every scene in which he is. <br /> <br /> The film likes those who like CKY antics, but only thanks to the basic material, not the filler or storyline. Oh, and does anyone tell Bam that skating montages, especially in movies, are in 1998. <br /> <br /> But the best part of the DVD package is not a movie - just 40 minutes' doc. <br /> <br /> During the last 20 minutes of the document, Raab's own alchemy and team's real feelings were treated with astonishment (as usual with Bam as Raabi's drink). problem and Ryan Dunn is really nice on the ground). In the last ten minutes of the document, a friend (who is a rare member of CKY) is trying to hit heroin while staying in Magera's household with a team - and a caring common gang (espcially Ape and Ryan) really is - an amazing pearl otherwise boring on DVD. <br /> <br /> Â£ 1.99 I am very pleased - although I hope that Bam will now be on improvised and short sketches.
