This is another addition to the trilogy of Frank Baum's personalized Oz films. It is essentially the same childhood as the other two pictures, although I find it better for others because it is shorter. As in other films, animal costume performers, an adult woman pretending to be a boy, and characters and a plot jump all over the place when the camera's work is static. This time there is a magical tint in the middle that gives desires, and a woman who is played by a woman is made king. <br /> <br /> Most special effects are witnessed at the beginning. Fairies are represented with multiple exposition photography. And there is a man who looks like Georges Méliès years ago, most famously "Le Voyage dans la lune" (1902). Méliès's imaginative fantasies and creative trick effects changed him as the leading pioneer of early cinema, and films made at the turn of the century were much better and even more technically advanced than this tiny Oz series.
