Do you remember those terrible films that grandmother forced to watch at 25 or so years of VHS recorder? "The Fallen" is just a bad execution of these films! The story is terrible, the direction is terrible, editing is terrible, music is terrible, and all together make an unbearable nightmare. <br /> <br /> It's also very slow! Very slow! I tried to sleep while watching it, but I couldn't do it because I had a nightmare of it. <br /> <br /> Please don't watch this movie! That's bad! Ten lines are many, so I don't know what else to say. <br /> <br /> Press the NOW button and you won't lose it!
