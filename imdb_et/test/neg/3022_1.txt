4 realz son my game iz mad tite yo i can't wait 2 get dis show and roll da club n make it a real 905 style wit crazy models n bottles, son! <br /> <br /> No, I was joking. It's a sad show created by sad men and meant to be enjoyed. Men who have been irrigated today because of their existence, that they will put their frustration in clubs where they fail in the descending chicks, in the hope that their small breeders will come into contact to try the loneliness of loneliness and feel, even for just one night, as if their location was in the Toronto Party. somewhat less stable in the board. <br /> <br /> I read a few comments here, saying that this exhibition is finally amplifying Canadian television to stand in parallel with American television or something else. Well, it is not at all short. It's like, yes! Feel the back side of Canada - you have finally broken a groundbreaking American content like "Studs", "Heart of Heart", "Elimidate" and "Fifth Wheel". Look, the real spirit picture is that "... will meet Candid Camera". Genius. And there is nothing to limit this thin line between fratboy marriage and latent homosexuality, as grown up by a group of men who hide each other on a hidden camera, admiring each other's "game" in the club. The man-love shown here is so understandable that they should really consider the "chemical bath keys". <br /> <br /> Side note how interesting it is that people who showed this show seem to be registering an IMDb account for an explicit purpose (I think I'm guilty of using the same tools to do the opposite). favorite is one enthusiastic reviewer who claims to be "from the United States". who strikes that "It is now clear that Canadian talent can produce American high-quality television." <br /> <br /> Smooth. <br /> <br /> But why even trouble making online buzz? After all, you can't cancel anymore - you are in the Comedy Network in Canada, baby! The viewing public will ignore your exhibition in the coming years. You're probably just fine, spending comfortably on mediocre freedom of speech with most of the Comedy Network's original programming.
