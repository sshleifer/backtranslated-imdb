It usually sounds much better with my head (so forgive me for rambling) I am hardly the biggest fan of Tarantino (and * I try * don't want to hack him ... which is quite difficult) I don't like watching the movie before. So with a cautious hesitation I walked into the cinema today to see "Inglorious Basterds". <br /> <br /> Now, to name this, it would be unfair to "rip-off" here. Tarantino is lucky enough to take the Enzo Castellari (less than remarkable) title from the Dirty Dozen clone, but not the plot points (that he takes from all other genres of the movie) Inglorious opens with a Nazi officer and his long questioning farmer who hides Jews in his cellar . This is such an anti-climax because it is a dialogue that is outdated, and the result is marked as miles. Of course one of the hidden Jews escapes (but more later) We (obviously very satisfied) are being treated to the introduction of Ldo Aldo Raine (ha-ha, almost a B-movie) by King ALDO RAY .... ha Quentin ... hold them "Honor" and this character is played by anyone other than Brad (DALLAS) Pitt (sorry, DALLAS was about the only good thing he ever celebrated) and jaws, Mr. Jolie treats us with a hound, pulled out with a laughing, laughing Nazi killer. At the same time, Tarantino forgets that real adults may be present, so it is assumed that teenagers have not heard of "Dirty Dozen"? <br /> <br /> The Raines team consists of (John Cassavettes seeking) bleeding Jewish soldiers who all want to become Adolf Hitler's great profitability. Tarantino pays special attention to two of these men in all of his higher knowledge by choosing Eli Roth, his best friend (and fellow citizen) for a long time, as a baseball bat that prevents Bear Jew. The other man is called Hugo Stiglitz (and I put more than half QT Fan Boys Ever Heard This Name Before This Movie) Keep up the good work of Tarantino, you have managed to get about 6 or 7 "hommages" (within the first 15 minutes) to continue adding them and this can damage the plot (or "absence"). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the long (and very boring and protracted) story in short, both Raine and her husband ("Inglorious Basterds") and the only survivor who is the first in the chapter, each have separate parcels to kill Hitler Nazi propaganda movie show, French cinema (which belongs to the mentioned owner, now grown) <br /> <br /> More regrettable (and meaningless) conversations are followed by two and a half since Pitt roars the audience's past and all the real tensions that lead to the murder of the most deadly tyrant of all time, the directors are urging to put David Bowie's song of 1980 on World War II film. <br /> <br /> My problems (and many) with this film, is it a recurring problem that I have most With Tarantino ..... he rarely knows when to start or stop. I don't need "respect" after "respect" to get fun * (whatever it is) I knew inglorious Bastards, Enzo Castellar, Aldo Ray , From Hugo Stiglitz ( and the ultimate crimes of the film) Ennio Morricone's REVOLVER haunting score. I'm going to the cinema to see the stars ..... the best you can do is the terrible Barad Pitt, I assume that you (Mr Tarantino) are the main drawing here? I don't want the audience to watch the movie. I pay to see my vision, my ideas, my creativity .... NO, how can you make endless scenes (over and over) of endless movies. It is high time that fan-boys (in IMDb) used some "strong love" for their "idol" (god knows if you don't ... studios should?) <br /> <br /> Tired old argument with Tarantino worshipers is "well if you can do better ... do it" Let me tell you when i was a 46 year old director, the (unlucky) pulling QT is ..... you want to offer you much more than the warmer better WWII movies than this is. The directors he was trying to emulate were making films because of bad or budget constraints. It is a fiction over and over again to hear his fans campaign for his lack of imagination. I'm sure he's better (but after questioning him once again ... and not to mention 2 and a half hours of my life .....) maybe he's not?
