This film may have some historical significance, and it certainly looks amazing how well the facts are together, device, rocket, space suits, moon surface, all screaming "classic" - but in the end the result makes a pretty boring film for today's eyes and 50s For the technological scenes you expect in such a film, it is far from sufficient to pay for the development of the entire sticky dialogue and predictable plot. Characters and plots can reward scientific sociological analysis, but they have too many times too few entertaining values. <br /> <br /> Much of this movie looks like a good movie for nine-year-olds. Mature subjects, human drama and violence are also kept at a level that is appropriate for children. <br /> <br /> Images seen from earth and moon can actually be more accurate than those from "2001" but when their use is dramatically ineffective. Particularly in 2001 may be the impressive meditation on the subject of this film, and has Star Wars in no way modeled the opening of space in the headlines of this film? But then again - the legacy is marginal. <br /> <br /> If this is a groundbreaking and mega-influential mature, 1950s Sci-Fi classics you are looking for, check out the Forbidden Planet.
