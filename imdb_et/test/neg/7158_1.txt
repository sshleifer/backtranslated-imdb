Theaters and drama in the film are fantastic, but the facts and research are far from certain. In the quotation of Dr. Bono, where the documentary seeks to establish a connection with Maria Magdalene of Mariamen, Dr Bovon later explains that it should be used for literary purposes (ie lectures of this time) rather than for historical purposes. In fact, he says he doesn't believe that Mariaalp's ossuary Talpiotis is Mary Magdalene. He also commented on his public letter that he had not been informed that his words would be used in this documentary, but rather on the works of Philips (literary work in the 4th century). <br /> <br /> We have a director here who took one clip for the fourth century Philip fantasy action and used it specifically to support 1st century ossuary records. Very sad stretching and Dr. Bovon invites Jesus / Mary Magdalene to connect as "science fiction" - because this documentary should be properly labeled.
