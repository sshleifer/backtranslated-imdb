The high product values ​​you will usually find in the Merchant / Ivory movie are here, but it is extremely boring, which could have been a very lively thing. I agree with the previous poster that it is not logical for the story to open through the eyes of the African American family, but their own ancestor, Sally Hemmings, has almost no role in this procedure. There is not much clarity to help the audience understand the motives of these historical indicators. And I was very disturbed by the accents of several characters. Nancy Marchand sounded very British for the French nun. And both Gwyneth Paltrow and Greta Scacchi felt they were trying different scenes in different scenes. In fact, Gwyneth is very poorly earned in this bio-region. His task, Thomas Jefferson's daughter Martha, is written so that we never get the hand of who she really is. At one point he slaves and the other moment he regrets the whole system of slavery. Nick Nolte performs his role well enough, but never makes us really care of Jefferson or his exploitation. Everything is very disappointing.
