Nickelodeon has gone down the toilet. They have kids who say things like "Oh my God!" and "We're Screwed" <br /> <br /> This exhibition promotes hatred for people who are not looking good or not inside the crowd. He says sexual excitement is good when girls put them on shirt-free boys. Not to mention an overweight boy who takes his shirt off. The main characters mainly cover someone from the usual. Carly's friend Sam, who may be a lesbian, wins over anyone who crosses his path, saying he's honest to be b ** ch. This exhibition has so much negativity that no one should look at it! I'll give him 0 out of 10!
