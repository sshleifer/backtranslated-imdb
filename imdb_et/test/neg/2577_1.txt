You will get a good portion of Steven Seagal's environmental damage and some breathtaking mountain areas with cow-boy scenes (or alternatively use some of the HORSE WHISPERER residues). You then add a large portion of the OUTBREAK virus or similar (it must be lethal and at least Biohazard Level 4) surrounded by a fat militant leader. You'll add one teaspoon of martial arts and explosions and fire. Add the classic red Indian herbs to taste. Serve now. <br /> <br /> What is the name of the movie ?: The Patriot. Perhaps Steven Seagal is the worst film. I am sure Seagal tried to say something in this movie, except for the usual I-am-a-chef (but also-an-ex-seal), but his recipe was confusing and the taste was terrible.
