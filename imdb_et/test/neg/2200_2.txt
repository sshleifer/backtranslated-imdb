Basically, it is just a fool that is almost identical to the zillions of other chasing stories in terms of functioning, arbitration, plot, dialogue, characterization (or absence) and pace. <br /> <br /> One area that "Net" differs from traditional chase movies is its material: Computers. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters did not clearly understand the differences between the pocket PC and Cray. <br /> <br /> Computer novices should not watch this movie because it makes them paranoid about computers. No matter what Hollywood is trying to tell us, it's not that easy to erase someone's identity by hacking. There are still too many paper documents in the world, and in 1995 it was even more. <br /> <br /> Computer pros shouldn't watch this movie either. I mean a magical virus that can melt the entire computer when you press "Escape"? Please. And the whole virus, including the cool multimedia effects of the screen (which are all?) Suitable for one 1.44mb floppy disk? Yes, whatever.
