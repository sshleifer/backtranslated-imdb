I have to say that this is the worst film I've ever seen in my life, I can't believe I wasted $ 10; this movie should be burnt and has ever thought about it. Who ever spent money on making this movie was D = D This movie features TERRIBLE actors and some scenes make no sense. Well, the whole movie doesn't make sense. Also, the part where these "men" enter the canteen (the National Securities Department), which happened to be the worst part of the film. How dare you say Frank Sinatra's name in vain? What about these glasses? If the boy and the girl are in the car and he "drinks" water, you can absolutely say that he is not even drinking! That's what's with a horrible dinner. And everyone knows that tires are not stabilized, you cut them.
