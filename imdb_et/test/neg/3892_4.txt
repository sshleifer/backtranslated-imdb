DON'T HYPE! <br /> <br /> I had to see why all the critics got over the film. I've seen it and still can't get it. The plot is thin, very thin. After the end of the film, I still didn't know the name of the female lead figure and one of the two male characters was not even under the name of the credit; I don't care about the characters, so I didn't care about the movie. <br /> <br /> Landscape and cinematography were brilliant, but so is National Geographic or Discovery Channel. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie to anyone.
