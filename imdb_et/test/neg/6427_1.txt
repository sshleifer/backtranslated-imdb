Wow, which is a bad movie. Not scary and hard to understand. The plot is not hanging at all and the actor is absolutely terrible. What is this famous criticism? "He runs emotionally from A to B." Yep. This means that. Not even a camp! I don't expect Oscar material, but it? And his, his friend's ghost? You should have a particularly stupid mollusc IQ to not see one coming. <br /> <br /> This movie (and I use this word loosely) is an insulting public of film art. If only a person associated with it knew how to put narrative together! It gets 1 out of ten, just because there's nothing lower. Light side - at least it's not two hours long.
