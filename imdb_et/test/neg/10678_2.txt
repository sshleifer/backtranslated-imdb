I don't even comment on this movie. Instead, I make a recommendation to all of you who are fans of the Euro-horror: If you want to see a nice little budget vampire strike, see Nattens engel (1998). It's all about the absence of Razor Blade Smile: acting, nice places, terrible results and less lifting vampires ...
