You don't have to spend a lot of time to watch it for a TV movie or a series of pilots or whatever it was meant to find out what's in store. Incredibly bad musical score from the beginning of his debut. Seriously, if this is not the worst thing I've ever heard, I can't remember it. While the acting talent is available here, from Jeff Bridges to Carl Betz, Vera Miles and Sal Mineo, writing is terrible and the story is lively, full of brilliant stereotypes and an obvious suspension by Ken Kesey. Why does Hollywood always have to present the seventies stories, as the so-called hippies are all the same size? It is too bad that such an interesting era in our exceptionally conformist societal experience generally depicts and throws out the garbage, so that the least offensive to the genre is now reasonably authentic, if almost none of them are even close to how things really were. The best I've ever seen is a man named Becker, called Looking Back, but who has heard of it yet? Somebody in Hollywood, that's for sure. They are too busy pushing like a storm in a movie to disturb reality.
