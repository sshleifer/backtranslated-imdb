Extremely bad! I don't expect much from Garcia because she is one of the most overweight players nowadays, but Keaton would have really had to suck it and get out of it (not that I love her very much, but hey, she did batman). <br /> <br /> In one scene, Keaton is transported to a hospital that is chained and carries a Hannibal Lecter-type face mask when the two attack dogs take it (dogs may feel the evil you know (puke)) and Keaton rejects them by doing them back and horny their tails between their legs. Did the film change the comedy there? Garcia fools himself into the celebrity debate, but only a full retard can be found plausible and the boy is too annoying to apologize. <br /> <br /> If you make this movie a poor plot because it needs some charm, humor, some definite action. Take Die Hard, for example, which is great, despite its rather nervous plot. <br /> <br /> Although Keatons's character was a joke, I directed him all the way. I wanted to see Garcia crying to his dead child and Keaton to marry some paradise island! This movie makes a good laugh. See it wisely to a friend and you can have fun because this movie comes up in almost every scene on wisecracks. All in all, this is an insult to your intelligence and a huge waste of money. Greed made this movie and thanked God for its own ass.
