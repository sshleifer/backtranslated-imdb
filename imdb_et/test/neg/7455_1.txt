Why is Canada able to provide decent movies in every genre, except in action? On the second day I caught Dragon Hunt on the television and it was like a train wreck. I just couldn't change that channel, it is a trivial stupidity that slipped my will power. Its pretty to say that cast IMDb "credit" for this monstrosity probably never worked again. It goes on and on. The film has nothing to suggest. If you are looking to enjoy bad movies with a smile, there are tons of other movies that don't require burning after your retina. to get money to finance the government, otherwise I will never pay.
