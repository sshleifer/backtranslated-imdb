Bad. Bad. Bad. These three lines are a summary of small films that can only attract the cinema of the idiots and their parents. and its ... # 1 Movie in America! What does this country think? Mike Myers is looking for more Micheal Jackson. Some Chineese ladies who sleep in 3 minutes. Flat plot with dirty jokes. It's grotesque and terrible. When Green-Eggs and Ham appear in 2005, I'm so happy! (not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan are likely to play two hipster who try to find the missing green eggs and the ham. They're trying to chase Sam-I-Am and the man who's going to go with it. (I hope they won't destroy the classic book.) Don't waste time and money watching it.
