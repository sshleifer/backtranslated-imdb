Sometimes it is funny to watch movies on your couch, but at other times it is just horrible for both your eyes and your mind. House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute is one of those rare examples where both your eyes and your mind ask you to turn off the movie. This last part of the House Party series is the worst, not just the sequel, but the Hollywood movie. Early on in this "function", director Chris Stokes loved passionately about Ferris Bueller's Day. I say this because it becomes very clear that Stokes had no difficulty in lifting Bueller's originality out of John Hughes and decided to create a film that was completely void. You think stealing themes and pictures from a more funny movie could at least create a paw or two. With House Party 4, Stokes proved that he didn't have the things he needed to drive a sequel, much less a Hollywood movie. His confusing and embarrassing story, the inability to understand his symbols and the recycled old / tired cliché moments all make Stokes a bigger nail coffin that keeps House Party movies. It reminds me of a student who forgets his project after an hour and quickly slows down super glue, macaroni, cat hair, chewing gum and straw and presents it to the Hannibal Cross Alps. It just seems awful and seems embarrassing for the creator. <br /> <br /> So where did this film first come into the area of ​​comic stupidity? Frankly, I do not believe that most places would allow me to talk so long, so I would like to catch up on some of the major issues that hit me hardest. First of all, I can't shake the Ferris Beuller hanging up yet. Just as Stokes would be ashamed of having to lead another sequel to House Party and decided to bring a completely random formula (from a more funny movie) and see if he could cut and paste the elements of the original series into that formula. It was a huge mistake. If the director tries to do this, it will eventually be a mess for the audience. We think we're going in one direction, but we're heading in the other direction. That's what you can recognize in House Party 4. In one case, we are trying to try to be the "biggest party of the decade" while trying to get a record deal (ok, reminds me of the original House Party), but then we throw away the random island where Uncle Charles fears flying, granny drunk and some idiotic moody moments with supposed killer. Again, let's start a bit strong and lose chaotic. That's the mess I'm talking about. Director Stokes was unable to hold his hand with a sense of humor or the ability to speak a sequential story. He rather cut the corners, keep the jokes cheap and think that the audience is idiots when trying to revive the dead series of stone. One might think that when the director was given the task of filming another House Party movie, he stepped in, thinking he would be the one who restarts or lives back, instead Stokes just wanted to pay. br /> <br /> I understand that I am slowly getting older because the days are going fast, but I believe I will hold my hand in the culture of the younger generation. I listened to rap and R&B growth, but the "Immature" group never did it for a cassette or a CD player. Why? I think they never had one of the following, but it would probably be useful for Director Chris Stokes to lead them in his new House Party movie. Did anyone in any of the studios think that it was pretty fast in red? Or how would Stokes himself play a comedy car repair job, like a director with no sense of comic timing, because that is the only possible source of humor. It was one of those few cases when I actually stayed between Robin Harris and I never thought I'd said a movie. Outside the leading role playing band, I also thought that the rest of the light would continue to suck the life of this movie. Uncle Charles was annoying when he tried humor. Kim Whitely was completely lost in his scenes (literally as well as figuratively) while ?? well? all others pretty much fall into this category. <br /> <br /> Where did Chris Stokes spend most of his budget? Not for the stars of special guests, because even though this film may be somewhat proud, there was no "unforgettable" House Party presence or any dream that might have a Kid or Play one final look. House Party 4 did not follow any preset that eventually destroyed this feature from the foundation. Could anyone explain to me why it was necessary to use a "escaped murderer who happened to be a licensed taxi driver" to humor? Stokes reached the bottom of the barrel deep and produced more emissions than the substance. Because once I can admit that there is no redemption value for this film. House Party 4 mattis series, and although I hear there may be more, I only hope that Hollywood realizes that this series is dead. Hollywood must end this series, forget the past and move on in the future. I think the sequel is Who is the man? get them in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Rating: * Off *****
