I was so "impressed" with Tim Kincaid's MUTANT HUNT that I tried it. Of course, this is an apocalypse in the near future. A migrating fighter named Neo (no, not that Neo!) Joins like-minded fighters to challenge the blind and his constant Valencia. Along the way, they come in contact with mutants, crazy women, sewer, big spider and some tricks with robots. The Lord! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ROBOT HOLOCAUST is barely up (or down) to HUNT level. For white 79-minute clocks (box 90), this is one of the cheap clips. The sets have all the intricate shapes of the carnival's haunt house, and the costumes prove that everyone, like John Travolta, will dress in STAYING ALIVE in the final dance number in the near future. The atom wilderness is a combination of old buildings and the Central Park. The headquarters of Dark One is The Power Station and looks like a power station. The actor is universally bad, except for Angelika Jager as evil Valaria. Jager has a healthy bad level. Vit er a sick Cherman accent, he gives such an incredibly bad result that this is the only reason to recommend this movie. He also offers the only nudity in the movie into the funfair chamber. Ed French again provides robot effects, but they are not nearly as slippery as his work on MUTANT HUNT.
