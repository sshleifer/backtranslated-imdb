It's always the worst movie ever. This film did not study or think at all. Action scenes were thrown at random intervals that were not meaningful in the context of the film. Items appeared and disappeared randomly, etc. It is obvious that it was led by a "stunt coordinator" who should go back to his old job. Skeleton Man rode a horse during the movie, which can change the color of the color amazingly. Did that or anyone think that everyone would be colorful and not noticed. Blood would be actors at one scene and next, miraculously disappeared and then again. It seems that everyone involved in this film forgot to check the contradictions.
