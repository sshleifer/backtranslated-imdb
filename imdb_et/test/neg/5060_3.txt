After six years of previous writing and production, Luc Besson returns to the board of directors with Angel-A. I'm a big fan of Léon and I liked the prospect of a black-and-white French movie from the same body. <br /> <br /> André is a liar and gambling addict whose money is on almost every loan in Paris. He can't repay his debts and stick to the edge of the Eiffel Tower because he decides to kill. He does it at the same time a mysterious woman who decides to save. He decided to thank him, he would help him improve his life. <br /> <br /> The film starts with some laughter that goes well. Visuals are pretty nice and work well with Paris attractions. But that's it. That's all the film has done for it. And these two facets cannot do anything to keep the frightening movie that triggers the movie. Although I can't hurt the protagonist (his contradictions are still close), this name is ultimate. Terrible screen presence and bitter annoying. The plot is ridiculously contradictory itself and sometimes odd, especially the end; the end that completely blew the fresh redemption that occurred just before the scene. Maybe the more ridiculous scene I've been attentive to, it's silly, tender, melodramatic, and far too terrible to be "so bad it's funny". The film's general assumption could sometimes have been potential, but it has been brutally killed by its infinitely horrible implementation of ideas. The film was really a task to look at, and one that was screaming on the screen all the way. <br /> <br /> Big and immeasurable mistakes, Angel-A is just bad. Although this occasionally entertaining dialogue brings out chortle at rare intervals, it is finally clear that this film is nothing but contradictory.
