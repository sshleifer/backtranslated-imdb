First of all, this film is serious that it is disturbing. I really didn't want to see all the scenes where people live, etc. The strange erotic introduction gives one hour of necrophilic wonder. This is personally imperfect for me. But the movie really works on this and it should be scary, so I'll give it credit for it. Yes, some points on these scalpels and .... well, the damaging thought of keeping alive. <br /> <br /> But what this film lacks is an interesting plot, characterization, or real surprises. The whole teen-flick horror genre usually goes in a very simple, predictable way. A lot of "tense" moments, crazy men who are crazy, and a big question about everything: is the boy a murderer? This movie fits into the category "Scream" and countless others that were born in the 90's. Well, I don't break it for you, but it's not exactly interesting to be a killer. We can find out who it is half way ... and from there, the movie speaks, trying to accomplish some time ... rather boring. I watched this movie a little while. <br /> <br /> The leader actor is great, as usual, but the box in the box he has placed makes one effort ... a college girl who is a detective who all thinks it's crazy, but she's is the one who really knows what is going on. And the cops? Ahhh, they just laugh and eat donuts. Very predictable, flat, sometimes disturbing and above all boring and boring ... It's like an American film company flew to Germany to make a movie to make it foreign ..... hmmm ..... or were they? <br /> <br />
