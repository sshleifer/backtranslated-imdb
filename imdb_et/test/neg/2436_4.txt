This movie plays like the English version of ABC after the school's special nudity. This makes you think who should be the target group. It's not like writers are too committed to selling a credible plot. Although it has some traceability, virtual sexuality is more fluffy than dandelion. It's a good movie to see if you're snow, cable, and it's the only tape you have.
