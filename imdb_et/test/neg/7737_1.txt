Like a local Chinese, I cannot accept such an idea that some people have to die for a "better world". I said "better world" because it is wrong that the Chinese people have been indoctrinated for thousands of years! <br /> <br /> I think most western audiences may not know Qin Shihuang (meaning the first emperor), the king of this film is the most famous tyrant of ancient China. Tianxia (the Chinese word was spoken by the king, "land and people"), which is spoken of in his mouth, is totally wrong. Since then, the same king of China's king said the same thing, but very few of them did what they said. <br /> <br /> Another fact is that the Qin Shihuang empire only lasted about twenty years before it was destroyed by humans. <br /> <br /> Well, I like the beautiful scenes of this movie, but it can't take me to the idea that people should die for a tyrant.
