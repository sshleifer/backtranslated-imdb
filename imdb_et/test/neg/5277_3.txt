This movie is very bad. Kevin Spacey is really a big actor, he seems to be in LA, American beauty, conventional suspicions, 7, etc. But it's really garbage, he didn't get anywhere close to a decent Irish accent, maybe he should have practiced it with Kate Hudson when he was working with Adam. For the Irish people, this film is ridiculous and even worse, it is quite irritating for several scenes. I think the producers made this film, hoping that the target group (non-European) would never have seen or heard the "general" or Martin Cahill and was fascinated by an intriguing and amusing story. Total crud!
