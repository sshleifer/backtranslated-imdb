The only thing that is more holes than the premise of this movie is its script. Flatliners is the perfect show for Joel Schumacher's famous, terrible lack of talent. The plot is completely illogical, but super fake and everything is artistic in one inch of your life in the most climatic, overheated way. I love how the med school dissection space is the crazy vaulted marble-bed that is red-lit and has large Rembrandt paintings on the walls. I love how Keifer Sutherland leads the canvas army jeep. Some of Joel Schumacher's films don't live exclusive. It is always an alternative universe, where everyone is young and painfully hips, but tend to rigorously and obsessively according to the inadequate middle-aged billionaire human-child idea of ​​the hip. And holy mess! The part where Baldwin's brother # 16 dies and lives back and worships all the women with whom he sleeps, who's "I call you" and "I just need space" is the most fun thing. universe !!!! What kind of world do we live in, where Joel Schumacher can keep people throwing money? "Flatliners" made me look for all the man's creations only on the high quality yuks contained therein.
