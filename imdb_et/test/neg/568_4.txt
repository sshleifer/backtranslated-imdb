A really funny story with the good actors of the idea, but it is somehow missed. Participants are older, but none of them seemed particularly good. They needed better formation, photography or something. It should be a love story, and yet the film had a more rough look on the street movie. I liked it, but I think the performances were quite boring. Then the weakness of the director is shown. Perhaps, under Spielberg's guidance, it would have been led by a much better film.
