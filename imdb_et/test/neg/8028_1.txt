<br /> <br /> I rented this movie on June 20, 2001, and watched it for about 45 minutes. I concluded that viewing a blank screen would be comparable. There were no people poured out for whom I would tear when hell itself had opened and swallowed all their heap. <br /> <br /> So I sent all my friends and relatives warn them and I'll take the time to invite everyone who sees this comment to this movie like a plague! I've seen very bad movies in my time, but NEVER as bad as this.
