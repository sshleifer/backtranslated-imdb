I hadn't heard of a soap girl, but I saw a movie poster outside the theater with a five-star review, so I thought how bad it might be? Well, I found it soon. My God, this movie was terrible. The most wooded exhibitions I've ever seen outside a porn file. Absolutely tortuous dialogue. I just don't understand how it's done and why someone agrees with that part. And I find it completely incomprehensible that it was actually shown in the theater and the money was seen to see it. How did this happen ????? And most importantly, WHAT IS THE FOLLOWING THROUGH THE FILM?!?!?!?!
