Coen Brothers-wannabe writer-director Paul Chart relies too much on ideas raised from other (better) films, but can create a creepy atmosphere that keeps one view. Robert Forster cuts off like never before when he plays a psychopathic psychiatrist (ha ha) who goes to the desert for killing. The film is unusual, but trying to keep one step ahead of the audience, it becomes alienation and abandonment (the role of Amanda Plummer, who is completely humiliating). Probably the bravura finale, many small bits of business - and Forster excellently naked - makes it curious. Produced by veteran film director Irvin Kershner and maybe it should also be run (could Paul Chart be a pseudonym?). * 1/2 from ****
