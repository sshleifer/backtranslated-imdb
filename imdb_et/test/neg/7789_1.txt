It was only the second version of Charles Dickens' classic story I saw, and unfortunately it turned out to be the worst. The movie opens with a fast live performance, where Simon Callow as Charles Dickens begins the Christmas song story and then probably goes for an animated story. You probably already know this, Ebenezer Scrooge is a fickle cold bloody businessman who refuses to charity and hates Christmas. He visits Jacob Marley (Nicolas Cage), who warns him of the remaining three Christmas Borders (Jane Horrocks), presence (Sir Michael Gambon) and silent future / coming visits. After all, he probably understands the true magic of Christmas and promises to be nicer in the future. The only change I noticed was Scrooge, who had mice friends (stupid thought), former Scrooge love of Belle (Kate Winslet), who had to see her in the orphanage, showing the two children. want "and" ignorance ", Scrooge still gets worshiped after she's nice, and she's worried that she can't keep her promise nice, and starring Rhys Ifans as Bob Cratch, Juliet Stevenson as Ms. Cratch, Iain Jones Scrooge's nephew Fred and Colin McFarlane as Fezziwig. Animation is not good quality, the actors have wasted their voice on worthless garbage. The only good thing about this movie is the good voice of Kate Winslet, the song "What If", as well as the rest, this is just amazingly terrible.
