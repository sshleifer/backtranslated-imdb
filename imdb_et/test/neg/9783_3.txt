"Luu Snatcher" begins with the use of an extremely promising new and original invisibility to the evil, as well as the extremely insulated film scene of the African desert. In the control of the pipelines in the desert, seemingly unnatural beings are attacked and killed by three miners who eat their meat and leave only a bunch of bifurcated bones. An expedition team deployed to rescue them finds that the monster is a highly mutated ant-queen and quite soon they will find themselves in a surprised desert. Director Jason Wulfsohn maintains a respectable tension until the monster is identified. Immediately thereafter, the film quickly becomes a normal creature function, with all characters dropped one by one from the survival race. The other side of "Bone Snatcher" is unendurably boring; with inevitable love story clich√©s and the absence of complete murder breaches. Characters are all insecure stereotypes that work and say exactly what you predict several minutes in advance. There is a beginner who has to prove himself a female with brain power, except for his hot-looking, unpleasant, experienced man who himself sacrifices himself and? last but not least? who could forget to check out a black man who refers to a monster using all kinds of voodoo names. Wulfsohn tries to point out his monster too hard, like the "Alien" and "Predator" outdoor space. Antenna-creature has infrared vision and crumbles when struck by him. The film only benefits from its unique setting and a handful of unpleasant images of broken bodies. It could have been a modest pearl, but it is less mediocre. Avoid.
