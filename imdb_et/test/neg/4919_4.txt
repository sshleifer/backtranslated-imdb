"The New Generation" is the third entry of Amityville based on the plot by writer John G. Jones, assuming it is sent from Long Island House, which causes spectral misery and death for new owners. First, the lamp, then the clock and now the mirror. But it is also the first in Amityville, because it is The Possession to directly associate the real events that started with the entire series. This time, artist Keyes Terry (Robert Partridge) gives the homeless men one day a spooky-looking mirror. Soon the people around him would die, eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror hung in the Amityville house - indeed at night, Franklin Bronner (Sonny Montelli in Amityville II) murdered his entire family. Unfortunately for Terry his discovery of his mirror is not entirely accidental, and he learns the truth about his past, which he has buried since childhood. <br /> <br /> This 7th installment of the often worn franchise is disappointing to me. Things started foolishly and unevenly, but "fun is the time" to handle it, and considering how much this film is trying to build on the roots - not on the first episode, but on the source material - it should have been better than it was. But at least three trips to the same Amityville house with the same bad artefact, which has yet another explanation for the malignant paranormal visits, do well. One of the biggest weaknesses of the Amityville franchise is the firm decision of every manufacturer to ignore all other series. On the one hand, it is perfectly reasonable that they do not want to be connected with the continuity of someone else, but at least they could admit the story already done and just not * repeat them again and again *. <br /> <br /> There is also something that tells us how the story comes out, undoubtedly due to the inevitability that this repetitionfest brings. Since you already know what is going on, careful pace building is just slow and annoying. Or maybe it's just annoying. The director John Murlowski would probably have done more to enhance the mirror's tense atmosphere, not just the red color and rush the funny "evil" voices that lack any nuance. There were times when characters seemed quite unequal to their other worlds. If they don't take it too seriously, why should we do that? <br /> <br /> What a shame, because the "new generation" is more than capable. I had to watch it until I saw the credit name "Julia Nickson". He hit my attention just as he always did, and when I was upset, his part wasn't even bigger. Terry O'Quinn was equally charismatic and unused again. Partridge himself in the lead is clearly suited to the type of hero hero with overcrowded forest industry shirts in the early 1990s, and although I am not sure he really gave him the necessary gravity, it is not the way Ibsen performs here. /> <br /> Sets also deserve to be mentioned in the dramatic art of performing Suki's space on claustrophobic corridors, characterized by inverted / supernatural sequences. The appearance of these rights is particularly important given that certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulate fragmented memories. It is clear that Murlowski is a visual director rather than an actor or a horror actor. Unfortunately, this is a horror movie. <br /> <br /> "The New Generation" sees the same competition four years after the third time. Add to it the lack of direction it really needs, and the whole effort will not be as high as it should. However, its strong links with the source material and some good participants must be acknowledged, not necessarily their best lessons. To be honest, it is the ideal person to have not seen any of the "The Possession", for which the story is not so much a deja-vu trip.
