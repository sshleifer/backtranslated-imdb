Is there anything else on earth that would be more tempting than learning what awaits our vulnerable bodies after death. Spanish director Ignacio Cerdà (soulmate of his German colleague Jörg Buttgereit) is opposed to our curiosity and invites us to an exciting journey in the world of preparation tables, scalpels, surgical saws, human internal and twisted minds <br /> <br /> Welcome to the Gap Space! <br /> <br /> I do not know which aspects of the film, beyond this notorious reputation, may have helped him to obtain a high rating. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple and straightforward - a day in a difficult coroner (or maybe an auxiliary pathologist, or whatever it is) that is routinely sick of its psychological tension in a non-traditional way in the workplace. I'm amazed at what specific messages the authors attempted to deliver with a single note plot. I suspect that this may be somehow inspired by the characteristic behavior of Udo Kier in Andy Warhol Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> The artistic values ​​of the film are also questionable. It's hard to judge the performance of actors who don't hit a single word. Their emotions are hidden behind medical masks. Also, there is not enough room for excellent camera work - basically, all the activities open up within four walls. <br /> <br /> Authenticity - effects and makeup are impressive, and the setup looks very plausible, but only a few medical / forensic experts can decide how the dissection made here (if someone cares) is true and anatomically correct. To be honest, I thought that autopsy would be done to investigate the state of certain organs and determine the cause of death. Now I know that the bodies are cut off, raped and humiliated, the guts are hanged, the brains are taken from the head, filled into the stomach and mixed with the intestine, then the body is sewn back and washed - something personal. And what are the poor guys who should write their deceptive autopsy reports later? <br /> <br /> Shock and Nasty Factor - It is very unlikely that an unsuspecting viewer will discover with his horror that the disc he was going to watch next to his Christmas tree with his wife and children turns out to be a graphical manual for the video network. This hidden object is hardly available, sought by people who are well versed in this area and are not easily offended. So it would be pointless to warn anyone to sabotage this movie. They are well aware of what they are looking at and what they want to see. <br /> <br /> Cerdà is a truly talented and stylish director that is clearly evident in at least two other "trilogy" sections - before "Wake Up", an amazing black and white short and 30-minute "Genesis", a visually stunning and spirited piece, with an off-beat and interesting concept. And I'm pretty sure that one day, he will conquer the hearts of the new conquerors with large-scale orientation. And sooner or later "Aftermath" would become a rare collector for his "early" "heating". <br /> <br /> But in the meantime, I am afraid that it can be strongly recommended for medical students or professionals who study mental disorders and sexual abnormalities.
