When I discovered there was a Christmas holiday 2, I couldn't wait to buy a DVD. I sent out my money and watched it as soon as it came in through the mailbox. I love all the national lights where Chevy is pursuing, and I think he was glad he wasn't here! I could not believe how bad it was, you think it would be impossible not to laugh at the national lampoon movie, but believe me! . This film seemed to be a good idea on paper, whose main character was Cousin Eddie, he started to get out of his nerves at the beginning of the movie and by the middle of the movie he became a movie and at the end of the movie I was dead brain and didn't remember what happened! .
