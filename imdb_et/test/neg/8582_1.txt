I've always found that Man Ray and his artistic efforts are deeply pretentious and I have never understood why his work attracts so much attention. In addition to his Rayograph (which he discovered in an accident and just being in direct contact with photos), it seems that his real contribution to culture seems to be the first photographer to portray a woman's nudity in a way that is accepted as art rather than porn. But it certainly had to happen, and there is no real reason why Ray deserves credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the Emperor's new clothing story. <br /> <br /> "L'Etoile de merde" ... silver, "de mer" ... contains a lot of blurred photos and a repetitive visual theme of a starfish that is never explained. Starfishes has an exciting ability to regenerate lost limbs - and even restore the entire duplicating body - but if it has anything to do with this movie theme, Ray will leave it untold. I was much more impressed with the title cards of this film, which (in French) can add a carcass, a bra ("Si belle, Cybele") and some portmanteaux. <br /> <br /> Like Ray often works, this movie is really a beautiful young woman. Unfortunately, photography (to a large extent) is so blurred that we have little chance to evaluate it. I appreciate this crap out of 10 points.
