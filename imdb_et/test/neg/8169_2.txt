Watching "Baghbani" is the equivalent of a movie that tries to eat taffy in the seawater for about three hours. This Indian film is a sticky sweet, sentimental soap opera that begins as "King Lear", moves in the middle of "Romeo and Juliet", then drives back to "King Lear" for its teardrop final. br /> <br /> Raj Malhotra is a bank accountant who seems to have everything a person might want to leave out of life: a woman who loves her, a family that loves her, and the work she does after a retiring service lifetime. Although Raj and his wife Pooja have been married for 40 years and have four grown sons, they still have a couple of love that struck newborns, peeling and sighing, beating eyes against each other, and whispering sweet dolls to each other's ears almost to nausea. In fact, the whole bloody heap is so happy, loving and harmonious that Von Trapps looks like a functional family. Parents and children joking together, laughing together, even working together choreographically, "spontaneous" song and dance numbers (like many Bollywood productions, "Baghban" has a lot of confusing drama, in this case too many musical sequences). <br /> <br /> Anyone who speaks about storytelling at all is aware that such unsuccessful bliss must not be punished for a long time, and that all of this joy is just some of the terrible disasters that had to come to the heads of our unsuspecting prayers. Knowing this, we spend the first hour of the film on a terrifying expectation, asking what form this disaster will take when it finally arrives. The thunderstorm is about an hour into the film when Raj informs her children that she and their mother have decided to move with one of their families, leaving them the choice of children and their spouses. Suddenly, like King Lear, who discovered the hidden vipers in the family, Raj explains that his children are not quite as loving, self-secretive, and eager to live with their parents as he originally thought. Understandably, the prospects that the children, in order to fool their parents' plan, come out of a scheme in which Raj lives with his children, Pooja lives with another; they will turn off until finally every child has had the opportunity to host both parents and the cycle will repeat itself to infinity. A lot of the child's fear, parents join the plan, though both are deeply in love with each other and have never spent time. Thus, the second and third parts of the two aging (though married) are spent by the retreating lovers, while their grateful, unknown little brats do everything in their power to let their parents understand how they don't want to be one of the main problems in "Bagh" is that he has no fineness in both his storytelling and direction. The love Ray and Pooja feel to each other, as well as the close proximity of the family unit, is placed so thick in the first hour that the film almost collects in the weight of sentimentality. Then, practically without any warning, the scenario turns into a dime and makes children nervous, self-centered monsters, and older passive, brightness victims. Raj and Pooja are too long in their teeth and a little too self-dependent to make a dreamy eye, disgusting, irregular love a bit more suitable for beloved school students than the parents of four grown children. The style of the purple process, in which every emotion is underlined and highlighted, leads to intense distraction and strong dependence on impact images and melodramatic music. The musical number has a certain amount of joy to be released at first, but they continue for so long and so often they lose their effectiveness and only serve the material as uneven proportions. This swollen production can be abandoned for at least a full hour without any noticeable damage - and quite good. There really is no reason to punish this movie for three hours. The most intimidating is the seemingly endless bell that we have ended, a speech where Raj (who has somehow managed to turn his experience into an award-winning bestseller) reads to us at least ten minutes at least for the tenets of parent / child relationship. <br /> <br /> "Baghban" has a delicate, messy saga filled with more sugar and a goot than a "Size" chocolate box. Try it at your own risk.
