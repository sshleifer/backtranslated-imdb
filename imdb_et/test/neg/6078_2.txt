Let me start with a personal note like a movie and a TV, enjoying more life: I love what James Woods can and has done, and I always love Melanie Griffith and Natasha Wagner was a very unhappy, smelly "real crime" essay in this horror. <br /> <br /> Whoever actually wrote this film probably spent some time talking to real criminals with real criminal talents: yes, some thieves are junkies, but they have a very short career as thieves. Truly successful thieves are rarely caught because they do not make any drugs or drugs before attack. <br /> <br /> The James Woods character at the beginning of this film was true to this paradigm and then the script was completely broken. He becomes a stupid, alcoholic terrible .... nice job, for example, a high-level man like Woods, but not the least plausible. <br /> <br /> Most criminals are lazy. If they wanted to work, these people would work. The people in the movie are beautiful, self-conscious, narcotic narcotic losers. They couldn't pull the real result in the real world, in a real world where a big and plump security guard who wins a lively baby of hell (as happens in the "DOG" early scenes). bang and don't let him up. Anyway. <br /> <br /> How many ways do I hate this movie? Much. Even completely vulgar people - like most theft hijackers and junkies - have bigger words than cretins. And "hanging" scenes with neo-Nazi cyclists? Talk. All rednecks are not neo-Nazis and those who are neo-Nazi speed dealers are just not so stupid! <br /> <br /> This movie served two because Natasha Wagner was very good at her role because Melanie Griffith still has something "special", or at least she was for this brutal and offensive film. For some reason I do not want to sing the praise of true criminals, but the reality of these criminal films is that they are all dead or in prison under Act No. 2, Scene 1. be better time to spend than this .... thing ... and i hate zombies.
