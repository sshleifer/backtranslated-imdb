Not good. Mostly because you don't give the fuck what happens to all these people. Some comments: 1. I'm tired of seeing that governors who never speak to their pupils never teach them, nor the tired and annoying gaze, if that student, who of course has won in four seconds, says something 2. Well, so Rosin's father is complicated and that's why he's attracted to his employer. But Charles is completely different from his father in all aspects - if something Henry is much closer than a sensual, exalted person. 3. How could you ever believe he would be more interested in Tom Wilkinson than Rhys Meyer. 4. Difficult to believe if he was really raised as a deeply religious girl, so he would be so reckless as he sleeps with the Gentile after 5 minutes of knowing. <br /> <br /> Some good things about this movie: at least she didn't get pregnant without knowing who the father was ... The whole description of the life of the Jewish community in London is good
