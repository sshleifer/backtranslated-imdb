Experienced professionals live in an exotic and dangerous place. They break every night. They smuggle opium. They fall into the parachutes of pigs. They are flying in an impossible situation. They dress strangely and prefer to act. They are iconic, outrageous. They violate any rule of the law and burn their employers in the CIA. They are indispensable. <br /> <br /> No. It's not "Only angels are wings" and it's not "M * A * S * H". It is an uncomfortable blend of the two, which unfortunately is as stupid as funny. <br /> <br /> It aims at shock, amusement and education but does not really achieve its goals. <br /> <br /> As for the value of the shock, we have now entered, isn't it? Does it really shock anyone in the 1970s to go to Laos with mysterious missions? No, it's not shocking. In the current circumstances, it is not even an education if it is interesting to know that some paramilitary excursions are NOT buried in a file called National Interest, Defense de Toucher. That's okay. So we're a little smarter and no longer as shocking or as stupid. <br /> <br /> In this case, the problem is that the film depends on what features are able to entertain. Without it, the film will seep. The Cat House is home to dirty drunken CIA pilots dancing girls, shooting the lights with a muted gun and killing lizards. Asking Newbie Pilot Robert Downey, Jr .: "If you guys do, it means there's something to celebrate?" Answer the second, worshiping, "No, that means it's at night." It might be funny if we expected the renegade pilots to be as upright as the rest of us. If we don't, the gag, like the film, will fall flat. <br /> <br /> Of course there are activities. Everything that can happen during a flight or on an airplane is done in flight or on the plane. People fall out of them, the luggage is accidentally thrown out of their hatches, the engines fail, they carry AAA damage, break down during the crash, but we've seen it mostly elsewhere, often better. <br /> Some may find it more funny than me and the actress are pretty good. Robert Downey Jr is a particularly effective straight man. See other reviews and if they describe a movie that may be attractive, always look at it. There may be some laughs that escaped me.
