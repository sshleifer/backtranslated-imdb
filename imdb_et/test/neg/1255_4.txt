Wow, I just saw one of the biggest poker tragedies and I'm not talking about the premature death of a big stu ungar. This movie, which I am sorry to say, was terrible. Absolutely terrible. A true tragedy in the history of filming. Maybe I'm a little tough, but if you have no interest in stu ungar's life, don't even consider it close. And those with an interest in their lives find that most parts are trivialized and made a great novelty scene. I watched it because of Stu UNGAR, but I almost wanted to stop myself when he saw this 4-star effort but watching it was a nuisance
