This P. S. was suggested to me by two friends who are excellent in <br /> <br /> (similar to me) tasting movies and have seen more than anyone I know. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what they saw in this movie. Sadistic, cruel and disgusting in the entertainment movie is good, but it is an endeavor of the windbreakers that is trying to crowd out when it is a low-key film making. <br /> <br /> The old generation clich√© "no social value redemption" comes to mind. Bill Pullman tries, maybe a little hard, and except for the boy, the rest of the actor seems to be self-conscious and confident in the flat. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and see "In Cold Blood" and "The Hitcher". <br /> <br /> As someone said, it would never have been done if Jennifer Lynch was not an overestimated daughter of David Lynch.
