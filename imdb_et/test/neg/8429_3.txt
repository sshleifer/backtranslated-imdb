"Disappointment" is the best word you could think of for this movie, especially considering the glowing overview from another user. <br /> <br /> One thing that actually violates a movie is that it is disgracefully partial (both words feel). Not only does it contain a very selective description of the games (focusing on the US athletics team), but also contains a number of inaccuracies, most of which are exaggerated difficulties that the US team faces. <br /> <br /> Even more worrying is that all exclusions and errors (?) appear in US sporting events by excluding other athletes (with some marked exceptions). For example, the viewer may believe that the US won most of the medals in games when they actually won only one of four gold medals and one in 6. Similarly, many athletes are depicted as caricatures of Estonians against them (so we have a lofty French and wine-breaking French). This attitude serves very little the Olympic ideals that the film should celebrate. <br /> <br /> All in all, I believe that this film is turning to the part of the US that is looking for a quick boost to the country's self-esteem. Those looking for a detailed and historically correct description of the games are recommended to search elsewhere.
