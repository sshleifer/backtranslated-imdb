Perhaps this is just the format of the film, the documentary, but I believe that the film would have been much better served by good players and stronger dialogue. The fact that the participants are also business owners is a two-edged sword. They know better than anyone else the emotions and complexities of these entrepreneurs, but because they are not professional actors, they do a very bad job of communicating their emotions and the documentary suffers. There were a lot of really memorable scenes in this movie, and many good features, but they were so bad that they disappear over time and the only memory I have with this documentary is that it had some good scenes I can't remember. <br /> <br /> See if you want a .com account bust account and see what happened to 99% of industry people who didn't become direct millionaires. However, some threatening camera works, bad actions, bad dialogue and a general bad film that represents the age of the Internet boom have to be prepared.
