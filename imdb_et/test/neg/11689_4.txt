To begin with, I met the director when he went to WW2 with a periodic film camera and made videos of events that saw DARNED good. I really want him to have it. Because as much as I praise what he clearly achieved "next to something" from the budget when I came out of the DVD, I just wondered why I was sitting for almost two hours. There is no real plot to talk about, you don't really care about what happens to cases (maybe Italian troops and some Germans), and the end is another commentary on "the art of film" about the negligence of war. I could have told someone how it would end when I got through the first ten minutes. Ask the Germans to heroically volunteer to fight death, I knew most of Quartmaster's geographical indications were killed, it was just too beautiful! And while I'm on this subject, I was shocked to see so much about Axis, but the GI party did it comically. The evolution of all character was clearly for non-English speaking roles. GI's just filming hard. And I can't help but don't know if they even have someone who understood how the US Army works? Phrases, terminology, activities are clearly written by someone who did not have the knowledge of the American military at all. If I knew now who directed the film, I would have sworn that it was directed and written by German.
