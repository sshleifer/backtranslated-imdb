The group of four young men who attended a prestigious private school belongs to the old treaty formed by their ancestors during the late 1700s. They all have the ability to use them forever, and they suspect that the new boyfriend of the academy might be a family who had probably died a long time ago. This new boy wants everyone to have power. <br /> <br /> This is not a horror movie as it tries to show itself. Yes, there is magic and all the supernatural things, but it's really just an action movie. Very mediocre action movie. Focusing almost exclusively on cooling and slippery, and paying only little attention to the plot, which unfortunately has a lot of unused space for interesting twists. But none of them were put on, and even before the movie is over half, you'll know what's being played and who. <br /> <br /> Here and there are some good scenes, especially an explosive car that has been magically reconstructed after a collision with a big rig, but that's it. What's even worse is that director Renny Harlin, who has very fun, if not smart, movies, relies heavily on metal music and a too sexy tone to carry this film and make it a pretty obviously frightening movie from the catastrophic "Alone." in the dark. " It's not as bad as "alone in the dark", because a few slippery scenes are really slippery and not ridiculously incompetent, but ultimately this film is the most promising and cozy home in the late night cable. Estimated PG-13: Violent Activity
