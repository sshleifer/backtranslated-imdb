Despite decades of tax breaks, the Canadian film industry is still lagging behind in most of the Central African and Islamic countries in terms of international visibility (surprisingly few Canadian films appear on their shores) and Nouvelle-France, or Brave's Battle, is another example. why. More than any other country, the Canadian cinema does not seem to be able to develop its identity and has remained a poor imitation of the failures of other countries. On paper, this historic drama can be vaguely promising. Canadian history is certainly a rich wine of untapped material, because French and English fought over and bought and sold the colony, although none of them do cut here if you don't read the odd-and-sa-miss-this scene characters that say that "Wolfe is dead" or "Nouvelle-France is no longer" before you return to soap operations. But although this is not a lesson in history, it is not a drama or an epic adventure promised by the new title: there is no battle in the movie if you do not read the 10-second bombardment by a ten transformer and one stall. The city square that we all see from Quebec is a fairly obvious, firmly lit studio interior that gives many scenes to the old TV mini series, as well as the reluctance of director Jean Beaudin to offer a long frame or even an exterior. What you get for your money is simple, but pulled out of Harlequin's romantic losers who are constantly separated from events outside their control, where the biggest surprise is that Fabio does not come to pain. This is a movie where two characters make the creation of two beasts, supporting the camera pans for a comfortable relaxing fireplace or waterfall. <br /> <br /> Anglo-Canadian-French co-production, which does not bring together as many warring states as any country with a nice taxi-stunt, this massive box-office disaster was supposed to be the Canadian Titanic - although no one gave Producers say they meant a movie, not a ship - but it turns out to be a revolution that has been made cheaply without the battle scenes, crowds or some moments that threaten to work in the short term with great probability. The Montreal mirror described it as "so bad that it can't even be found." It is quite unfair, because while most of his working hours see the film under the 80s ministries, the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny, the characters randomly place their feet in the traps of the bear, the foolish spouses who say, "You can never see your beautiful lover again, cuckold au! You pay for it, both! "and our hero, who is accused of murder and - throws! - sorcery in a trial that is funny enough to have been in Demi Moore's Scarlet Letter version. At the end of the year, caddish British governors, indigenous slaves and Celine Dion sing and you have something that sometimes it seems like a movie that Timbo Hines wanted (and still could be left wild) with its legendary failed World of War version, though without technical incompetence. <br /> <br /> Diversity of David La Haye seems to be limited with the number of other actors he can see in the film: he looks like Andy Garcia, briefly takes the look of the Al Pacino revolution, flirting with the purely shaved Tch√©ky Karyo style before he becomes the younger Ted Danson in his character age. his father's death news, an expression that looks like he is expecting the director to tell him he can go home, promises he is now a bad show party, in fact he gives the impression of a more mediocre actor who has succeeded in the lead in the last minute than the one who was initially cast, read the script and rescued. She shows willingness and gives her away, but the part she needs is not just there. Billie Piper's inexperienced lady, Noemie Godin-Vigneau, does not specify the light of the screen, despite being in the middle of a peasant girl kidnapped by Vincent Pere's corrupt and perverted intendant Le Big (which is actually the name of a character), double haired drunk drunk Sebastien Huberdeau and the saddest Gerard Depardieu bed revolutionary messy old priest in the mankind gray-haired wig. It is really a sad vision to see once upon a big actor on the absolute stone base of his game, when he interferes with movements that look like he has not just lost the will to act, but the will to live with it. He couldn't obviously interfere with the English dubbing session (or even a couple of long frames where he was very much doubled). It is a little wonder that he talked about retirement at the time of the short release of the film. <br /> <br /> Some short comics offer Jason Isaacs in his default Patriot mode, which surpassed Quebec's Wolfe, rather than the asthmatic bunker played by Alf Garnett / Archie Timothy Dalton, while Tim Roth's William Pitt stands aside occasionally confused with a smile placed in a pretty hotel with excellent room service and plenty of holidays, though like Colm Meaney Benjamin Franklin, who they are both on the film for less than three minutes. (Voltaire and Madame Pompadour also put a couple of minutes around the door, but can't impress, comic or otherwise.) Supporting actors are generally better: Juliette Gosselin and Bianca Gervais as heroine real and accepted daughters and amazingly beautiful Irene Jacob who is looking for all over the world like young fanny ardant, all are refreshingly good and deserve much better.
