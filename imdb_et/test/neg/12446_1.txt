Wow, this movie really suck under the usual scale of boring, boring and unimaginable movies I've seen recently. The action was bad and robotic. The story was so cute that it could have summed it up in a simple 5 minute short time. The sound was so poor and dirty that it was even hard to listen; maybe it's the camera that it was taken off? I'm not sure which of the 3 glowing reviewers you commented on, but it wasn't. Perhaps the director was able to see that his film had a good overview, at least before the emergence of real reviews. <br /> <br /> Save time or just waste your time and money on this movie. Absolute sucking!
