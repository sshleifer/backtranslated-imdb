Less than two hundred and fifty years ago, the last great pirate wrote his names in the blood and all over the maritime history. This is the story of a buccaneer captain whose name in a short year hit a terrorist in the heart of sailors and merchants from the harbors of the Caribbean shopping centers in London ..... <br /> <br /> Hmm that opening the movie sounds the way we are in one movie hell, kidnapping a movie, ripper? Well, that's not. Because it's not entirely valuable as a curio piece. From Fox of the 20th century, Philip Of Dunne & Arthur Caesar has adapted Anne Of The Indies from a brief description of Herbert Ravenel Sass. The direction is by Jacques Tourneur, the score is Franz Waxman and Harry Jackson offers Technicolor photography. Jean Peters is in the title of the title of Anne {AKA Captain Providence} and is supported by the justice of Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez & James Robertson. <br /> <br /> Originally designed to be a real life pirate, Anne Bonny, the film is ultimately the story of a woman who is seeking identity and finds herself especially in men-led piracy and sea-based Shenanigans. The film filled with glasses and familiar pieces is also cast, which is usually incorrectly installed. Peters gives him a better move and Paget enlightens the screen with effervescent beauty. Although Robertson's justice is underestimated, he actually looks and doesn't move like the rest of the male. Some reviewers have desperately sought to dig deep into the movie to find intelligence and hidden meanings, as it is the Tourneur chair. But there is no depth here, it's just a job for Tourneur, a professional but thinly drawn and actually missing swash to go with the bets on the buckle. <br /> <br /> Disposable. 4/10
