I read many great hopes from the readers of the book that it would be a faithful customization of Nora Roberts' story. Have not read the book, I do not know if this adjustment was faithful, but I know it was not good. In fact, the scenario for Nora Roberts was such a praiseworthy film. <br /> <br /> I planned and looked at Carolina Moon for Claire Forlan. I'm never sure if he's a good actor. In some films he has been decent, in other medium and very bad. But Forlan was not alone. The performances were everywhere. Oliver Hudson was wooden and boring. Josie Davis was hammy. Then, in the midst of all this B-rate, Jacqueline Bisset is! He had nothing more to do than imagine bitterness, but even talking through sleep, he was miles ahead of others. <br /> <br /> Still, Forlan is still one of the most breathtaking women in the movies, and I was not disappointed in this area. I believe Forlan can be more than an eye-candy, but until he has achieved a good result in good films, he still has a good eye on it. And I look exactly at everything he participates. Fandom is so much fun. <br /> <br /> This movie, Carolina Moon, was pretty bad. In addition to bad action (false Southern accents are really disturbing) the direction was pedestrian. It wasn't terrible. It was just a boring TV caliber that you used to see in a lifetime. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of a star, you probably enjoy Carolina Moon for the reason I did. If you are a fan of a book, you can see the story on the screen, though in a dim form. Otherwise, this movie will be unnoticeable.
