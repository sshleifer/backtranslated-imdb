Where do I start? The story was so bad, it must be written in a high school movie club! The act was so clean that I felt sorry for the actors! One actor even reminded me of what the deer must look like in the headlights of the car! Another actor is this constant appearance of constipation! But it was a dialogue that takes the cake! <br /> <br /> Our hero tells his prisoners - everyone who keeps a machine gun - if you put a finger on a female prisoner, you're dead. A moment later, the strongest guard, built like a truck, and the only prisoners who go to prison. When our fearless chief, who has this very annoying dirty gangster voice, catches this transgression wind, he walks calmly to the guard, while the machine guns are trained by him and during the second second he clicks the giant neck as he broke the tooth! Then he goes back, while all the conveyors do nothing but essentially worship him! <br /> <br /> I can go on and on! This film is the gem of the camp; And if you have some sense of humor, it is guaranteed that you laugh so hard that your eyes are tearing!
