I don't talk much about this movie because there is not much to say because there is not much to talk about. The only good thing about this movie is that our favorite characters "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" are back. Many of the bad things about this movie are that it has terrible signs, it's terrible comedy, terrible animation, and James Arnold Taylor is trying to copy a wonderful, only and only Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch. The reason for my criticism is that all the characters become something they never had and should not be, animations that have been reduced to a minimum, and finally, why should someone who made excellent voice recordings for Ob-Wan Kenobi in "Clone Wars" wants to copy Michael J. Fox? I have an answer to this. Because they are the same people who thought he had to copy Edanie Murphy from Mulan in Mulan II. Yes, unfortunately this is true. <br /> <br />
