I would never have gone out of the movie before. I felt this idea a couple of times, but this time I did it, I ended up with another movie, but I had to come back and see the end of Rage when I waited for my friends. They told me I didn't go when I went. I was generally offended by the film in such a way that it can't even be described. My bowel instinct told me to get out of the theater. It was a visceral reaction to a terrible film. At the center of the plot were the cruel actions of some understandable teenagers against vulnerable and worrying others. To ensure contrast, there was no light beam, not a resonant or pleasant person. I found that even the "good guys" movie didn't do anything to me, they were stupid, stupid, prisoners, or just ineffective. disgusting. (Not "I am easy to pull out", but more to portray humanity's abandonment). And besides the repetition of this scene, in slow motion, from so many perspectives, the other visual aspects (interesting camera work, etc.) had potential, but sometimes they just became annoying. I am a person who loves movies and tries to find good things about them. I usually find some good things that balance the film's not so good. I'm not saying that there was nothing good about this movie, but I say that no matter what it was, I can't remember it all that messed me up. I am very sorry about that too. Perhaps the best parts were the clips of the classic.
