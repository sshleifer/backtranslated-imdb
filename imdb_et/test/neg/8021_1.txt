I can say for sure that this is the worst film I've ever seen, and I usually love foreign movies. The film is nothing but badly done violent pornography. If you decide to see it, prepare yourself for endless sexism, free birth and a foolish sensational rape scene, which I am sure will be the main appeal of the film's enjoyable people. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot tends to be deliberately inclined and does not like any characters. Many scenes have been filmed from the forests surrounding the river, where girls have given a constant feeling that someone is pursuing those pathetic attempts to compensate for the lack of stories. <br /> <br /> Maybe I wouldn't have wasted my time to see the movie if it was accurately described in the comments.
