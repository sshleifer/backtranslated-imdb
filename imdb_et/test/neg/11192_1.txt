If you want a great joke of April, please ask me in every way to show this movie. However, it is important that you do not criticize the film in any way, but talk about what is an artistic triumph and how "they just don't make such great movies anymore". If your victim watches on many divorced and meaningless scenes (like a cute dog who, for an unseen reason, is punished, a cow in bed, a woman who binds legs or Jesus apparently returns to a woman), make a lot of comments, such as "shine", "side by side" or " transcendental "- while acting as if the movie was really meaningful and not a waste of one hour of your life. Be sure to keep a straight face and turn the shock when they say they don't understand it or think they have all the cowboy art. Then, to make them even more confusing, show them all the IMDb comments, because almost all (except for some distressers like almagz and rooprect) speak glowingly about what genius and artistry is this movie! By the time you do this little karate, they probably think they are idiots and meet a psychologist. <br /> <br /> This is the only reason for me to see the terrible confusion of the movie !!! That or you could show it to the Guantanamo prisoners to talk to them! <br /> <br /> When you ask me, the famous painter of the Elvis Painting Dog or Velvet is artistically higher.
