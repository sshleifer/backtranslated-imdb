Well, it removed my nerves from raw, they got this right. For the first time, I rented this movie in the 1980s when my friend opened a video store that carried all the rare films he found. She also wore all the shocks, horrors and exploits she could complain about, and I went to almost all of them. Previously I had seen Blood Feast and 2000 Maniacs and Gore Wizards. They were tough (especially during the time period) and Gore's wizard got pretty nasty. But the Gore-Gore girls were what I remember the most. <br /> <br /> I rented it on a DVD shortly ago because I wanted to hear a comment and thought it might be some cool dances and clothes. I forgot that it was done in the early 1970s, so that way it was downhill. I also realized that it was a movie that I didn't have to see more than once. It had some fun parts, but gaaaah! It was much more disgusting than I remembered. I'm very bent on the gore of the movie, but a few times I just got too big and I had to look. It wasn't a good choice for a DVD that was all crisp and clean with better sound and picture quality. The comment is partly fun and interesting (I think HG said the budget was $ 6100.00). Jr. Sorry, pal, but you're not exactly Martin Scorses himself. <br /> <br /> The extremely thin plot is related to a series of murderers topless go-go dancers in club clubs. A lovely reporter and a truly attractive private detective team (as he doesn't seem to be against him) is trying to solve the crimes. Henny Youngman has a striptease club. The amount of really ugly murders is taking place. <br /> <br /> I apologize in advance because I do not want to call that I should light up, but this film was so unsuccessful that *** me more than "Men's Company". Mainly because the main character and the extreme resistance of the director to the women - and the audience - just disappear from every frame. It's not just murders. A high-attracting detective comes out of his way of treating a female reporter like a dog hut at every opportunity, for no apparent reason (he is not exactly at risk for George Clooney as I said) and he follows him as a puppy. He despises the horribly spoiled body for seeing, and he sees him terribly, then pouring cold soda on his face to wake him up. Later he calls the police to report the crime - "No ... no hurry ... he just seems to have lost his face." This man is HERO. You can imagine how other characters are known to women. I could go ahead, but you get that idea. Note that I make this movie much more politically correct (and much more fun) than it really is. <br /> <br /> Most cast are actors you pray, never take your clothes off. not too easy eyes, so don't look at the movie to see nudity if you're not too picky. Go-go dancers look like they desperately want the end of the scene to get their $ 10 or whatever HG paid them, and get their drug repair. OK, it's not so bad, there was one dancer who looked like he could have been a prof and another cool dancer with a huge afro that didn't seem as unhappy as the rest, but still not too exciting. The only little fun things were a few moments of occasional humor, for example, when the police responsible for the crime scene were angry with anger: "Get out here before you have been arrested!" not a plethora of reporters, but to another policeman who is quietly going to work (they bump and walk down). Henny Youngman is kind of funny, though, as Lewis says, he said his lines so fast that they needed almost subtitles (I'm sure he was trying to rush all day so he could pay and bounce there, though he doesn't look like he does looking at bare chicks). <br /> <br /> It may only be worth the curiosity of the sick - since the movie was made, it was probably the most terrible time of the movie - or if you are a really big fan of HG Lewis and he finds someone exciting. Otherwise, if you have ever seen it, you have seen it and you can move on to the other nasty at the beginning of the 1970s, but a lot of fun for low budget movies ... this movie is not even close, say, "Pink Flamingos" when it comes to popcorn factor. If you've never seen a HG Lewis movie, I suggest you first try "Blood Feast," then you have a much better time. <br /> <br />
