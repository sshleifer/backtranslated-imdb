This is undoubtedly the worst film I've ever seen. And believe me, I've seen many movies. The incredible twisting of the film - an extremely bad "alien life" film, with bad performance, for a film that tries to spread Archchristian. The Day of Judgment is within reach, searching for Jesus, or burning all the eternity for the fiery debt of the hell - the message - left me stunned after 85 minutes of torture. Even religious Christians must be ashamed or furious, looking at their beliefs as such. I didn't know what to do with me when I looked at the terrible action that a 7-year-old could have done. Just nasty. I'm not a Christian or very religious. But if I had been, I would not want to be afraid of hell. Rich Christiano has shown that something is much, much worse.
