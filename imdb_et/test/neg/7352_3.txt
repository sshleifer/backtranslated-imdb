It could have been a good movie if more things were explained. Too much plot holes to enjoy. Especially the ending ends in the field. SPOILER ALERT: How did the kidnapper get back to Dundee so quickly and Dundee appeared in the house in two minutes? Get out of here. How could Anna get the money? There's no explanation. When Pete cop knew that Lancaster was in danger, why was he not a police officer at the hospital. That and many more questions remain. Too bad because the premise was there, just bad writing and filling. <br /> <br /> Good casting is lost here. DeCarlo goes bad to bad? Lancaster's character lacks development and Dureya is just a "bad man". <br /> <br /> It can re-establish a single story and better writing. Of course, it would be much more violent with lots of free and sexual sex. Also, I think editing jerky, so we leave it alone.
