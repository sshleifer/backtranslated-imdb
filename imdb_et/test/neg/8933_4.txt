"Flashdance" corresponds to "meatballs III" or perhaps it should be called "meatballs IV". This is my friend's Wesley all-time favorite movie, mainly because he still has a thing for J.V. As someone once said, "It is finer than good, but when you get older you have to branch out. Do you want it or not?" <br /> <br /> "Gimme An F" is the cinema's biggest JV cheerleader Mary Ann (played by Beth Miller) who looks like a sweet face Alicia Silverstone before her "Clueless" day. Wesley hates Miller's second film, the terrible "Teen Wolf Too", made three years later, where he plays a relaxing southern belle like Martha Smith's "Animal House". Personally, I admire Miller's choice because the two characters can't be different and he's convincing because they're both. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Mary Ann is a naive beginner from cheerleader Moline (a member of The Lucky Ducks team) who arrives at Beaverview Camp for cheerleading teaching. She is friendly with Jenna (Karen Lee Kelly), a tough girl called "The Demons". Jenna becomes Mary Anni after her main rival who doesn't like Mary Ann. <br /> <br /> Later, Mary's head will be headed by Tommy Hamilton. Tommy spends his summer wrestling dilemma on growing and moving forward, which is a problem because his only skills teach cheerleading and finish the dance routines in the shower. thing. Phoebe (Daphne Ashbrook) is Tommy's longtime girlfriend, has a well-regulated attitude and an experienced perspective. She can even tolerate Tommy's flirting with Mary Ann, believing Tommy isn't actually using a young Mary Anni. <br /> <br /> Although these four characters are strong and their relationships are a nice charm, the supportive majority is almost as weak as the material they need to work on. What a shame, if they had brought a real comic, it would have been a decent film. Jennifer Cooke plays Pam, a social climbing and endless teacher who continues to camp with the hungry owner Bucky. And there is another pair that has the thing for "Mad Max" characters. Since nothing is very funny, you will only be left with lovely half-romance and some great dance routines. <br /> <br /> Trying to get some relationship, slowly ending the final race, but if it's not your first movie experience ever, there's no doubt. And some Japanese businessmen are the story that Bucky wants to make money, but it doesn't go dramatically or comically. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
