It's a mystery to me how this film's wind was ever spread. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is horror and there is a fair share of nudity, but God, the value of this production, is the lowest I've ever seen used equipment worse than ordinary household items, everything is over lit, giving everything to an amateur appearance, bringing your thought to America's worst home video or any of this exhibition. <br /> <br /> Please, people, is it too much to ask you to make a real effort if you are expecting a 90-minute population destruction? You should have done some short projects, because it is obvious that you are a lot of amateurs! 1/10
