... copying to another language. Let's face it: Nielsen and Schwarzenegger aren't really good actors for dialogue. And given that these bearing lines should say so, this is an open-ended situation. Any kind of voice transmission is definitely an improvement (and it is actually - at least in German). <br /> <br /> But this is just a small point. Operation is bad. Accelerated combat sequences are pathetic. Nielsen couldn't use his sword to get out of a wet paper bag. It becomes painfully visible when compared to the smooth running of the sport shown by the child (which has undoubtedly been won by some martial arts training) and Sandahl Bergman. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger does his Conan thing - there's nothing new here. <br /> <br /> Some pictures are nice, I have to give it. The Dragon's skeleton bridge seems cool. But more often, the plaster is not too obvious. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie has not been viewed. Even Conan the Destroyer is better than it (though only to a small extent). I would have seen Bergman as a red Sonja when he was supposed to be, but I doubt it could have saved this movie - well. <br /> <br /> 3/10
