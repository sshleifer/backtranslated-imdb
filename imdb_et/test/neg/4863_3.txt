Would you be surprised if I told you this film was about conspiracy? No? But if I told you the driver was a shadow doll. What? You don't believe me? ... OKAY. Yeah, I did it up. It is too bad, this movie could have used a sense of humor. I understand that Charlie Sheen does this at that time - the second movie was more money - like Donald Sutherland and Linda Hamilton ... why? Don't even let me start Stephen Lang. He was as fun as Crasher's 'Hard Way' and now this junk. <br /> <br /> Ah no matter what. Anyone involved should feel ashamed. If you want to make a bad movie and succeed - it's twisted - but I doubt it was what they wanted here. Let's get out, the story smells, and we should take that yoke seriously. Do you think about whether this film even had a shine of hope. Seriously, I doubt this and the industry that is so narrow that the purses it is so green when it is first green. Perhaps even more frightening is how this dog pile reached the theaters! <br /> <br /> Oh ... Sam Waterson, how big you are in Law & Order. Why are you here? By reducing yourself to the role of the President of the United States I could add, you will be hit by a biplan remote control controlled by a gonzo assassin. And again, this is a masterpiece of George P. Cosmatos's work, which includes Rambo: The First Part of Blood II with Other Gems. Hmm .... case?
