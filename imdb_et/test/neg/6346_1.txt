I'm not sure who to blame for this attack - in fact, the action isn't too bad and the story isn't as terrible as some Disney movies have been. The story itself is low and advanced, but it is not surprising for this type of film. Operation is more than two-dimensional, but I give participants the credit to do something with the material they had to work with. <br /> <br /> But this is an unforgettable story in my book about the story that they have created a "perfect" pop star and then surrendered to an actress who can't sing to save her life. If a girl can't sing, let someone record music! <br /> <br /> This actor is the singer of TERRIBLE - she was so flat she usually sang in a completely different key!
