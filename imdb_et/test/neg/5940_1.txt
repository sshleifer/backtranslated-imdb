The film shows the relationship between the dead mother and the son of his son and certainly loves him. What does it show? It shows their living in very bad conditions. This shows how gently they "go" (really he brings him). But what else do we see? After their promenade, he walks alone in the same places where they walked together. It's not possible. A person who loves and cares about another death will do everything to make this life better. He wouldn't have a minute to think, be alone, and if he finds a few minutes a month, he will run away from the places he usually has. Another thing. The author dedicated this film to Andrei Tarkovsky. We see that he learned a lot about Tarkovsky's visual effects. But in Sokurov's film these are just effects, they don't support any senses or moods. Someone has compared this movie with "Mirror" ("Zerkalo"). Nothing ordinary except those visual effects. "Mirror" is a great movie and it's just a bad imitation.
