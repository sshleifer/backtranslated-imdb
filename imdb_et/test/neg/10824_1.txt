How unfortunate, but also happy that two movies of pot holing - cave and descent - should arrive at the same time. Unfortunately, The Descent fell on July 7th in Great Britain, where the London Underground Metro / Metro Terror Terror was killed, killing nearly 60 and injuring hundreds - not a very good night / weekend in the cinema, especially to see the horrible movie that the delighted women stay deep, a dark, claustrophobic underground crawling system. These two films have virtually the same elements - half a dozen characters lost in an unexplored blasting system where no one knew they were trapped there. A lot of water, cavities, danger ... finally, some cruel human beings or creatures of human origin who decided to get into them. If these two are so different, the cave is unrealistic, absolutely incredible, more of an alien's sci-fi fantasy adventure than horror or drama. With a relatively small budget, the British film (filmed in the South of England, although it is designated by the Appalachians), is a scary five-pair trousers, with a heart-breaking shock turning his belly so that people leave screening in shock early on. It strikes the girls in the old queue - you really don't know what to expect next - certainly not her! Descent is also illuminated in a natural way, making it even more frightening, unlike the ridiculously illuminated cave that resembles a gigantic magic Santa Claus, where the cathedral-sized room after the room dazzles with a bright blue light ... who knows where, while bellows torches work exceptionally granite-jaws for artistic lighting of heroes (every doll-like creation of any Team America / Gerry Anderson / Thunderbirds). Also, there is a fantastic range of equipment, but nevertheless, the impressively deeply expressed actors clearly forgot about any future threat, drama, or something of a horror film. It is rigorously valued. And in this case, the participants put out exactly that everyone is waiting for them - I quickly wrote down a list for each character, only getting out of Piper Perabo. The Cave Script is completely ancillary, unlike Shakespeare writes a full-length room for less than a week ... Take a typical "good friend" between white and black drivers that go; "How many times have we been in this situation before?" - "Too Much" (Morris Chesnut answers). I swear that you heard that my suburban London audience heard it. The most frightening thing about The Cave is that at the end there is a clear sequence of "sequel" - "cave 2: on earth" or whatever. Don't be afraid, be very afraid ... Or rather catch The Descent and be really scared, very scared. RR
