I had not heard anything about this project until I saw that it was going to happen so I looked at it completely openly. And the gee cast is full of strong players. <br /> <br /> Sorry. . . it is terrible. I don't mean it's not good; I mean, this is exceptionally bad - sometimes ridiculous, but mostly it's just boring. Its strongest appeal comes from attractive people who are as naked as US network television, but it's all bothering and not the only one, and being nymphs as backup doesn't justify hours of bad TV. <br /> <br /> There are two major problems that most cannot overcome. First, the script * is terrible *. Yes, changing the myth of Hercules (which is definitely not a one-time monolithic story) is traditional, but this version is boring and too often stupid (and sometimes even head-shaking, peculiar), with a terrible pace, here and there bits (and several parts) that appear to be in different films) and a truly terrible dialogue. Dialogue is often intolerably bad, as far as you feel it is embarrassing for the participants. Sean Astin, apparently now the second banana, seems to be particularly loaded with one dreaded line after another. Tons or atmospheres and little cohesion are not consistent with the plot. <br /> <br /> Second, most special effects are really bad. Really bad. Sometimes a little bit of CGI is decent, but most often you feel embarrassed. I have no idea what the budget of this project was, but it definitely looks like a "Titanium clash" or even "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" and does not even compare very good old Lou Ferrigno and Italian "spaghetti" Hercules films. Just hurt unhappy. <br /> <br /> There are many other problems - the story is unnecessarily complicated and unable to keep up to date and Hercules is not very interesting. Almost everyone who does not have a European accent tries to falsify some kind that is not merely amateurish and dated, but never really meaningful: drama does not get better just because the actors use British accents all. But the terrible script and the same terrible effect drown the whole thing right from the bat. <br /> <br /> In fairness, Hercules was apparently meant to be a four-hour miniser, but was truncated (for that to be an incitement) to a three-hour TV show. I do not know what they cut, but it is possible that the changes will make things worse. I don't think you could do "Hercules" good, adding it, but that doesn't mean that consistency, for example, hasn't suffered from network changes. I don't see how I look at the US version.
