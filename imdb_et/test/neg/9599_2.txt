Okay, let me start by saying I love the original RS 64. The graphics were new, the ships were really fast and cool. The missions were a challenge, but you had a strategy to come. The computer didn't tell you every step of your mission, you can effortlessly and study it. <br /> <br /> This is the first thing the RL is wrong with, everything you do is scheduled and controlled by others. Should I lead you not telling people how to behave with each mission? <br /> <br /> Speaking of missions, why do they share the original trilogy with a complete crap? I didn't care. <br /> <br /> I had been waiting for this game when I heard they were going to fly you through the Empire Strikes Back. I think everyone who is a fan of movies wanted to do it. So, they give it to you. This is the stupid level of the game. You start flying through the asteroid field with ties that track you and your entire goal is to go further when you take ties. You have to kill them all to go ahead. Hey, remember how much Han killed when he was in the field? None, they all had poor pilot skills compared to him. I just wanted to avoid asteroids when they came to me, but I have to use my automatic goal to kill the ties behind me. <br /> <br /> It was the biggest disappointment. Over your flying is all slow. Everything except the A-wing is probably the fastest and most maneuverable ship in the entire fleet. But, yes, yes, did Han say Falcon was? Anyway ... <br /> <br /> You will eventually end up in Endor's battle. Here is the ultimate level, you can destroy the star of death, everyone's first instinct is to choose Falcon and be the leader. But of course you can get there and you need to do foolish pre-selected strategies, like finding (not to mention decoding differences) bumpers. It is impossible in the shrub if you have seen one group, the frigate is destroyed. The only way to pass this part is to choose the A-wing. After that you have to attack the star fighters and this is a real stupid chore. This game will make you feel like you are the only one who protects the rebel union. </p> And here you might think "yes! I can destroy the star of death, and again, as in the asteroid field, you have to do some annoying things, while getting narrowly along the impending punishment of the tunnels. Your task is to protect the ship in front of you this is so moral, because if you choose a horn, you will die because you are not maneuverable enough, but if you choose the x-wing, you have to lock and release your s-foils kill bad guys or try to reach Lando, who probably doesn't know how to maneuver. So die in the process. <br/> <br /> when I saw the new three movies, I was upset and I needed to kill something, I'm happy, Smash Bros Melee is there. on the other.
