I am an atheist with little love for certain aspects of Christian fundamentalism. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is deplorable, whistle and transparent. It only works at the level of the current fashionable (and tired) motive of the white American Christian fundamentalism. If this film had been made of a fundamentalist Jewish or Muslim family, or even a black Christian family, this resentment would have been sensitive and the film would have been rounded in all circles. But as it is, it is "OK" and "artificial" because the white Christian fundamentalists remain one of the last "acceptable" targets, as it is. <br /> <br /> And the garbage it really is. If you want to see a similar bent high quality film, look and see or see "Badlands". "The King" did nothing good that wasn't done in this masterful film for decades. <br /> <br /> As other reviewers note, the stars are almost completely undeveloped in King. stabbing, cinematic art is weak. We've seen the sociopa story 100 times better. This movie doesn't cut it for thoughtful viewers.
