This movie is Horror 101 & Horror 102: Endgame on a double disc available as a special bonus feature. It has nothing to do with these films, except that it shows that the producers / directors Dudelson and Clavell are in the routine. Like other films, this young person has people who go to the building where they enter, and run down a lot in the corridor when they are chosen one after the other. Finally, it turns out that one or more characters have another identity. It is by far the worst of the three. <br /> <br /> Here, people are only invited to the Halloween night to be opened by the dead museum. The museum does not have many exhibits and they are kind of ancient Central America. There is also meat eating, zombies spreading the infection, and an ancient cannibal warrior and two female warriors. <br /> <br /> The movie is very repetitive. It kills people fairly quickly until you know who they left, where more people appear without explaining them to be killed. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, one character on a mobile phone is actually able to call the police, who actually takes it seriously and appears in the museum. When someone tries to enter the lock, the other tells him that it would be "forced entry". If you have people trapped in an injured building, I think it's not appropriate. Police officers are also stupid that if they shoot with a zombie head, it will go down, but then they will shoot other zombies in their chest and they will not go down. They happen to shoot another zombie and it goes down. They continue to shoot the rest of the zombies on the chest. Stupid. <br /> <br /> Opening credits and a nightmare are made with a kind of animation effect, a poor man's awake that is not so comic. It's kind of interesting, but some of the attacks are done the same way, so there's no logic. <br /> <br /> Dreadful.
