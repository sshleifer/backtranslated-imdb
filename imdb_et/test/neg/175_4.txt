I was expecting it and frankly there were some bright spots, but it would have worked better if it was focused on one story rather than shoot around the world. Many dogs were very fun, but I missed the wine fascists who pompously pounded (;-)) on their achievements. <br /> <br /> I felt that it would have worked better than an hour-long TV documentary, focusing on one of the many different issues he was investigating. The most interesting is the French city near Montpelier, which fights the American wine company campaign to get rid of historic forests. The Socialist Mayor agreed to the agreement, nicely scheduled elections and a communist mayor who turned it down, amazed American American wine ... <br /> <br /> Hopefully the director's cut is shorter than the original.
