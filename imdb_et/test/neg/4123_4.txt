I was just watching this movie and I have to say it was a good movie, I loved a good man and I loved the killer robot, but there was a hole in the movie. <br /> <br /> The names are people it was this .. stupid .. i think people should complain about the maker of this movie when flat it was at the end .. first half hour was good but then just dragged and then then I was lucky ... it was over ... but I still loved the killer robot and some good man in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think it was the best two bits I've ever spent because I like a stupid b-movie like this and come ... it's a b-movie for everyone.
