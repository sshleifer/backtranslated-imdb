In 1904, the rich American woman Tangier and her two children abducted Berber, murderous desert pirates, intimidating the Moroccan government, and abducting American Americans, which attracts the attention of US President Theodore Roosevelt. A fictional historical epic is a lesser adventure when it is a peculiar, somewhat exhaustive setback to 1940s desert-sheik-films (and there is also some "King and Me"). Sean Connery and Candice Bergen depict a hidden, spicy, bloodthirsty leader and his brilliant, high imprisonment that could act in two completely different films (neither know how far their characters camp bearings and dialogue must be, and both seem alone without proper guidance). The different (and anonymous) slashes and invasions that occur are arbitrary: we don't know any of these victims and big action scenes become blurry, noisy assemblies for horse violence. Pros: Jerry Goldsmith (Oscar-nominated, but John Williams' "Jaws" loser) a lot of reputable music score, fine location imaging and cinematography. * 1/2 from ****
