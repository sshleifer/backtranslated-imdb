I couldn't watch this movie for more than 10 minutes. It has set the standard. I'll never give a a 1 if it wasn't as terrible as it was. I fully agree with other comments on this movie. But since I'm a Dutchman, I watched it with Dutch translation. They probably didn't have the money for the right translation, so they decided to have it for babies. Sometimes with fun results. <br /> <br /> Don't smoke, don't drink, do drugs, don't look at the Demon Summer. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that the actors (Wow, I can't believe I just said.) I didn't have the script (Was it there?) in my hand while shooting. I think they did a good job ... Well ... Uhmm ... No, they didn't do a good job at all.
