I can't knock this movie too terribly, because it is obvious in the meantime, by watching that they're trying to do it, or if you want, "campy." Anyway, many of the parts they actually tried to do are actually, but often just for the cheese factor. See the "Space Invaders" game that was actually played as real life! Scratch your head to bumping robots ... oh, madness! And see that the whole thing goes all the way to the end of the time-warp! And the sexual enthusiasts just fly ... I'm really surprised to go with PG. Oh well. A fun way to waste a couple of hours, but it's not Star Wars / Trek, people. 3 out of 10
