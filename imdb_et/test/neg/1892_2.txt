I'm not funny with movies, oh I've seen so much mess so I can see something. Maybe that was why I looked at it until the end. Im a big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its disgrace to every self-respecting RPGer is. The footage made with the gaming security camera would make it more realistic than this film. Lines, cuts, sound, everything is wrong. In some scenes you can see that it is filmed in some photos when !!!!! (front spoilers) !!!!! People running around do not disturb people sitting near computers. I mean, would you continue your work if you had a ninjas around you? oh and jokes about pirates, this is the worst yet in the movies !!!!! (spoilers) !!!!! At least the first seemed to be a documentary film, now it seems to be a home video experiment. There are better movies on YouTube. Topline: Don't waste your time and money on what's so bad.
