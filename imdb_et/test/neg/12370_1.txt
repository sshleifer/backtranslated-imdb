Undoubtedly, it's probably always the worst film I've ever had to see my whole life. Take 5 wooden actresses thrown out of school because they were so wooded that someone sat down to think they were a bench. <br /> <br /> Then add a cheap camcorder. You know the old VHS types that cost 20 pounds of eBay. Add a terrible story that has no effect, and yes, you have this movie. What was this shocker. They couldn't even save it if she had a suitable girl. He was greasy and ugly and was the worst. I looked at it all because I couldn't believe this mess was ever funded. <br /> <br /> MISS ALL COSTS
