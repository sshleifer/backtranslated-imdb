The fear of the blind gave me the impression that several different scenarios were written that were too short for a game-length movie, then fought hostile to the Frankenstein monster. <br /> <br /> His best, main character, Lucas, is horrible. To pull both heavy and secondary characters, they are much more sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Fear of darkness could have been mediocre if it had only taken one approach and seen it - and would have made Lucas just psychotic and confused, not ghoulish and off-to. I wanted to see him in the shelter to get the rest of the characters in normal life.
