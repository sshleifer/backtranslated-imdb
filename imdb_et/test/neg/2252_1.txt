I didn't read reviews of this movie from IMDb until I watched it, because I really wanted to see it and make my thoughts. I've been a big fan of QT in the past, I think we all agree that he's made great movies, but lately he seems to have picked up his mystery and lost his own foundations. This "film" proves it. It consists of a couple of scenarios at work. It mainly consists of people's long, tedious and boring conversation that after a while you realize that you just don't give anything. It is long-lasting and there is no big sparkling dialogue that QT has been responsible for in the past. The whole movie is anticlimactic. There is no tension - what happens in every scene is telegraphic so clearly that by the time it happens, don't care. Honestly, don't believe it. This is a very boring movie and you won't lose anything unless you see it.
