Tyrone Power was cast into Solomon's lead. But part of the film he died suddenly. The studio chose Yul Brynner to take the lead and recycle the scenes Power had made. In retrospect, given that this movie was terrible, Power was very happy - because it would have been a terrible way to end his cute movie career !!! <br /> <br /> Of all the epic of the Bible I've seen, this is one of the worst - and it says a lot because Hollywood has done a lot of biblical stories - so much you don't know if their creation movies were an atheist conspiracy !! In fact, the film was so empty that it was earned in Harry Medved's superb book "Fifty Worst Movies of All Time". There are so many reasons to hate a movie, but the worst is how incredibly embarrassing it was! Of course, people with Italian, Eastern European, Scottish, and English accents were quite bad at playing Egypt and the Israelis - but at least it made the movie strange. Also, Bosomy Gina Lollobrigida plays the role of a well-known woman from Ethiopia, but was also terrible, but at least she was beautiful even when she couldn't act. Playing overweight and midwife George Sanders was such a bad role, but at least he had a beautiful voice. Creating a choreographic and stupidly boring orgy scene was pretty bad, but at least you had to see a person under the credit as an "orgy choreographer"! No, the worse thing about this movie is that almost two and a half hours seemed nine that it was so badly worried and terrible! Given that the only mention of the Sheba and Solomon queens mentioned above is only in some old Testament pleasures, it is amazing that the film went on and on. LARGE REASON EVER TOLD was a little longer, but this movie was based on four gospels - not ten verses! <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that the movie is practically bad (except for Gina splitting). Even dedicated to Christians and Jews, this is an inevitable film because it plays the truth as fast and loose as the biblical movie !!! Terrible in almost every sense, it is really a blessing to Tyrone Power that she doesn't remember this burnt turkey.
