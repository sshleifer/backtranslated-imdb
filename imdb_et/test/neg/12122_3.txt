Low budget mystery. From this direction, blind shooting and a woman are looked at. Young architect Jimmy McMillan (Chick Chandler) discovers a lost body. A quick woman, Mary (June Clyde), is related to death; but it is McMillan who has to try the case and solve the serious doubts. Suspects are six store owners near crime sites. The whole Film-Noir atmosphere; but not a real thing. This flick accumulation is just enough to be a decent low-budget mystery / drama and it's a nice little escape. Other players are: George Meeker, Michael Raffetto, Milton Wallace and Rebel Randall.
