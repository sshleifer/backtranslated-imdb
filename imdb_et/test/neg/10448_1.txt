Finally, a film with rival "El Padrino" and "Darkness Falls", which concerns the only and complete temperament. In fact, this is the first film I've ever released in IMDb with 10 and with good reason. <br /> <br /> There is nothing special for one. This is usually not a problem for me, except that the only one that is otherwise interesting or different from all others is Grand L. Bush Harrington. Secondly, the production values ​​that are non-standard television sci-fi like "Stargate", more convincing kits and all the underwater scenes that SFX teams do not have, are filmed with dry sets with "falling particles" that are not very convincing. This film is literally drydocked. The worst part is that this movie is OFF. The first 45 minutes I felt like we'd moved around: "It's a prehistoric shark." "Bullsh * t." "Not really." "Bullsh * t." "I don't." "Bullsh * t." "There is now!" "I didn't see anything." "Let me guess?" "Yes. Bullsh * t." After that, it rises so little about twenty minutes. Then we return to dialogue. The dialogue is not bad, but it is all this film. The characters speak. Also, this is not a bad thing except this movie is not very good. Dialogue is often animated and cliché and not very interesting to listen to. I don't see any points that torture special effects; this film has inferior qualities. <br /> <br /> Sets are small and unreal. Operation is sub-par. Script - oh Lord, script - is worse than sci-fi television garbage needs to be deepened. This makes you wonder where the budget for this movie is or was. <br /> <br /> Another terrible, terrible addition to the Megaloadon (there are about four) movie series. Bring Steve Alten, please ...
