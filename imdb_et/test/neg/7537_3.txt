Two teenagers in north-east England are desperate to buy and buy money for their favorite football team. They go through a series of "comic failures", but eventually come out with a smile. <br /> <br /> The trailer of this movie sells it as a comedy and contains most of its lightweight moments. At the same time, the tone is increasingly bleak and the end result is a depressing story with known stereotypes. These two "heroes" have no problems with lying, cheating, and stealing. Their opponents are a parent teacher, a father's pantomime villain, a psychotic head of the head and a meaningful but incompetent social worker. Other female characters are a teenager with drug addicts, a pregnant schoolgirl, and a dead woman who seems to be smoking. There are no pleasant characters and the audience can only feel regret or disdain. Local actors Tim Healy and Kevin Whateley play against both types of baddies, but writing and directing these characters is so one-dimensional that they have only novelty value. <br /> <br /> Chris Beattie and Greg McLane are giving good young two young leaders. But they have failed because they have the wrong accent. For anyone in the north-east, it is obvious that both are from the Sunderland / Durham region, but are expected to be Newcastle local. Geordie myself can assure you that the accents are not the same. Take the phrase "Let the poor boy talk". We say "let poo boy speek" when they say "piwer lad spiyk" with two distinct vowels. This discrepancy creates a ridiculous double irony at Sunderland's football field, where two boys are trying to hide Newcastle's accents they don't have, and * pretend to be from Sunderland - what they're doing clearly. In a comedy, comedy can be seen as chewing. But the dark tone of the film makes it clear that Mark Herman, the writer / director, is striving for sharp realism: it means that "almost enough" is actually far away. <br /> <br /> I was hoping for humor and optimism for this movie. and instead they found tired old clich√©s. Tyneside is not just a gray wasteland inhabited by the dead, but tells us that Herman should have known that he was causing an offense. It is interesting to compare this film with the same director, "Little Voice", which is also largely down and with one-dimensional characters, "Little Voice" is at least a talented heroine and it does not let the same amount of poverty. I've heard "Belter" who is next year's "Billy Elliot", but this movie is a much more enjoyable and life-giving experience. By the way, I can be too old, but I have lived in Tyneside for 42 years, I've never heard anyone use the phrase "purely Belter" outside of this movie.
