This film was an uncircumcised film. It was a non-moving story that certainly didn't mean anything other than all the strong moving materials that other critics say about the film. The three main players are good and some are laughing, but once again the film that you continue to expect will improve and it just isn't. I watched this movie last night and wished we didn't waste our precious time (when the baby was sleeping) watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend recommending it to my family and friends, as well as probably someone who wants to rent it. I was pretty much impressed by this movie.
