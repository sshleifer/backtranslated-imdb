In order to comment on the film, I know that the subject is terrible and that the words are not enough to express the sympathy that every dignified person would have to people dealing with post-bomb attacks on nearby nuclear bombs. <br /> <br /> But this movie doesn't work terribly, except for the first 10 minutes. Some pictures are terrifying and should be reminders of what nuclear weapons can destroy. Seeing people who are burnt, walking without purpose or a man with hair and hair hooks, etc., is not very prominent. <br /> <br /> But after the first dozen minutes, this Japanese film touches people who deal with the consequences of Hiroshima in the mid-40s. In fact, I found this story quickly for a boring soap opera. Almost all of the story takes place five years after the bomb and mainly deals with the problems of one family. That's why it became a melodrama rather than a shocking story about a nuclear disaster. It is just a story of how these people passed on with their lives around 1950, whether one of these women was permanently damaged and, if so, should she marry? <br /> <br /> It could have been a real film of influence, but it didn't go in that direction
