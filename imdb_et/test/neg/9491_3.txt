I would like to know the real name of Lodge, where the movie scenes were filmed. It is truly beautiful and recreates the architecture of the 20's and 30's as Hotel Del Coronado. I know it was either on Big Bear Lake or Lake Arrowhead and I would like to hear if it still exists. As for the film itself, it is really amazing that Jane Wyman was even nominated for the Academy Award. It was supposed to be a period when his academics liked it. It would have been really interesting to get a real impression of the script on Wyman and other participants in this movie. The script of this movie, like the latest Kevin Costner movie, in a bottle, is so incredible that it limits the credibility that participants can bring to their parts. Rock Hudson can be forgiven. He was never a big actor, mostly unable to get his appearance and did not get credible roles before his career (Pretty Maids is an exception). But Wyman must be forced to take this film through contractual or studio systems.
