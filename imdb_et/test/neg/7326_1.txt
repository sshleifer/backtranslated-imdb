Again such a zero-budget digital video camera trash. and again i fell into the trap where the title was "zombie" in this (german title: ZOMBIE ATTACK!) story: halloween visits some people "museum of the dead", this is a trap, crazy doctor wants to kill people, everything related to some steppe . so they fight against the zombies there. <br /> <br /> Ultra Cheap Landscape: Some corridors with black ribbons. some dilettant drawings and some skulls you can find in all the amusement shops. no participants but low quality models that wake up and don't know what to do. no effect. ridiculous make-up, your local hobby-make-up-zombie-fan does it better, for a while it seemed that they wouldn't have enough color enough, otherwise they just couldn't do it, man, they have to realize their "zombies" look . some ridiculous martial arts fighting zombies, slow motion. just when a director wants to scare it, he uses some standard digital video-cam effects, all of which are flackering. unbelievable! 0 out of 10!
