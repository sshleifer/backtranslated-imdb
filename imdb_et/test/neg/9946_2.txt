As Jennifer Denuccio speaks at Square Pegs, "Out of the door." I will definitely vote for the worst movie list in this movie IMDB. <br /> <br /> Dennis Christopher plays T.T., a Chicago guy who goes to California, who is driving his brother's jazz records. He should be a barney for the local surfer community. But he does more than he is new to civilization (just try to get through his sexual scene). The rest of the local population also has adventures that the viewer has to endure. Duke (Seymour Cassell), a volleyball expert who is trying to act as a normal person for a TT, unpleasant drunken surfers who cheat on his girlfriends, and a boy who contributes to the second that he can live in the car on the Sixth Month. <br /> <br /> California dreams are just a big old mess. It begins as a typical seventies romp with bad 70's music (although this movie was shy of the 80s). And Dennis Christopher comes out as the most irritating loser, making it difficult to watch the movie (hold your finger back and forth). Even though this film was supposed to be about the surf culture, surfing is almost all the garbage. People in the surf contest look like they can't fall asleep. <br /> <br /> I think the only cool thing is to see Tanya Roberts outside her role as Midge in sitcom. "And Cassell wasn't bad, he was just in a bad movie.
