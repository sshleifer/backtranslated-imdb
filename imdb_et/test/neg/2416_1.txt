There are good bad movies and bad-bad movies and nice bad movies ... it's not one of them. It's a movie that doesn't understand how bad it is. <br /> <br /> I saw it on November 14, 2006 in Los Angeles, as part of Grindhouse Cinema at New Beverly Theater. this theater places every month. Hopefully, Eric Caiden & co. think twice before letting the writer / director Lawrenece hit somewhere near them. What a man. The man got up before talking to the movie - you think he was Orson Welles, who talks about "touching the evil" or some other lost classic. Hardly. It's nice that he takes the audience time in 20 minutes with his inconsistency. <br /> <br /> "Young Warriors" are described as "Animal House" and "Death Wish" crosses, but if you expect something like imitations like "Nerds' Revenge" or "The Exterminator" you are one sad disappointment. The script makes no sense. The direction is so poor that the actors saw embarrassment and what you can say when the best thing about the movie is blowing up the car? <br /> <br /> Bad Richard's "shaft" round. In this film he plays the second character "John" with the first name, but it is the only similarity his character has to the classic mentioned here. I hope this movie allowed him to pay the rent for another month. Other actors who look like they wanted could be anywhere else: Ernest Borgnine and Linda Day George. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time. Even the audience did not recognize it (except for the one who was sitting behind him who was funny every five minutes and his girlfriend who worshiped every time he opened his mouth, lobbied by Barbie.). <br /> <br /> For the actual VILILANT films, I would recommend: <br /> <br /> Death Wish I, II, III, Destroyer I, Vigilante Force, Pr 45, Rolling Thunder, No-Mercy Man (The last two are a few years ago the films presented at this theater) - probably the same budget as "Young Warriors", but both were a million times better!)
