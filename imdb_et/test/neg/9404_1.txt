Pacino and Maconadump really hit this stinker. I swear, I'm an avid movie and fan. I've been the fan of most of the people involved in this abortion one or more times. Until now. Story of Crap The-crap (Rene Ruso-Major League was good) Plot-nonsense Subplot-garbage Teen's attempts to communicate with sports betting junk <br /> <br /> I've promised to see Romy and Michelle high school meet twice a day for the next seven days as my punishment for not changing the bag of this film after 10 minutes. I was out of town for a seminar, and this mung bunch cost me $ 9.99 and 2 hours. I'm deceived. This director should be in jail for fraud. <br /> <br /> Contact me if you have any other review questions. I'm always right.
