what a sad movie, took me 3 times to finish it. The thing I didn't like anymore was an infantile sense of humor. 10-year-old child jokes. not funny. pretty annoying, for example, when the detective chancellery is where he screams at the bar: "he takes it all out" and then they all run "fast" "slapstick glove" in a hurry. so stupid. and also a boy who sat in a bar that crushed the fruit to develop his post-traumatic stress disorder. at the bar! and the bartender supplies him with fresh fruit. should it be funny? and i mean ... i love good was exploits and i saw many terrible movies but his one is bad. and also "gore" is not so exciting. do not worry. I don't recommend it.
