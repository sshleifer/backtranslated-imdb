Lonesome Jim is like a romantic dark comedy about an insecure family whose two boys are the loser. Both boys are about 30 years old who live at home, but nothing for them. I live in the Midwest and I can't name such a family. I chose it because I like the humor of the actor of Buscem. Now I understand that I need to act against this humor to make it work. Functional and camera work and editing was good. After the first 15 minutes, you have helped prevent the film from being completely depressed in the last 15 minutes, with the Jerry Springer trailer bin. The women in my family asked me to turn it off, but I ruled on the assumption that the end should be a turning point and we watched the whole movie. Men's family members, as expected, just left the first 30 minutes.
