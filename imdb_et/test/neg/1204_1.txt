A teenage boy who is not in the army and has not become a jet pilot is a stranger to rescue his father for the country. If it is not ridiculous enough, he will speak to the air force with a colonel to help him let the jet go. To make the picture even more absurd, the Colonel threatens his career and life by giving some help to the brilliant marriage. They do not just make the colonists like this, but they never did. This gentle, bright film needs to be blown up and MIG blows.
