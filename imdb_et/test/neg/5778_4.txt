(There are spoilers) Ordinary film, the story of which takes place in and around the God-abandoned mine outside of the almost backward Sutter town. After a letter from Jared, Shadrach Smith, Clair and his wife Nick Breman, Carrie Bradac and Sean Hines, a nugget of gold and gold, they drove to the village with the gold searches of four other friends and amateurs Alx & Tori, Steve Wastell and Sangie and Hayden & Rox Ann, Rick Majeske & Elina returned their claim. Later it turns out that the fact that Jared disturbed the long forgotten gold well caused the soul of the notorious Jeremiah stone, Vernon Wells, to come back to life and re-launch his terror. Stone, or 49er, is the most ridiculous in film history. Stone looks like he was buried in a few tons of coal over the years, where this hook slices people into two. After almost all the local hermit Aunt Nelly (Karen Black), who was also the daughter of Eve (Alexandra Ford), was also one of the victims of Stone, they say alive that if they do not return the stone to the stone stone, never rest until he kills all those who still live. <br /> <br /> Aunt Nelly has given you enough time to tell her story before she has turned into a human torch and can jump into a nearby stream. The film goes endlessly with the killer miner rampage as it is as scary as burnt toast and the same in the dark. Even those in the movie didn't show him any real fear. In one scene, when he invaded Aunt Nelly's house, everyone blamed everything instead of fleeing, as she caused the ghost mine to lose her right hand; Stone spent the rest of the movie with a miner that was attached to his "stump". <br /> <br /> In addition to actor Karen Black, "Miners Massacre" is also a veteran artist John Phillip Law and Richard Lynch as Sheriff Murphy and Old Man Prichard. Passive things, but nothing special about the film is predictable, which ends with flames in the gold well. The hint of "Miners Massacre" makers that this futile end of ransom is not on the horizon and may continue to follow in the near future will help us all!
