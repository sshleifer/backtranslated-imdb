View 1 of 10/29/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Stephenson): A lightly fun story about five children forced to live their eccentric uncle when their father and mother fight and work in World War I England came to war. They are told that they would not go to the greenhouse of the uncle's manor, which they do, of course, again and again, and they discover the sand fairy who wants these everyday desires until the sun goes down. This is the "IT" referred to in the title created by Jim Henson Group and edited by Eddie Izzard. The problem with their wishes is usually the other problems they should learn. This part of the film is not very well done, because it is obvious that the children, especially the character of Freddie Highmore, do not learn from them, but continue to go back to solve their next big problem. "IT" is not nearly as funny as it might have been comedian Eddie Izzard really did not give much opportunity to improvise and Kenneth Branagh is wasted as an eccentric uncle, although he is the best character. Children are good in terms of their ability to act, but the story would probably have been much better in the field of fantasy, but they also had a human story that also spoke about what probably caused confusion with filmmakers. So, it was all OK movie, but it could have been much better.
