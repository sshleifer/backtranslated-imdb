Terrible movie; poorly written, ill-acted, clich√©, hackneyed, dross. The assumption is so good and the opportunity to educate black people, but the film is really terrible. This is a curious confusion about the bad 1950 Randolph Scott B movie and the bad 1970s spaghetti west. Roisto is carton, the setbacks are laughing, the dialogue is tortuous. <br /> <br /> Intentional anachronisms (like "Victorian" rap singers and contemporary swear words like "motherf **** er") are irritating to the extreme. <br /> <br /> The Frankenstein monster that died in the lab table.
