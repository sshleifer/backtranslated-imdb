I saw this turkey in the theater, but I had a good time. Special effects are not worth the classroom work. A toy that represents a merchant ship moves at high speed speed in flat water, while the wind-driven mist blows in the opposite direction. The red and blue flood lamps add a particularly dramatic touch to it. Regardless of what cache Vincent Price was supposed to bring as a narrator, a completely terrible production job is hidden. Calling it, the documentary is like a Britney Spears musician. About 20 minutes of this, something very funny hit me. Maybe it was an overly dramatic intonation of Price, which was often used by the line "They disappeared from the damn triangle! [Cut to black; the next story] When I started to laugh, my friends joined me back." Good! " As much as laughing as the Marx Brothers movie, no one was terribly serious about another feature of the "God Chariots".
