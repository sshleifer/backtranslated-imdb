I was almost asleep during this screening. The boring eternal boring story follows several days in the life of a male prostitute who loves one of his tricks. After a heated thing, the trick leaves a long-term message explaining why they can't be together and how they need to keep their way. <br /> <br /> The male prostitute then goes down to the self-destructive spiral of his "one true love" that repeatedly returns to the same places they visited, looking for more clues or signs of where he could find his love. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, he grabs one ugly guy (who I thought it was a male prostitute), a gay basher, and some guy who comes with him "triple sex" allele. <br /> <br /> She ceases to amaze me about how STILL movies are random sex, act as scenes that can happen in a short second, for example, when the trick is barely in her pants, strikes three times and orgasm miraculously! <br /> <br /> All these random meetings end with a sexual partner who asked him to call whom he was giving up his phone numbers. <br /> <br /> Here is a short side line that includes the main character who visits his busy mother who doesn't have time for his lifestyle. There is also another short side line that includes some random conversation with a young woman who has stood on her label several times. There is also another short side line that shows him a letter to a male acquaintance, but the audience is not informed of his relationship with that person. <br /> <br /> None of these things coincide, just to show us how this young man is lost and confused. He seems to be a living life like a ghost. The whole movie had one good scene that made him rob through the yard sales, looking for a definite record for the saddest song in the world. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this movie seems to be going on forever. Filmed in black and white, it may seem like a great dream, but almost two hours sitting in the theater, looking at this generation, is something like a nightmare! <br /> <br /> Did I find that the end is confusing when I wasn't quite sure if the young man was dead and gone to heaven? It would have been a great reward to end the misery that both the audience and the main character had to endure in this meaningless faithfulness. But because it is an "independent film", movies like such should encourage you to "use your imagination". <br /> <br /> For those who are looking for nudity, there are only short scenes and most of them are filmed, hiding something in the shadows. In other words, don't waste your time with it. <br /> <br /> My rating - 2 out of 10
