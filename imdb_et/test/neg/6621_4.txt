Before I sat down and watched this movie from HBO, I didn't expect anything but a couple laughing here and there, and all together is a stupid and common plot. Well, that's exactly what I got out of it except that I was somewhat satisfied at the end of the movie. I didn't expect it to be, I thought it would be just one and a half hours that I had hands on. Well, it was, but still it was somewhat worth it. The whole plot was very stupid, cheap, and some lines were very stupid. Otherwise, it was still funny moments, though not much. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you rent it, don't. Watch it on TV. I gave it to 4, I was generous because it made me laugh, but still it was pretty stupid.
