I agree that this film is about sex without seduction or love. In fact, it makes sex so boring and makes me wonder why. I really don't think it talks about how Canada's second-generation sense of sex is about India. Did you know that the first idea of ​​a hotel / drunk was copied from the Korean film Yopgijogin gunyo, made in 2001 or later? This Korean film was really fantastic as comedy, but at the same time forced the audience to think about the complexity of the relationship between man and woman and the difference between men and women in experience and thinking. I mean, most Neal N Nikki hotel / drunken segments were emulated. Do Bollywood filmmakers only want to make originals? Seriously, I never enjoyed a Hindi flick that is a copy. The ones I enjoy are always Indian feelings using Indian cultural means.
