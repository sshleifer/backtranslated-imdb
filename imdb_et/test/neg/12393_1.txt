I was shocked to have 18 good reviews. It must be one of the worst films, especially considering it was recommended. I have to admit that comedies aren't my favorite genre, but this movie made it worse that it was so hard to be wise that it made me look. <br /> <br /> The movie concept is comparable to the listening week of American Idol. You look because people are so deficient. But we knew there were no bad actors in this movie. So, how funny would it be for good singers to try to convince them that they shouldn't get close to the American Idol's challenge? It would be pointless because this movie was. <br /> <br /> The use of healing has been overestimated. We've all been in an environment where group friends get rolled up and everyone has tears in their eyes. I feel it's better. Improv cannot be turned on just because the camera is running because this movie proves. If you like Drew Carey hosted an improvisation show, then you probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> In general, jokes were poor, improvisation was sophomore, and the overwhelming activity of the guests and the company was campy. ..and these are my affections. If the trumpet man and the kettle are at the same time funny, you are fine. For me, I would prefer more fine things like "I Love Lucy" or "Hee-Haw". -priced humor. I was waiting for a person to identify himself as a zoo keeper and then tell us that there is no zoo in the city. This is the humor you can expect. <br /> <br /> My only wish was that I could give it a minus rating.
