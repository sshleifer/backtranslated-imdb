During the eighteenth century, when Charles Bronson made nine films, only one company was released from the Cannon Group: The Evil That Men Do, Tri Lar Films, an IT entertainment company by Tri Lars Grupp. Bronson was already in close co-operation with director Lee Lee Thompson, who ran through many artists to "Kinjite: Forbidden Subject" in 1989. <br /> <br /> Expectations should go quite high when Bronson and Thompson are working on better-funded clothing such as ITC, but "The Evil That Man Do" is a great disappointment at many levels. Evil is still a very large film with the low budget of the 1980s, the B-film. However, everyone in the production department easily took out and sold the hacker to Bronson. The "bad that men do" was a concept and technical resource that could have been used in one of Bronson's and Thompson's finest films, but instead became one of the most central. <br /> <br /> This 1984 political thriller brutally opens up with British doctor Clement Molloch (Joseph Maher) who organized his professional training for class political leaders in Suriname. Gray, passive Molloch is a torture expert who is used by numerous political regimes. At the beginning of seven minutes, we see Molloch with an electric current to cause intolerable pain to Jorge Hidalgo (dissident journalist Jorge Humberto Robles). As you might expect, the scene is terrible to look at and it is cut from the original VHS release. <br /> <br /> Hidalgo was no other than a Dutch (Bronson) friend, a retired assassin who enjoys life in the Cayman Islands. The journalist turned to the Netherlands before he released Mollochi's humanity, but turned down the offer. The Mexican professor named Hector Lomelin (José Ferrer) immediately after Hidalgo's death will visit the Netherlands to talk about his work, giving testimony from his doctoral victims. At first denying, the Netherlands finally agrees with dirty work, directing Molloch and his wife's sister Claire (Antoinette Bower) to Guatemala. <br /> <br /> The Netherlands will enter Guatemala City with the help of Max Ortiz (René). Enriquez); as a tourist she is the widow of Hidalgo Rhiana (Theresa Saldana) and young daughter Sarah (Amanda Nicole Thomas). As with most of Bronson's later outputs, his character Mollochi hunts one by one, crossing the way through an American diplomat (John Glover) and his supportive hit (Roger Cudney). In the cracks of the opal mine, there is a brutal end where the doctor simply gets deserts from many of his victims. <br /> <br /> Evil That Men Do is based on the forgotten Hill Hill by R. Lance and jumps in the 1980s in American political relations with Latin America. Indeed, "Evil" is heavily cooked in every sense, because it uses sensationality and doses of brutality to cover the major drawbacks of land and character development. There are three or four minuses for each film that result from a craftsmanship. <br /> <br /> Although "Bad to Men" makes great sense, the film is never more than an excuse Bronson destroys foreign-based scum. The bad flesh fiction is "Evil" full of cardboard labels that we never know or understand. Despite being strongly played by Bronson, Holland never speaks of his inner feelings or explains what motivated him to become a killer. Rhiana, the terribly weak part of Theresa Saldana, is outrageous by the Netherlands, but later she is fond of her. Where does his love come from, especially after looking at the Netherlands to kill several people and want to go home a few scenes? <br /> <br /> The most interesting characters are actually Molloch and his sister Claire, because so many questions can be asked about them. Of course, we can never find out what they have brought so close, how and where their torture started, what is Claire's exact role in their business? it seems to be doing things. Why did Hidalgo's daughter bring such a dangerous situation to Molloch's comfort? When Mollochi's bodyguard Randolph (Raymond St. Jacques) obviously saw chefs in the Netherlands and Rhiana, why is he so friendly in the afterwords bar? Is his memory short? And what really was the idea of ​​the Netherlands, except for cheap theater art, throwing Molloc's driver Cillero (Jorge Luke) out of the window when murder could have been more discreet in Claire's apartment? <br /> <br /> The overall action is decent and somehow Bronson gives one of his strongest performances. The points lack the direction of Mr Lee Thompson, but may be limited in time. In addition to filming Evil in Mexico, the presence of ITC is clear through better production values, cinematography and music. Rural areas are well used to transmit Latin America's hot and dusty atmosphere, and Xavier Cruz offers rich color and clarity. The Ken Thorne (Murphy War) orchestra is a refreshing synthesized junk era. Oddly enough, these positives only add to the disappointment of a good movie that screams out. Editing Peter Lee Thompson is better than usual, though with more ridiculous continuity errors. <br /> <br /> "Bad as Men" was the perfect grinding material in the early 80s and I find it hard to recommend fans of the 21st century. Columbia TriStar Entertainment DVD is a presentation that offers a widescreen and standard format with four-language subtitles. Although video quality is significantly higher than average, Evil was originally recorded with normal mono sound. The theatrical trailer has been offered and in fact it has the feeling of a floor house with eroded color and fuzzy sound quality. <br /> <br /> ** 4 of them
