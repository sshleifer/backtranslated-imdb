Rating: * 1/2 out **** <br /> <br /> "Network" is one of those movies that you wouldn't miss in the next hour. Well ... Just when you mean how bad it is. It's mediocre, unhappy, hollow, ridiculous and predictable garbage. One of the adjectives I just used above is the reason that made me add 1/2 of what I would have given. Is it so "so bad is good"? No. It's as bad as it is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Bullock is (surprise!) very bad performance with Angela Bennett, a computer worker who is at home all the time. She works at home, she has no friends and her neighbors don't know her. He suddenly sees himself in dangerous situations when his colleague dies and the same thing almost happens to him. His identity, bank accounts, etc. have been deleted and he is now Ruth Marx. The conspiracy even covers the government and ... wait! Have we seen it before? Yes, thousands of times. "Net" is trying to be modern, be a portrait of the 90s, showing the computer as a cable. Great thing! This is something about the film, but a pretext for showing ridiculous scenes. Take a boat accident scene. I just laughed when the camera started to slow down ... <br /> <br /> What makes everything even worse is Sandra Bullock. How terrible he is! Has he already made a decent movie? "Time to kill," okay. But he's still a bad actor, repeating his robotic face in every image. <br /> <br /> The advantages and disadvantages of the computer were already shown in "2001: A Space Odyssey," the best, the most. intelligent and most complex film. It is not necessary to compare "Net" to whether it is ...? <br /> <br /> The only reason to see "Network" is to laugh as I have said and see what it has been trying to do. Well, the results are disgraceful.
