A group of friends will get the word from the palm, who has found gold in an old mindhouse near the old abandoned western city of Suttersville. Despite the warnings of the local sheriff Murphy (John Phillip Law), Old Man Prichard (Richard Lynch), who robbed tourists of the anticipated collection of posters and kooky superstitious aunt Nelly (Karen Black) to stay out of the mine it is a notorious legend (.. that evil coal mine, who sold his soul to the devil and murdered the daughter of the priest (Jeff Conaway), returns from the dead to kill those who remove the gold from his shaft), these people see only green, not blood red, which could potentially shake their bodies. Finding the gold of the Jeremiah stone intact, they align their pockets and carrying bags that are prepared for the future that is supposedly facing. But if you ignore the warnings you count, the obvious result is a terrible death. As we can see, Jeremiah's stone is simply lined up next to one another, as their candles light up, the pickax underneath it that awaits its master, with dust particles that return his grotesque body with demonic exposition, his eyes hitting anger. This unhappy group, hoping to have fun around the campfire, with gold, giving them a warm outlook for the future, falls for revenge and its average pickax. The other victim faces the nasty end of the shovel thrown by the windshield of his vehicle, directing the road directly to the neck. Another failed attempt to retreat from Stone has caused a terrified victim to drive his car into the tree, his body banged in the flame if he cannot escape without damage. Another, local girl looking for her new friends, worried about her well being, gets her pickaxi buried in her belly. Aunt Nelly informs those who live forty more of Niner and the curse, those who are attacking her eternal clamp. Does anyone survive? Or is the entire group killed by the dead zombie miner? <br /> <br /> Make-up effect artist and monster creator John Carl Buechler directs this supernatural creator without worrying about logic or strong storytelling, instead of letting his zombie digger destroy everything and everything that happens on his path. She offers just a modest story, and at best it is weak because a killer who promises a special guest letter, Karen Black (.. oh how her career has sunk into the abyss), to introduce her to the viewer. The story we are given is a miner who has a priest's hostage hostage, threatening to fill him, because the Suttersville authorities are warning about this. Enough amazing, stone plants that pickaxid her back, the opposition can hold her arms a little because she sold her soul to Satan. It comes down to its own domain, the mining shaft, Stone, warning that someone is even trying to take his looting. Usually, most of the slasher is generally the twenty of the victims of your garden varieties, with little development, except for some beating and exchanging words, as a filler, until the undead maniac jumps into the scene to kill them. They are a common group in the city, crossing an unknown territory, restoring evil that should stand still. Like many later 80's slasher, there is a lot of violence off the screen. What is on the screen, the minimal gore, is pretty much presented every day and is happening quite quickly. Killer killing is only shown from time to time, mostly covered in darkness, intimidated faces of victims when captured or pursued, more appreciated than the method of destruction. One thing is for sure, stunt men were fire several times. At least three times the lamp is lit with a lamp or flame. Martin Cove has a small former man, former Black wife, Caleb, who now lives with a much younger and denser man. Vernon Wells (.. of The Road Warrior and Commando Celebrity) is a story behind Jeremiah's stone as a person who is still struggling with the same type of threats he specializes in. John Phillip Law seems to enjoy himself in a polite and hospitable sheriff, welcoming strangers to his forest neck. Buechler has a pretty attractive actress, all wearing tight pants and small shirts, showing their sleek and athletic figures, especially Elina Madison, as easy to place Roxann, who is always ready for her greedy jerk, Hayden (Rick Majeske). Stephen Wastell (the ghost of Edendale) is Axl, a rather clumsy foil used as a backstage for many jokes, including his "dumps in the woods" and the current status of unemployment.
