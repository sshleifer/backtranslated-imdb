It must be one of those times when you come across a film that has a clean cover, my first impression, sweet, full moon, crows, scarecrow that keeps the dragon. OK, I have the impression (I was watching TV for weeks with scarecrow) perfect, nice slasher movie to start the evening. ................... wrong, absolutely wrong I think I'll take it in 5 minutes, but I thought I was wasting 3 dollars so Ill would stop with this pity Well Im guessing his feet fisherman man wearing heavy duty rain boots. you see it so often every time. I watched this thinking ... OK, when these brothers get into this guy, at one point I thought they died. but no .... i mean frig, their still alive. I just ended up with some of the reasons why they were poorly staged. one had a zoom in part at the beginning. The director / actor / writer says, "Remember that I had this feeling, I have it again" and it was either zooming or reducing that I check back in hell. but I think the scene was supposedly shocking, I mean, what's more shocking if his wife had the same shocked look .... OK ... he believed him? I'm sorry, but YEAH .... I didn't know he was psychic until I read the movie box to make some sense of what I saw. not only did they use the pictures to guess that the film was at least clear. <br /> <br /> Another thing that made me a little laugh was screaming at the camera to make it scary ....... OK ............. .. the girl is filmed in the camera for 5 minutes ....... right ..... I laughed at how pathetic it was that these kids couldn't act like the rest of the people in the movie. <br /> <br /> To win things off, you have to be lost or something .... the reason seems to be that the bad guy was just a stick. even an ax, somebody should pull the dam production movie <br /> <br /> Don't miss the picture, this movie is a piece of sh * t. I watched the trailer and guess what it is.
