Daniel Auteuil Bruno Petites Couperes is his Pierre Medieval model 10 years ago at Christian Vincenti La Separation. In both films, youthful confidence in left-wing ideology and love (reciprocal metaphors) collapses into paranoia - expressed as relaxed aggression in Pierre and desperately comic femininity in the last Bruno. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for the fans of Auteuil, the actor has become dependent on a unified world of excitement (unlike the recent l'Homme du Trainist of Johnny Hallyday Leconte). It does not work and becomes quite depressing as the film progresses. Pascal Bonitzer does not help as a writer / director of the project. The sequencing of the episodes covered by the connecting symbol does not hide the lack of rhythm of the film. I was especially furious that Grenoble's amazingly dramatic / romantic backgrounds were made by a virtually superfluous operator, who was probably a shiver. <br /> <br /> Krisitn Scott Thomas will release an exhibition with his female colleague Bruno, Beatrice. He dramatizes the dizzying contradictions of Bruno's increasingly complex nature to become surreal. However, Bonitzer is unable to support it and the flagship has a requirement for Beatrice to have a second civic dummy. In doing so, Bonitzer then denies Scott Thomas's oscaricabin. <br /> <br /> All the decline of the characters in civil society can be a viable and really tragic result, but in this case it is a cradle of cadence (unlike La Separation's brutal and painful disclaimer). Serious disappointment, 4/10.
