Some giant scorpions are on the submarine and kill everyone. Two months later, some Navy and Scorpio scientists are visiting to download their cargo. After finding 200 bodies, the sailor tells the doctor "I need to know if there's something that could endanger my men". Do I think? He refuses to tell him what is there, referring to the need to know. Yes, it is quite big. One of the scientists is probably an idiot that is idiotic and real light. He has given the task to confirm the lights. She finds the luminaire control panel, cuts the wire and burns like a banshee. Then he does it again. Then he takes the hammer and crushes the control panel into pieces causing all the submarine lights to work. <br /> <br /> And so it goes. This is probably done in Sweden; I'm not sure if the Swedes really have a strange sense of humor or are just very terrible filmmakers. I tend to think they are terrible filmmakers. If you thought there was a big explosion at the end of this thing, sorry, but it is a need for knowledge, so I can't tell you. <br /> <br /> If you've absolutely been able to see a giant scorpion movie, let me recommend Tail Sting, a delicious and fun movie about scorpions on the plane, or Bugs, which is a pretty humiliating B-film about scorpions in the tunnel. Watch this movie as an absolute last resort. Oh, it's traceable, it's hard to turn it off because it's just lunacy, but that's all that is.
