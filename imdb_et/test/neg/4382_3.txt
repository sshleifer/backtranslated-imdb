I chose this movie from a local Family Video sale for $ 1.50, which was probably the first sign that it wasn't good. Looking at it with two friends, neither of them even wanted to end the movie terribly. I strangely couldn't look at it. But this movie is definitely a tutorial on how not to make a movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple enough and sounds great: Chuck Norris has a nightmare for the serum killer he has placed behind bars. The serum killer escapes and his nightmares are beginning to become reality again. A murderous murder, Norris, a round house strikes ... it looks like a great movie. <br /> <br /> And some of them are pretty good. The regenerating scene where the man crushes the ladders with his teeth is intense, the scene where the van-cascades pull out of the cliff is amazing - and I learned how to break out of prison using more than Chapstick, gun powder and dental floss. But there's a lot of wrong about this movie. <br /> <br /> One: The editor is a morm. When you perform an action or a thumbnail, you need to move the energy. There are too many scenes that are not important for the plot that has left the movie, slowing it down and disturbing the overall story. At least 10 minutes could have been cut and the pace would have improved and the film would be a little better. Two: The sound man is a moor. Apparently, someone was trying to film most of this movie in an area where you don't get a sound, so most of the dialogues are tuned in by killing the stereo and not the mouth. Music is also too dramatic in some scenes. Three: The electorate is a moor. They put Billy Drago into a psychiatrist. Billy Drago is a brilliant cult artist (in Brisco County, the eyes in the mountains and others) and would have made the right serum killer or frog. His character is so vanilla that Drago's skills are wasted. Four: Writer is a moor. In this film, there are two plots - the romance of the serum killer and Norry and his pregnant girlfriend. Every time I saw this woman on the screen, I wanted to take my eyes off. And certainly, he never thought of another plot, making his story completely meaningless. <br /> <br /> Will I ever look at it again? Maybe. But if they don't rebuild this movie at least ten times, you should never do that. Not recommended.
