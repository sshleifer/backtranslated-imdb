When I think about TV movies, I always think about this movie, I've been watching it on Sky Movies a few times, it was terrible. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time to see this movie. was just browsing and about here: -S. <br /> <br /> Microbiologist (Linda Flemming) goes on vacation with her son (William Flemming) at this resort, where they meet Paul Johnson (taxi driver / owning a bar?) and Kathy Johnson. <br /> <br /> It's like a strange romantic thing, William will fall for Kathy and Paul will fall for Linda. <br /> <br /> Some boys leave the street, have a sign on their hands, Joseph (Joseph was a deep-sea diver who saw light or something on some dives and turned it into a religion), he says, take care of this person, my memory is cavity, then there is a widespread virus break, I think Linda offers her help, cure, Kathy gets infected (William notes Kathy's hand) with the virus makes Joseph <br /> Paul tells Joseph some lines, then Joseph stumbles The next time you see Joseph, he has healed how this information is used for infected treatment, there is a beach party, the end.
