This movie is the worst film I've ever seen in my life. Woman "EX" pretends to be a number of people to gain access to her former husband. Killing people in a bath to reach their goal. Women I never believe in college. She just spends the whole movie as a fool's expression and she looks like she is trying her absolute hardest to avoid looking into the camera. In most cases. He makes friends with his ex-wife and son, he does it against his wife. At first, when you watch this movie, you think "Ex" wants to kill his former husband, perhaps because he has treated him badly. But in fact, women are obsessed with a man and want him back. Two of them enjoyed furious entertainment (using whips, of course). My advice to the public is not to buy this movie, don't rent this movie and don't look at it like I did (at 1.15 FOX)
