Poor Casper Van Dien, his career has slipped far from Tarzan and Starship Troopers. <br /> <br /> In Meltdown he is a police officer who just happens to be a TV reporter Stefanie Von Pfeten and his brother are a scientist who is trying to pick up a commentary on Earth that goes to Earth. But in the business of collided comets, even near-event causes some real problems when the Earth's orbit goes out. <br /> <br /> From the survival of the earth we go to the survival of Van Dien and his close relatives. Indeed, her daughter's gangbang boyfriend, Ryan McDonell, proves to be somewhat useful, especially if he suspects that a man he knows about a sophisticated cop might mean a lot of damage to the Van Dien group. <br /> <br /> My only question here is why were they not with Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton and the rest of this team to deal with a nasty comet? <br /> <br /> Submit it to people.
