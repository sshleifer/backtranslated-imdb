Girl in Lovers' Lane: 10 out of 10: Homoerotic subtitle in movies is a well-known phenomenon. There have been many debates about film sub-types such as Top Gun and Spartacus from film schools. Lover's Lane Girl is definitely a homoerotic trop. In fact, it is so dirty and from the top even MST3K, who rarely sees such things rarely, just can't avoid it. <br /> <br /> The film is about two drifters. One abundant child (Lowell Brown) who drives home for $ 100 and not street life, the other is a professional hobo (Brett Halsey). Hobo rescues the boy from his sons and reaches a small town consisting of a canteen, a basin and a whore. Our messy teacher gets a second impression of a canteen speaker (Joyce Meadows as a title Lovers in Lane) who has obviously passed the age of aging and whose only prospect is the horrible Jack Elam, who makes Steve Buscem's impression. <br /> <br /> This surface looks like a strange film for MST3K treatment. While the cast is old for these players, both Brett Halsey and Jack Elam actually perform well. The story is small but hardly Robot vs Aztec mommy material and production values ​​are cheap back to many, but relatively competent. <br /> <br /> This is the strange homosexual currents of Batman and his church that make this movie so terrible and fun. Halsey has the ultimate objections that children are trying to put in fortune-telling, fun, his inability to commit to a reporter (or at least get the first base) and tens of eyes between him and the child; hand on shoulder, sleeping places, hitting girls, so she and the child can shave each other. You don't have to be Freud to find out this downstream.
