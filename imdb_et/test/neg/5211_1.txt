How on earth were these boys making money for making this movie? The absence of a script is one thing, but cinematography makes you cry. A handheld camera can be very useful for the look and feel of a movie, but in that case you need a photographer who knows what he is doing. I am well aware that actors are amateurs, but there is no protection, because the director can be the least talented person who ever runs in Sweden. It would be a shame for the industry to be given money (or some of these teams) to make a movie. This film simply asserts that there are too many films in Sweden every year.
