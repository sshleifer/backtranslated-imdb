What can I say about twelve oceans? Who thought it would ever come to this? Huge confusion that loses halfway and can't go back. I was surprised how bad it really was. Really! I've never seen this end because this movie is just impatient. I'm the first fan, but it's a flat apology sequel. <br /> <br /> What was the hell when they returned money? The film is just boring and so drag that I can never sit. It's really bad. Just stay so far, repeat, as far as possible from this movie. It's worthless.
