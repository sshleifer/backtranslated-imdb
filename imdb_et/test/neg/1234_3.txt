photography is good, costumes are good, but editing is bad. Different scenes are cut or stopped at the wrong time and chats are s-1-o-w and annoying. This slowness continues the exhibition. This is a very annoying exhibition. . . . I believe more scenes should be added, but that would make it longer. It's very slow. Writers would have had to make this one-night show and not extend our darkness at night. There is nothing else, otherwise I would change the channel (first night). I feel bad for the Indians of this time and I am angry at the white men for what they did to the Indians, but what is our history.
