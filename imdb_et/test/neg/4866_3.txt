This movie starts with the pedestrian settings before it came to a regular midnight meeting, where the office worker continues the men of trained secret services, and so on. <br /> <br /> I couldn't say it was bad - there were some good "surprised" faces from Hamilton and Sheen - but then I really shouldn't. <br /> <br /> Risible Finale at least gave me a laugh for my pain. However, if my life blinks in front of my eyes, I think I'd like to go for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I have to write two more lines of text to publish this thing. Yes, a very durable suit that is illuminated. I gave myself a promise to never watch this movie again.
