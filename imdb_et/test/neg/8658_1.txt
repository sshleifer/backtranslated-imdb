Certainly not worth the money or time. It's the same guy and girl meeting and falling in love. But it's a western touch. But it is not unhappy with a love story or a western touch. We never know that hero and heroin are in love. Neither of them has a depth. Probably it would have been possible to prove characters with better elections. Finally, this movie, which has no fun, does not work, has no theme, no plot, no comedy, no action, no excitement, no romance (I associate romance with something more passionate). Definitely not a movie you would like to go to with your family. In general, if you are looking for a movie that contains some content, it is definitely not an option. I'm looking forward to a day when Bollywood movies are something I look forward to and I can refer to my friends as a "black watch" movie.
