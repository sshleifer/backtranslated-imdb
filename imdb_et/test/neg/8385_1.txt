This movie was so bad when someone who starred in his movie reads it with the director, I hate you! LOL, this blonde woman who ran in the forest yelling. and oh dear god, if this were the director who chose its cameras, go back to the normal job. No one wants him to look at some of the frightened women throughout. Amm, don't even think about renting / buying or even copying it within a 100 meter radius of your house, because it can be harmful to people who like good movies ... When I got home, I thought the camera was a movie and style.
