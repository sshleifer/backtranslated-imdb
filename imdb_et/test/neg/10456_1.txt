I thought it wasn't going to get worse for "dead army", but this comic book makes the above-mentioned "godfather" movie !! Special effects are HORRIBLE (Makes the original Nintendo graphics to HDTV). When it comes to actresses, I went so I went to this 6-year-old brother-in-law in the game and gave it an Oscar compared to their D-list (and it's non-existent) actors and actors. So basically, if I had a gun in my head and headed to watch this movie again or cut my hand with the boredom, it's a tough choice! Do you know who needs two weapons in any case?
