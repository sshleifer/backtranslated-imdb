This movie was a waste of time. It's nothing but a gangster movie. It contains a very predictable plot. My feelings are multifaceted and symbols are at best mediocre. Half of the time you are looking for something else, because the movie is boring because you already know what is going to happen. The other half of the time you are desperately trying to make the main character grow a couple of balls or just end your life by jumping on a bridge or something. Secondary characters are also usually one-dimensional. There is no symbol in this movie! No depth!
