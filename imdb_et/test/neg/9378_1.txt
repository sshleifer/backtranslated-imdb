August 25, 2003 Exceptional gentlemen's league: <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is one of the greatest awards ever and I've been his fan since the 1950s. I went to this movie because Sean Connery was the main actor. I had not read the comments and had no prior knowledge of the film. The film surprised me quite a bit. The landscapes and sights were remarkable, but the plot was unrealistic because it was ridiculous. In my opinion, it was not one of his best films that could be the worst. Why he decided to be in this movie is a mystery. For me, this movie was a waste of my time. I'm going to go to my movies and add my movies to my video collection. But I don't see a waste of money to put this movie in my collection
