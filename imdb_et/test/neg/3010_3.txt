Professional production with high quality actors who just didn't touch the heart or the funny bone, no matter how difficult it was to try. High quality cast, rough setting and excellent cinematography made you rely on Fargo or the High Plains Drifter, but sorry the soup wasn't flavored ... or meat on that matter. 3 (out of 10) efforts.
