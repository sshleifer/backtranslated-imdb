The DVD version of Crash Cinema was badly done. The Mastering engineer must be drunk, asleep, or even in the room when it was done. It seems to have been managed from a copy of about the tenth generation and about half through the movie, audio sync disappears. The dialog is about 10 or 15 seconds behind the sound. If you want to think about buying this DVD, please save your money. I remember this movie in 1973 in the theater. Also, the title of this movie's VHS copy titled "When Taekwondo Strikes" is better than DVD, but the rest of the movie for several minutes is "lost". Where's the original camera negative?
