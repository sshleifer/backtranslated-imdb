On the clean side of the theater, Last Stand was great because the reenactments and soundtrack are very entertaining, but there are better reports about the battle found elsewhere, which are not as long or as dynamic as they are much more historically comprehensive. <br /> <br /> Certain small details, such as misuse of the word "hoplon" for the Greek hoplite shield, and misrepresentation of different names and words, really ate me. <br /> <br /> My guess would be that since the "last status 300" was broadcast on the eve of the "300" theater, the history channel tried to try only the movie mortgages. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for imagination that is historically accurate in every sense possible, there would be better luck elsewhere.
