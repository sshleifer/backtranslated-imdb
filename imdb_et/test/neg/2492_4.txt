There are many other comments on how bad this film is. I would like to point out how this film took the largest research project in history and made it small. The Manhattan project was an incredible achievement and it was huge. Almost all silver in the country went to make wire for electromagnetic separators. If there were any two options to choose from, they did both. The first permanent nuclear reactor was fired under the stalls of a football stadium at the University of Chicago and graduated from students who used the axle scrambling mechanism. This is an exciting story that includes hundreds of places and thousands of people that this film seems to be diminishing as a small group of eccentrics in New Mexico. The second thing that I really did not want was a great moral debate if we were to continue the project after Germany had given up. Okay, we have thousands (mostly) men who worked for years to make a really big boom. Does anyone think they didn't want to see it? There was some controversy over time about whether we should use the device, but it wasn't so serious that obviously not the big movie that this film does.
