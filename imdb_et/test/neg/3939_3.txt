Seriously, if you want to see a clich√© horror movie, you have to see it. It contains all the "scary parts where nothing happens", "the nerd who is not actually killed", "the boy and the girl who come together and survive", "the old child's fear" and so on. . I wanted to see that this movie causes a combination of video game and movie. I think I was wrong. What makes a movie more acceptable? It's only 1 hour17min, so if you're bored, it might be a good idea, although I'm rather bored. Why not see it absolutely? Frankie Munitz, named Malcolm, just irritates the nerve type. I could not smell this boy and it is so sad that he did not die before and finally he even returns. Look at something else!
