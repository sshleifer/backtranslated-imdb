Anyone who looked at "Alien vs Predator" must know that the "Alien Quadrilogy" conventions were not tailored to the film. Some of the extraordinary elements include the rapid growth of aliens within a few minutes, aliens with extremely long tails, and so on. But the idea that Predator species would give the city and temple a boost to create a hunter would be such attractive warriors that I couldn't resist. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that the end of the movie wouldn't be a sequel to this sequel and unfortunately I was wrong. For those who forgot how the first film ended, the deceased Predator was bursting through the chest, carrying the qualities of both species. <br /> <br /> For this movie, I just go through a list of "good" and "bad" features. <br /> <br /> Good: A lot of great people, especially men. Bad: Many mutant people get both mutant Predator / alien and predator. <br /> <br /> Good: An interesting idea from the Predator planet. Bad: City's inconsistent scale. It is a small town without many opportunities but with a very complicated (read: metropolitan) sewer system and homeless. Is it a small town or a city? The police service is one sheriff and three deputies, so I thought. <br /> <br /> Good: Um .... <br /> <br /> Bad: Why are these mutants aliens / predators growing so fast? Within five minutes, they seem to grow full. I mean ... what these things are ... Chia Pet Aliens ??? And while we are on this subject, why is it that an alien in Predator's body mutates but the alien is not in the human body? Does it make sense? <br /> <br /> Good: Still Thinking ... <br /> <br /> Bad: Why would only one Predator come? And why does it pour acid over all "alien" residues, but he decides to assassinate a cute deputy and then skin him and hang it upside down. I mean, there is so much incognito! <br /> <br /> Good: Ah ... I'm stuck. I think there are lots of loud sounds! Bad: How do these mutated Alien / Predators emerge? Obviously, they find a pregnant woman and kiss several female offspring in the way they move. Yes, what would you like to see? Pregnant women who explode their bodies become mutant foreigners - as if the previous way wouldn't be big enough !!! I mean, not even an alien queen. <br /> <br /> Good: Did I say the boys of this movie are proud? Bad: When a nuclear plant blows away from buildings, how can a helicopter survive a blast? And how sticky it is that one of the passengers glimpses the pilot "I told you that you are not breaking!" I think because of the nuclear blasting when he wakes up in the morning, he won't get his hair left !!! <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I think you'll get a message. The mutated Alien / Predator breaks through the dead Predator's body, grows in a few minutes, kills all Predators and succeeds on the ground. More mutant Alien / Predators are being created, while the ONE size Predator comes to the ground to destroy this new mutant species. Predator kills people. Mutant Alien / Predators kill people. People kill people. Sucks you're a person in this movie. Maybe? <br /> <br /> If you have a lot of beats and bumps, you'll love this movie. <br /> <br /> If you liked First, I suggest you skip this step.
