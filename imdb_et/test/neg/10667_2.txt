Who filled the idea of ​​this stupidity to act and produce the film with Himeshi's head, which is always hidden under the lid, covering almost half of its face? Only hope this is the first and the last for God! Assalam From Tale To Gayatri Mantra, Himesh has tried all the things to create his own aura of singing talent, which is nothing more than a scary word like Tanhaiyya, which completely kills the beauty of love. songs. Why Himesh Doesn't Smile? Easy because it doesn't use a close toothpaste! Now this is his friend who drove him everywhere, and this number one lawyer in a city that has to laugh sexually and try to attract Himesh of all the beautiful German people he had met before, perhaps men's lawyers in this part of the world can be their destiny of fate , which is designed to deal with everyday rigid, unpleasant batches! The action scenes are so funnily shot, as the event planner attacked the thief, driving in cars over cars, so on and so on. The bride's father seems to be very quick to get rid of her daughter when she marries, that she rides around and around. Most of the hypocrites praised the HR for sharing love among the people of the world, as if they were sweets and gave their daughter a lecture on these show businessmen. once Himesh has been found innocent, he will once again dug another guy like a musical chair game! I didn't even face a poor son, right? Hansika Ria's role looks like she needs eye control, eye tightening! A friend of a friend is good, who has acted naturally and should be in better films like Sharman Joshi. The child's artist Trishu in a short look is sweet but wastes. It seems that today's young generation has gone into nuts, because they prefer blinking such lyrics and musical results and associate it with fame, for example, when you sing the bar, then the ghost would have come. it is a strange taste of music and quite funny. I'm surprised how classical writers like Gulzar have chosen Himeshi from all people to give music. The Panchtantra is a story that the crow's windows are so many peacocks that beautiful birds like; But the feathers will fall and the real dark crow will appear! Hope Himesh takes a hint and refrains from making such pointless things, and wastes the valuable money he has earned in paying his short nose so much! Her friend tells her when your nose is cut, how do you sing? Thank you for showing us Germany, Himesh, for a reasonably priced DVD rental! and fix those misspellings, right? extra e-film and e-love! In the old movie Sholey, Mehbooba, there is also a famous number that Mallika Sherawat smiles again, but this time with Himesh, worshiping her and comfortably, Ria, her so-called true love and her new bride. not around! Now it was very wise, Himesh! At least one thing in this movie that you have cleverly done to justify Sherawat's presence. But does he not see a little wash?
