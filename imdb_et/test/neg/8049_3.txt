The best way to have fun in this movie is to read how many clich√©s he has around. Chinese gangsters. Female Vice President. A fan tube large enough to accommodate a large Caucasian man. Shooting through the wall to kill the bad boy. A situation where you need to fire innocent people to avoid Armageddon. Independence Day scenes, where you shoot off some memorable sights on the shooting ball. The vice president was in a nice well-lit room surrounded by subordinates, while the Chinese prime minister was practically alone in a dark room, where a little dim light shone, despising as cruel as slippery gangsters. A single hero who left alone on a ship (a building, an airplane, whatever), caused disgraceful bad guys with large automatic weapons. Etc, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> Another best way is to calculate how many zeros are needed after a decimal to accurately estimate the likelihood of a movie scenario. I read 45. The President agrees on a private ship at the meeting. It is possible that the nuke box command is impossible. Part of where China decided to play shoot. Etc, etc. Earth's land is more likely to be exposed to the sun when this film takes place. I testify that the film was interesting until the evil Taiwanese gangsters robbed the president. Then boredom went down. Stopping belief stopped, and I began to wonder how fun I would torture this movie ...
