Unfortunately, producers do not know when to leave well alone, or recycling is that all Hollywood bins remain in Alpo. It seems that every sci-fi adventure flick has to endure the list of offspring check-ups and Robocop is a tragic example. The first film, under the direction of Paul Verhoven, was a wild and stylish journey that even took time with a small social comment on what can be changed on the dark side of biotechnology. There is nothing in this film, besides, perhaps, telling us that drugs are bad for you and could do things that you regret. Robocop 2 has no vision, a deeply frightening vision of what we are changing, and takes us terribly to boat racing, how drug dealers and their victims really are. Social commentary is fucking. It's really great for me. If you don't care about anything other than SFX, go to it, my friend. Otherwise, do not waste your time with this yeast-free sour cake and keep your first movie in a precisely measured, heavily weighted pumpernickle oven. It's that simple.
