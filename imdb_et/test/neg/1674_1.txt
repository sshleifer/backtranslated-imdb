I don't know if this type of film was as clich√© as it seems today. <br /> <br /> Considering how many "Bad News Bears" films had been released since 1980, I think that such a movie was already a tired idea. <br /> <br /> Former footballer in Vietnam is partially paralyzed and limited to wheelchair. The Chicago bears him a PR job, but he wants a coach. At the same time, his minor nephew is being taken against armed robbery. We are told that he has already been arrested over a dozen times and now he has to work hard time ... which is less than a year! Of course, a child is actually a good boy who only needs a strong male role in his life. The same applies to all children in the detention center. Yeah ... even what's locked for murder attempts! I am sure you already know what will happen, so I will try to keep it short. <br /> <br /> Our protagonist will become the coach of the children's football team. He wins the cynicism of the criminals and earns their respect. His team is facing a local high school team (yes yes!) And they get their bucks hit. Now more than ever, he decided to prove himself to be a valuable trainer. Are those underprivileged children with golden hearts able to win enough to repair the rematch? The terrible execution of football sequences destroys any excitement with this film. "Trainer of the Year" should punish your brain for cutting. 1/10
