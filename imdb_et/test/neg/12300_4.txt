"4th Floor" is a decisively mediocre film starring Juliette Lewis as a young interior designer with a troubled neighbor. Jane (Lewis) has recently inherited her grandmother's excellent 5th floor apartment and, with the agreement of the landlord, is ridiculously low in rent. His boyfriend (William Hurt as a horrible man) wants him to move with him, but he wants his room. So he moves, and the strange stuff is going to happen, and because it's a B-class horror, there is a pointless, non-discoverable-cause of reality. Because non-too intriguing Jane tries to tell others - her boyfriend, police, colleagues - what's going on, everyone thinks she's losing it. So, of course, she has to face the problem - one time enemy life. Not Scary or Interesting, Lewis is one of the sustainable armor of the movie. He's a very good actor, but it's badly used here, which doesn't mean he's not the best for this flick because he's. She has a wild charisma and keeps the screen better than a dozen silicone bibs that routinely fill this type of film. However, this type of film is not worthy of it - it is ironic, because it is probably the only reason someone would see it.
