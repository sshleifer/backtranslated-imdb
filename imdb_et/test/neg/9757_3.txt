Teenage exorcists are one of those terrible films on the video that makes the viewer quit the expectations of proper entertainment for low-eyed sexual men, adolescent humor, and empty writings. This movie offers exactly what he was trying to offer. It is a girl who moves into a house where she once lived with baron de Sade (hmmm) and was finally taken to her own inner demon. Her sister and brother, together with the Irish priest, her boyfriend and pizza delivery boy, are trying to save her and repel her demon. Well, not much here for horror or arrest. In fact, one movie takes quite a bit of the film to expect. Mike (the girl's brother) has bound her (the name is Diane by the way and she is played by Brinke Stevens) after she tried to slay her sister. He removes the mouth from the dick and says something like, "This is not the last gag we see tonight." Indeed, it was not. Special effects are cheesy and poorly designed and the film uses it when it plays its comic complaint. Some lines and situations are funny. Robert Quarry, the old Count Yorga himself, steals his scenes as a Irish priest. He hugs it into biblical verses and Irish songs. You know you're in trouble when Eddie Deezen gets the most bills. Deezen makes her schtick and has a few nice moments, but the material is just too harsh to be more than a teen sophomoric time filler. Michael Berryman also has a short but interesting movie from The Hills Have Eyes. As for the others, they are all quite mediocre. Stevens is a cute net of stockings and French-cut panties, but beyond that, she doesn't expect too much. His sister plays Elena Sahagun and she shows a little more than Brinke (a very beautiful young lady by the way) and works by Brinke miles away. His wife, played by Jay Richardson, shows his ability to act and be in the middle of the environment. Again, it is not a bad movie to waste a little time, which means NOT thinking. If you're a Robert Quarry fan, check it out at least for your action.
