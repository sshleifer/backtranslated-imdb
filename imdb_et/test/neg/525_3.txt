Some aspects of this production are good, for example, performances by Angela Lansbury, George Hearni, Cris Groenendaal and Sal Mistretta. But am I the only one who has disturbed Betsy Joslin's terrible performance as John? He's terrible! He slauters songs in his screechy voice and overacts the role he clearly does not understand. I also think the cream can't sniff. They drag the pace and make the worst facial expressions. In general, I think this production is fine, but Sweeney Todd can be as much as it does right. This production does not come close to the level of demand for this material. The concert version with George Hear and Patti LuPone is much better.
