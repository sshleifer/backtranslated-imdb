I saw this pseudo-intellectual mess a few years ago and it is now returning to the local film club. He uses all the keyboards of the Intellectual Film Maker Handbook (a release for beginners) to appear intellectual if the director is likely to be himself. You get the slow pace of your mill, the brown color scale, slow pans through bombarded environments, empty, suffering facial expressions, over symbolic images, and the unfortunate end you need. <br /> <br /> This is a complete failure, the inadvertent perfect caricature of a typical Russian art film. Directed by Alexander Sokurov, he is a great technician, but he has no eyes on it. He doesn't see if he crosses the pathetic kingdom of the line. <br /> <br /> This movie is a dreamed dream for the movie's wrestlers. It lives on every stereotypical perspective that exists. <br /> <br /> If it was entertaining, it would be turkey. However, for a movie that is so bad that you will later leave, we need a new term. This movie is Sokurov.
