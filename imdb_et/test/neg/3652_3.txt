MGM tried to mate and come to the young men with the divine to give them contact and try them as leading men. Gable and Garbol had chemistry at SUSAN LENOX, but it was a sad film. There is no chemistry between Garbo and Robert Montgomery in INSPIRATION and the script is also bad. What did they mean? Modern, fast-talking, smart and breakable Montgomery and long-lasting Garbo? It's a story like CAMILLE. A young student falls on the woman of the world and displaces her from studying her past, rejects her, takes her back, rejects her .... you get the picture. Garbo is absolutely believable as the top model of Parisian artist and completely at home, albeit boring, with his life at the top of society in the midst of his artistic friends and their free morals. Suddenly it has been fascinated by innocence. Finally, he gives up his life and sinks into poverty, but saves him and goes to his house. Ironically, he plans to marry and keep him on the side - so much for his pure moral ethics in the past. <br /> <br /> Scenes are incredibly boring and boring and nothing happens. Only Marjorie Rambeau, as Lulu, is capable of injecting such features as "Unfortunately, weak women have a strong appetite" and "Odette, where's your needle?" <br /> <br /> For Garbo fans only.
