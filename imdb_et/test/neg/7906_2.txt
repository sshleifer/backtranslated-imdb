"Soul Plane" is a terrible experiment in comedy, which should only pay attention to the pawn of thick skulls, blood-drawn eyes and hairs. The plot is not only inconsistent, but also non-existent, acting, in most cases, sub-parallel with the terrifying and terrible gang that has been thrown into poor measurement. never even a little fun. This film lacks any structure and is full of racial stereotypes that seemed old even in the fifties. The only thing she's actually done is some pretty ladies, but really if you want you to rent something from 'adults'. "part. OK? <br /> <br /> I don't see anything here to suggest, because you probably have a much better and more productive time when rats are driving, or inventing waterproof bags, or whatever." /> 2/10
