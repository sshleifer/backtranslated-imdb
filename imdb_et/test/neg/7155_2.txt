I just follow this comment because I was unable to adhere to the submission of a positive comment on the "complete information" page. I think it's a film I've ever made in my country. It is not only a terrible plot, a dirty English language and a tension curve that is as flat as our country. No, it is because it was a serious attempt to make a good action movie, to meet the Hollywood standard. It was supposed to be a "European Year of Action". To this end, they even hired the actress Fejda van Huet of the Academy Award winning picture "Character". I don't like bad movies, I can even enjoy them when they are unpredictable b-movies. but I don't get caught in the scary movies, but should be movies.
