Such B-films from the 1950s that were so much fun are what Predator Island respects. Filmed in Connecticut, Predator Island is set on an island called Hell Beacon, home to only a couple inclined to the lighthouse. In a typical 1950s sci-fi fashion after half a dozen young adult crashes on the rocky shores of their boat island, spooky creatures hit the island after the meteor. Beings begin living the bodies of their victims as well as destroying them. In this film, the main form of dialogue is a lot of tantrums and flat returns. It's so hokey that you have to laugh from time to time. If you are looking for a movie that is stupid but fun, it will fit the bill. <br /> <br /> Interesting note: I will appear in the movie as a dead body in the background of the final scene. They needed about 50 extras while filming, but about 300 people showed up. Finally, they used nearly 200 of them.
