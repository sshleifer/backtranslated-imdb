The book, though not very big, was decent, but this film alters it completely. Many elements of the story are consistent between the book and the movie, but Dr Ross's character goes from a creatively written character who lives for money and causes a volcanic eruption that his greed is at his heart - patient, who does nothing if he even tries to catch the slightest hint that it may be less than noble. If movies change the book so much but retain the same name, it should be a crime.
