If the film is not interested in the first 25 minutes, it's as much as I'm concerned about. This concept, which you simply have to deal with in the slow first third of the movie and pay later, is pointless. A good movie must start and be strong. Everything seems interesting and some decent shots and many promises, but ultimately confusing and irrelevant. There are so many others in Asia to watch movies, many of which I am sure most of you have not seen that I really miss and look elsewhere. Why exactly does IMDb require at least 10 rows for reviews? I told my piece and I hope it will help some of you move to the next movie.
