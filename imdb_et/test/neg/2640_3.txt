In a quiet city, a couple of girls see Milo, a strange young boy of one of his friends, who lives in the second half of the city. After his murder his body is found in the river and his pronounced dead. So sixteen years later, the wedding girls are pulling back to their childhood city and Claire's school teacher is getting obsessed with Milo's not dying because she has recurring visions of her and her friends are dying one by one and no one believes her when she claims Milo is separate. Now that she saw this movie, I was pretty skeptical, especially when it was on the front panel of "Anaconda Creators". , but reading the odd little plot sketch for videos, it sounded good and changed to refresh. Well, guess what? I thought it was a good idea at that time, but it was a completely different story while watching the movie. It seems that it was just trying to be smart and very psychological, but this last element didn't come out well for me and it was basically a long-lasting and mostly convincing thriller. Hey, I admit that it had its moments, but hardly enough that it wouldn't be effective cooling or memorable. But the filmmakers' bravo, at least this story, is not the transformation of the "dropping" imitators who followed the "Scream" and shock horror, no self-expression humor? in fact there is not even humor. Although maybe it was too serious? Especially because the plot is rather absurd, but it's not his main problem. What left the plot that we get, I didn't know much about what happened, because it seems to reduce many things that are favored by some supposedly shocking and disturbing sequences. No! More like irrelevant scenes and horrors that produce clich√©s that we see from time to time. You'll also see some effects from some of the "good" 70 horror movies, one of which is "Don't Look Now". That's when our protagonist continues to slip his past. The second one should be one of my favorites, "Alice, Sweet Alice," with a person who causes problems with wearing a yellow strap and death. An interesting idea, but it comes up pretty low and too many mistakes. I liked it more when the scenes dealt with the child's childhood, because the performances and circumstances were scary about it, but when it slides into its adulthood, most are tired and uneven and the performances were not terrible, but incredibly secular and barely involving is a good way to present it . Most of the dialogue left me incredibly nervous when it was natural and uncomfortable. You scream "no duh!" on the screen because you just can't believe what you hear. Police Detective Gets It Off! <br /> <br /> A high-quality smart movie is not bad, actually it's better than normal for the video I would say. Very slippery things. With some ingenious and outstanding camera angles and a weak score that works relatively well. Another factor that set the mood for the mood and was the key was the sliding sound effect and the fact that the bicycle clock did not leave the ears. The silent primary school setting was well done and the rest of the activities take place in the house. But do not expect any real intercourse or surprises, as they do not exist. Deaths are not pleasing and they are slightly bloody, and this is more with the consequences of these organs that are trying to disturb you. Thoughtful in this piece, Milo Jeeder, an average-minded child, was slightly nervous, well that the voice and the yellow slip start, but it seems to lose its effect when it comes to the conclusion of the films. The lines of video cheeses compare her (move over) with Jason (be careful) Freddy and (this is not a child's game) Chucky, but you have to make me joke! Is it? He's labeled "evil new face", yes sure. All he needs is to teach some practices and solve the problem. All in all, the film left me with a sour taste because I would have seen it. I probably wanted to do it. <br /> <br /> Just don't expect too much blur from this movie. Or even better just skip because you don't lose much, really.
