HIGH MANTIS will certainly not frighten anyone, but as sci-fi programmers go, it's better than most. The volcanic eruption on the southern edge melts a giant prehistoric priest on the north side. Military men go missing. Dr. Ned (William Hopper - son of Hedda Hopper and best known as Paul Drake in PERRY MASON) is called i.d. creature - but by that time the creature has eaten several Eskimo and is on the way to the Washington monument. <br /> <br /> About a third or more of the film is equipped with film material: old government educational films, military personnel in radar spaces, airplanes - and would you believe that Eskimos are at sea? What explains, of course, why the Eskimo tribe is attacked in the film. ("Hey, boys! I think we can do that?") Mix some tricky special effects, a somewhat confusing dialogue and some sexist attitudes, and you're good to go. Not as original as MONSTER, WHO IS OUT OF THE WORLD, but the "big mistake" of the 1950s enjoys it - and it's a good time for kids to throw on the popcorn screen. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
