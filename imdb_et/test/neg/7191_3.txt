When you read the comment of this movie, it is a smart and funny political comedy based on real events - the only real word here is that it is comedy. If you are told that this is an internal film about Russian politics - that is not the case. The film probably only has 2% of what actually happened in Russia during this election campaign. In reality, in 1996, the situation was a thousand times more interesting and it was a real funky election campaign. Well, there were PR advisers from the US who worked with Yeltsin's staff, but their role was minimal. The whole campaign was completely different from what is shown in the movie, it would be a lot of fun to show all the president's people who travel all over the country with paper boxes full of money and celebrities showing Yeltsin's support all over the place - at least that's true. I only give it three due to the respect of Jeff Goldblum, Antony LaPagglia and Liev Schreiber. And with machines on the streets of Moscow. I lived in a place where there were the most serious crimes in Russia in the mid-1990s and I never saw a man with a gun on the street.
