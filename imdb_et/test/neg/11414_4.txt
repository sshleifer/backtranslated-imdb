I'm surprised to see all these positive comments on this movie. Don't do me wrong, it's not that I don't like "such movies". <br /> <br /> While I am very pleased to enjoy the good-minded blockade of Hollywood action, such as Die Hard 4.0's "dogma" movies or "real-life-on-movies" as much as they are well done. <br /> <br /> A good example is Festen (1998): no music, no dramatic corners of the camera, no special fx, no fancy places. Just a good story with excellent performance and a great movie. <br /> <br /> Do nine live without dramatic camera angles, special fx and fancy locations? Yes, yes. Is this a good movie? I'm glad you asked. <br /> <br /> The answer is: absolutely not. <br /> <br /> First of all, everyone is sloppy about acting performances. I am terribly sorry, but you can do whatever you want, but if the story and the dialogue are not credible, it will work right away. And that's exactly nine lives. <br /> <br /> I've never felt in nine lives looking at real people who have a real conversation. I had the feeling that I was looking at the actors who were trying to become "real characters", that the "real person" never said anything in situations. </p>, but here are some excerpts from the dialog. If you think reading ten lines (ridiculous) will destroy your movie experience STOP READING HERE. If you want to laugh, continue reading. <br /> <br /> Dialogue was often so ridiculous that it was tragic. Want examples? Many of them are in nine lives. <br /> <br /> EXAMPLE 1: <br /> <br /> Shoot it. The couple will visit their dirty rich friends in their new mansion. She sees this house in the castle and tells her husband: <br /> <br /> Woman: I can get used to it (that is, expensive house). Man: Don't. Woman: Why not? It may be. Man: No. They are the ones they are and we are who we are. Woman: I like the sound - we are the ones we are. <br /> <br /> Does he love this sound? His man acts like a jerk, but he likes it. Then he walks away from the older couples. Woman doing this: <br /> <br /> Woman: Look! They are like children after school. They lived so much. Shared everything. I love you. <br /> <br /> Are they like kids after school? And then the most used clich√© lines you've ever heard of? Ending 'I Love You'? He says this when his man is his jerk? Yes, very logical, very realistic, NO. If anything, such a dialogue made me strangle some of the characters in the movie to say these terrible and terrible things. <br /> <br /> Example 2: Younger daughter at funeral. Father: I didn't know that Andrew was religious. Mom: It's comfort. Daughter: It's strong. Mom: Life is short. Father and daughter BURST OUT LUGHING. <br /> <br /> Yes, this single layer cracking at any time, especially at funeral! Sorry, I have to get out of here. <br /> <br /> And it goes on and on ... <br /> <br /> How does the camera work? Don't even go there. "Bored" would be a compliment. It had to be "realistic"; Instead, you leave half of the facial expressions (the only thing to watch in this movie), while half the time when the camera is directed to someone's back or side to face. <br /> <br /> Summary? Don't tell me I didn't warn you! It's a good movie rental if you want to make your date or something during the movie because you don't care if the movie is played or not in the first five minutes. <br /> <br /> Overestimated and more boring when looking at grass growth, it takes together.
