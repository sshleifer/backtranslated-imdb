This film is a good companion to Blair Witch because it makes so much wrong that BW did the right thing. As with BW, it is also a documentary of ghostly events, where each team member has their own camera. <br /> <br /> Reality, however, never exists. Participants are badly written cliché characters and events are equally clichés (cat jumps from closet, falling chandelier, etc.). It also speaks of an extremely attractive cast of dirty dialogue and an unsuccessful improvisation of docu feeling. AND worst, probably the cameras held by the participants are storing too many events too perfectly to be far from believable. In fact, it could have been Blair's witch parody when editing it again. In fact, there is a scene where a blonde historian eats sandwiches with a huge rooster, which is actually pretty funny, as reminds me of a similar gross point "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me". Ultimately, the event is played directly, without punchlines. It is hard to say what the intention was with the St. Francisville experiment, except for the exclamation of some stray BW bucks. But it is quite sad if the only real interest I can find was whether the blonde historian had to grab his t-shirt with a flat shot.
