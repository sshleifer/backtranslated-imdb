I recently took all three Robocop movies in one box, quite cheaply and the only reason I did it was great for the first edition. I've seen Robocop 2 before, but not 17 years, the year he came out. I've never watched it, because I still remember how disappointed I was when I discovered how terrible it really was. It is a complete confusion, it has all the signs of worrying production, so there are so many sub-plots at the same time. It is also very uneven and it is also one of the tears I've ever seen. I don't mind violence, the first was incredibly violent, but it's just unpleasant. SFX is also terrible even in the 1990s, saying hello to a bad stop. Also, drug trafficking, a child as an evil is just too much. Peter Weller had at least a sense of not coming back. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that he has a couple of nice gags, like thanks to the fact that you didn't smoke, and the baby baseball team who rob the electric store.
