It was a film that could have been great if there were not so many unnecessary historical inaccuracies and if the actors were chosen or made so that they would look a little more like real persons (not very difficult). Sissi didn't go to Mayerling to see his dead son, nor did he die on the street; they spent her on a boat and then returned to a hotel that was much more dramatic. I'm not sure about the marriage night, but I find it exaggerated that a woman who is waiting, strips the empress and leaves her completely naked (and in the 1850s) or that the emperor would be very proud to say "yes I finally put her in the court." if I know it happened right on the first night and no one gave him a prize as if he were a streetlight.
