I went to see that I suspect I hate it, I did. All this was wrong; it was like they filmed another book. Places and houses are very beautiful (if not somewhat unpleasant, yes, even the house was wrong for those parts) Keira was too modern, boring and, frankly, I found it uncomfortable to look. If everyone else saw Darcy as a sexual god, this writer saw her sexually disappointed and inadequate. Bingley was stupid and dippy (he didn't have to be) and Bennett was shown to be poor and due to some unknown reasons farmers were wrong and ridiculous. Just the idea that Mr Bennett would answer the door at his night, with the rest of the family who dressed his underwear for the night, is stupid. They had servants. Mr Collins was not modest and greasy but stupid and nasty, Georgina Darcy was ugly and old and Miss Bingley wore sleeveless clothes, what! Like! It is historically inaccurate and even the end is satisfied. I could continue the days. I hated it so much that it was not just like a book, but I'm afraid that for many people this is the first experience of these great novels, and that gives them the worst idea. The BBC version is so good that it's not even funny and all about this version is insulting its memory. In short, if you need to be sure that you have read the book for the first time or seen the BBC version, then you must blame it for what it is, what it is not!
