Demi and Woody are married, but they are poor. They meet Robert Redford and he's really rich. He takes pride in Demi and, as he is a gambling man, he makes a few "indecent proposals" for a million dollars with a small woman. <br /> <br /> You don't have to watch a movie anymore because you can sleep. Of course, Demi will accept the offer. If he doesn't have the first part of the movie. Of course, it affects Demi and Woody's marriage. If it has no other side of the movie. And, of course, credit is going to be fine when it comes to rolling. If this is not the case, there is no happy end to the ticket office. As for the rest ... The script is incompetent, the direction of the amateur, the performances are insignificant. I suspect that Redford, Moore and Harrelson are blushing and changing the subject every time a movie is mentioned. Do them - and more importantly - for yourself. If nobody offers you millions ... Miss It! <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
