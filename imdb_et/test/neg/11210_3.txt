This is a great movie for the first time in a ninja who gets acquainted. If you try to impress a cute little ninja, I would recommend playing this masterpiece. This is one of those special films that allows you to stay in larger parts without affecting the plot. <br /> <br /> Also, I wondered where the Teal ninja lies? Is the ninjas color like that? Is this normal? If I were attacked by one of these yellow or orange ninjas, I would die before laughing at my sword. <br /> <br /> And I finished my black star ninja test the other day, it was an option, it went pretty good. I found there were many questions about how to crawl and look bad. It's all about eyebrows and attitudes. In principle, the film could have been better if: 1. there were no color coded ninjas (or the color coded ninjas could combine with the supernova). 2. Joe died in the first two minutes and Patricia had to pay her. 3. Various monkeys were scattered throughout the file 4. Patricia did not speak and Patricia was replaced by another 6. The French man was also a black ninja 7 Chris Tucker, Whoopi Golderg and Chris Rock were added to the "comic" relief 8.
