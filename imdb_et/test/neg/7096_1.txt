When I saw this movie, I thought I was in a gymnasium in high school and I still feel that I have a Master P fee for an hour and 20 minutes or so that he took out of my life that I never get back. <br /> <br /> A man who has already posted is absolutely right. Master P is a wannabe mobster. Like all the rappers in this country, millions of people have sold rap cds to impressive white children in that country. It is common knowledge that the mob was not a black thing and the blacks could not be part of it. Unfair, because it can be a rapper, can't cope with it. Does this film paint Master P as a mobile phone called Nino? The script is terrible when it works to fit. Absolutely incredible. Looking for a link or something that said he was going to make another movie "The Black Sopranos" !!!! <br /> <br /> Please save us and stay with Nickalodeon. You are not a white mobster, not even your good actor Master P, please stay with your music to hear who's listening ...
