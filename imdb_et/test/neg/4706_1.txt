Well, Dude Where my car can be at least novel as one of the few Hollywood movies that seem to be written, cast, filmed and edited in less than one day. I can not honestly believe that this has been done (or that I promised my friends to sit down all over me). The jokes are too stupid and predictable to be funny, and the actors don't seem to be able to pull any funny thing if the script actually gave it. Strangely enough, unlike most nonsensical comedies, this movie is actually too much of a plot - every scene seems to use a new moral and uninteresting sub-block. Of course, they were obviously moral, but it didn't work at all. . This is the role that makes him into the next Richard Gere, just look ...
