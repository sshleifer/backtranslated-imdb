I went to this film with little expectation, knowing Uwe Boll's legacy as a film director and scriptwriter, and I was still disappointed. Uwe Boll finds a way to make every movie worse and worse. The general concept was not bad, the man who forever lives like a stockbroker lives, becomes a serum killer. But the film's problem is not between, he goes directly from the stockbroker to the serum killer. The film has no names, and I see why, after watching the movie, I don't see why any career participant would even want to include this movie. Anyone who did it off did his career. And if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and don't do it. <br /> <br /> I'll give Sanctimony three out of 10
