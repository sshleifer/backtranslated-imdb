This piece was viewed on ONDEMAND because the description was kind of extreme. This film seeps into cocaine, the opening scene alone has to have a film cost of at least five digits. It is a racist, homophobic garbage that moves along a good 1-hour and 22-minute absolutely no direction. I'm a little confused about how good the reviews are here. I'm not worried about talking about the line because there is no plot to tell me as much as I can. I'm pretty sure everyone showed every day that every day they made giant patterns dressed with Loretta Switt to see as much flapjack as possible and screamed. Unleash improvisation of cocaine frenzy. Like real beer, this film almost caused my liver. Save your money and see "Strange Brew" instead.
