For all appearances, this series could be done at any time since the mid-forties. Paper sets, kings of the month, with light bolts, sewn their aprons, you know the exercise. This is Rocky Jones's adventure, with space commander's communication with Offeecious's inadequate female queen, a communal plan that doesn't associate with United Planets. When the intergalactic noble messengers report that Offeecious is in the course of this second, vaguely Slavic planet, Bitch Queen decides to defeat other boys rather than evacuate their land. This leads to a moral "size of the nation not in his land, but in his people", which is worshiped five or six times in climatological talkfest. BQ's continuous nose coloring "OffEEEEcious" provides some relief from some serious cosmic effects, is it a TV show?
