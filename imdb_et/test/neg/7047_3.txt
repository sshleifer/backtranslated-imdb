Why see this movie? This prize is likely to be determined by the fact that the big movie star is the worst career move from Clark Gabi's ridiculous Irish patriot playing in Parnell. <br /> <br /> It is inconceivable that Bergman would choose a lucrative Hollywood career for both this film and its leader, where he could choose from the best scripts and directors available at that time. First of all, there was no script to work except for some notes. Then we should believe that polished Bergman is a poor refugee who wants to do something to get rid of the refugee camp, including a marriage with a poor Italian fisherman he doesn't even love. I read where Anna Magnan was the original choice for this part. If so, it made more sense than putting enlightening Bergman into this proletarian part. But as he loved his director, common sense flew out the window. So he lives in this poor village where men have to attack to stay out of the sea. A place where he probably hates and where he doesn't fit. His only friend is the village priest who knows that he does not fit the life of a poor fisherman's bride, but tells him that, in the interests of love, he must feel his real irritations and receive the poverty and despair he faces every day. In addition, this volcano is always on the edge of a recreation area and is drowned all over the hot lava. But like a real heroine, Bergman rebels against his misery, proclaiming the war on almost all other such ugly films. He goes so far as to try to attract a visiting priest in a scene that makes laughter if it is not so pathetic. Because her husband's bad slip must lock him in the room, he is forced to use his body to bribe a man to take him out of the island. For him, the sacrifice is not too great; no man who is impossible when he is ready to help him escape from the island and his misery. I don't want to tell you how it all ends. The end of the non-script movie is as credible as the rest of the STROMBOL. I even remember (late night on television) that he has two different ends! So be warned if you should be bold enough to sit through this king-size turkey and catch Bergman. This led to his downfall in Hollywood over the next seven years and he was condemned to sleep with his director, yet married to Peter Lindstrom. No film he made with this director (who he later married) is not remarkable, except as evidence of a career loss. I'm not doing you. It's quite embarrassing. <br /> <br /> - - SoundTrack
