I'm a big fan of zombie movies and it's just a pathetic attempt. I find that the best features of zombie flicks are the feeling of solidarity and the need to live. This movie focused more on "let's just it gory". <br /> <br /> The film was full of bad action and even worse special effects. When the zombies come out of the floor and the boy takes off, it is just spraying from the blood. I did not know that the holes in the floor of the aircraft bleed so widely. And the original zombie lady, Kelly or something, showed the worst behavior I've seen when she woke up and began to feel bad. I laughed pretty hard at the time of death. You deserve it. <br /> <br /> I was a little confused about why dr. Kelly spoke after receiving the zombie, but then there was nothing else the other zombie was talking about, as the annoying screams and shine. And they seemed to have killed the zombies quite effectively when they shot them in the abdominal wall, but when dr. Bennett has been taken out of the plane and the engine, removing most of his bottom, he can still live. br /> <br /> I thought they changed things to make a "good" scene. When one of the bitchy girlfriends (I didn't take the time to learn their names. They played a meaningless role) was in the bathroom, she was attacked by a mirror behind the zombie. Was it a two-way mirror to watch Mile-High Clubbers? I've never crushed an airplane mirror (bad luck and all that), but I doubt there is so much space there is in the bathroom and everything is very crazy. <br /> <br /> The redemption features were, unfortunately, too late. One thing the movie had gone to was the hot flight crew, but they felt the need to kill everyone except one. And I testify that I laughed pretty damn when the old lady forced Frank down and said, "He's worshiping me," or something to that extent. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I'm sad I wasted my nine dollars on this movie. The fact that I bought this minor buys it back, but still ... It failed on so many levels. Stay with the dead dawn and 28 days later.
