It was really waiting for Lonesome Dove to continue, but it was a complete waste. Cinema was terrible. Shot is too tight. There was almost a Grand Canyon watching through a stationary telescope. Editing was cut, cut, cut. Not even smooth. More like a bad student editor. Don't know if McMurtry was playing the screen, but the dialogue was terrible. Do you really like Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holiday at Wyatt Earp, but what the hell did he do with the character of Comanche Moon? I have no clue. Even it seemed that it was made on the soundtrack using the old Bonanza sets. How can the original Loneome Dove Director get this wrong? Where was his head .............. Can't say if the actors are. It is a disgrace that we shone on such a beautiful western rim that could have been, but more like they hurried to get to it. Read other comments and see that others felt the same way. Not even curious to watch the next few nights because it would be just a waste of time as the first night was. <br /> <br /> (Post 2) .............. .... OK, because nothing was on TV, I have to be honest and admit I was watching Comanche Moon's last 2 nights. And I honestly say I didn't do it until the end of the last two episodes because I was sleeping! I can only admit that I was very attentive to the two main characters and I can choose some of the motifs Steve Zahn did while depicting Duval's good work. So I have to give Zahn credit for that. As for the depiction of Karl Urban .... simple dead meat. It can be said once again that I was very disappointed only because I took care of so much of the original LD ​​and the like ....... has defended his feelings for a truly big Western world.
