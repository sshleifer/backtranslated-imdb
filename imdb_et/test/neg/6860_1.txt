I have liked watching the disappeared from the very beginning and tolerated some bad participants in badly written episodes because if good is lost, it is really good! But this episode, which characterizes Mr Echos' death, had so many drawn-out scenes with bad behavior that found himself in a fast forward button. This episode seemed to be the worst. In fact, the lost quality variation has been so inconsistent that I often question how many writers they use. <br /> <br /> I keep looking, but I hope things will improve and I hope I will cease the secret that the sub-parameters of the series will die.
