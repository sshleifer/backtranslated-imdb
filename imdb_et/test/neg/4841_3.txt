It is the first western part of Poland and is written and directed by Piotr Uklanski. Known as DEAD MAN'S BOUNTY in the US, this film uses some strange visual to tell a story that is short in dialogue. Val Kilmer plays the body and some scenes are through his dead eyes. Some inconvenient visual situations are actually comic in the way sick. My favorite is a young man who builds one of his fingers in cut gallows and really hangs the rope's strength. Only a "stranger" (Karel Roden) known cowboy finds a dead man (Kilmer), which he thinks he wanted a man. He takes him to the nearest town to collect the ball. He loses his body and potential hope in the gambling game with the drunken sheriff of the city (Boguslaw Linda) and has little townspeople turned against him if he has the reluctance of Katarzyna Figura. He manages to escape from a certain death and takes a small position in a dangerous "wildfire". One scene has a strange tendency to scalp wounds, swelling the gunpowder and the game. The body rotates over the chain because the sheriff reveals no peace. In this film, also known as SUMMER LOVE, John Davidson has sung a theme competition. However, it is west like a train wreck. There's something that says you don't look ... but you're doing.
