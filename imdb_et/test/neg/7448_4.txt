I was a big fan of the original Robocop. <br /> <br /> But saying that I was disappointed, this first order would be underestimated. <br /> <br /> There are many problems. <br /> <br /> Glossy, though the film can see that there are many seers, wires, cameramen, etc., which I think someone in Irvin Kreshner's family is completely unacceptable. <br /> <br /> Robocop has become a robot. There is no character in the spark of humanity. A real disappointment when it was thought that his "soul" had finally returned to the first film. Here is not his attitude to man and it is hard to understand. <br /> <br /> Caine is a bad villain. OK I know that the first movie, Boddiker, was better than average, mainly thanks to Kurtwood Smith's performance, but the usual solid Tom Noonan creates a character that you don't want to care for in one way or another. <br /> <br /> What happened to an old man? I appreciate that he did not reach where he is, being "nice", but the change in his character is not inconvenient. In the first movie, it is clear that he despises Dick Jone's tactics and attitude, and so far he is no better than Jones. Doctor Faxx is a poor replacement for the genius of Bob Morton's charismatic as unpleasant OCP. <br /> <br /> The sequences store a sequence in which Murphy is caught on the side of a Caine truck, harsh and disgusting, and rather displaces it. <br /> <br /> And finally. What is Musical Score? Don't tell me that Poledouris couldn't do it just because he worked at Total Recall at that time. The series (TV or movie) soundtrack is part of its personality. Part of its character. If you remove it, it will damage the knowledge of the characters we look at. So it's bad enough, but shame is Leonard Rosenman. His score here is spooky, camping and even bright. <br /> <br /> The story is moments fair. Here's a lot of originality. But it is trying to bring too many new things to one movie. The hob is a well-understood villain and the only truly pleasing "villian" in motion, Thumbs up to Gabriel Damon there. <br /> <br /> The final showdown between Robocop and Robocop 2 is also fun. > <br /> But for most of this longer working time this is a serious disappointment.
