A boy with an unlikely name Shy Walker is looking for a corn field with his two daughters for an hour and a half. That's the whole plot ... of course it's a bad actor. Walker drives a corn maze (corn? I get it! HAHAH ... not funny) and shouts "Girls? Where are you ?!" about 1000 times. For some reason, the carpenter-laughing voice laughs as he runs to the pumpkin (as the pumpkin laughs at him, yes OK ...). His daughters scream for most of the movie ... even if there is no reason to scream (maybe because they're still stuck in that horrible movie). Double girls straight out of The Shining appear at any time. Most corn in the maze looks the same so that the Walker search gets very old very quickly. The filmmakers realize that this film has nothing (even music is repetitive), so they try to make things interesting by turning the camera very fast, filming it upside down, adding smaller images of the same picture at different angles, using red lights for a corn look scary and the camera turning 360 degrees (at least I assume they were done intentionally, but they are probably just examples of incompetent film making). More often, when Walker moves through the maze, you don't see his face. I think the boy who keeps the camera can't look for that high picture. This film gives you a new recognition of the original "Dark Harvest" (which is not related to this film, except that it also contains a corn field). Don't be fooled by the R-rating. Walker says F word three times and now we have "R-rated horror movie", ugh. The scarecrow on the cover doesn't even see the movie ... and if you want the cheeses from the first movie to come back, you know that things are bad! Instead, we get the man's yellow boots running behind our hero (unfortunately he's dressed like Mr Walker, so I didn't even think he was being watched for a while). I thought the identity of the man in the yellow boot before Walker did it (the movie is almost over when he puts 2 and 2 together, natch). The end of the movie drags on and on ... and only if it's not slow enough is some slowdown! The last sound you hear (in addition to your laughter) is very bad dubbing. If you can't tell, this is the worst film I've ever seen. At least they didn't finish the second sequel with the promise!
