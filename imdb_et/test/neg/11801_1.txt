St. The Francisville experiment claims that "it's not walking in the forest," a direct blow to Blair's witch. When Blair Witch turned out to be a film that showed a simple suggestion to the viewer, then St. Francisville Experiement exceeds the viewer's patience. It has to be said, however, that it is meant for a classic camp. <br /> <br /> Warning: Spoiler is coming !! <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in a local theater where "paranormal consultant" Troy Taylor talked about making a movie. If anyone wants to see the upcoming information about this movie, stop reading here. For those who can't resist, read my friends and say everything. <br /> <br /> Mr. Taylor, a writer who has a fairly unequaled ghost story he claims is true, told the audience on this video screen that St. The Francisville experiment was not a documentary. Shock! Amazing! As if we didn't know ... He told us that all the scary discoveries that the participants did were staged and pre-arranged by the film producers. In fact, he told us that the last 15 minutes were not filmed in Louisiana, but rather in California. All four participants were real actors (I noticed I didn't say good ...). One of the participants is actually a special effect technician. <br /> <br /> What pleases me about this movie is that it declares everything is true. It is trying to overcome the Blair witch project, claiming it is true while Blair Witch was a scam. The amazing thing is that no one can believe this movie for a moment. The Saint Francisville experiment belongs to medieval films everywhere, so they are filled with terrible acts and fun features like "surrounded by white light" and "I love ghosts" so that the crowd can properly heckle, boo, jeer and sing "I love ghosts ! "<br /> <br /> Talk about the wrong ad. True stories are not filmed with staged special effects that look like neighboring scouts forming a haunted house. From the sandwich sandwich (oh ... scary ...) to the annoying Madison, "Seance", which is nothing more than a foursome who plays under Oujia's chair with two mice under the bed, The St Francisville Experiement is one of the embarrassing confusion of the film. The Lion Gate would be wise to throw or advertise this thing to the nearest trash compactor, as it should be: <br /> <br /> "St. Francisville's Experiment: Comic Look at Not Filming".
