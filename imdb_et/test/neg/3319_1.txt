This is definitely the worst vampire movie ever. I started watching the vampire right after the interview and I was deeply disappointed. Not only was this movie script as big craters as the big canyon, the film seemed to jump from one scene to another, leaving the viewers confused. Vampire Lestat, played by Stuart Townsend, was terrible, a good body doesn't make you an actor! The queen's end was too simple and unexpected, insulting the viewers' intelligence. I'll give it one letter because Aaliyah tried to do the best in her movie and the soundtrack is pretty good. Besides, I would recommend Anne Rice to take the ax and start hacking those who destroyed her glorious story.
