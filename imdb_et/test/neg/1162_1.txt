I got this movie fifty cents when I stopped doing business. I want my fifty cents back. Bad behavior, bad script writing, bad direction, historically inaccurate, even movie sound is terrible. This is not an offensive topic. I am one of many who find very interesting temporary films and real criminal films. The subject could have been considered more seriously, paying more attention to detail and accuracy, and the lack of respect for victims and their destroyed friends and family is sufficient to understand everyone. Also, little attention has been paid to what could have been caused by someone who started the strange behavior that Ed Gein had shown in their terrible crimes. <br /> <br /> Save your time and peace of mind. Don't look at this terrible movie. When you buy it, you have compassion. It's not a general waste, but ... you can throw the disc and use a plastic case!
