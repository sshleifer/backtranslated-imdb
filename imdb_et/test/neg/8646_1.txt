I saw this on the shelf in Blockbuster and thought it looked cool. DVD bag touted so many great actors and I thought to myself: "Why have I never heard of this movie?" Then I turned to the case and saw the director Lee Tamahor, so the answer started to explain itself. First of all, I want to capture the idea that a big movie is a big cast, but more importantly, I think I should explain why this movie is so terrible. Okay, the script is terrible and full of one-dimensional characters. This is the worst role I've played in Chazz Palminter and I'm surprised that he's doing something ridiculous. But underestimated, but talented participants have to earn their money. Palminter plays a one-dimensional police detective who goes down the stupid as well as the C-movie mobile. He, along with the head of Detective (poorly directed Nolte), is a big but simple Michael Madsen, and late Chris Penn (whose role along with Madsen was completely thrown out) make up the LA detective elite group whose mission is to release the city. sometimes at the end of the 30s or 40s. The film introduces a team that violates all laws to ensure that those who think they are above the law do not act in their city. At the beginning of the film, they crouched at the local restaurant of the police, grabbed the alleged cell phone (William Peterson) and brought him to what they call the Mulholland Falls. They will put him out of one rock at Mullholland Drive and it should show how seriously these guys release the city of crime. What ever. It was nothing more than an inexpensive excuse to use the title of crappy, which is meant to think of LA and its famous places. Somewhere later, they find Jennifer Connelly's body and the plot begins. <br /> <br /> The direction that was lacking for amateurs and WEAK! Apart from being a B-film quality, the characters, such as the police chief, Will Williams, are a surprise, and the terrible Daniel Baldwin are just some of the highlights that made this movie like Lee Tamhor's first film. There are no good performances in the movie except Melanie Griffith, some of whom say it was the worst in the film (she won the Razzie for this movie). In the end it was his character, which was not so big and he didn't have much work to do. As with any bad movie, it all starts with writing and this script was not a pearl. Ploting a plot is simply about creating the next scene and never taking into account the motivation of the characters. The way the characters behaved was incredible. Cops, who take the law into their hands, are credible in the right situation (see LA CONFIDENTIAL), but in that case, it seemed that these men could prevent something, including murder, and never see anything from cleaning. I think we have to assume as an audience that no one has seen anything and people do not ask questions. Everything about the story is predictable and it is fed so well that we understand everything that happens before the characters do. But it does not make us wise, but rather makes us angry when the hero is a hero, even though there are no heroes in this movie. Finally, the best part of the film was David Grusin's great score. From the very beginning, it was highlighted by CHINATOWN, which quickly disappeared when I realized how incredible it was in the movie. It didn't surprise me that I learned that it made eleven million in the ticket office. I say that this movie is worth watching some laugh. Nick Nolte's action is like an unsuccessfully domesticated junkyard dog and I laughed every time he tried to be serious. I also fell on the floor of almost every movie's slow-to-use frame (I think one is in the middle of the main fighting phase). If you need to slow down the dramatic moment of heat, you have obvious problems. So, even with my negative criticism, I recommend this movie only for the sake of laughing, ie if you appreciate good movies like LA CONFIDENTIAL.
