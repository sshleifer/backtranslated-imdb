This movie is bad. Just bad. In absolute numbers it is bad. <br /> <br /> The dialog pops out of the screen and slides you deeply artificially on your face, and then removes the ability to detect even traces. Racism is bad. Racism in Los Angeles can be particularly bad. I live in the city of angels, I can confirm it. What's so frightening in Los Angeles is his insidiousness. It slips with you with a conscious glance or a swallowed word. Until it is full of fights, it almost never comes out and says, "Why should he be black!" <br /> <br /> I see quite clearly that the car's bushings are black, the detective partner is Spanish, and DA is white. As long as the projector has a film rolling, I can bring the visuals, the music and the words to this conclusion without just getting the conclusion. The characters appear and read the relationships and conclusions between the lines. <br /> <br /> This is a partnership and trust between a filmmaker and an audience. This film violates this trust. <br /> <br /> A good movie will draw you into the audience and it will guide you to tips to drive to the point. This movie strikes you at your point and offends you and your intelligence. My unanswered question is why did we collectively say, "Thank you?"
