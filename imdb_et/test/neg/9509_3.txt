True, the only reason I watched this movie - since it's been about ten years after its release - was because of Ian Holm; I was intrigued to see how she represented another favorite character in her game. In any case, this film is as harsh as the Old Zeff has produced from "Jesus Nazareth". However, some of the best parts of the games are excluded. I understand the control / editing options, but I don't think it plays correctly. Maybe I'm too crowded. I should direct the people (who have read it far) to the Branagh version if it were not that I despise his tendency to over-dramatizing. However, he plays a better Hamlet than Gibson. But did we all expect Gibson to be an actor? Now, all he has done is to prove that he wants films out of dead languages. <br /> <br /> ... Maybe the only Shakespeare acting here is to act like Scofield like Ghost.
