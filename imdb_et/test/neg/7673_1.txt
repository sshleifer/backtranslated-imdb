Last "Airport" sequel. It's Alain Delon and George Kennedy (who was in all the airport films) as pilots; David Warner (!!!) as a radio engineer; Susan Blakely, the death leader who has died; Robert Wagner is a great scientist (stop laughing!); Eddie Albert as President of Airlines; Charo's terrible "comic"; John Davidson as a Journalist (I love how his hair stays in place after the plane is back!); bad Marta Raye is humiliated; Cicely Tyson plays with a mother who drives her dead son to heart (cut off eyes!); Jimmie Walker as Clarinet Player (What Didn't I Speak?); Mercedes McCambridge as a Russian gymnast (you can laugh at it); Bibi Andresson as a whore and Sylvia Kristel and Sybil Danning for the sake of love. <br /> <br /> Just pathetic. Full of foolish plots and a dialogue that will take you - see how Davidson's "married" ends! Concorde takes all these people to Russia. They attack missiles, escape, landing safely in France and RET the next day !!!! Don't you think the flight would be canceled or something? Most of the actors are terrible - McCambridge has a vision to see a red fear wig and a terrible fake. The only good actor is Kennedy and Delon (looking fantastic), who give very interesting results. It's still not enough to sit around you this generation. Special effects too long and evil. It was a mega-bomb and (fortunately) stopped the universe from doing it.
