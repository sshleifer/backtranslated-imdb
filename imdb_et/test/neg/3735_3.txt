Knowing Minnesota is not really a road film, but it is still the best category I can create. The road movie does not depend primarily on a great story, and because the plot of this film is really pathetic, it fills that description. To be interesting, such a film must be based on fully moving and intriguing characters and their chemistry. Unfortunately, Finning Minnesota employees are not fully aware of this excitement. <br /> <br /> Character representation is not satisfactory and confusing; For example, I can't figure out if Jiaa (Keanu Reeves) grew up in her mother's and brother's house or not. His mother (Tuesday Weld) says he must live with his father, but nothing in the film suggests that it will ever happen. The same goes for the rest of the characters - I never know them. They seem irrational and do not give any real explanation as to why they do it. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I leave the movie without the sense of the characters, except for the darkness and maybe a small blow to the cute Cameron Diaz.
