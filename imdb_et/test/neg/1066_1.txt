I really hate and despise this movie and the filmmakers behind it. <br /> <br /> Of course I am all about making a difficult and honest film about youth and youth culture. 1987. 'River's Edge' is a great example of a well-made teen drama. But what I take as an exception is the infantile, silly and sensational approach taken by the "2:37" makers. <br /> <br /> The main example is how it raises so many questions and nevertheless does not have any significant opportunity to comment or reach any resolution. <br /> <br /> My second big problem with this movie, besides the complete plagiarism of Gus Van Sant's "elephant" (surprised by Van Sant), is his attitude to the "bull freed in the Chinese shop" on rather delicate issues, incest and especially suicide. <br /> <br /> In short, avoid a movie like a plague and something that the filmmaker will ever do. I've heard that his motivation to produce "2:37" can be based on lies. Having seen a non-standard result, it is not surprising to me. It is a praised student film exercise that has no place in the cinema or DVD. Clean and simple.
