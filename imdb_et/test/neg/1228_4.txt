I, like many people, believe that the 1989 epic Lonesome Dove was one of the best Western countries ever produced, perhaps the best. And knowing that most of the successes (in this case prequel) are definitely disappointing, my expectations were low. Comanche Moon met this expectation with his marginal leadership and action, poor casting and, frankly, sad script. <br /> <br /> Loneome Dove created Captain McCrae and Call's heroes as Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones were very capable. Before living in Lonesome Dove, we believed that they fought bravely to get rid of Texas bandits and wild indians. <br /> <br /> If I had only seen Comanche Moon, I think these two boneheads were a couple of incompetent, cowards. In Lonesome Dove, Call and McCrae allegedly called Blue Duck in Texas and could never beat or kill him. In Comanche Moon, he persuaded Call's launcher to live and grow the herd. There was no proper fistfight or weapon fight across the minis. The best punch was McCrea sucker, which captures Inez Sculli, a funny scene, but was not a McCrae character. Where was McCrae's spirit and charm? Clara's love for McCrae, drunk, unearthed slut and filming was absolutely incredible. And Maggie's love for speech, disassionate and sullen lonely, violates the logic. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was great, better than the original. The credit card does not only involve HD technology but the operator. Comanche Moon minisums were better than anything else on television for three nights, but unfortunately it doesn't speak much.
