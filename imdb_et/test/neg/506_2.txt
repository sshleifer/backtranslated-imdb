It's a movie that sounded like a Hollywood author's death. With over 40 million bucks, the gate of heaven is so poorly prepared and executed that every area of ​​failure will collapse. What I like most is that technically it is a very bad, unforgivable sin for the money that went into it. Talking to John Hurt at Harvard is unheard of, as is the conversation between Kris Kristofferson and Richard Masur at the train station. Some people think Cimino saw it as "style". He didn't. It's just a bad sound recording. The characters are not particularly well drawn except for four or five drivers; it is hard to say who are bad guys and who are good guys in the fight against climate. Even at this level, enjoying a movie is impossible. Casting Isabelle Huppert into a town mayor is a joke, his French accent makes all character deceptive. Operation is generally rigid, without any degree of sensitivity or depth; even Christopher Walken is bad. John Hurt's character is the only one who has some shaking or vitality (though Hurt, in his 40s, playing a fresh-faced Harvard degree, whose bags are under his eyes, is probably ridiculous). <br /> <br /> I think you say it's too long. The roller skating queue could have been easily cut, the chef's victory scene is quickly turning into a movie cliff, and the final scene on the ocean liner is out of the Twilight zone. Having Rod Serling appear in front of the camera to explain what we were just looking at would have been the perfect finale. In fact, these scenes are not bad in themselves or in themselves, but Cimino has no right to include them, because what he gave us the picture of "meat" is so unlikely to be bad. Editing is bad, especially at the peak of a big battle. At one point, three different times are used to burst the same wagon with the same explosion. I wish I could say something - something - nice about this movie: great scene, great performance, even one memorable dialogue, but I can't. It's just one big sacred mess. The only thing I did was the cinematography and Montana locations that are stunning. Even Cimino couldn't shut it down. It's a long, boring, bad movie by all standards. And people who say he's only getting over the cost are just kidding. 1/2 * 4
