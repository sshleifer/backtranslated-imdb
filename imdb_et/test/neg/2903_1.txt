It can only be described in one word and it would be WOW! Wow, I really didn't think such a mess could ever get rid of. If you look at a movie called ninja, you expect at least some cool martial artists, right? But none of these men know any martial arts and it seems that they went to China and chose the first people they saw on the street and trained them in martial arts, what is their martial arts skill level! The actors are so exaggerated, the special effects are ridiculous and there is no point in making any sense. This is the worst martial art I've seen and I've seen a lot!
