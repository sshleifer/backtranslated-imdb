It's hard and I didn't expect it ... But it's really the worst movie I and my wife saw. Sensitive dialogues that go unintelligible over time, with no obvious reason, except for time. Storytelling does not follow a holistic way of understanding? everything is a mess. Activities and dialogues appear as jumps. Most disappointed was I seeing Dominique Pinon one of my French favorite actresses in it? uh ?? I don't even know how to describe it without being polite? The rest of the participants, the poorest. Susan Paterno interpreted her character terribly, making uniform inaccuracy. Poor special effect. I don't think it was a complete waste of the movie, but is it close? When I say I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie. I think it would be a waste of time. Sincerely I never say anything about this movie, but ?? there is always the first time.
