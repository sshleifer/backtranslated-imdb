This film is a cone. It's quite disturbing to see that someone can say it's the best film of the year. What can I say? Bad behavior, bad action scenes that end up being comic. Excuse me, if it was a comedy, I didn't understand it. If I was sorry, I'll smile at the tent scenes! Do it yourself - go instead to look at it! Good night!
