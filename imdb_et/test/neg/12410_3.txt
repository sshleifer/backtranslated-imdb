Return: A single swordsman who lives in the desert and acts as an agent for other swordsmen reminds us how his life turned out to be such. It started with the fact that the woman she loved chose instead to marry her brother leaving her home town. One swordsman is Huang, who is himself in the midst of a complicated love story, where a woman wants her to be killed for having gone away from a promise to marry her younger sister. But the sister wants to hire a swordman to protect Huang, and everything is put to the edge if the woman and her sister are actually the same person. <br /> <br /> Comments: I've seen the Redux version released in 2008, the original in 1994. As these two options differ, I can't say, but Redux is very stylized in China's Wuxia action. This is unfortunate because this style seems to me to be one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining film. An understandable story. But it's true to its style and visual elements that it's much more important and much more focused on writer and director Kar Wai Wong. That's why there are many colorful, very beautiful scenes that aren't completely related to the story. <br /> <br /> Editing and scheduling the story is also wrong. There are many scenes left in the scenes, the timeline is broken and confused. A very slow and peaceful scene is suddenly mitigated by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated struggles, but something different and independent to alleviate them. The result is a confusing and very uninteresting movie. <br /> <br /> Thanks to these cruel but very few battles, the movie is set to act. Poster and photos also mean it, but they can almost be considered as false marketing. Only a few minutes out of 90 could do something similar, the other could not be further away. The movie as a whole is very slow, boring and so very boring. Even scenes filled with rare activities will not help because they are disconnected from the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> It can be said that I am not a fan of this Chinese style because they often seem to have suffered from the same problems, most importantly, that the visual is more important than the story, but Time Redux ash is perhaps the worst example I've seen. <br /> <br /> 3/10
