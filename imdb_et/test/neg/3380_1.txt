Although I can say the pathetic episode of the night gallery in two words, these two words are "horseshoe", I have a duty to write at least ten lines. This is a very sophomore episode, not worth Rod Serling's standards, but rather an unsuccessful attempt with some ironic black comedy. The assumption of huge rodents who live for a month, the orphan orphan is sure to be totally ridiculous, as is the construction of a giant mouse trick. I think we also have to assume that the moon is made of green cheese and that these absurd beings survive. I can only assume that this episode was presented as a filler to replace the other two episodes that first appeared on that date. All in all, it is a waste of time for films, actors and air.
