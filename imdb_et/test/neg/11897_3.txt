One might think that anyone who starts following up on a 30-year-old native public servant would try to respect at least the original with an inspired vision, but not. Here is a kind of biopsy of one of the most stylish people of the late 20th century who don't know any style. Indeed, the filmmakers have put together some outstanding actors - and have given them a gravel grade for processing. Everything in the infrastructure of this movie is wrong, starting with a script that is another condensation of a big-life TV movie, where every other line is "famous quotation" by the subject and every other scene is inside your interface introduction to the subject's life to the next to the central character. We get Swoozie Kurtz as PR maven, who promotes Crisp as a state entertainer; Denis O'Hare, as an editor of a film-based journalist hiring Crispi, becomes somewhat alienated from him when he seems indifferent to the passions of 80's AIDS activists, and then returns to the fold as a compassionate friend of octogenaria; Jonathan Tucker (with a fine) as a shy, insecure gay-themed canvas artist who is friendly with Crisp; and finally Cynthia Nixon as a performance artist and Woman-About-Bohemia Penny Arcade, who is interested in Crispi's personality as a traveler. Nixon is a convincing and talented performer, but the script doesn't give him any chance to embody all-to-earth and streetwise arcade. Crisp spent the past 20 years in one room in an old rental building in East Village, Manhattan. He said he had never cleaned up, because "in a few years, dust will not be worse," or something like that. But looking at the image of this apartment in this movie, you would never get that dusty taste. He visited a local coffee shop on a busy journey and would see it pretty much every day of the week when he was eating and watching the world. In this movie we get a canteen that looks like the 12th Avenue on the Hudson River. Most "New York Streets" have a sterile, unrealistic appearance that has no sense of time. <br /> <br /> The soul of this movie is great in the role of John Hurt. After nearly 35 years, he can still understand the nature of this special post-Edward-English language and put it over to the third millennia. His every line, every gesture is subtle. In later scenes, he even modulates his vocal prediction to suit a person whose life is toward death. Crisp wrote shortly before he left the world that, when he grew up very much, very old skin takes on the character of a stinky coat that cannot be removed and one of which dies to death. One feeling is the feeling of Hurtis. So he and his film alone are worth it.
