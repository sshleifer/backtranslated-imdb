GEORGE AND MILDRED was a twisted turn of the MAN HOUSE since the mid-1970s. Although I haven't been to the last one, I don't remember that most of the comedies that come from having a funny couple living next to the snobbish Fourmile family are quite entertaining, something like LOVE THY NEIGHBOR without cynical racist gags. <br /> <br /> Having seen this "big screen version", I ask myself what is it? Definitely not popular in the mid-70s to sit with the same name. For some reason, the film has all the television-related relationships, as George and Mildred leave the street where they live, and get into a plot that includes some serious gangsters who want something that George has accidentally taken and which causes some concern about situations and traits like : <br /> <br /> "Did he give you" <br /> <br /> "No, this is the first time a man has held my charms" <br /> <br /> "I was thinking on the envelope "<br /> <br /> You get the impression that the scriptwriter Dick Sharples (who did not write the original sit-com episode) has never seen the source material episode and has been confused with the CARRY ON movie series. In many cases, it is similar to the latest LOST IN SPACE movie with the same mistakes that it has absolutely nothing in the series that created it
