*** May contain spoiler *** <br /> <br /> I had very high expectations for this movie based on the trailer. I knew a little about the actual Ed Gein, so I thought it was the average budget for real events. The man was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, there was an eight-layer writing that hardly knew anything about Ed's history and pulled the script out in about 20 minutes. The film completely crosses Ed's most interesting facets and her relationship with her mother (not to mention what the real police found in her house) and decides to concentrate mainly on young deputies who look like she just traveled to the kit. Similarly, all male characters seem to have their dialogue on the whole film. I'm not exaggerating. <br /> <br /> Don't start with the historical pawns of this movie. Seriously, who the hell drove it? This film should take place around 1957, but police officers carry modern side handles, some of the items in the hardware store look like prisoners from Lowes, and when the policeman reaches the payphone, he chooses 9-1 (1 wasn't there). Ed was also a little guy, scary like Anthony Perkins Psychos (who was supposedly the basis for real life), not the guy who got too much like a bad man on black. The other thing that really made me wrong was that the makers of this movie did the whole thing abandoned in 3 buildings. Due to the angles of the "smart" camera, you will never see any real city, and the inside of the sets seemed old, long abandoned. Pop-cat and catch! - Direct Hardware Store <br /> <br /> I am usually pretty forgiving about low budget horror movies, but it just comes up for it. All you had to do was most of the real events (even decorate them!), Pay five good actors instead of 15 raps and Pete's time to take 5 minutes and think about the time period. My advice: Google Ed Gein, you have a lot more entertainment.
