This is the first film I watched at Ed Wood, Italy, Demofilo Fidani, Miles Deem. The title above was superfluous later because there is another similar title in 1961, featuring Richard Basehart, one of Hammer Films 'Michael Carreras' and only west; the real Italian title was originally translated as his name was SAM WALBASH, but they called him AMEN, although it was actually the Italian version of WALLACH, which means of course the respect of Hollywood actor Eli! Although they are certainly not badly bad, cases of awkwardness and inaccuracy are abundant, so I often burst into smiley skins: a frightening number that would have become irresistible in French chanteus; completely irrelevant to the bar room; makers who shoot; an obsolete villager who makes expressive dance; inefficient use of slow motion (even abuse); and easily the most inconvenient, seeing Gordon Mitchell and Lincoln Tate, who play two armed forces winners (names of sports event owners!) who have been redeemed by a villain to kill the character of the title and never appear in the rest of the movie! ! <br /> <br /> Leading actor Robert Woods is just that it is even impossible to whisper Amen's bodies of victims. Supporting actor Simonella Vitelli (actually the director's own daughter!), Because the villain is widespread, but unfortunately she can't do much in the movie? despite the change of heart to the end. The main musical theme is really good, but again the title song itself is rather weak.
