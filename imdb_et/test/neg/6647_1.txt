This movie was a complete disaster for me. There is one thing films have to be observable, and that is * some psychological credibility ... unfortunately this is not the case here. The main characters behave irrationally for most of the time, and even if they have no reason to do so, the director has not published it to us. The character of Sophie Marceau is particularly irritating, taking pictures of everything throughout the film, if one could expect more rationality (for example, meeting with her mother in the hospital) and why did she get married to this guy? (No, it's not a spoiler) Sometimes a plot that is some soap opera seems to be, and while the actors' power is not bad, it doesn't help much. All in all, I just couldn't find a way to connect this movie. Not that I tried too much for the first hour. I have never left the cinema at the time of the movie, but that time was closest to my life.
