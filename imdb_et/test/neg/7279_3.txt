This movie was suggested by several people and after reading this site's positive comments I went on and bought a copy of the movie from the ebony. Acting in the movie is a medium and a bit of a hammy, especially by the cannibal family, one order comes to mind when Jupiter ransack and kidnap the burnt body, talking directly to the camera. He's one of those performances where you just hurt and feel bad about this bad actor. This is also evidenced by some of the worst edits I've seen, there's a terrible jump right in the middle of his "speech". However, there are a few crappy moments and sometimes the music works well ... but the film is not that big and I don't know why people think Wes Craven is a great director. So far, he has not shown me that I believe it is brilliant, the only thing that has improved with Cravens films was the production of his budget to produce.
