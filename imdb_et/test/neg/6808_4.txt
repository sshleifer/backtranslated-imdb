Warning, front spoilers (even if I doubt anyone has seen it yet) <br /> <br /> The film starts pretty well, but about half of it breaks down and becomes sharp, sweet, predictable, and unrealistic "harmony of harmony". I think it is very obvious that there are serious problems with the marriage of the main characters, but these problems are not solved but simply forgotten. <br /> <br /> Basically as soon as she decides behind the child (without even asking) all of their problems will magically disappear without any trace or explanation. Considering what happened until the moment, it would have been much more logical if the marriage was to break apart rather than to become a trite and a clich√© "with a child changing everything" ends. <br /> <br /> Two main characters: "Families and neighbors are also extremely one-dimensional and do not seem to have any purpose unless irritated by the viewer, and they disappear mysteriously from the camera as soon as harmonious moments begin. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to hang this movie, but from the beginning I would have expected more. 4/10 for me.
