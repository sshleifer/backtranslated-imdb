Yes, the fool is the word of this actor. I know many have mentioned his beauty, but this viewer found he was empty and boring to look at his bleached hair, lip gloss and not so perfect body. Watch her walk in these jeans, showing a pretty big ass. His butt spreads over his shoulders. What does that tell you? As a leading man, played by gorgeous Mark Humphrey, he was completely cast. Wizard. But he and Lancaster just didn't fit. He was against this good-looking man. Good to act as a sister to Susan Glover. Angela Galuppo's role was small and it was fine. But Philippe Gagnon, the director of the film, wasted too much material on Lancaster. After a while you are tired of looking at him and looking at his dull ability. And what woman was his wife. Hit your spouse, being unpleasant and just plain corrupted. He was happy to see him hit by a strike gun. I thought it might be his end. But unfortunately the script tells us otherwise. After torturing myself and watching this loser again, I came to the same criticism. Lancaster is boring to watch. This time his hair, people. His hair constantly on his face, constantly tossing back, became annoying. I ask the writer, Alexandra Komisaruk, why a good-looking wealthy man, like Philippe, would be bothered with a similar bimbo like Allison. If there were so many attractive intelligent women who had a class, choose. He does nothing. Is that the Rochester / Jane Eyre thing? It's all a matter of taste, I think. This Sarah Lancaster is not my cup, people.
