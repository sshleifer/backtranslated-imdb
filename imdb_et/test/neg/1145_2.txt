I'm a fan of some film, but when the movie franchise goes from a big screen to a TV screen, you know it's out of steam. Made for TV National Lampo movies do not work well on television. This movie is another reason. <br /> <br /> I think many of us were excited when it came out, but we also had to deal with reality ... this is a TV movie. Randy Quaid is good, like Cousin Eddie, but is better than a leading role. Dana Barron sets history as the first actor to repeat her role as one of Griswold's children. She is just as beautiful, but it doesn't help with a thin script. <br /> <br /> Why was this movie even made? This was probably because NBC recently received a couple of years of X-mas vacation. There is nothing wrong with acting. It's all in the script. It's not that funny. People have to think before they write such things. This is one Christmas movie I don't want.
