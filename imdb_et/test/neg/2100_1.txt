The land on the train is a movie I rented because I had the clean idea I had about the film. The snakes on the plane were an enjoyable Action movie, so obviously the filmmakers wanted to succeed with this small budget effort. After 85 minutes Snakes is a Train almost unrecognizable. I had to stop the movie to do something about the lack of entertainment in the movie. Throughout the duration of the film, it has never been fully explained why this girl is a curse, or why she constantly coughs up this green / flower flower. Not only is there an endless boring dialogue between two main characters, Brujo and Alma, to discuss how to get rid of the curse. I appreciate film making with a low budget. I'm not really picky about movies, I'm open to any genre or budget, but the Snakes train really is one of the worst horror I've ever seen. Did Acid writers have something like this at the end of the movie? Why did a woman suddenly become a giant snake? and most importantly, how was it possible to eat a train on earth? <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Snakes is a Train is a movie that must be avoided at all costs. Don't be interesting as I was heading, it's a movie that is really bad. Let's put these snakes to rest <br /> <br /> 0/10
