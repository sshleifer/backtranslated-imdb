John Travolta repeats his role as Chili Palmer, a Hollywood gangster who is now turning his eyes on the music scene. Using her "negotiating skills", she tries to launch an independent record label with a murdered friend's wife, played by Uma Thurman, and try to get her young singer (Christina Milian) hit. <br /> <br /> Before I saw this sequel, I heard it was a terrible movie. Be Cool, however, is an enjoyable comedy, even if it's not as good as the original. This time the film focuses on the music industry instead of the film industry. The film is portrayed very badly in the film and uses a number of flat stereotypes. I can't tell if it was intention or not, because Get Shorty did a nice job of scamming the film industry. The same cannot be said for the sequel and the tests are just lazy. <br /> <br /> The impressive cast is the one that records the movie from drowning. The best result is The Rock and it's nice to see him in a different role. Vince Vaughn also gives a funny show, although he started annoying before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman gives an average score and I was expecting him more. John Travolta returns to Chili and he does a good job. But his performance is boring. Christina Milian gives a terrible performance and she's not a good singer either. Cedric's entertainer gives a good result, although he's not in the movie for a long time. There are also a number of bonnets, including Steven Tyler and James Wood. <br /> <br /> F. Gary Gray controls and struggles. He just doesn't handle the movie very well and the film is such a mess. There were also tons of product placements and for some time it was annoying. Even after 118 minutes, the movie is too long and has a lot of slow spots. The film had to be changed badly and it was not obvious. Fortunately, filmmakers are able to rise above the weak point and script and offer funny scenes. Sometimes the film tried too hard while it was really funny. The sequel does not mean well compared to the original. But Be Cool is a rather harmless and forgotten comedy. After all, Be Cool is worth the rental and that's it. Rating 6/10
