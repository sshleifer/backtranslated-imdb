I looked at DEATH MACHINES as part of the BCI Eclipse 'Drive-in Cult Classics (which includes Crown International Pictures) on DVD. As I work my way through several DVD sets, I grow to love many Crown International movies - especially horrible, erotic, psychological thrillers! <br /> <br /> MOTHER MATERIALS are not one of them. <br /> <br /> Having seen movies like MALIBU BEACH, CREEPING TERROR and PINK ANGELS, it's hard to say it's the worst film ever made; but it doesn't have that much. <br /> <br /> There is no plot; there is really no story to talk about. <br /> <br /> Action not obvious? Only terribly played Tony (with a thick, fake Italian accent) tried to "get into the character." <br /> <br /> The result is tedious and pedantic. <br /> <br /> The only thing in this movie is why ... which forced the filmmakers to make this movie? <br /> <br /> Did they think the story was: 1) three ninja, 2) two competing bosses, 3) character of wage worker / karate school student; and 4) was his compassionate love-loving sister so convincing that the world would not be complete without making this film? This is a complete waste of time and money for you, me, the producers, the writers, the actors and the director.
