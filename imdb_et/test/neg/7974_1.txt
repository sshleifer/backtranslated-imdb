The first question is: how many talented idiots do you need to screw a movie? Answer: One is more than enough when he writes and manages the script. The second question is: did anyone teach the participants to handle the weapons properly? Answer: hell no. I don't know if Kristy Swanson got hot with brass, because it went so! The third question is: how many times did we make the "super secret government agency conspiracy open from the inside" plot? Answer: A good couple too much! The fourth question is: is Michael Madsen and Ron Perlman overrated? Answer: In this movie, unfortunately, yes. The fifth question is: will a few pairs record this movie? Answer: Even three (Kristy Swanson's couple and director / writer) did not. <br /> <br /> God ... When I see the (most likely) assassin that his weapons are hit, and then the Moron from the bull crew give him a completely different first bloody thing in the fucking movie, the "suck" meter hits the top. Time from the start of the movie to turning off the TV: fifteen minutes. A little more than what I had in "Alone in the Dark".
