I have to say that Krasinski is the only reason I even watched this movie. He's good. But everything else about this movie is so much lower than average that the time and effort spent watching this movie is not worth it. <br /> <br /> This movie contains a lot of technical / aesthetic problems: namely, shooting options, framing, camera movements in monologue sequences, extremely poor editing (probably due to the total lack of power in and between frames) and overall terrible operation (except for Krasinski) ). <br /> <br /> It was too theatrical (acting and presentation) to develop some arresting moment in this movie ... which is surprising because it is a bank robbery, which should be at least somewhat exciting. <br /> <br /> How did this movie get bad and then released and then shared? <br /> <br /> Reminds me of a C-film student thesis project, probably not even that good.
