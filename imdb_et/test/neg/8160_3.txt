"San Francisco, Oo, admire the city, thank you, God, for destroying it, and for the fall of our bricks on our collective heads, and despising dozens of thousands of your innocent, obedient sheep, O Lord, who is so merciful on your heavenly ways ..." be the songs of this oh-inspiring and totally frantic movie title. <br /> <br /> The film starts well enough because Gable discovers a crazy Cinderella's very annoying but very welcome opera voice, and she will soon be shooting at the starter. One of the many problems our Cinderella is having is that she is played by Jeanette MacDonald, who, when "takes time" to look through all this make-up and 30s glitz facade, realizes she is kind of ugly. Anyway, this role is too ugly to play. Yet Gable and everyone else is here everywhere like fucking beauty or something. The problem with Cinderella is also that his character is so modest, healthy, innocent, loving God, kind and generous - enough to vomit in the whole hour. MacDonald plays his (though one-dimensional) role with "ahhh", "oh" and "ooh", which rather disturbs than sympathetically. <br /> <br /> Tracy has been better and had better roles than playing this gold-plated, golden heart, God-loving, non-child moral priest (who boxed in his "free time" as if the priests did something - if cute). Even more reliable Gable does not meet its usual standard; he is too animated and his character is too self-evident for someone who should be an ambitious western "stupid" (although this is of course a script guilt). <br /> <br /> The plot is basically this: Gable and his rival Holt play a ping pong Cinderella - using him as a ball. How? Well, first he works on Gable (then sings), then works on Holt Square, then he goes back to Gable to get back to Holt very quickly. (And of course, both want her to become a girlfriend / husband.) And if the earthquake hadn't interrupted this table tennis plot, then it's sure she would be ten more bouncing, this is a tiny little princess she's. <br /> <br /> There are many, actually too many musical numbers. It's almost the same as they tried to make the first "disaster-movie" ever. How foolish. What he sings in Gable's "common" is okay, but when he starts to struggle with these high, tedious ways during the opera pieces, when I felt that my ears were attacked by an enemy's sound and unjustly attacked. Actually, the opera number is 6 DAMN MINUTES. 6 may seem a little, for those who have not had experience with Vietoperanam's experience of such scary fear of torture, but it is like a dog's years; The dog's year corresponds to seven people. My opera is equal to 100 minutes of Chinese torture (or dog urinating acid). <br /> <br /> I thought it was a disaster movie, but it's almost a catastrophe. (I read that part of this film's dialogue has been written by SILENT-ERA FILM DIRECTOR. Jesus ...) The melodramatic and only occasionally amusing procedure interrupts the actual star of the film (namely, the earthquake), only after an hour and a half. When Joe's earthquake finally shakes the characters of the city and our clich√©s, I almost felt like saying, "God is thankful, death and destruction are finally here!". Unfortunately, Joe's movie gets too late to save it from its growing mediocrity; The scenes of devastation are very good, but even the part of the film's earthquake is destroyed by an extremely annoying and religious ending. You see, Gable, who feels atheist (without actually using the word), finally finds that MacDonald is alive - after searching for days - and suddenly he is converted into a believer because Cinderella is alive?! How stupid! All that tells me is that Gable's character is a weak mindset. <br /> <br /> The movie really ends up being very stupid. Gable, saying to God "thank you" for saving her girlfriend (and she makes her knees) "finds" God (sees light) and the little old devil of the movie Gable transforms herself into a believer. How very godly the American ends ... <br /> <br /> Of course, nobody thought to ask this "God" why there was an earthquake in hell first! The sad and involuntary irony is that Gable finally becomes "sucking"; all the time he had made jokes that fell on their most sacred scam - namely religion - and eventually he became one. Now I call it the triumph of human spirit! Another irony is that I had to repair Gable as a person, but I see it quite differently; on the contrary, it took only one great Joe to turn Gable into a godly, foolish, small, obedient believer who joins the world sheep family. And if this Gable intellectual decline was not pathetic and disappointing enough, this first "earthquake musical" really ends with hair growth (take this word as you want), a noble and hopefully beautiful mass scene: dozens (or hundreds) of earthquake survivors and proud, proud Frisco citizens spontaneously (or "maybe" arranged by God?) sing all the songs of the title in the hope of a better, brighter, Joe-less future.Hallelujah! If you are "sucking" Hollywood's sentimentality, don't miss this movie.
