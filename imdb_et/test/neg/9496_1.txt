I've never felt the need to include an overview of this website so far, but when I just sat on the film, I felt the need to warn parents who might be thinking about showing it to their children. Please don't! It's not a Disney movie. This film tells us that "life is cruel" and when you show it to your children, I think. <br /> <br /> The video box describes the film as "joy of all ages" and the IMDb plot sketch describes it as "a family movie". I just had to find the definition of "family movie" and I found the following: "Usually comedies or adventures, these films are often based on children's literature and can include multiple useful animals, friendly supernatural beings and fantasy worlds, all aimed at stimulating imagination and addressing whatever the situation is, little offensive material or not at all, and generally a lesson on the road. "Tarka The Otter is not an appropriate description that contains some unpleasant scenes that are totally unsuitable for toddlers, and the end that qualifies as a" bad "movie. Lesson learned?
