As if the world hadn't received enough cheap Jaws imitations, the writer Boaz Davidson decided to consistently, but with a reasonably enjoyable creature, octopus, Spielberg's classic full hanging. a policeman who doesn't believe anyone, and the mayor is worried about the 4th of July celebrations as people's lives. <br /> <br /> Even with a highly qualified director, it is unlikely that this derivative garbage could have been anything other than a B-film garbage, but Yossi Wein (yes Yossi Wein!) who calls the camera behind broke the fraction Mr. With Spielberg's talents (I value about 1/10000), Octopus 2 is guaranteed to be as bad as you could imagine! <br /> <br /> Predictable and extremely clich√© plot is not worthy of detail (replaces Jaws' Amity Island with New York and Bruce Shark with gigantic rubber octopus and gist), although there are several points about the movie It is definitely worth mentioning just because that they are so funny: all the octopus attacks involve actors who fight to make incredibly counterfeit giant tentacles that are weird to see; The Bulgarian capital, Sofia, is convincingly in New York, and the excessive footage makes the illusion even less convincing; Best of all, the silly dream sequence that sees a rubber octopus attacking our hero on the shape of freedom is not only stupid in the gut, but also some really terrible special effects. <br /> <br /> The Davidson script does not even know when to end: there are several points in this movie that could have ended (and probably should be), but the action continues and continues, octopuses survive multiple explosions and cause The tunnel collapse (the love of the movie and the bunch of kids) before the hero finally blows smithereens. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is very silly, always terrible technical, but never scary, this STV stinker can find fans among those who are looking for a movie. However, it would be advisable for most ordinary people to be very clear.
