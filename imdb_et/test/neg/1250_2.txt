How does this movie suck? As a fan of Michael Imperioli at Soprano, I chose it in Blockbuster on the basis of his name and story, which was promised. It still works, but this movie doesn't. <br /> <br /> Every story is completely predictable; I was looking for a lifetime error in the right corner of the screen. It's all there: a noble woman who comes out of tough times, a guy who can't stand her potential despite her efforts in the middle of getting stuck etc. The mysterious alien identity is what really made me throw stuff on the TV - I would have been a little calmer with a little Stuey waking up and realizing that it was all a dream. the story is ... "a little before the credit, because as the other reviewer said, this thing really makes a special afterschool. Don't play, don't drink, don't do drugs, stay with your wife, spend time with your children ... come a little bit of a nuance? How would some interesting bad guys be? Writer / director AW Vidmer should pay special attention: not only is the dialogue leading, the pace (in dialogue and on both ends of many scenes) makes this film for at least 45 minutes longer than it should be (and believe me Imperioli, Renee Faia, and some of the supportive components (Steve Schirripa, natch) are the only ones that keep this rating 1, all their good work is almost compensated by the brutal work of depicting Stuey. was it a wrong mistake (hey - this is a mob movie, so let's get someone from Blue's Clues who can't do anything but overestimate the big Disney flick) or just terrible control, but not ed scenes are really painful to watch. <br /> <br /> I would be interested in accepting this character and its story by another filmmaker; it is a shame Imperioli has already been used with this flick. Terrible, terrible, terrible.
