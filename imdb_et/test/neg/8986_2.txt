The story speaks of a psychological woman, Tori, who returns to her hometown and starts her traumatic past (death of her childhood friend and abusive father). Tory discovers that his friend was the first in a series of murders that still exist. Does his psychic abilities help to solve crimes and stop the continuing murders? <br /> <br /> You don't really need to know because Oh God! It was so bad! I know all Nora Roberts fans are going to go to this movie and give her 10 tons. Then we'll see the rest of us in the IMDb score 6 and think this movie is worth it. But don't be fooled. The end was predictable, working on TERRIBLE (not even with southern accents * y'all *) and the story was tiny. Remember ... you were warned!
