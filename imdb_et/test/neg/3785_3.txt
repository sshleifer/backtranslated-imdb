So this guy goes to the psychiatrist's office for his first meeting. After making the paperwork, the psychiatrist says, "I'll show you the ink pictures. Tell me what you see in them." "Well, the patient says," watching the first, "I see a man and a woman who have sex." When he sees another, he says, "I see two women having sex." Looking at the third, he says, "I see two men having sex." In the next sight he says, "I see two men and two women having sex." The psychiatrist puts down the inks. "So," he says, "We're starting to discuss our monoman." "My Monoman?" says man. "And you all these dirty pictures!" So this movie hits me.
