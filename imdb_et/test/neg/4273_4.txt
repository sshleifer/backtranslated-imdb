This is a big disappointment. The main problem is action. Sylvestre le Touzel is pretty poor because Fanny, and the rest are not much better, everything is very cunning and unnatural. The camera work is also very 1980, ie narrow and nervous, compared to those of the 1995 P&P. <br /> <br /> The script is when something is too loyal to the book, and there are some worthy phrases that it should have been cut. <br /> <br /> In any case, it is much worse than the last movie version, which, although it had enormous freedoms with the book, seemed much more reliable to the spirit of the book and was much more enjoyable.
