I agree with other users' comments. It is hard to believe that this film rose in 1994 because it screams in the mid-80s. I think it's dubbed because the sound and picture don't always match. If someone can really say it's a good movie, they must be locked. It is so sad when money has so much power over people that they do something to get it. I feel I lost intelligence when I looked at it. I looked a little at Chuck Norris before I watched it, but now I feel bad. I bought it as part of 3 movie packages for $ 9.99 and I can honestly say that I would have been better off losing money literally. Forgive me Jesus.
