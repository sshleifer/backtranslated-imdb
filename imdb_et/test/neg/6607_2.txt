The film has three main problems. Or, rather, there are three reasons why it is not even a more serious discretionary candidate. <br /> <br /> First, and it was always true, it's not nearly as good as books. But at least we could have expected to reflect some of Sapkowski's thinking or depth. Secondly, we have production. Fantasy movies are, in my opinion, the most difficult to produce well. All from props through costumes, landscapes, stunts and (especially) CGI are of poor quality. <br /> <br /> Finally, and it's a lot to be very subjective, I just can't really take action seriously. I had not grown up in Poland, so I can't really be a judge - it might not have been a lack of knowledge of Polish films. All the same lines look very interesting ... Casting can be better. <br /> <br /> In summary, the only possible redemption feature of this movie is the rest of the plot that shines through: unlike the diamond ring, the rotten cadaver. <br /> <br /> In a separate note, I heard books in English. I haven't seen them yet, but I can't imagine how to even translate them ... I ask the English-speaking reader to remember this book.
