It combines the glorious, endless 50s of sci-fi with an endless line. As usual, it's pretty bad. There is not a lot of plot that I could discover and the excessive exaggeration of the leaders only adds an unintentional laugh. The title is misleading. Getting it for MST3K is probably the only way to watch it and it's better.
