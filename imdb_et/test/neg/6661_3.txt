I was looking at Gristle mainly because of Michael Dorni's presence because I enjoyed his Worf image of Star Trek TNG, but had never seen him out of her makeup. Dorn has a beautiful presence and is likely to have a lucrative actor career. However, this film gave him little dramatic challenges, except to prove that he can really use the word 'F'. <br /> <br /> It seems that this film was made by someone who developed himself - thinking, with social conscience. Yes, in 1965. Nowadays the themes are both belabored and sophomoric and cornball that even Spike Lee's terrible "Bamboozled" looks good in comparison. <br /> <br /> This criminal whim has a complex double - triple and quadruple crosses, but the plot layout is so complicated that it collapses in the first 30 minutes. For the most part, after this point I just looked at the momentum and light curiosity about how each scene plays. Here's a big cast - you know almost everyone as a character from the actor's much better movie. Why are they all in that? I suspect it was 1) work and money, even if it was modest. 2) Maybe the director knows all these actors between LA classes and social ties. Perhaps they were in support of him as colleagues who fight in the third and fourth stages of the Hollywood scene. Dunno ... but the film was baked --- not really "ready". I gave it to 3, although my affection for the participants was lost from admiration of my previous work. We hope that everything has since moved on to more professional, carefully done and more thorough projects.
