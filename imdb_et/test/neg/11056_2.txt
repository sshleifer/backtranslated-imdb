The barrel-stinker is so bad that it is funny. "The plot" is an American mercenary, played by Reb Brown (in a movie called "military adviser", but it is not really clear whether he is in the American army), helping the Latin American army fight the guerrillas who join immigrants if the government turns him on, tortures and tortures him. Shannon Tweed is a "sports equipment salesman" whom he collects at a bar that gets all the intrigues. This description actually makes the film better than it is because it is really a beacon of biblical proportions. How bad is it? Well, Shannon Tweed turns the film into the most professional actor. If that doesn't mean exactly what is the 12th hero spam, there is nothing inappropriate sound effects with a music score that sounds like it is in the material of the 1940s Z-innovative horror (and can be very well) in the same material (ie Carriers of armored personnel running along the same jungle trail) who used some of the worst-performing "action" scenes in a recent memory, must see the laugh of a minute's stroke incredible. Tweed seems boring, Brown looks hung, and until that thing is over - if you can so long; I couldn't - you know how they feel. <br /> <br /> Although there are many explosions and races, this image cannot be portrayed with any imagination. . It's boring (there is a scene at the back of a truck where everyone just looks at each other for three or four minutes), repeats (the same "rebels" and "soldiers" are killed over and over again), illogical (when a group of insurgents are caught in open-air government helicopter ammunition, instead to cover the cover, they just stand there, reaching it up), inert (soldiers and insurgents, who "die" if there are no strokes, weapon battle inside the house, fighters who stand against the walls, are mechanized but admirable walls fleeing unharmed) (when the "governor" says it offers a charge for getting Brown, because "someone" can turn it on, you know exactly who "someone" is, and that's exactly who you thought it was) and just completely stupid (pretty much other picture). Inept, pointless and stupid outside of faith. Don't waste your time.
