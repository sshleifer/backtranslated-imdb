The presumed writer and director Mr.Dhawan has copied almost the entire plot of the Hollywood movie "HITCH" that will play Will Smith. Many scenes are also exactly the same. The plot was just a copy of pasted and some low-quality humor (probably mr.Dhawan's own creation) and frequent dancing was added to enhance movie time to local standards. <br /> <br /> Although Salman khan and Govinda were doing some smiles for us, it is not suitable for legendary artists as they are part of plagiarism, especially when they tell people to stop buying pirate boards!
