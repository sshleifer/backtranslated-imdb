After the astronaut's death in the room, he brings back the military base. The embryos of strangers are discovered within the human being - he is the host of the foreign host! This film comes to us from director Bernard L. Kowalski, who also led the "Giant Leeches attack" (see separate review), but may be better known for his "Columbo" work. The leading producer was Roger Corman, known as the creator of much better films, especially in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> This movie is cheesy and poorly designed. What is so interesting is the bad effect, not the actual film itself. One scene shows the proximity of foreign embryos and it is an embarrassing representation of comics. Even in 1958. And when an adult alien appears, you don't know why he's wearing it. Or, if you're really sensitive, you don't know why you've seen an alien suit in other movies. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst scientific literature you'll ever see. And you almost have to give it - an alien who drives the idea of ​​a military base has been "The Thing" and "Alien" for several years. I don't know if these films were inspired in any way (I doubt), but at least it was before my time. Despite this, the film is filmed and it is great only when drinking. I haven't seen the version of "Mystery Science Theater", but it's a sure-to-be-insulted film.
