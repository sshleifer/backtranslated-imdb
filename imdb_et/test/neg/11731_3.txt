The first review I saw in IMDB says that Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Perkins was in that role. Makes me wonder if he saw the original. Psycho is difficult to review if you do not have the revolutionary perspective of the 1960s film. You have a heroine who is not very pleasant and who doesn't stay far from the movie and the villain who is horrible but makes you feel like him. Add to this some graphical violence and you have a blue print for some 80's and 90's movies. <br /> <br /> Where's this movie going wrong? Let's start with casting. Anne Heche is good as Vivian Crane, but Norman Bates is Vince Vaughn wrong. One thing, he looks too young. Secondly, he has no idea how to play the roll. Her nervous laughter reminds me of Ron Howard, who is trying to play karma on happy days. All he does is shouts I DID IT! The original film, even for those who know everything about it, still makes itself unaware of his mother's influence on Norman and turns him into a real personality. How about a shower scene. When I finally saw the 1960s film on the big screen, I was surprised at my power to frighten me of fear. Bernard Herrman's score becomes incredible and hard and goes beyond scaring you as Danny Elfman's interpretations of synthesis. This shower scene only helps to show us the bare body of Anne Heche and some nice color blood. Which brings us to choose the color. Did not work. <br /> <br /> There is something that seems to have barely seen working to relocate classic movies. Some may see it as a great experiment, but to be honest, if Gus Van Sant had nothing to add to this film, he should have left it alone
