The Vindicator opens with a monument in a monkey cage that attacks a small toy robot as part of a scientific experiment. This violence of random behavior sold it to me and I am happy to say that the rest of the Vindicator gave a real cheese party. <br /> <br /> Vindicator is about a scientist (David McIlwraith) who has been almost killed by an explosion in his laboratory, whose split residues are put on a test piece / armor. For some pointless reason, he is equipped with a Rage Response Activator, a device connected to his brain cord, which makes him kill when he is physically in contact with another person. They give some explanation of how this is a necessary defensive mechanism, but I do not see the logic of installing such a device if you did not want a humping machine. This is especially ridiculous when it is shown that Carl's suit is actually an experimental space wash. What is the need for an astronaut to become an incredible stack during the mission? He's predicted to break out of the lab and continue fighting with the nonsense scientists who put him in the suit, along with Ninja's assassin Hunter, played by Pam Grier (No, really). <br /> <br /> Vindicator himself looks pretty fucking silly. Basically, this guy has a golden foil. He is also embarrassingly confused, which does not cause fear or even compassion. I don't think you can blame him for this, most people who watch the movie see the same faces on their face. <br /> <br /> Actress is really bad, stylish. The nature of emotions or thoughts is that I take the pound and drag my dialogue with a random voice, but try not to look at the camera's school of action. An actor who plays a funky black scientist even fights for the last part of it. <br /> <br /> This is the first accidental death that Vindicator follows scientists. The odd thing is that the whole Rage Response Activator 'touches me and I'm killing you' the thing doesn't play as big a role as Carl would be when he goes to his former colleges reasonably inseparably. There was one scene where he rather murdered some of the street beasts who suppress him. I know that street gangs are randomly attacking the leading figures of the eighties movies, but one of them must have realized that it may be a bad idea to attack a stray cyber, even if he looks like a C3PO slowed cousin. As they do not even seem surprised when they saw the golden cyber walk along the street, as if it were every day. The only other time that this rage response activator appears in the movie is how old Carl can't hug his wife. When Hunter tries to throw him against him, he is forced to kill him, he accidentally notices that he himself has been programmed (of course off the screen), so it won't happen. They could have left out the whole Rage Response activator thing and just went into a straight revenge story and it wouldn't have made a huge difference to the film. <br /> <br /> The sewer has a fun sequence. Grier and his cronies are watching Vindicator. Thanks to their armored stain, they are armed with weapons that come from "steamed acid". For some strange reason, when these weapons come, it is represented on the screen by the red lines of comic strips leading to the target area's Ghostbusters. Vindicator fights back by pulling out the wall of the gas pipe and burning all of Grier's gons under a huge fire. The resulting fireball is so big and powerful that it leaves the sewer through a human hole and blows a couple of scientists. Oddly enough, Grier flees, throwing himself deep into deep water, despite being closest to Vindicator. This is one of the many fake fire explosions throughout the film, including the death of a funky black scientist when the windshield sends its rock. (That's after they hit The Vindicator, trying him seriously for gellonate, seriously). <br /> <br /> There is also a disturbing and long and uneven order where Carl's deceptive obese friend who looks like a poor man Ned Beatty opens his affection for Carli's wife and tries to rape him. It takes about 5-10 minutes and is full of disturbing shots made by sliding the woman's face. It is icky to say at least and it really looks out of most of the rest of the movie, which is a kind of cartoonish and a bigger life for its violence. <br /> <br /> The movies final includes Vindicator fighting a whole host of other candy fighting costumes. For some reason, all these other brides are less than Carl, some of which are simply sent out by the spouse to the outside. Luckily for Carl, the fact that she wears is not a major design error. The only really memorable part of the end is Grier's death. By doing something I have never seen in the movie before, in the midst of his confrontation with Vindicator, he decides that he really has no chance of receiving him and, in reality, his own brain is blowing out with a gun.
