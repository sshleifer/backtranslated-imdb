If you need a clue as to whether the Playmaker is decent or not, look at your star Colin Firth, who refers to it in an interview as "absolute garbage - I sincerely hope no one can see it." <br /> <br /> The script and plot are ridiculous, the female driver is not convincing. The only thing that is worth is Colin Firth, and he seems a little embarrassed all the time. <br /> <br /> Only for Firth fans - only the shower scene is worth $ 3.99 that you should take out. video clip trash like I did. <br /> <br /> I'm happy that Mr. Firth's days for such projects are over!
