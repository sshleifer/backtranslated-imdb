This is my first Almodavari movie. I admit that we chose it mainly because we knew it was an attractive outlook for Antonio Bayers in gay sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all this movie has to recommend. I consider myself a pretty complicated viewer, I like European films, "art" movies, and I am generally able to recognize a high quality film, even if it is not my special taste. <br /> <br /> But this movie was completely empty for me. The plot was ridiculous, the characters lifeless, the box called it "fun comedy," but I never laughed. Naturally and uncomfortably built, with a lot of meaningless dialogue. I can't do it at all - it seems to be an amateur effort. Does anyone illuminate me?
