Ed Wood's Classic 'Plan 9' has been considered the worst film for years. Forget this Roller Blade Seven is endlessly worse. The famous brothers are cast and almost famous or have been actors and actors. Plot with budget and script is non-existent. The driving time is not made in the classic Ed Wood style, which makes it possible to use film material. Instead, there is an endlessly slow and repetitive activity. And like the Roller Blade, seven of them are not even seven! Giving independent filmmakers everywhere hopes.
