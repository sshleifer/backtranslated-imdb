I'm a big fight. For a sephalic story, this film could have been great (as great as some are appreciated here), but it's mixed with an actor (director and relatives who play important roles for financial reasons). .. although it works, it is not just a stretch of the word, but it gives it a new meaning! A whole new meaning! <br /> <br /> If you are in surreal movies (some of which I really like, look at the strange circus of Japan, for example), you can forget the mistakes (see above) and enjoy it more. After all, here are great ideas! Many great metaphors and ambiguous scenes, but looking at it (with a group of friends), almost all of us, just couldn't laugh ... not of course the director's intention! Again, everyone has their own taste because of the high rating of this movie, but I can only recommend the movie if you are aware of the work Alejandro Jodorowsky has done and / or who is his fan!
