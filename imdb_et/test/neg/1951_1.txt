Talk about garbage! I can't think of anything good in this movie. The scenario was bad, the action was terrible and the impact was not affected. I can't believe that this film's writer, Identity, all this movie made me sick to stop. <br /> <br /> The front of the video box has a showman with shark like teeth and frightening eyes. I look like a scary villain, but as the old saying "ever judge a book by its cover", the whole villain looked like a cardboard. One part of the movie kills salad jars, awful. The setting was bad enough, as if it could have been done all over Lapland, but not, the tropical island. <br /> <br /> I took this movie as spam, which I think they wanted it to be the only thing that made me laugh badly, had a sticky effect. You can argue that I have not watched the first, but seeing it would be safe if I did not try it. <br /> <br /> The biggest joke in this movie is the consequences, snowballs seemed like they were made at home and this carrot was a complete torment. If I think the budget for this movie would probably be eight to nine pounds fifty. The last minute panic disorder producer had to seize the street actors that the script told them they had 6 minutes to train them and shoot on the island. <br /> <br /> In the end, the action was painful, it was like the actors forgot their usual lines and carried them out. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'll give this movie: 0 stars out of 5
