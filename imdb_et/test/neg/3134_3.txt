Bardem is great. The actors are great. But Amenabar didn't have to do it. It is good that he is defending his position against euthanasia, which is an extremely delicate issue. However, it does so by losing its point: the film is wrong, offensive intelligence, full of tricks and even sometimes very boring. Some scenes are promotional materials, more than film. Women are incredibly interested in this mind-sick man who wants to kill someone, not to understand the consequences. He doesn't seem to care about anyone and thank them for their care, love and attention. I think Amenabar could have thought people differently about this question, but how he decided it is not right in my opinion. He could have made his point more powerful, bringing the coin on the other side without mocking it.
