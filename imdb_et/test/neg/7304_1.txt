It must be the biggest practical joke ever. I'm surprised that all the other participants held a straight face. I may be wrong, but I got the impression of this movie that they called Frank Stallone and Joe Estevez to act in a budget of just under $ 40, depending on how much these chews and spray painted equipment cost, most inconsistent film that was once created, and sit back and laugh that Joe Estevez and Frank Stallone were not joking. <br /> <br /> If they are in no way kidding and they were just trying to make a movie, then I'm sorry for everyone involved in the work. I have had a lot of love for the movie with fun movies, but this movie is so bad to hardly watch it. They repeat the meaningless "special effects" so many times that it is obvious that they just tried to cover the fact that they only shot for 30 minutes. If I had to watch this movie repeatedly, I would beat myself unconscious with my hands about one and a half times. There's no offense for the big Frank Stallone, but I'd rather look at Sylvester to teach his fingerprint class for 10 hours when he's ever watching this movie again.
