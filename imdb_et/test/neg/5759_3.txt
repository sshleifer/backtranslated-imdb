My companion and we decided to look at this obvious junk that was based only on that label? After almost 30 years of terrible and rudimentary pioneers, I can't believe that only now a few nerdy horror brains will perfectly create a spiritual slogan "They Axed for it"! Moreover, "Miner's Massacre" is just as casual, annoying and forgotten as everything else there? Maybe even more! The script contains all the typical clich√©s and contains all the terribly stereotypical signs you want to have terrible and painful death. Gore effects are computer-generated, and thus safe and mandatory "big" letters (Karen Black, John Philip Law, and Richard Lynch) surpass their top scores. Cursed mines and abandoned ghost towns are the place for an ideal horror? The creators of "My Bloody Valentine" already thought that in the early 80s? but his boring film has not simply provided innovative ideas or even surprising elements. A bunch of twenty losers pointing to friends, although they can't clearly stand against each other, destroy the old mine to find the gold there. Of course, they will restore zombie miners in this way and he will only have a 150-year rest period to prepare a huge teenage massacre. Yes! It is extremely irritating in this area. The girls have impressive shelves, but they refuse to show anything. Instead, they prefer all the endless whining and taking unnecessary risks. Darkly glowing blocks are just a filler on the screen. In her barely five minutes of playing, Karen Black is still fooling, depicting the most prototypical and hysterical local nut woman ever. The zombie has a stupid and very persuasive face, but it looks good and reasonably threatening when it is shown in the shadow of a moonlight while sliding around its ax-needle. Since the best thing about "Miner's Massacre" concerns the above label and you can read that there are very few suggestions in the video store box. Director John Carl Buechler received some modest hits during the eighties, such as the original Troll and another Friday, Friday, but it's probably time to retire.
