This is an OK movie when it is done by high school kids to their friends. It is below the boundaries called "professional". There is no plot, no actor in the game and no visual appearance can see it through the film. I was so glad I had the FF button far away, 32x worked really well. I understand that everyone has to start somewhere, but this should not be the reason for bringing it to the public. If you are concerned about quality and budget - "Open Water" was made for $ 60,000 and more than half went to a guy who gave security to the ocean and trained sharks. And this film looks 100 times more professional and it was an event in movie films.
