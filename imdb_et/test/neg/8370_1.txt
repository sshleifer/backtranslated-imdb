it is a real big turn that people can still make movies today because of cheap digital video cameras. I would usually appreciate this opportunity, but if you see such movies, it's just a big shame. and it is also a great shame if people like h.p. armecraft get abused like this. I rented this "movie" cuz on "h.p. lovecraft". and I am a big fan of many of his adjustments, mainly those made by the brian yuzna & stuart gordon. this movie has nothing to offer! cheap scenery on the beach and in the old wine cellar. digi-cam effect "red light" all over the movie. not the participants, but some foolish lower quality models who are not sure what they are doing, rigid wood. and so must the director. It is obvious that he tried to create some atmosphere. But as the whole thing is so ridiculous, it just doesn't work. and some gore effects, but some blood in the river (you drink = you become a demon) and drop here and there. Oh yes, the story: thousands of years ago, some of the "great old" worlds colonized and became people slaves. then mankind became independent, so the "old" tried to destroy them. and now there are some survivors in the apocalyptic world. The only way to save humanity is to find NECRONOMICON, this is where it gets to LOVECRAFT. so these soldiers fight with some undead and demon on their beach and in their wine cellar. incredible - the whole thing! but as it is dubbed (German title: "Armee des Jenseits") and found in most commercial television stores, it seems that you could make such things money.
