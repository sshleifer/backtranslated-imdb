Most of the positive comments posted here are the same as the movie! Speech and boring film evaluation takes a long-term cage. Some have just called the film "contemplative", which means a slow and missing plot, but one Dutch reviewer hit the nail head: this is an important event that turned into a dull film set in the first scene. Here the young couple shows an apartment realtor, who is predicting to talk about non-stop and whatever happens. So it's almost every other sign! <br /> <br /> The only silence in this picture is the sequences of dreams - the extracts of the Soviet propaganda of the 1930s - and these are also the most interesting parts. It tells you how the rest of the movie is traceable. <br /> <br /> A device that captures most scenes with extreme close relationships - as if searching through cracks in the dark - gets old quickly.
