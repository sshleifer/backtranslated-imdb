its a perfectly average movie with some semi-conductive sequences that make the plot a little better and remind the viewer of classic old-fashioned films. The parts of the plot do not make sense and appear to be included in the use of time. The ultimate line is what is a very basic type that does not leave the viewer in awe and all the twists are obvious from the beginning. The end scene with the back of the flask does not make sense, as they are added and appear to be insignificant in the history of the van dam character. is not yet worth looking back, a little disappointed in the final production, although it is obvious that it has been done with a small budget, certain movie clips and parts are poorly targeted
