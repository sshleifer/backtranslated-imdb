It's a flat comedy. <br /> <br /> Here's the reason: man and woman sitcom. Okay. The man has a shower bag. Wife is Einstein. <br /> <br /> How is the original? <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller is just the same guy in Seinfeld. <br /> <br /> Gags are flat. None of the fancy single liners. <br /> <br /> I've had enough. Stop it now. <br /> <br /> Last word: stupid. The average white boy is destroyed in ABC. The worst part? Kevin James is actually a funny comedian. He's just not here. Leah Remini is an excellent eye candy but is unlikely. Destroyed talent is a word. Bad sitcom.
