I think the best way to review this title is to share it with your pros and cons. <br /> <br /> PROS: ~ They change rather than wolves than plastic / cartoons. - Wolves going through the forest ~ "Cash Machine" played by Hard-Fi: CONS: ~ Some parts of the script will force you (for example, the terrible part where the woman escapes "games" of "Fortunate Five" boys and there is about half an hour " Dear cousin "and" Yes, look, we know Gabriel's law "round ring" ~ The transformation of diving is ridiculous - the obvious and ridiculous end ~ Aiden was told thousands of times to leave, and then "if you care me if you had left me" ~ obvious Characters ~ Unnecessary Parcouri - Ariel ~ cringey calls for absolutely unnecessary shouting. <br /> <br /> I see what I mean. <br /> <br /> I adore werewolf movies and I tried to watch it a few times to see if I wanted it better, but it just got worse. I guess I just read the book and see how I get ahead. <br /> <br /> Don't worry if you don't have a 12-year-old brother or sister in horrible things. Anyone who crosses that age can suffer and wants to get one and a half hours ago.
