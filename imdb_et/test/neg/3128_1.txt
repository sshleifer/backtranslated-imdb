It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> We should like and take on the arrogant, conscious-all, trashy bank robber played by Dale Robertson and the boy tease, played by the exceptionally beautiful red dress of Linda Darnell's fire truck. She must be sewn into this body! <br /> <br /> The Senator in the movie thinks Americans and White should try to understand, but the big ones still won the day. I can barely sit through the endless dialogue of other word displays of the characters. <br /> <br /> Except for wounded knees and wolves with wolves, there are few movies that give a positive view of American Indians and very few old Westerners do. It is exceptionally bad in this regard. <br /> <br /> The romance of Robertson and Darnell puts my teeth on the edge when he came to eat, forcing him to kiss, while he was playing old to play old. <br /> <br /> There are scenes that are inadvertently humorous, such as characters who obviously don't really travel or stagecoach in multiple frames. <br /> <br /> An amazingly humorous case at the scene of Linda Darnell's character is to a large extent buying tickets for stagecoach, then asking the horse to ride, in a few minutes, for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Another humorous scene is when the stagecoach reaches the cowboy hat next to the road, not just that but all the CART passengers. <br /> <br /> 1 Star
