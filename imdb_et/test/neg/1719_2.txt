Unimpressive and extremely low budget sci-fi without charm and appeal. Even the scenes associated with the fall of asteroids are stolen from other films with the same plot. It's just a bad hanging of "Asteroid" (with Annabela Sciora) and "Deep Impact" (with Morgan Freeman). Hopper seems to want to get rid of this pointless and boring sci-fi entry. <br /> <br /> I'll give it 2 (two). And don't say I'm not a good man!
