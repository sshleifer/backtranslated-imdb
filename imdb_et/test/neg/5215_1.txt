my friends and i always watch chuck norris movies just to bash and joke. One of our favorites is still Lonewolf. I went to the wal-mart store and came to the 5.99 trash. I had to get it. I had great hopes for this movie, and although I was at times fun, we agreed that the innocence watches are the worst film we've ever seen, produced, produced, thought about, etc ... who the hell would think is a good idea. it is not at times confusing, but action is just difficult to look at. The man who plays the orchestra acts when I can compare my vomiting, and this mother-in-law took the dive, she is not the biggest actor, but it was terrible. and what names are oren, conrad and jux ........ jux. come on people. if you honestly thought that this movie was at all traceable, good for you because it was hard for me and I had a serious headache and abdominal pain after watching it. I'm telling you now that you haven't seen this movie, DON'T! For God's love, don't let yourself fall into such a terrible 90-minute life.
