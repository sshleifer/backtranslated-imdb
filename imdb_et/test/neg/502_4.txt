The film, Heaven's Gate, was a good view, though still tedious for over 4 hours. But the film got a great license - as usual in Hollywood. James Averill (Chris Christopherson) and "Elle" were actually married in life. Their main contribution to Johnson's war was to start hanging. Well, starting with it, I mean it was in the beginning, not the end. Here's the real scenario: James Averill and Ellen Watson married secretly because every family can be given one farm. When they performed as individuals, they got two homeland. They chose Crazy Woman Creek's home, which actually controlled the water in the possession of a powerful member of the Cattleman Association. He offered to buy them repeatedly, which they refused. <br /> <br /> Although it is characterized by real life as the owner of a brothel (herd Kate) and a prostitute (and also a movie), there was no real evidence. It is known that he bought many sick herds, took care of them and was later accused by the Cattleman Association of livestock farmers who were forced to act. "The West of America" ​​was sold for the part that is the motif of myths that have been around for 100 years, so much. <br /> <br /> In real life, he and Jim Averill were surprised one day by several members of the Clemleman Association who were picked up and hanged right away. Those who committed injustice had never turned to court, but it was the first link that led to the assassination of the Nate Master, and the beginning of the Johnson County War. <br /> <br /> Unlike the Hollywood version, which shows the end of its end. <br /> <br /> In addition, I think the main problem is the film was an editor who could have changed the smarter editing faster.
