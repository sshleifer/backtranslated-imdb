Is it badly done with clich√©s in the trash? Of course. Anyone who doesn't understand that when they get into a video store box, they don't have to make the right decisions first. So now I appreciate the aspects of the film we really care about, on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /> <br /> Violence and gore: 4 - There are very few deaths in this genre and Gore is almost non-existent. Anyone looking for small blood should probably look elsewhere. The only quality of redemption is that the children do these terrible things that raise the bar a little. <br /> <br /> Excitement: 1 - Okay, I feel bad for anyone who scares this dork trio looking for kids. <br /> <br /> Nudity / Gender: 7 - A lot of boobage from three different women, one of whom is MTV and Julie Brown. There are two sexual scenes, but there are few. <br /> <br /> Unintentional Humor - 4 - There are some good smiles when children are trying to scare, but it is just bad, not funny bad. <br /> <br /> Generally - 4 - It's not invisible. There are some fun moments and enough nudity to keep the whole movie's attention. However, watch this movie only if you are a big fan of 80s slides. It certainly falls to the bottom of the scale, but it is not below. The real downside is the disappointing end. It almost destroyed my movie.
