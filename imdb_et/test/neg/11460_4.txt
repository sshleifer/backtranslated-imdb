Unfortunately, this film is typical of a good film for watering many offspring. In the 1940s, Universal made several series of monster films that were light imitations of the original. The intelligent Egyptian teacher Imhotep has been replaced by Frankenstein, a mummy-wrapped leg, with no signs of intelligent life. This movie is entertaining in places, but once you've seen The Mummy (1932), you're disappointed.
