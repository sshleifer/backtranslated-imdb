Royal Rumble 1988 missed me pretty damn. Rumble himself is quite steadfast, full of middle carder and winner, who really had no point in winning, and why did the Young Slaves Vs Saarers make it to the ground? half crowd. Jessie Ventura plays for half a thing and you can say when she mentions that she finds Hogan Vs Andre more interesting. McMahon and Ventural have no Gorilla and Jessie chemistry. Ricky Steamboat Vs Ravishing Rick Rude. Strong disappointment with too many holidays, and too much slow pace, sink it. If it gets crazy in the last 5 minutes, it's too little, too late. Steamboat wins with DQ. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Next is Dino Bravo, who is trying to set a new bench profile where Ventura set him up. A scary segment with no entertainment value. Ventura is not nearly enough to carry this segment, and even McMahon admitted it was boring. Inconsistency or not, I wasted enough time for this mess. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2/3. <br /> <br /> Glamor Girls | C | / W Jimmy Hart. Vs Jumping Bomb Angels. It's the best night, I'm not kidding! Very exciting things for a woman's wrestling and you have trouble finding this thing, now days. Jumping Bomb Angels were on their way and the crowd went to ape sh * t to win their title. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Signing a contract between Hulk Hogan and Andre The Giant. Hogan gets a decent pop, but for him a couple of noticeable boot, probably because it is in Canada. A little too memorable, but it was necessary for the story. It got it all over, and it had some powerful moments, but many times I said I'd get along with it. Both signs and Andre slam the Hogan's head on the table and push him to the table. <br /> <br /> Royal Rumble Match 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Very weak for Royal Rumble, probably due to uncomfortable tempo and lack of real power. I think Vince tried it with water and showed. Ventura seems uninteresting and I don't blame her. Crowd clearly wanted to win Roberts by shouting DDT almost every 5 minutes when he was there, and while Duggan had a good pop, I don't think he was the winner he wanted and where did he take his career? Nowhere. Bret's first royal rumble and he made an impressive show. It was not terrible, but it was rather weak, and it was not enough to show, given that it was what the exhibition was based on. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br Hogan has an interview with Craig DeGeorge. Hulkster's standard interview, but not the same craze and outrageous comments he usually pulls. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Ted and Andre are questioning. Andre claims that he will give the championship to Mr Dibiase. Short but effective. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> 2 of the three falls. <br /> <br /> Islanders carry young people in slave. The people are completely dead for this and half of them have been turned to exit. It is quite boring and had no major event. Jessie and Vince seem to be bored and argue over other things when the game takes place. The islands win because they take advantage of the Roma injuries. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> The bottom line. Historically it is important, but there is really nothing to see here. It was just a start-up layer for the king's thundering for big things, and while you see possible glances, there's nothing that goes down the road. I usually recommend Die Hard Wrestling to fans once, and given that this is the first Royal Rumble event, I think I have, but I'm preparing forever. <br /> <br /> 3/10
