I can't believe that the number of people who refer to guides is "boy cows" !! there is no such thing for people !!!! There are cows and bulls, and all bovine males are bulls and have no udders !!!! There was even a real pull, but it was like it was another animal species completely! my god it is like drawing human ears on cat, super game or mickey mouse with blond shirley temple curls - even in animation it just doesn't work! Giving people the qualities of animals is nothing new and expected, but making these real bodies basically transsexual is odd for the family - how many people - editors, writers, manufacturers, animators saw it and didn't know better or didn't say anything - it's absolutely amazing ! i am not snob & i luv animation simpsons, beavis & butthead, south park, even ice age and all other new ones out there - over the hedge was great but it is nuts - totally nuts - i couldn't agree that many people have that unknown and i was hoping for the cause of the movie udders - no one came - and at the end, when they keep that little newborn calf and half of their belly, they are udder and they say "my a boy i almost smoked !! please, writer / creator lets us joke!
