For me, Bollywood movies are generally not great, although they are still quite desirable and Bollywood is a big file maker because they have their own fans. <br /> <br /> The only motive that made me watch the film was to see how the American actor could change or influence the logic behind the Indian film. Not only did it change the story of the film, but it also caused some ridiculous series of events. <br /> <br /> I think it's quite common to see illogical things through Indian movies because they have their own world of movies. But if you see such cases in the United States, it makes you laugh. For God, you may believe that the famous American actor is in desperate condition and feels impossible. Can you imagine that an American actor is in love with a dance teacher whose fianc√© is already in love with an American boyfriend and met at the same time. Many similar things were said. the less so, the better. <br /> <br /> Maybe I was wrong because I was expecting too many Indian films.
