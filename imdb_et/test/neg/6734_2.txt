Since I am from Norway (one of the ten (or so) richest countries in the world), it was fun to see how we use trucks of the 1950s and live in medieval houses. And because we have very strict laws on weapons, it was fun to see how many weapons there in Norway in five minutes there. Mr. Direct-to-video was able to even bring his own silencer with a short notice so he has to have a powerful friend in customs. <br /> <br /> Please do before you go to exotic country - you can hurt old fans. <br /> <br /> A Sverre-old fan with injured feelings.
