Some movies you watch because they touch your soul or challenge you in growing ways. <br /> <br /> Some are watching because you want to be open to adventure or shock outside your experience; they do not support you directly, but they help you to live in a larger world than otherwise. And after all, the hard parts of life are what you decide not to accept. <br /> <br /> And then there are movies that don't do any of the things that you don't watch for, or because you need a historical context. These are pretty worthless experiences in building life. <br /> <br /> The problem is, of course, that you often do not know which of these three movies will be. The people you trust, but because you are so personal in life, you don't really know until you go on a dark date. <br /> <br /> For me this was pretty worthless. Yes, yes, I know many of Bunuel are sublime and rich. And you should know (if you don't) that some of my greatest movie experiences are some very strange movies that are very strange. <br /> <br /> It is not that it is neither cinematic nor symbolic, or apolitically / politically friendly in my opinion. How it stays there is out of the base. This deviation from the real deviation that bothers me. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is that it is a successful alternative art, which means it is a successful commercial art. Which in turn means that it can be simply explained and the explanation is not only widely accepted, but simply coded in a brief description. Surely this is all true. <br /> <br /> When the term "surreal" is used, it is usually misused to denote any movie or world that is different from reality or seems strange. But if it is used correctly, which means consensus theory, it always turns around to Bunuel, especially the movie and what he actually did to Dal. Because they invented a surreal cinema, they define and control this term. This in itself prevents me and I have my own alternative definition, which does not come from their philosophy. Because philosophy is completely the opposite. It is not a philosophy but a rejection of philosophy, an anti-order. Its packaged anarchy, carefully selecting the things they use, and the things they don't do without clearly distinguishing them. <br /> <br /> So okay: against linearity, narrative, history, religion (simple) against deliberate love. But illinear a linear narrative to create your own history (which is celebrated by countless film school professors what else can they do?); sort of transcendental "casual" love. <br /> <br /> It's your enemy. If Bunuel is alive today when he sold his picture, the first thing he does is attack the church or surreal. <br /> <br /> My regular readers know that in almost all cinematographic works I break Spanish and French. But on a surreal matter, I would like you to consider the opposite: to get your surrealism from Alfred Jarry, not from Bunuel. <br /> <br /> Tedi Assessment - 2/3: Are there some interesting elements.
