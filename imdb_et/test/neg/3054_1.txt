Dear friends, I've never seen a trash like NIGHT OF THE DEMONS (1988). It seems that director Kevin Tenney was going to copy the classic steps, such as Sam Raimi (1978) or George A. Romero BACK TO THE RECOMMENDED BACK of the same year. Cinematic art was trivial, the film was very dark so I had to maximize the brightness control. Indeed, horror images have to be blind, but not like the night DEMONS. The whole film was ridiculous, not intercourse, worse actors than Alvin Alexis in Rodger's role and terrible make-up effect. Is the average voice of this movie 5 stars? I can't believe it. Maybe the users were beautiful actresses tits, asses and pussies, they were really worth the 5 stars. Welcome, Hans-Dieter
