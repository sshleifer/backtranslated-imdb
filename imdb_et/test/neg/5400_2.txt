The Delta Army Army Unit, whose mission is to find a lost Green Beret Bad Things Party, which has not completely disappeared, is in the battle for survival against the supposed spirit of the hidden skeleton man, an ancient Indian warrior who was revived when archaeologists disturbed his grave. The Skeleton man rides a horse and is able to move back and forth using such a dimensioning portal and it seems that the ball and the explosives do not affect them. The Skeleton's horse does not leave a horse-drawn horse and can ride from the background and its catch quietly. The film's view through the eyes of a skeleton man looks at its harvest in a different color. In other words, he is not a seemingly human person, so how does Captain Leary (Michael Rooker, like grizzled and intense as ever) and his gang of possible commandments end this threat? For some reason, a skeletal man murders workers at a nearby chemical plant. What are the skeletal man's motives to kill endless people? And why is the dark indian living in the forest that our communities live when a skeleton man kills his entire tribe to prove himself? <br /> <br /> It's as stupid as it sounds. Just incredible scary. This is a film that can kill brain cells. Casper Van Dien gets another credit on credits under Rooker, but is exhausted by a ridiculously written character who leaves the movie quite early. Rooker deserves the better. If I were an actor, I wouldn't want to continue this movie. The Skeleton person is the Templer Knight who refuses de Ossorio. He has a spear that can just hit certain people, exploding the head of a woman during a blow. The arrow from the Skeleton Man's bow really destroys the chopper plane propeller. Approximately 99% of the film is hit by a skeleton man and he can go in and out of this portal, eventually becoming vulnerable. Oh, and horses change even when the skeleton man moves freely from the forest through this portal. The film is written and edited by clowns. Attack scenes are poorly designed and characters who should be experienced professionals really make bad decisions throughout the film. The mind is against this movie. Some laughs good and some gore scenes make this pure herd slag traceable than the trash.
