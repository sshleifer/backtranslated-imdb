Back at the threshold of human civilization, the diggers sat around and made flat jokes, hit each other over their heads, and they had never seen, and apparently had tails at one time. These cavemen lived in a geographically diverse area with cacko, camel, monkey, but not women. This film speaks of seven (or so) cavemen's "fun" malformations - having burned their country with a new fire - moving to the new country with water, where they find this woman's extra annex. Along the way, we get such "great" moments of comedy like a bunker that swallows a frog that keeps the stomach curved. A monkey that throws stones in its heads. A man who swallows a mouse to get a frog in his stomach. Mandatory "gay" cave man. The list could continue and continue. This film is the definition of cinematographic dreck. I was bored from the beginning and it only got deeper when the caves dragged each other with a blow, making bad jokes, like the words perches, beating each other and poor Seta Berger, who looks like he lost his contribution to the producer. He is indeed one of the two bright spots in the film. He's not a lot of actors, so you have to guess why he's ass? Another "bright" place is music. As soon as I heard the score, I told her it was very familiar. I had never heard of a real score, but music was unmistakably Ennio Morricone. It's a nice score and the best thing else is a raw, boring, odorless, unimaginable, and ridiculous movie, mostly about a group of fashioners to find a woman for the first time and first want to eat her like some animal that is taught what she could do. Awwwwh! Sorry, I push the grip when I recycle the plot! At the end of the movie, there are about 100 or mostly naked women who have all the erotic feelings to pull off the knee. This movie was painful to sit and do nothing. The fact that it gave birth to a sequel does not surprise me, because it offers what sees the viewer's interest - the tail.
