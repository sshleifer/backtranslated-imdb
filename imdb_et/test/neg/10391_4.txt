The girl named Isobel becomes a demon. The local priest (who was formerly Isobel's sister) must try to save him, but the bigger problems are the family's doubts against each other, not the demon with his daughter. <br /> <br /> This movie is directed by Ethan Wiley, a "House" writer and "House II" writer / director. I loved the first movie and liked the other one right so you think it would be a winner. Unfortunately, it seems that the first year's film students have been throwing them together. Dawson Leery could have done better. I've been thinking of accusing a new writer, Ellary Eddy, especially because the idea is hardly original (are they trying to get into Emily Rose's exorcism fans?), But Wiley should have been able to do her magic. br /> <br /> You would also like to think that veteran horror stars Jeffrey Combs and James Russo would help this movie. Russo (bishop playing) hardly shows, and the combs play a big role in the sheriff ... within five minutes he's on the screen (but I love the mustache). So, don't help here. <br /> <br /> After you see "Exorcist", all other exorcism films have to be compared to the classic, no? And this demonic possession in this film was not the least scary. There is no dizzying or paranormal activity. Only girl with deep voice and colds. All "demonic" things focused around the father, accusing everyone of sleeping with their wife. As another reviewer wrote, "you get a lot of Isobel in your bed bouncing like a trampoline, hiding in your closet and jumping from a hay-attic. Yes, it's Chuck E. Cheese gone wild." Unfortunately, this is the extent of the "evil" of this film. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie about family members who invent charges and bully each other when the overwhelming daughter sits down in another room, this is your movie. But if you don't talk about my saying, you will have a terrible taste in the movie if that's what you're looking for. <br /> <br /> It seems that at the center of the plot is the father who accuses the cowboy sleeping, his wife (who was not, but slept with his daughter) and his wife, a doctor (who may be, but denies). And then you have a gardener who attacks a conquered girl with a crucifix and tells the family to call an exorcist, but when the priest arrives, the gardener tells her not to believe in God. What was the whole Bible quote you did five minutes ago? <br /> <br /> A terrible exorcism movie. Horribler examples of what Combs and Russo are capable of. And so sad show of leadership after the "House" movie series became classic. I would like to pretend that Wiley had no role in this shamefully derived and irrelevant film. The power of Christ forces you to avoid this film if it is a cardinal sin.
