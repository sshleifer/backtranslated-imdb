A young man who never knew his parents who were giving birth, would get an old farm in the isolated part of West Virginia upon the death of his natural father. She visits her property cross-section among potential victims, including a comic relief black man and a trendy lesbian couple. (Hmm, is it a skinny dip? Take it.) Unfortunately, the party ends when his evil grandfather died of the spirits of the drifters used as scarers. This movie starts well. The artistic assembly of depression photographs and counterfeit newspapers against FDR - which I think is his first appearance in a killer scarecrow - creates mood. I worked out some hopes for the film, which were partly realized. The story was usable enough. The setup was bucolic enough. Photography was mostly in focus. Acting, though not in great shaking, it was a little bigger for the movie range in the budget range. The film may have worked in the narrow demands of the genre, when the scarring was scary. But they weren't cheap. They weren't scary at all. The better the monster, the better the film. These scarred fears do not scare Dorothy, let alone Totos.
