I have now all seen 3. I just can't believe how bad Naqoyqatsi is. Not in comparison with others, but simply with its own achievements or absence. <br /> <br /> I don't understand how the average rating of this movie is over 10 out of ten. I gave the first 2 films out of 8 out of 10. I rated this movie 1. If 0 or a negative number was available, I would have given this rating. What a waste of time watching this movie was. I thought after the first 30 minutes I should turn it off, but then I thought it was just a (very) slow movie. I was thinking about the same thing for 45 minutes, then 1 hour and so on. Then I realized that it didn't fix it. <br /> <br /> It's very annoying to look at and without redemption features. Don't take my word, look at it yourself. Be sure to check out the first two films before. When you see this first, I can just make sure you never want to see the first two, but they are definitely much, much better than this "work". <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is when the role of credit is at the end. This is when your torture here is completed and you can foresee 89 minutes in the cleaning station for the suffering you have suffered when you watch this movie. If God is truly merciful, he is generous.
