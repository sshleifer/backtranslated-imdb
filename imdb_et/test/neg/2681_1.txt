Taste is a subjective thing. Two people can watch the same movie, one of them loves it and the other hates it. As for the "Halloween: Michael Myers Curse", I belong to the last category. <br /> <br /> I think John Carpenter made one of the best fiction films of this decade in 1978, which, despite his shortcomings, remains in the 21st century. He used many old horror movies again, but used them in original and effective ways. It had no claims that it was anything other than a fledgling mental patient who was chasing babysitters at Halloween night. And there were still "ideas" in the movie, but they were introduced in a delicate way and were not in the skull. The myths of the macabre festivals were alongside this story with the reality that had taken place, and it did so with great ambiguity. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers of this film probably do not understand this previous paragraph. That's why we have grieved us with this unfortunate and uneven piece of disposable cellulose. The direction, scenario that works, is the lowest possible images. This is a movie that is both dull and nausea, which forces you to return to the uterus and die. Indeed, it is really sad to see the veteran British actor Donald Pleasence waste his ability to act with the saliva of this film. He seems to have dried up all his energy and gave up on being his last film. Maybe he killed it.
