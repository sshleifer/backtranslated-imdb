Ask you not to watch this movie ... It starts with a promise and if it goes on, you want to end the movie ... Predictable, not fun at all, wasted movie ... Save your time and watch better thrillers. ... The synopsis sounds good and that's why I watched the movie ... But it was too predictable, without getting started with you ... No big tension ... no big deal ... nothing phenomenal ... away from it ... low rating ... Something to write about this movie so I'll fill the rest of the text lines so you can imagine how much time this movie will spend ... really upset, how good is the assumption, what was and how bad this scenario is out of it written ...
