Perhaps the weakest film in the "Kharise" series, despite John Carradine (Egyptian high priest) and George Zucco (as his predecessor, who has been terribly affected by bad Parkinson's disease), supporting Lon Chaney Jr. a named creature - if it really was under ties, because its contribution is at best negligible! I think it can be tracked for 60 minutes, but standards have fallen significantly compared to the previous two entries, and the end result is strictly routine and not at all memorable. The only interesting feature is that the female leader is the reincarnation of Princess Ananka, mentioned in many earlier films but never seen.
