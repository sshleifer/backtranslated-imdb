There are so many logical mistakes in this exhibition that are hardly worthy of me. 1) Mystic Gohan does not exist 2) Uub is as powerful as MAJIN BUU, but the game has no role in any way, but somehow every bad boy is able to easily 3) The whole idea of ​​Super Saiyan 4 has slowed down and it's terrible that he loses super 17 (which is the worst idea for the DB villain EVER) 4) Super Saiyan 4 Goku doesn't fit Super 17, but Goku didn't change when he moved in a movie that didn't have to happen, he kills 5) Vegeta is completely useless 6) No other way than Goku has any effect on the results of the battles 7) The series ends with a bomb of bomb ... come 8) Goku invincible? swallows dragons? flat 9) Gotenks? ... better Goten ??? Trunks ??? they both suck 10) Super Saiyan 4 includes magical transformation into adulthood 11) Goku is a child 12) Goku is a child 13) No super-cyan level 2 (characterized by electricity) 14) No Gogeta 15 animation imagination) Gogeta completely useless 16) Big Bang Kamehameha is the biggest abandoned anime story (not really logical, but I'm going out with a tangle) 17) The shortest character ever fight <br /> <br /> I could go longer if I didn't repress most of the memories associated with this show. If I make enough money, I fund the reprocessing of this series.
