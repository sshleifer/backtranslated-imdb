[WARNING: Some spoilers have been added, although this is a documentary.] <br /> <br /> I bought this documentary because I like the work of D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus, featuring MOON OVER Broadway, STARTUP.COM, and WAR ROOM. Looking at this ultimately boring and remarkable account of the Depeche Mode tour of 1988, I realized that they had nothing to do with the film. The band members were certainly less than the future cameras; So, no doubt, the competition was added to add fans to the one-week bus trip to get things up a bit. Really, now, I mean. Who thought the concert movie with a good keyboard and singer was a synthetic pop band? I like the music of Depeche Mode and Martin Gore writes good melodies, but seeing them together did not seem to be interesting and this film is a proof. If you are not a huge fan of Depeche Mode, stay away from this documentary .... it's a total waste of time.
