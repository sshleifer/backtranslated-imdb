Kurosawa's film is never disappointed, but it's probably the first one. "Doppelganger" is the worst thing I've seen about this director. What? Kurosawa's most frightening film is definitely "Cairo". And if you think it's horrible, you will be surprised. It cannot be classified as horror or thriller. It's drama and pretty bad. Many scenes that were supposed to be shocking have proved to be funny and many plots are really confusing. And because it's Kurosawa, it's slow. But it's so slow that you lose interest in forty minutes and feel you are doing something else. The most disturbing thing was the use of CGI. Now, if used well, CGI can be really cool. But if it is filled with little care ... It can be a disaster. I think it describes here one scene with very little use of CGI. Koji Yakusho gives an excellent result with the rest of the pain. But that's pretty much it ... <br /> <br /> Please, do yourself a favor and go if you want to be scared of Cairo or Ko-Rei. It's a bad, bad test for a smart drama. What it is intelligent, but ... Well, there's a lot missing.
