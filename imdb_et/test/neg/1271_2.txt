Theodor Sparkuhl's well-photographed rich costumes and rich costumes, and a good (not great) Janning's presentation, Henryna, cannot overcome poor writing and static camera work. Henny Porten looks like a landscape like Anne. <br /> <br /> It's all very beautiful; but it is the whole surface and depth. The melodramatic story of a woman with an accident put it in America, where the expressionist "Dr Caligar's Cabinet" flopped in the same year (1920), which proved that what is going on is not popular. Lubitsch is remembered for his living comedies, not for sterile glasses.
