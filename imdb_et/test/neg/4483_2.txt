OK, let's start with the good thing: nice scenery, Channing Tatum is easy to see, Amanda Seyfried has a nice hair, that's it. How much of this movie was delivered to the room floor? Probably a plot, an action, a good dialogue and a point. Terrible action, terrible dirty dialogue. Let me tell you how bad it is: my friend, who always cries in movies, came to the part that was supposed to create tears, and she laughed so hard we thought she was crying! The film seems to want to take too many questions - war, loss, autism, cancer, but it is unable to cover one topic satisfactorily so unhappy. Make sure you have something you want and return your cell phone text messages!
