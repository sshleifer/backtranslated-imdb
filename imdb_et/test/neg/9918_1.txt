Undoubtedly one of the worst films. The film is slow and without a structure, tension or story, on the thin assumption that the exhibition is put together. Conflicts are resolved within two or three seconds of their onset and the dialogue is random and random. Everything is put together in slapdash order, and often "stepping out" seems to be more deleted scenes than the actual movie. The film seems to exist only as an exhibition for the musical number of liza and totally random Liza. Shelly Winters can be seen from the much better Octo-epic "Tentacles" and REAL Liza is found in "Queer Duck: The Movie" in Showtime.
