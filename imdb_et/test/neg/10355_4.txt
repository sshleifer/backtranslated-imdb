There is something about this exhibition that follows me and hopes for its future. When writing, the jokes are little and far, and the story is drilled so I think it must be physical comedy and visuals. <br /> <br /> I enjoy camera movement, clothing and wardrobe. It is amusingly contrasting with the prevailing mood. And I'm pretty sure that every time I was laughing, it was John or Molly's physical comedy. Two of them make a painfully pair, which makes me laugh and want to dress at the same time. <br /> <br /> So here I am going to sit down for Kath & Kim one more day today to see what the way this production will go down (or may happen if we wait positively).
