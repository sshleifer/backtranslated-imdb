I think this is one of the few films I want to evaluate as little as possible to pay for this compliment. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this movie in about 25 years, so I really can't talk much about it. It is still very difficult to find a video. But I remember my brother and I stumbled somewhere late in the late night of the 1980s when I was about 10 years old when I was drinking UHF TV. So I've never seen the beginning of the movie, but I saw it mostly. The first thing I remember is that this couple sniffs out of the camp and they drive out to the island to get out, and then they attack the crazy Scotsman ax! They can escape from him, but they can attack the Loch Ness monster, which in this movie is just a head and neck that has no body. Monster's eyes and mouth don't even move, it looks like a pi√±ata. <br /> <br /> I thought I had literally ever seen this size before, and that blew my mind completely. At the beginning of the 80s I had seen some bad movies on TV, but I've never seen anything so intuitive and so casually and thoughtlessly built that it seemed that the people who did it spent less time and effort on it than we watched it . I had already seen some Troma movies and things that deliberately try to be "campy," but it was pure and real stuff, and that was my first meeting with really big bad filmmaking. This movie was like the beginning of the era and I got it on time. In fact, if we watched it, we couldn't figure out if it was done in the 50s or 70s. It turns out that it came out just a few years before I saw it. <br /> <br /> Later I was in contact with Mystery Science Theater and found many old B-movies and games, but I had already seen it in the movie. The movie is so funny that I've never laughed at the Monty Python team or Bill Murray or the comedian. After this movie I saw I always tried to search for "good bad" movies and got it a lot of friends. But this film was and is basically impossible to find. I never knew what it was, or who Larry Buchanan was up to the 1990s when IMDb started and the internet got up and the information started moving. But this movie has yet to be discovered by many others who value their transcendental bad qualities. Find it.
