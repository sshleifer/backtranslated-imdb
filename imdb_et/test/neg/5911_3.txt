Just read the other comments here and I was a little surprised that no one said anything about actors and plots. <br /> <br /> Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy can both offer an amazing example of a stand-up comedy. The big actors they're not. It is enough. <br /> <br /> What about a plot? Oh man. Every time a movie tries to "fool" you into believing that the good guys are losing, you know these scenes: "What? Good guys lose? Oh .. I see, it was just a trick," it's done so terrible kilometers away. <br /> <br /> It was 2 or 3 funny moments, but not enough to save the day. <br /> <br /> It's a bit stupid that these comments must now be 10 lines. Many people do it together to be eligible. The art is short.
