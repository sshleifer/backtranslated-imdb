I remember reading that Darwin had a central experience on the Galapagos Islands, seeing a large number of animals there and intern, giving his evolutionary theory. Not that movie - it was inspired by British land. OK, and like John Cleese would say-Right-. Nor did I think that Darwin was a person suffering from a deep personal conflict and someone suffering from flights of blind reverence and torment. According to this movie he was. It is sad that he has apparently lost one of his daughters illness, but I do not believe that losing his family member would have greatly influenced the human's scientific abilities. Well, not right ... you get the picture. I think there is nothing worse than turning science into a fictional, and in a movie when it tries to break the theory of evolution, saying it comes from a man who was emotionally unstable, which is just plain for me. I think Charles Darwin was the soul of the scientific research, cool and calm, and always thought logically. This film tries to dramatically explain unknown research. It's like the story of Canterbury. I don't recommend it.
