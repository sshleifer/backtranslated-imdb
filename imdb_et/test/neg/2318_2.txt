Although I'm sure the idea seemed good on paper, and it complained to me when I first heard about it, this movie often links and falls, and when I watch it, I just want it to end. At best, the beginning and the end of the film have emerged, with regard to the film about worrying about Lou's childcare, even though I found that a long policeman is humorous. But I found a little laugh with the bottom of the barrel script that was thrown to the two big comedians. I thought it was a mistake to put them in the musical, and it's the "Ozzi Wizard" rip-off (with songs and black and white to color format). I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone other than the deadly A&C fanatics. Someone else is frustrated and has much better movies.
