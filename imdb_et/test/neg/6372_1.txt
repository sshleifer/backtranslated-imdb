I have collected Iron Man comics since the early 70s and have always enjoyed the character that is far from the average pure hero and his many and diverse enemies. At least three attempts have been made in the Iron Man animated series and only the original and the second part have ever made the character fair. So I was somewhat hoping that this latest version would be good. The boy was wrong! DVD art is very misleading and represents an image that is not a film. Turn off the good things, little ... Art and animation are well drawn, and writing and dialogue are generally good, though significant exceptions. The voices of the characters are very well chosen and each character is distinctive and well-behaved. Now it's bad ... Unfortunately, the writers decided that they were both of Iron Man's origin and especially Mandarin around them. In addition, they decided to make Iron Man and his opponents in CGI. Bad CGI. It makes them stand out as bad as live actors. CG's work is often repeated and sometimes short shortcuts take place. CG battles are also clumsy, which further adds to the fact that CG and line animation do not interfere well. The film would certainly have been better if they had chosen all the characters. Another problem is that Iron Man is in his traditional red and golden suit with one battle! And it's not even a big fight at the end. All of this pulls the movie down and it never picks up. <br /> <br /> ************ SPOILERS (or Warnings) MAY FOLLOW *********** * <br /> <br /> The film starts with interesting from a series of unusual machines, welding and gearboxes. Then we are introduced to the process of restoring the Chinese temple and what is known by fans as Mandarin is outstanding. Things go strangely, preventing the restoration of the temple. It's followed by James Rhodes, Tony Stark's long-time friend. Indeed, they seem to intend to raise the temple from the earth, despite the opposition of the group, who demand that lifting the temple lead to a terrible disaster. Rhodes have been kidnapped. Stark, shown in a lovely lady in a bubble bath, is aware of the problems and tries to personally follow the project and save her friend, while in the background her father is working with management who want Tony removed. Tony arrives only to have his armed escort under attack and blown. Later, Tony wakes up in a deadly wounded heart and rebel prison. He is only saved by the quick action of Rhodes and the scientist. Ultimately, Stark must build a gray iron prototype and make a good escape, but only after some human casualties. With the rebels, he meets Li Mei with the troubled girl and these two fall in love. The temple is lifted and four elementary beings appear (all done in CG) and continue to collect the hidden power rings. Stark and Rhody find problems at home, but they are faced with those elements that can't really stop them. First use the Aquatic Armor, then the more classic red and golden armor, and finally everything back to the temple and Stark is back in the bulky gray armor Final showdown and running with what may be Fin Fang Foom (also in CG). Here the story is very complicated, as it turns out that mandarin needs a host institution. This leads to a somewhat tragic final battle that is disturbed by the fact that the mandarin is a bit more than a ghost and it is not seen in the last 5 minutes of the movie. ugh ... <br /> <br /> If you are a Iron Man fan, you probably won't enjoy this trip. And even non-fans can miss the movie somewhat or not.
