I was quite excited when I saw this movie at the Montreal Film Festival. Together with the elephant and some other people, I thought that the issue of American weapons violence / culture would be treated intelligently and fashionably for the film's visitors. The press release promised (not so many words) a "violin violin" for a crowd of weapons violence that makes us ponder our NRA-shoot-up-up thinking in this country. <br /> <br /> After 9: 15 years of waiting for a 9-hour screening (what technical difficulties would they have crossed me), we finally arrived to see the movie from DV (where 35MM was advertised?) . I think I just answered my first question. <br /> <br /> The result is a terrible mess. We get a "weapon" vignette that has the most unrealistic "biker" I've ever seen (and I know more than a couple). Movie Expiration is insignificant for "character development" only because characters are either a. stereotypical, b) losers, c. stereotypical losers and / or racial cartoons. It takes another 30 minutes for the plot to move and when we are there, we want conversations between couples and / or couples. cyclists and pawnshops. <br /> <br /> The film finds this conclusion, but without leaving the clich√©s, I was not interested in the characters of the white trash that had come into contact with the weapon, and how the minority should have the NAACP immediately cry because all these people are pursuing a weapon, because they are at the bottom of society's trash and are looking for an option wherever it was found. would have given at least some hobbies to the symbols. <br /> The biggest problem is the promise that is not fulfilled. The plot overview was great. P.T. Anderson or Gus Van Zandt could have been a powerful piece. But because of a bad scenario, direction, or both, it is an unmodified confusion that must be ignored at all costs. <br /> <br /> My biggest question is who in the multiannual financial framework thought it was a competition material. Better to sue this Showtime at 3:00. <br /> <br /> Art Blose
