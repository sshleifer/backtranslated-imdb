it seems that if you post here, this is a 10-star rating, nobody seems to like something nice, well I'm honest, some don't like it, but here we go, rachel ray show is just terrible. !!!!!!, this exhibition reminds me of the nature of the bird if it were cooking - no matter what the show.i must say that I liked the rachel in the food network for $ 35- $ 40 a day, but I am sorry he doesn't have enough life experience to make her interesting day and day, give me the street kink, anthony bourdain, interesting people, but above all i find she is annoying, she actually told the studio audience member "stuck" yes funny way but busy is busy and who cares about their pet stories, sorry that Rachel has been canceled !!!!
