I doubt who has written this scenario has ever read Mansfield Park ... or if they haven't, it wasn't very good. No character is what they should be: Fanny is alive and aware of his ill-treatment, while Sir Thomas, who treated him well, seems to have fallen accidentally into Aunt Norris's personality. In addition, Fanny is not the first person to tell the story or his character. Fanny is not an entertaining heroine, and I say he is not meant to be. In addition, Fanny flirting with Edmund in the movie version is shamelessly from the beginning when they are raised brother and sister! Austen Fanny would have diminished as a result of any flirting, and the novel would make the pairing of Fanny / Edmund very uncomfortable ... as it should be. Unlike other Jane Austen novels (P&P, Emma), Mansfield Park does not survive the strength of its female protagonist. This is a very different novel than others; it is not meant for the love story. I watched this movie because I've just finished reading Mansfield Park and I'm totally terrible of what I see; Miss Austen runs in her grave.
