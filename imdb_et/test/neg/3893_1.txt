Now, get me wrong, I love a good movie, and after watching the thin red line (and love it), I was eager to watch Terrence Malicks' two previous movies and, having just watched the sky days, my enthusiasm to see Badlands has practically disappeared . <br /> <br /> I have noticed a lot of beautiful photography, but I saw this movie on a terribly old VHS tape, which made it obviously terrible. I can say that I hope photography was great because it would have been one of the only interesting films. Not because the submergers have fallen asleep during the movie. This film felt so long (and it wasn't!), The editing was filthy and separate, the story was not there, the voice was confusing, the twilight, all the things touched. I know Malick wasn't sure how to make a movie. Consequently, he shot a lot of video material and spent about two years editing, trying to put it all together. This is very obvious on the screen. Everything looks cut, every time the scene seemed to be somewhat more brisk (or some form of character), it would be boring things cut from boring scenes. As if somebody tried to concentrate the story on people's agricultural production. Some good points are the end of the music and the end scene, but these things are not close enough to preserve the points of interest. Usually let a bad movie pass without being too vocal, but if it is so highly appreciated, something has to be said. <br /> <br /> Maybe the farmer wants to ...?
