What we have given in this aspiring trendy film is the "frat-pack" of college friends, which is now approaching the age of 30 (which we all know, of course, is considered a "new 20" generation). Consisting of four men and gals, we have pushed us to the following types: seemingly "unemployed" and frequent drug addicts with one person who is successful at work and who is trying to be. They are all drifting in their own way, trying to find the future as well as emotional happiness. With one exception, maybe two exceptions, those people who definitely shouldn't take care of this model after that. After disappointment, almost all of your life is disappointing after disappointment. Except for the individual (who appears when he finds it), no person seems to be able to move towards emotional satisfaction in his life. And so, the only sincere moment in this movie is when knocking on the door brings this respondent an unexpected and heartfelt "I love you." <br /> <br /> With only the exceptions mentioned, these people are the ones that are hardly worthy of or deserve several hundred thousand dollars when playing these stories. <br /> <br /> PS writer / director, Johnson, seems to be having a problem with sexual sexual scenes - --- the lack of such problems in long-term and revealing heterosexual problems. Why is it like that? <br /> <br /> ****
