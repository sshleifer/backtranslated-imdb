All those who criticize Soprano for its Italian stereotypical images have not seen anything before they have a good view of this cormorant gangster film that focuses on such an irritating family, you almost want them to be rubbed out. > <br /> The parents of this clan are not so bad, but their two little boys - one harsh, one amazingly cutesy-poo - are inadequate, while their older son and Pollyanna's daughter compete to compete for public contempt. But their grandfather's all right, Granddaddy. Like Chic Sale (in full "Dag-nabbit!" Mode), he acts as a moral compass for movies, throwing a lot of diatribes "dang, dirty aliens" for good measurement. If these are good guys, it is no wonder that the players of this era who played bad became big stars. <br /> <br /> Not that there are stars among criminal actors, but at least get rid of better than Lithuanian Lithuanian network. Inadequate police officers do not even have enough time to bring things on the screen. Only Walter Huston, as a district commissioner, raises clich√© abducted material in breathless breathing tests. <br /> <br /> The film deserves credit for being an early entry into what is a very popular mute-witness formula, and it does not burn its difficult-to-bite underworld lifestyle image, but the genre is quite simple - and less xenophobic - examples.
