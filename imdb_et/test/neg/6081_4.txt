As usual, Leo Gorcey (Slip Mahoney) and "The Bowery Boys" are forced to cash in. After trying to sell your old bicycle successfully, boys are looking for help at a local bank. There's an unhappy Huntz Hall (like Sach) in his picture made by a real photographer at Teala Loring (like Cathy Smith). But since the blow was made during the robbery, he makes Mr Hall look like the main suspect. What palms Bobby Jordan (Bobby), William "Billy" Benedict (like Whitey) and David Gorcey (Chuckina); Mr. Gorcey wants to clear the hall and collect $ 1,000 in cash. "Bowery Bombshell" passes through the movements, the main strength of Mrs Loring. <br /> <br /> Bowery Bombshell (7/20/46) Phil Karlson ~ Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Teala Loring, Bobby Jordan
