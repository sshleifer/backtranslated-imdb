Carlos Mencia is not funny. Carlos Mencia is not funny when he talks about breaking a train set train. I've been trying to convince people for two years to steal other comic jokes and when his comedy stuff goes, he's a regular "Johnny-come-recently" with much less than sub-parameters. Psycho astronauts joking? Britney Spears Attacking Jokes? I hope this is just a scheduling mistake, but come to Carlos and Comedy Central, these topics and many others have been to late night TV show hosts opening monologues, Saturday night live, mad television and many others. Demolition of ethnic and racial stereotypes? Comedy is not evolving with Carlos Mencia. Maybe people, especially viewers and comedians, get a point because this week's "New York" magazine gave him the exact inscription: "Carlos Mencia, a unique joke-filer."
