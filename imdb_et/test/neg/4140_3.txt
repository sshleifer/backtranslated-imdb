If there is one word I can associate with this movie, its "embarrassment". It must be embarrassing for the film to be seen in the theater. All - script, script, dialogues, lyrics, direction - dirty, sad. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie when I was a child. That's why it was mainly because it was a fantasy, superhero film. This is a non-so-called genre in the Hindi cinema. The test deserves credit, but that's all. Sashi Kapoor seems to be very fast in making the film. Do not understand the reason why foreigners are cast into Hindi-speaking characters who do not even have the right to synchronize (say something about duplication). The scenario is terrible. Edit even more. If the dialogue is followed closely, it is possible to detect grammatically incorrect sentences (which completely change the meaning). There is nothing special about music. <br /> <br /> The greatest embarrassment must be on the Censor board. The film has a couple of pinched scenes, one of which is completely clear (so much that I don't even think of a metaphor). The director missed them. The editing team missed it. And the censor board was also missed. So many non-indecent-exposition-screen motto. Probably officials were asleep while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> You can't think of why Amitabh played its role. This may be because he was a good friend of Kapoor. But the role has nothing to do with it. With amazing roles in Humi and Agneepath, he couldn't follow it worse. There are a couple of heroic scenes, really worth it. Otherwise, they are embarrassingly disgusting (for example, arrowing .. it would probably have been better with CGI but it was '91 ..). <br /> <br /> Dimple and Sonam are not exactly on the screen of fire. Shammi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor give inspired results, but their scope is limited. Amrish Puri is his usual fairy tale (laughing forever laughing laughter). <br /> <br /> In general, it is an interesting concept. Could be much better.
