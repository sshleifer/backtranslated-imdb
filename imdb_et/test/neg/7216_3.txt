The original Road House is by no means an award-winning film. But this is one of the greatest innocent pleasures of all time. It shouldn't have done this. There's no need for a big budget, big letters, and outstanding visual effects. Even the story didn't have to be original. All you needed was a good time and some great fist fighting. I don't think of a Matrix-style "wire-fu" but some well-choreographic bar sticks. Many of them. The film has a few decent struggles, but none of them is memorable and focuses more on playing weapons. In addition to how it relates to the original film, it is ridiculous, offensive. Johnathon Schaech plays Shane Tanner, a secret DEA agent who has good hands and feet. But here's the kicker ... he is Dalton's son, Patrick Swayze !!!! Say what ????? Let's see, the original Road House was made in 1989. So Dalton would have a son in his late 20s (maybe even 30) in 2006 ... but you get the idea. They give him a cheesy explanation that he lived with his uncle Nate (Will Patton) when his father "traveled a lot". Oh please. It's almost legitimate to close this movie. But I ground. Schaech is completely out of its elements. Of course he can throw a few strokes, but he has nothing to do with the actor. Plus, she has referred to the movie's bad guys as a "beautiful boy". I've never studied men carefully, but I don't think this guy looks too good. He looks sick. Her face is too thin and her drowned eyes look like she's going to go out at any moment. I wouldn't have heard of him before, but I think he should give up and go back to his day. Jake Busey plays local Wild Runner. Busey is not a terrible actor. He was good at Starship Troopers and even made Hitcher 2 a threatening scraper. Even his "threatening" dialogue is a must. We should buy him as a man with a whole city in his pocket. But why? What is he doing? Because he wants to buy a Pattonist bar in "any way"? Ellen Hollman has the symbolic role of a girlfriend. A secret woman. It's too difficult to think of this secret as 2 + 2. He is a local primary school teacher who is a former military soldier. Guess what that means? This means that although he may be afraid to fear most of the movie, he is ready to crush his head when the fur is flying. Well, at least she's hot. In fact, the fight between him and Wild Bill's girl in the film is the best. It's fast, brutal and fun. What brings me to the next problem with the film ... fights. As I said, Schaech knows how to break. The same cannot be said by someone he sees in the film. Of course, all the films come between Schaech and Busey. Busey is an actor, not a fighter. He has no skills to fight the film. Swayze can be a trained dancer, but his athletic ability gave him the tools to draw choreographic struggles. He also faced a few worthy opponents, and one killer (literally) moved. None of this here. With a few exceptions, the struggles are forced, poorly staged and routine. Blows sound like someone who captures 2X4 on concrete, and there are even a few parts where the sound doesn't even fit. It's embarrassing. There's not even good south / red music in the original. Road House had a Jeff Healy Band who was a somewhat popular band at that time. This film is made by singer John Otto, whose music is dull and his behavior is even worse. He has given one line in the film that was apparently inserted to attract the fans he has. Is it, or somebody owes it to him. My last complaint about the film is that it's just picky ... consistency. Films are released from the sequence and the editor's task is to put it all together. Well, somebody should give the editor of this movie a little hit. Problems range from small things like people who don't see the same direction when shots change, to the RE-USED footage at the end of the movie. At first we will introduce The Black Pellican bar. When the camera moves through the bar, you will see a band, bouncers and people dancing. At the end of the movie, when the bad guys are hit, we get another picture of the same bar where our hero sits with his girl at the bar. The problem is that the film material of the people in the bar is SAME footage from the beginning of the movie !!! I'm not doing you. It is the same people who are dancing in the same places wearing the same clothes. Want to know the funniest part? You can see the hit images that had been killed in the movie before. Do yourself a favor, don't watch this movie unless you feel the need to go out. This movie makes you angry to do it.
