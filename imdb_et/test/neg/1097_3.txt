Director J.S. Cardone presents something a little scary and a bit creepy, but nothing more. The mother of the widow, Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring), inhibits the home in the Pennsylvania mountains; so he takes his two daughters and moves into a sprawling building that seems somewhere in the middle. But somewhere, ninety-two years ago, the tragic mining accident demanded the lives of many children who were forced to work in the dark and stabbed. It seems that the area, and especially the mansion of Tunn, are haunted by the spirits of the souls of little little evil. The legend is that screaming children come to the moonlight to look for their revenge; and you believe it better. Also cast: Ben Cross, Scout Taylor-Compton, Chloe Moretz, Julie Rogers, and Geoffrey Lewis.
