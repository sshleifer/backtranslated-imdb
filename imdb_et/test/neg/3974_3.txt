... The TV movie 70 is sort of. This is one of those films that appear in hours, but rarely, because the more recent late-night movies will hit it. It has nice performances by Graves and Wynn. In general, it's just a safe little piece of something that doesn't break too badly. Something good, a lot that is mediocre.
