Extremely formal with cosmic logic holes and comedy. Aw, poor NYC lawyer! He's just scraping, and if he gets a cut in wages, he won't go to find another job, though he's one of the most detained lawyers in the region. We see him claiming in court that others are coming and congratulating him on his fiery, winning delivery, but he cannot hold anyone in his company. At home, problems are ignored until people come out of the storm. <br /> <br /> The only sign you want to root is the final servant who seems to be the real person who uses logic and communication to survive. the world. How ridiculous that a servant would bring a lawyer and his wife a chicken and wine for the New Year's Eve because he feels them! (Bit doesn't play laugh.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, too unbelievable and ** SPOILER ** pat, every 180 degrees ends. How did they get top-notch stars for that? If I had been in the studio, I would have sent it back for one full writing.
