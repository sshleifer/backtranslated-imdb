I completely forgot that I saw it in a few days, which is quite revealing. The secret of Gaston's Phantom Leroux locked-in country house has heard that it was an interesting and witty update. So it seemed like a nice headline and some clean touch in the opening picture, but the movie stopped very fast and became vaguely annoying and completely satisfied. <br /> <br /> As a mystery, the main problem is the main problem. that the audience cannot solve it in principle: as the worst of Agatha Christies, it depends on the character in the Final Act, which has a lot of background information that we have not given. As a film, whether it be comedy or a thriller, the crucial problem is that the characterization is almost non-existent. Except for the killer, everyone has a typical suspect typical of a typical land-breaking story - a reporter, a heir to the end, a suspicious groom, a scattered scientist's father (surprisingly bad for Michel Lonsdale) and so on. depth and low interest and often too mature or incorrectly rated performances do not help. Frankly, nobody cares about it, so there is no danger and no relationship. Only Claude Rich and the last reel Pierre Ardit can do something, and only on the last reel does the film go closer to resonant feelings that are too short to be truly effective. <br /> <br /> For the rest, we get endless exposure and a couple of ineffective comic book sets (budding with the grandfather inside the grandfather's clock have been too badly thought about to pay off), Dving Podalydes reduced Irving to explain the last third of the picture. I don't like country house movies or Agatha Christie's style, so those who are capable will feel this loosely, but I found it to be a bad show. As Rich says, when the secret turns out, "It's all a disappointment."
