Jack-O (1995) was really a bad movie, we're talking about snoozefest x 100, no entertainment value, no budget, gore, Z-class actors, etc. etc. not done !!! The only reason I bought this movie was because I knew that Linnea Quigley was in it and sure she'd make her mandatory naked shower scene that was lovely yes. <br /> <br /> But like a movie for yourself. ...... I slept in a 40-minute stage and I had no desire to finish it, it's just big flat OK. <br /> <br /> I love horror films, I'm an avid fan, MASSIVE fan, I love low budget horrors, I love it all, but I hated this garbage so I think it tells you all you need to know "JACK-O". <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2/10, "2" is for a 2 minute Linnea shower scene, the film itself is ZERO !!!!
