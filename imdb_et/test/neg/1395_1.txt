... so where's my friggin trophy? I was looking seriously at the banner and confetti to fall from my ceiling to look at this 30-minute gaze. Comedy Central is pulling the ball recently to try to fill the gap left by Chappelle with a number of season-slower men who embody outdated men. Dah duh nah !! When we pay attention to the show, you notice that if Mencia does not beat the punchline and laughs at his sketches, he only makes exaggerated observations that seem like a lack of sense of humor. Have you ever noticed how Buick's driving people are really slow? It's like Dah duh nah! Even dwarf and semi-mature chicks are not able to interfere with Mencia's special lack of talent. In addition, Mencia is not even a "wet break", as she constantly and carefully declares she is a scam that is all about it. <br /> <br /> If something good could be said about Mencia, it is her effort. The man is not clearly a talent, but like a wounded antelope in the mouth of a hungry alligator, God knows he is trying.
