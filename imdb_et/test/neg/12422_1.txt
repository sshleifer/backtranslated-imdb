The legendary pop star Steve Alaimo ("Don't let the sun shine on you") marks an unlikely rider who has been hit by a quarry (ha ha) because he runs his car constantly (or, as he says, "I") m tired of every wheel behind a fat-like monkey). He gets into the humorous unfair Nazi cyclists of the bad crowd, whose name is unlikely to be Jeeter, Banjo, Fats and er, Linda. Fat is most pleasant in the bunch; he took a surfboard on the back of the skull and now communicates only through the ground, a kind of Harley Davidson Leatherface. <br /> <br /> In any case, Steve is fooled by scammers to catch the middle of looting. their bank robberies. Gang rubs banks only "hitting, man". I think they're giving money for charity. Steve continually fails, cyclists get pregnant and the whole thing never comes bold because it's so boring. This film looks like it was filmed on degreased paper. Not because "Necromantic" is a movie so that it closed my soul. <br /> <br /> The man who played fats went on to Derang, the biological star of Ed Gein, with Robert Blossom. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in conclusion: Wild Rebels: Hullful in MST3K, terrible everywhere else.
