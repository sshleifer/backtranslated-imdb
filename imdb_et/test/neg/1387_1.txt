Did you find the title funny? Oh, you didn't? Well that's because you're real. Learn to laugh because if you don't laugh, you won't live. So please lower your standards in relation to what you believe is a funny child. Is it funny? Still not ?! OK, it's because you're full of yourself and too easily offended. If you don't laugh, you won't live. And if you don't like me, send me a hate post so I can write another review and note how much hate I get and try to turn it around, changing it as if I was a bad ass. Do you laugh at my fun title yet? Still not?!?! OK that's it! You're racist! You have to laugh or else you are racist. Why else wouldn't you laugh? Oh, it's not funny!?! No, it can't be why. I want it to be funny so it's !! Laugh fucking it !! Please !!! Deedeedee !! Durdurdur !! Please !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OK, that's it. Where's my notepad and pencil? And where's my Richard Pryori DVD? I have to write some jokes for my show. <br /> <br /> And ...... scene. Thank you, thank you. <br /> <br /> This is basically what you get from Mencia for about 23 minutes. Please, do yourself a favor and change the channel when this bomb show takes place. Even on major cable TVs, things are 100x better. I don't even say that because I hate him. I'm real. This exhibition is like watching grass. Not sure that at least grass doesn't steal jokes. I'm trying to honestly save my time. I even tried watching my show. I said to myself, "Maybe he's not that bad." But no, he is. I looked completely when I looked at his exhibition. I tried to gather and focus on the show during a commercial interruption, but I couldn't. I pointed out again, I think I was thinking of something more interesting, like restoring my bed, vacuuming or folding my socks. Before I knew it, the show was over. Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> Here's my last point - 30 minutes are so many things you can do, besides that this guy doesn't say anything for half an hour. Don't look at an example of trying to empty your face. I can support exhibitions that try to ease the tension in the race, but this man gives more racism rather than stopping it.
