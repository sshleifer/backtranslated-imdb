This film had a very unique effect for me: it stopped my understanding that this movie really sucks! It's a hidden "thinker movie" in a similar way to Memento and other such jewels, but in the end, and even after a few minutes, you realize it's nothing but a pretense. Probably some collage students wrote with friends to tell him that his writing sucks. The whole idea is ?? I don't even know if he tried to supernatural scratch from scratch or want us to believe that because somebody fills his mind (very weak, btw) with foolish "riddles", what do you learn in the primary school cavity, you suddenly get to "one truth" everything, you have to kill someone and admit it? !!! What? How, why, why, WHY? Similarly, to make a cake, discard a bunch of ingredients and add water? forgot about cooking? I think these men forgot, did not explain, but show WHY it happened? You have to do this when you submit a story that, in normal and everyday work (wrong solving puzzles), begins to have an unusual effect on people. By acting, it was terrible that this girl always tried to look cute at the camera and the guy from Highlanders, a series that worked like a heavy metal store (yes, they're all real, though s-o-b's). "Dangerous" atmosphere with "oh-so-wise" puzzles (enter the 60's Batman and Robin series with the appearance of Riddle's appearance) and the fools who claim to have "knowledge" behind this smile on their face? I'm just terrible, HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> I am usually very involved with low-budget films and tend to root down the losers by giving them more praise than they deserve, but it's just a ugly excuse for a movie that keeps you good for one and a half hours, and in the end you just mind that you fell for it.
