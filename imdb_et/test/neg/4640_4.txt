The second day - this film requires you to watch it one more day to understand it. I enjoy watching Shannen Doherty carefully and I was quite interested in seeing how well Julian McMahon and Shannen and Charmed played the roles played. I can definitely PRAISE see the whole film's operational skills, even the production - but the plot ... what happened? I lose for words because I'm still confused. I must remain loyal to actors who really did a good job, taking into account the madness of the plot. I also have to recommend looking at it, because despite the plot-madness I would look at it over and over again.
