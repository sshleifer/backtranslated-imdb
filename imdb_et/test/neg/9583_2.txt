It looks like a pretty innocent choice first - the name "moon worker" can call the bells "Office Space" and show "Office Clerk". I don't think so. It's not even a dark comedy. The director of this film, the name of each man, was a complete jerk and he had a sick, perverted mind. It is no pleasure to lure you to feel sorry for the complete loser who cheats on her wife, steals her top level job and is through her teeth around the clock. The second one that I enter into the room when I enter the room (and believe me, they looked more, because they prayed that there would be at least some relief, maybe even a fable, finally, sending a warm message) with good justice and good boys look good). All the good guys were killed so long that they didn't have time to look good. No memorial was made. <br /> <br /> This movie is bounded with madness. It ignores the elderly, the dead and the women - and the director tries to please people. <br /> <br /> I just gave this movie two just because the soundtrack was good. But even that was not memorable. If you were lucky not to see it in the theaters, my friends would definitely not do it at home.
