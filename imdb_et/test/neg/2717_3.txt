I'm just happy. I like bad movies. I like movies that contain attractive young women in small quantities of clothes. <br /> <br /> This movie gives you all the bad name mentioned above. Yeah, you know it's going to be what you get is not high art or anything else. But even with this movie type, Beach Babes From Beyond is very good. Some people have given it to 10. I can only assume that these are the people who have had the organs that allow the surgical removal of rational thinking. <br /> <br /> It's not very good. It's just not very good. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 only a) novelty values ​​for famous relatives and Burt Ward; and b) some girls are cute. <br /> Oh, by the way, did I tell you it wasn't very good?
