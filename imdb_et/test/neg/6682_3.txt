It was the first feature for Clinton, I was there while he shot this confusion in Adelaide about 98 ... <br /> <br /> Although I was not directly involved in production, I was witnessing a typical delusional behavior, a mail set that went down: parties, narcotics, illusory glamor, really an example of what not to do when making a film, but also a by-product of young, talented people that fell into classical ideologies of fame and world position. <br /> <br /> I like Clinton, we had a curious friendship, she deserves another mature mature script ... there are problems and I'm sure a lot better work will be done next time. Because, frankly, he definitely didn't want to make his own CV or do it ... but hey, it was a paid job in a country where participants die regularly of hunger <br /> <br /> All in all, exciting to "do" basically, not so much fun to experience (unfortunately!).
