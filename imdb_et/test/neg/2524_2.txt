I had read online comments that praised this hidden departure as a combination of horror, uncomfortable black comedy and border art; the film has all three elements, but they are in the service of such an extremely silly assumption (the title immediately gives away the game)? and Amateur Production for Boot? that his long-term negligence due to a lack of proper distribution? basically until Cult Epics took it to the DVD, released 30 years after its launch! ? there was no big loss of cinema or even genre (s). The bed was probably created to accommodate the demon against the woman; anyway, a dead man who had used a four-poster and even painted it will get a canvas (!) behind the canvas canvas and give alternate comments to "action". Several people (teenagers-on-to-fling to gangsters-in-hiding) feed a hungry bed throughout the year; the last menu is the girls' trio? one of whom reminds his old man a long time ago, and as a result, it seems that the bed was afraid of him! Seeing different objects? pieces of chicken fried from cigars? and people who swallow (the bed's stomach is depicted as a fluid of honey color) make the film occasionally amusing (especially when the young man's hands are reduced to the formation of the skeleton, which seems to be quite too big just for his breath!) but also terribly repetitive , so even after a short 77 minutes, the whole useless exercise is tense and desperate.
