OK, so it's horror? I get horror - but I'm not terrible. Monochrome is artistic, but too much black is illuminated ..... enough light. Story - Serum Killer ....... A lot of them around. This has been done in the past and yes, it will continue ..... but I hope not. My question is when can the audience revive this mad dilemma? I think the director thought he was doing something else - killing children. Well this has also been done before. So I think he had to go to the shock value ..... did they kill in the darkest fashion. Okay ..... the audience was shocked ...... sick. And I got out of my seat, I knew all these things. So was the manager successful? Yes! Absolutely! He wanted these things to make me feel and I did. What do you know now? And more importantly, what is the "message" here? With the amazing talent that Francis Xavier was "talented" with ..... Could he ever consider applying it to movies that speak, dare to say, come from darkness? After watching the movie, I left in the dark, my soul was attacked .... what is this craft? There are many such films - they give the bucks I've been talking about. So, what about those people who want to see all these unfortunate visuals? What's going on in this world that people pay to be terribly shocked? Can I see it again ..... never.
