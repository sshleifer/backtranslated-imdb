<br /> <br /> Well, great costumes and a great "feel" for the Pre-II World War in Italy. But what happened here? <br /> <br /> Great actors ... Kristin Scott Thomas, Sean Penn, Anne Bancroft, James Fox, Derek Jacobi ... if you don't get memorable performances from this "A" list, the problem with this movie has to be blamed direction and insufficient script. I rented it on DVD after I liked "Angels & Insects" (1995), which was also directed by Philip Haas. <br /> <br /> Jips! I can't believe how dumb it was. It just pulled on and nobody could save the poor thing. It's not even a good intriguing-alien-dudes-and-young-things-in-real-outfit chick flick! <br /> <br /> Make Mussolini Gone Amuck! <br /> <br />
