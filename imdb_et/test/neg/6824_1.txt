Rourke does his usual part, like the evil, dirty, neanderthal, wild, evil jerk, in the same form as "Picture Claire", "Out in Fifty", "Get Carter", "Double Team" and the rest of the garbage it happens. <br /> <br /> He has very few lines. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is all junk, underestimating Rourke, exhausting him and not being important to characterizing the actor. After seeing "Prayer ...", "Johnny Handsome", "Barfly", "9 1/2 weeks", "Dragon of Year", etc., etc., for years I thought of Rourke's outstanding, intelligent and intelligent men. I think he has changed since then. <br /> <br /> He looks rough, calcined. / Despair lived on his chest / And made a man a perfect pest. "(Belloc," Example "). <br /> <br /> I had no other reason to watch this boring movie except Rourke.
