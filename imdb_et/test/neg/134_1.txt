Fran√ßois Traffaut "Mississippi siren" was a convincing plot. The scenario required too much elasticity to stop the infidelity. The plot went to the ice rate. It started in an interesting environment, but soon the logic or intelligence was missing in the melodrama boats. What were the critics? It is overestimated even as a loser. Even Catherine Deneuvue, who was "Cherbourg's sunshades" and "Belle Doe Jour", just managed to annoy her. <br /> <br /> We rented this movie while we rented another Traffe movie. We looked at it for the first time and found that it was so bad that we sent the other at the same time invisible.
