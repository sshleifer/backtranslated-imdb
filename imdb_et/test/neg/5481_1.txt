It's the hands down of the most annoying and frustrating game I've ever encountered. Every time the game turns, its character is controlled or invisible walls are created that you cannot walk on. The cut scenes leave you under control of your character's movement, but only to a small extent. You also need to play the game for about 2 hours to get to know the intro / tutorials. It's terrible! I'm afraid if I play this game anymore, I'll end up with something. This game sucks. The graphics are good, but nothing special, but the game is terrible. To say that I hate this game would be a huge understatement. I got it for sale, but I want my $ 20 back. What waste!
