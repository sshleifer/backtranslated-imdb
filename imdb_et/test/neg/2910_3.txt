After the post-World War II Japanese attack on US troops in Pearl Harbor: "Eastside Kids": Leo Gorcey (like Muggs), Bobby Jordan (Danny Connors), Huntz Hall (like Glimpy), David Gorcey (Peewee), Ernest Morrison (like Scruno) and Bobby Stone (like Skinny) wants to serve his country. But both the US Army and the Navy refuse them too young. Still, if they want to "hit about a million Japanese", "boys" attack an Asian official who turns out to be Chinese. The unfortunate incident, however, leads to a gang to help detect some really nasty Japanese and German people. <br /> <br /> If "too young" is defined as "less than twenty one", only Mr Jordan and Mr Kivi will be rejected for military service. However, potential recruiters were turned off by the offices provided by Mr Gorcey and Mr Hall. "Let's Get Tough!" was done at a time when the script accurately describes "open season in Japan" - and for other reasons it's not well outdated. This is a wasted effort, but ordinary players play hard when Tom Brown moves the story like a Jordan spy. <br /> <br /> *** Let's get tough! (5/29/42) Wallace Fox ~ Leo Gorcey, Bobby Jordan, Tom Brown
