The Savage Guns (video title) is a gap in cheap, bottom-barrel spaghetti in the west, where the massacre survivor is fueled by bandits who killed his brother and left him dead, reaching them in a city under the control of their curve boss. Despite a lot of violence it can be both dull and colorless with bad testimonies and almost no imagination or humor. <br /> <br /> The leader actor Robert Woods lives under his own name of wood and unhealthy performance that does not generate any heat or compassion. In other words, the viewer is never a real root, despite being a protagonist. <br /> <br /> The worst scene (in my opinion) is the annoying dance hall where the woman sings a heavy and terribly unsexy German accent. It was the worst scene in Blazing bareback and the worst here!
