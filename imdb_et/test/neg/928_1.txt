A terrible, terrible and terrible movie. I saw the original when I was a kid, and it gave me nightmares for my teenagers. When I discovered that the remake was on the way, I fell. WHY WHY WHY TO DO A GOOD FILM? Well, we can thank Dark Castle for beating another classic horror film. This time they have replaced a somewhat interesting story gore, which is slower than the slow pace, and wake up to inspired characters. Someone previously said he was surprised that Paris Hilton can operate. Did you watch the movie? He plays a small tramp. It seems to me that this is a forecast for me. Half of the audience actually died when he died! This will tell you why people see this movie. If this is your only reason, look better because, like a black hole, this thing sucks more than you want. If I were alone, I would have stayed for 10 minutes on a dull exposure. This thing is like a hero's guide to making movies: grown in the southern, foolish, but attractive guides takes a lot, gore plenty, a hidden truck, I could go on. After watching the movie, I started to appreciate Jeepers Creepers and I thought the film was sucking. Save yourself and avoid it at all costs.
