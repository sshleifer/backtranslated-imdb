Terrible, confusing a bit of a mess at the border. I looked at it twice and I don't really know what's going on. It had something to do with a stupid looking Aztec mummy, a "human robot" that is a stupid looking robot I've never seen. Most of the story is said to be painfully slow and droning to an incredibly boring scientist. This guy is a great sleep assistant. His nemesis is greasy, called Batik, which is an unimaginable name for an evil scientist. a woman just HAPPENS is a mummy girlfriend reincarnation. They keep the mummy permanently in the mausoleum for some reason, I think the excess bad man can steal it. It takes five years for it to invent a "human robot" to steal or attack a mummy or whatever. He is after some treasure the Moomin has to be rich. But excuse me, when the boy was with this tremendous intellect and vigorous motive, why didn't he patent some of his ideas and ruin it? Oh, well, I think it would make too much sense. Instead, there is a ridiculous fight between mommy and robot, and it is really hard to say which of them is a faker who can see more or more cheese. The truth is that I looked at it because I thought a movie called Robot Vs. Aztec's mom had to be just fabulous. Instead, it was just terrible and desperate to confuse.
