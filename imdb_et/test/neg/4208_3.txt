This is not one of the high quality films. It's actually the first Chuck Norris movie I've ever seen, and I got a really subtle feeling. Fighting scenes are slow and do not have much variety. Norris simply uses many round households of all the bad guys coming after him, making the fighting quite boring. The film is also quite short, but for some reason it does not seem ready when the movie ends. This is a pretty anti-climate end. However, I've been watching a lot of bad movies and it's not one of the worst I've seen. Worth checking out, I think especially for Norris fans. There is also no way to see a group of rackets hanging from the desert, which I thought was the highlight of the film.
