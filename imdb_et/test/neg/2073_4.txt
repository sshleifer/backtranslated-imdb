Unknown, weak script ... worst Spanish movie in years ... I was <br /> <br /> attracted by Paz Vega's (naked) beauty, but as an actor <br /> <br /> useless, you almost can't understand what he says ... <br /> <br /> There is not much to say about the story ... we heard about it <br /> <br /> before, but if it's "modern Carmen", we'll find some Changes: - The French soldier is now a Basque soldier. - The seaman himself is a story character. -Carmen is a dangerous "bandolera" that is loved by the famous <br /> <br /> "matador" and he can speak fluently in Basque ... <br /> <br /> Can anyone understand this confusion?
