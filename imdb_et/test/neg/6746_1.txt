I still try to find out what the target of this film was: 1) to show how stupid, inaccurate, unprofessional and arrogant the police are (I can definitely add different adjectives, but I think this point is clear). 2) Show how twisted contemplation that does not know what it wants can be created in chaos. 3) Show if a permanent detective resolves the case just when it asks the offender the same foolish question over and over until the criminals have the answers? 4) Or was it just to show that 90 minutes of filmed material can still be called MOVIE? <br /> <br /> It was one of those films that was not disappointed in any way. From the first 10 minutes I thought this film wasn't the best film award and surprisingly enough? it was always consistent. Was it foolish to wait to see how stupidly it will continue and end? and I wasn't disappointed there either. <br /> <br /> Was it a full waist? YES. What raises your question? WHY I looked through it? Well, I tried to fall asleep and I thought it was a great candidate for that, but unfortunately I had too much coffee before that?
