This film is probably the worst film. This is definitely the worst I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies. <br /> <br /> There's nothing interesting about this in the movie. You can literally start a movie, take a short nap and then wake up safely knowing that nothing has happened during sleep. And I've seen this movie three times, awake all the time. I feel I should be congratulated. <br /> <br /> The movie goes according to a formula that can be expected without any variation. Hunters grab the baby's bigfoot, get the parents' death, and the nearby city is killing big feet. It's surprisingly boring for Troma release. <br /> <br /> So please do yourself a favor and skip this movie. If you have to see it, you understand why.
