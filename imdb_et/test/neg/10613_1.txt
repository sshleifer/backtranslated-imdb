Young writers, young authors, young people cast, manufacturers' burden that could go wrong? Everything. Even the flat is a too good description, suggesting that four out of four feet worked, in fact, none of them. Barely enough recycled plotline for 48 and a half-minute television hours, stretching over 90 minutes. The audience spoke back to the screen, so the story was bad. Dirty policemen steal drugs in the locker. How many thousands of times has this been done on television? Poor police framing good police. Many times? There was no breaking of the original during this entire excerpt. Giovanni Ribisi bravely worked to support the absence of the script, drawing the only laugh of the film. And the idea of ​​me and Claire Danes, who are working with a real manuscript with an adult director and photographed by the actual operator, intrigues me. Note for Scriptwriters: Buy one of these story generators. It may not be as bad as a bad TV. Note to the author: Images are also available for close-up shots. Even Claire Danes' beautiful and interesting face grows tiring in the near future. Note to the operator: Learn for a professional for a few years - you have a lot to learn. Note for Laboratory Timer Coloring: At least try to convince the author and the operator that they don't know what they're talking about. Note to Claire: I hope it will be paid for your new apartment. It's time to get professional leadership and start reading scripts before signing up.
