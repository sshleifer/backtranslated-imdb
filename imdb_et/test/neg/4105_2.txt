This movie was very bad, simple and simple. How such a movie is widely released is a miracle to me. <br /> <br /> It's a good idea, but it just didn't change. Edward Burns is a decent actor. I liked his little role in private Ryan. <br /> <br /> Let's start with a bigger problem here. <br /> <br /> The visuals were so incredibly bad, I thought I'd look old. Dinosaurs in 3D "CDROM point-and-click adventure demo on Windows 3.1. I mean I have seen scenes from the 2000 console games that have better dinosaurs than that. I mean, hell ... the original Tomb Raider T-Rex seemed better than this. <br /> <br /> Lizard monkeys were ridiculous. I thought they were some kind of ripoff from "Killer Instinct." I see better sock puppet monitors when I mean. br /> <br /> You know that there are a lot of better movies on TV.How can a pearl like Scifi channels "The Shining" get such a small audience, but this "CGI, easy to make 4 Kidz" load opens open? is it the story of Ray Bradbury
