What a movie atomic bomb. The story goes somewhere and is not coming anywhere. It leaves the theatrical visitor with his hand, saying, "Is that it?" What happened to Redford. He was once a fair actor. Now she thinks she can show up and do a couple of scenes and that is the key. Wrong. What is an inexperienced film? I don't want to be so cruel, but a crap. Unbelievable amateur crap. If I were in this movie, I wouldn't see my face. I'm telling you what, if I associate this movie, I'm in big trouble. This movie goes down in movie magazines as the King of Bombs, with whom everyone else is compared.
