(spoiler) it could be one of the worst movies you see, you might like it as i did it. One of these odds. <br /> <br /> There is a man who saw a day in life. Black rats, how he regrets (what I thought was a good idea). The killer rats become friends with two big men who feel unwanted so that the man puts them on the killer rat and both large black rats on the floor are covered with blood not so much blood. <br /> <br /> but think of big black rats all over your body), but start a little killing with humans, but the rats will move forever until the rats kill their Friends and girlfriends, <br /> <br /> One sitting in the toilet, while the rats go into the tubing leading to the toilet and the rat rises, you know and come out of your mouth (which means the rats have to eat everything inside the body) I had a laugh for weeks <br /> <br /> why I liked this movie, yes, it is different from the rest, I like ONE how a little creature takes on humanity. <br /> <br /> If you have seen any of these movie strips, sliding, these, spiders, snakes, trembling, cujo, crocodile, shark, octopus. <br /> <br /> Hood rats, <br /> <br /> better than Terror toons, which I can all say! 4/10
