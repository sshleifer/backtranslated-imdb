It may not be the worst movie ever to win the best picture, but it is there. Well on the second I thought it was probably the worst film ever to win the best picture. While you think it would be worth the movie. This is actually questionable. The film has almost no depth and is just "fun" after "fun" if you want to name it. At first it was very interesting, but it seems that everything is exaggerated on so many levels. <br /> <br /> The show was not remarkable, but it was quite interesting to see Charlton Heston in his first lead. I found a lot of signs, like a movie tone that was annoying after some time. What I like a lot was James Stewart as a philosophical clown. He saved me the movie so he gave him the much needed extra layer. Unfortunately, although after Stewart there wasn't much else. I found the movie at times and the use of Betty Hutton was a mistake. The appearance of the film was very good at times, but it did not create the magical feeling that classics were needed. Writing was really good, considering how much the movie was. There is no depth, no valid attempt to extract emotions from the audience and just the artistic value of the film. Then of course a lot of holes in the whole plot. This film was constantly annoying and frustrating. Even with this movie, I had the idea that much of what I was looking at was not just the impression of a circus life, but the opposite of how it really is. Why this best picture is outside of me, but it doesn't like the first or last time Oscar has done and lost.
