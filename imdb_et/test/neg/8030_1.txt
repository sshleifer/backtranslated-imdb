This is one movie I almost went out of and it would be if my friends were not in the cinema with me. Usually, even if I don't like the film, I think it's still worth it to go through. So you can really claim that you have given him every chance to redeem himself. But with the Million Dollar Hotel, it was so terrible that I just wanted the experience to end as soon as possible. I guess I wouldn't have been so frustrated if this film was made less for a director I usually didn't like. But from Wenders, it was even more shocking. I know Bono, U2, a good friend of Wenders, wrote the script for this abysmal movie, and I don't know why Wenders promised him, like a friend-friend, as the two have been. "Stay with the day project, Bono" is a sentence that is easy to remember when you look at it. Pretentious, disjointed, mish-mash of every possible contemporary movie stereotype, naive and transparent attempt to come over kooky and bold, with the most irritating characters I've ever seen, especially leaders, Jeremy Davies, Milla Jovovich and Mel Gibson, none of whom usually dislike. The happiest end I could have wished would have been for a nuclear bomb to be dropped into their collective heads to get it as soon as possible. In the case of a positive note, the first five minutes of the film are extremely good, especially the very obscure soundtrack of U2. But the shots of the film make the rest of the movie (which has since been a wonderful nose-dive) even more frustrating because they are promises of cinematographic quality that has never been delivered, not even close.
