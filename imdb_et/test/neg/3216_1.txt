Shortly before, I stumbled upon the DVD while browsing Netflix and with this impressive pain I decided to go for it. <br /> <br /> Never before has the movie tried to be a new version of the existing big movie (Scarface) and so spectacular. <br /> <br /> The main problem seems to be a complete misunderstanding of what the story should be. In Scarface, Tony Montana himself was a "bad man". His remarkable rise and possible fall was not sad, it was a great (and only logical ending) for someone who lived such a life. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa, director, writer and leading actor, sees Kilot as a hero or at least a sophisticated man. However, he does not want to make the grunt work to create a realistic, compassionate character. White mother brought her out, except for her six months of childhood, when her father, the gangster himself, showed her his life. For reasons that have never been fully explained or even actually mentioned, he decides he wants to be a drug dealer and actually goes to the bad part of the city, approaches two dealers and says, "Hey, I would like to buy some drugs." He falls to his father's name, and apparently they have not only time for the rich, but the two men who supply him, act for him for a reason, again, never to explain. <br /> <br /> Chapa wants you to feel bad when her character is imprisoned when the police informant is in her. But since he has used large quantities of drugs before taking drugs, why should he give him sympathy? The most obvious case when Chapa wants to be a good man is in his prison, where a White Supremacist / rapist was played, played by Gary Busey. In Scarface, Tony Montana kills someone in prison because he has a lot to raise, it's done, he's moving on. But in this case, they must make Busey not only rape / pedophile, but also white domination. A little over, don't you think? I'm not going to go into more detail about this, but their desperate message "PLEASE LIKE ME! I'M A COMPLICED GANGSTER!" fails on every level. Try as they would, I didn't feel bad, contradictory or sympathetic when his mates were killed (after a shootout), and his wife was killed (shortly after he called him because he was in the evil father and during the escape attempt when he decided it would be good to drive directly to a car full of armed men when his wife is in the car) and his final death. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that his action can be quite concise as one weak, his only achievement that brings the term "wood" to new heights. Busey should be credited for actually making his ridiculous role. Tiny Lister did well. Stacy Keach plays Prison Break in his jail. Robert Wagner travels for a fee. Faye Dunaway, while in a dramatic touch, is still getting better than this movie deserves. Brad Dourif is in the movie for about two minutes and does what he can. And to give the film credit, he makes one-way Scarface one way - Jennifer Tilly now holds the title "The most ridiculous experiment with a Spanish accent". (Sorry Robert Loggia.) In short, this film was an interesting assumption, but a bad story, atypical characters and post-impact performances. I would recommend Mr. Chapa next time to ease forced compassion - really, we don't have to like our character, but we just have to be interested. The next time you are lucky.
