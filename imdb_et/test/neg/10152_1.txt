I'm not even going to comment on what trash this movie has already been created for. But looking at it with friends, we all laughed out loud as the leader girl made a Shelley Hack reference during the phone. We were sitting there trying to find out why the writer would throw him into the mix. We can only assume that he had fixed the Charlie angels at once. Based on this reference, we assumed that this film had to be made around his Charli's angels in 1979 or 1980, but what I read here was made around 1987. It seems as if a college student did it for a film class. And although I should not, in any case, expect that this low-budget waste bin would be politically correct, the circumcision of this movie certainly liked to divert the deviant gay notes. Nonetheless, I would only be the one that has ever been made for the 2nd worst horror film, secondly, only "Nail Gun Massacre".
