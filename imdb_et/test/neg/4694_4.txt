1. Watched 12/26/2008 - (Dir-Eugene Levy): The mystery of the Corny comedy murder with very little laughter. The film seems to be based on credits from an earlier Italian film, but it was written by two rather popular American romantic comedy writers. But Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyer do not reduce it compared to other efforts. The story speaks of a couple of down-and-out Americans playing with Richard Lewis and Sean Young, who stumble upon a lost dog and hope that after earning an advertisement for Dachsund's return, they will earn money for a success. When he tries to do this, they see a woman's hand in the garage door, which they believe is related to the rest of the woman's body, who should give them money. They speak out and do not contact the police and tell them the truth that they do like runaways from a scene that they expect to be killed for murder. The other characters in the movie are filled on the train before and hang around the Monte Carlo gambling center, doing different things that need to be drawn. Other cast members are character actors John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. After the police know about the death, they start interviewing the main characters and, of course, they have to work with their funny lies to find out what really happened. None of the characters mentioned above can bring this movie out of their mediocre state, despite some funny moments most often offered by the Belush / Shepherd couple. It's not a terrible movie, it's not that good. There are many average movies and this is just one pile. Try it, maybe you like it, probably you don't.
