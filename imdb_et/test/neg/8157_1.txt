Although I am a fan of Heather Thomas and I have some of his old bikini posters here somewhere, I can honestly say that if the only movie I ever saw was "cyclone", I could never guess why he had done it that way much more than he does for the show. <br /> <br /> Director Fred Olen Ray (about as good an apple as we could see at the ear in the desert), the story of a woman (Thomas) who has to protect a high-tech motorcycle from unscrupulous types is about the same as "B" when he gets (or Fred My, "B minus"). <br /> <br /> The cast itself should tell you something. It's not every movie that connects Thomas with actors Beswick, Hall, Combs, Donahue, Tamblyn and Landau caliber (!!). If you're lucky, there are very few movies. And while they seem to be fun, shouldn't some of this fun be passed on to the audience? I vote yes, they do not seem to have voted. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you want Heather to get to the other woman's upper edge, use the F-word and stick the battery to the cables. you probably looked for it. I am happy with the repetitions of the old "Fall Guy". <br /> <br /> One star in the hope that if another "cyclone" hits the city, Heather will shelter. I know I do.
