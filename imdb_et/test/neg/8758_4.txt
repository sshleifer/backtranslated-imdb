Oh, horror! I've seen many movies in the days, but it makes me laugh rather than reluctant. This is definitely a crazy movie and it can be a very low budget, but if you can look at cheap sound, terrible dialogue, ugly girls, obviously fake gore scenes and the general nervousness of the movie, you might find that some of this movie is a little fun. The story speaks of a killer killer who is going to kill every "fifth day, fifth day, fifth year" (wow, how the original), and it's up to two detectives (one of whom bravely made an effort) trying to make a dirty dialogue good) to stop the killer Bloody Rampage. Slaughter scenes (made with a plastic toy) are pretty brutal (which is a good thing), but very annoying because of the constant repetition of apparently saved screaming (which is a very ear piercing). As for Gore, there is a lot of it, but it seems very fake; especially blood - dude, c'mon, purple blood? But if you're a fan of gore videos like me, you'll find something I would like about this video, like I did (crap-speaking detective ... he's the best thing for this movie). In addition, all you find is a lot of nonsense nudity (which is also a good thing, but too bad girls are OOOGLY) and a very idiotic hippy necrophilia serum killer. Sorry, but it sucks.
