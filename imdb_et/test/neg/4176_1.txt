This movie was terrible ... It had nothing to do with Dark Harvest. And the DVD was very misleading, as it showed a scarecrow and a bug, neither of which appeared in this movie. <br /> <br /> The start was a mix of random scenes, most of which had nothing to do with the movie, except that they show the man is psychic ... but not too good ... <br /> <br /> After the first 10 minutes of the movie, the hour is only a person. her daughters. It becomes vague when the daughters meet a dead girl after two years. But this is its scope. <br /> <br /> And why, could I ask if this movie was rated R? There were two drops of blood and 4 curse words. And how was it on the video store on earth? This film was badly done, poorly filmed, poorly written, and generally terribly executed.
