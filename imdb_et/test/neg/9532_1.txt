This is one of those movie films that would like to tell you about women, the universe, the better life, the terrible loneliness of Manhattan's great architect who links all ties with all people, including his three-year-old child, who may seem irresponsible to some - Actually, the hero wins hands when it comes to selfishness and scene with the palm of his old school, which begins with some good old conversations and an intimidating remark to the end, is the oasis of the oath movie. <br /> <br /> A scene where the on-father-left-left-home-as-I-was-child was said and said and TOLD. Of course, this did not prevent the offspring from doing their own way and when you see the hero's wife's attitude, You may think he should never hear the woman's slipper. <br /> <br /> The best is a soundtrack that contains great songs by Willie Nelson, Tom Waits or Bonnie Raitt ... But you can enjoy them without this annoying pretense.
