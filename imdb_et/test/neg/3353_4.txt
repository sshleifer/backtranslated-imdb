Threadbare Horror Outing has an innocent teenager (Meg Tilly, tempting as always) who is trying to become a popular click in school (despite being hated directly by him) and self-imposed on his corporate initiative: Spending the Night's Spooky Mausoleum. Despite the complete lack of originality, this small budget thriller is able to find some decent special effects and has a number of good performances (especially Robin Evans, the crookedness of the girls). The script is not sharp, but it has enough questions to make the procedure somewhat acceptable. ** from ****
