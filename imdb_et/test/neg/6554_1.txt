<br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly strange because it makes every person cry, the clich√© is put on thicker than 5-year-old peanut butter, and so it actually sucks humor in its heart, every joke was badly timed and not funny, if it was timed correctly. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie, there is a real chance that you can never go back to comedies ... ever.
