Emran Hashmi posted good roles in MURDER Bhat's films, but another director just used his kiss and naughty picture. <br /> <br /> AKSAR is one of them and it came after AAA, JAWANI DIWANI and I was already hidden from him and such roles <br /> <br /> The movie has a nice twist in the beginning that felt like Abbas Mustan's movie , but then it becomes a routine movie with unexpected love, unexpected jealousy and bad climax <br /> <br /> Anant Mahadevan makes a terrible movie Music saves grace Camera work is amazing <br /> <br /> from his earlier films, and has 2 expressions throughout Dino. he says he was practicing Hindi and well in some scenes. Udita is inexpressible and irritating
