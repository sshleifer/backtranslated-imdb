Before the airport 79, these films were pretty good. They had good special effects, all the stars and good actors. This movie destroyed the franchise and there are many reasons for it. Lets talk about special effects WOW !! they are terrible what the director thought. I know this is only in 1979, but lets you watch other very special special effects like Star Wars (1977) and Moonraker (1979). I like the idea of ​​Concord and it could have been the best movie for the airport, but they did it too much. How would Joe Patron (George Kennedey) shoot out of the cockpit window to prevent a rocket looking for heat from being hit. It also makes 90 degrees of dives and loops. It totally far drawn and unrealistic WOW !!!!!! Believe me that special effects don't help this scene and are really farther than the poor .... They look almost like a cartoon, and that's how the whole movie is !!! Finally, we can talk about action that I find extremely bad to be fair at best. Over acting is a big problem with this movie, especially George Kennedy. What I really like as an actor, but I just don't cut that movie. The director, who did a very bad editing action and indeed attacked the airport on the franchise, must be guilty of full guilt. Too bad that Concord is not used today, it was a miracle of air tickets ...
