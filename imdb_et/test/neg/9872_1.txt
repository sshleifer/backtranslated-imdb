Of course, if the opportunity to see this terribly infamous film legend, my expectations were quite low. They were not small enough. Scholckmaster Roger Corman has in some way acquired ownership of the Marvel comic book characters in the late 80s or early 90s and released it to Oley Sassone, whose performance has largely been in the campy television series, such as Hercules and Viper. Assuming that the total budget is $ 1.5 million, it was produced, shot and briefly published and then sent to the wasteland. There should have been. But like the "banana peel" in the vaudeville work, this "fantastic four" is sitting in the air, waiting for the rare and stupid people to practice it. <br /> <br /> Once you've heard these comic books, you know what to expect. The people who did this were very true to the source material and that is the only thing they deserve for any credit in this fiasco. It is a heroic group that develops supernatural abilities when shielding their experimental spacecraft does not protect them from cosmic radiation. Reed Richards (Alex Hyde-White) develops the ability to stretch his body and becomes "Mr. Fantastic. His girlfriend, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab) can become invisible, and his brother Johnny (Jay Underwood) can spontaneously cause fire on his body. Grimm ("credited" to both Michael Bailey-Smith and Carl Ciafarlio) supernatural power when his skin mutates into a rocky hype and is called "Thing." There is a prologue that creates the former Reed's classmate Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp) to become their enemy, Dr. Doom, who organizes the Fantastic Four Space Flight for sabotage as a revenge for the injuries he accuses in Reed, there is a structure, a power discovery, a horrible revelation and, ultimately, a climate struggle. they are insignificant. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is made just because of the creators (I use that word in a technical sense. t here is a lot of creative imagination at work). The plot is undoubtedly reflected in the expected large budget release led by Tim Story in 2005, but treating a massive special effects project with a similar budget or qualified players qualifies as cinematic madness. What special effects are there are mostly hand-drawn or simple camera countries that have existed since the day of the original 'Great Train Wrestling'. If half of the anti-climatic struggles go back to full-length animation, you are almost free to look at the comic instead of the poor players who were fucking in the project. There is very little style in this confusion. Most scenes are available in either light or wild basic colors and the only dressed sets are obvious sci-fi pieces. There's camera work, but it's usually just keeping the symbols on the screen and minimal information. Editing involves leaving extra loops and using obvious sweeping tools (even at one point, there is even a transition via the 4th center). Editing twists are even used to supplement bad special effects when Thing changes. One scene using morping technology was shocking only because it was such a positive leap of quality. <br /> <br /> Restricted camera work is not unforgivable. Clerks only uses the most basic camera movements and the style is almost non-existent. It worked for this film because it was about people whose life was not style and that was consistent. Kevin Smith will never let his grip over. The "Blair Sorcerer's Project" caused some audiences a movement disorder of nervous hand-held material that put this pseudo-document together. When all was said and done, it was an effective act of disappearance and terrifying terror consumed. There is no story or topic at the oral or visual level. With this "fantastic four" you can never laugh more than a casual laugh that filmmakers and performers actually seem to be trying to compete with other comic book movies with this poorly budgeted entry. Each film involves a lot of time and work. It is so sad that so many both were cast into such projects. If you were one of those people who were doing it, it was probably a step-by-step (hopefully improved) film career. Everyone knows about taking up jobs to take advantage of what seems to be an opportunity. For those who want to watch this movie, my suggestion is to do it with a group of friends (so you can announce it all and say "you followed it") who has been informed about the experience (so nobody gets into shock), and maybe you can Come to relieve the pain between the random laugh of the drinking game. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
