The worst movie ever made is none. If you can sit in every painful minute of pain, give yourself a backdrop. Except for a little where a lucky loser turned to a forced psychopath for a failed medical experiment, his pea soup is poured onto the head of a doctor and laughs like all good looting lunatics should be ... all.
