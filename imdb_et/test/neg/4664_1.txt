Two films: "Fifth Element", "Armageddon". Same topic: saving the world. Same main actor: Bruce Willis. One difference: "Armageddon" is much worse than Luc Besson's film. Some remarkable special effects cannot be hidden in a hidden and globally customary scenario. Several parts of the movie show it. I mean the president's speech and especially Willis's relationship with daughter Grace. At the beginning of the film, he tends to neglect and protect him and makes him tired. Then, at the end of the film, it is the true love and understanding that appears in him. On the other hand, the film falls into the following trap: Michael Bay takes his subject too seriously. Of course, the film is trying to be funny, but the result is not working, because the humor used in the film is often crude and quite low, while in the "fifth element" humor was crazy, involuntary and allowed to forget the serious side. The film still suffers from two disabilities: it often gets ridiculous (Russian astronauts) and almost all participants are bad. Bruce Willis contradicts his "fifth element" character. He's playing him, he's banging and sometimes he's intolerable. Other participants are hardly reliable in their roles, especially in the Willis drowning team. It seems that this team is just for fun. One of them is very skilled but looks like a fool. And Poor Liv Tyler! He's just decorative in NASA. <br /> <br /> When the film was released in August 1998 in France, Bruce Willis expressed the fatigue of world fatigue. His fatigue was probably justified by this remarkable but poor film.
