It's made for a film about every clich√© you can play on a disaster movie. The only problem is that it is not very well done. <br /> <br /> My brain is still offended by scenes where Brian Dennehy is probably looking at a computer monitor looking for weather pattern data and showing on this monitor weather scenes from weather conditions in the Weather Channels Ads. Why should we look at global weather patterns to look at local news on outward street? You also have me. <br /> <br /> In the first two hours, some of the worst CGI effects are known to humans. Watch the semi-trailer and the airplane that looks like Commodore 64. It's all sledgehammer made in the foreground of this "movie", the dialogue is forced and I can't think of the pleasant character I want to survive on the other side. <br /> <br /> The hateful woman who cheated hates the most. Perhaps if he lifted his finger at the exhibition at any time instead of being a helpless woman standing in the entire 10-storey kitchen throughout the day, his wife would not sleep with a PR representative in a competing power company. He's so helpless, I really want to take him out of his and his misery. I hope that everything in this "movie" will die in the second half.
