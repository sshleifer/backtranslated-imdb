Some friends and I have a strange hobby to search for really scary and completely unclear (for good reason) horror and then looking at them in the minds of like-minded consumer products like alcohol and / or soft drugs. Of course, many people do it, but they watch movies like "Godzilla" remake, while we torture our eyes and brains like "Loch Ness Horror". And eureka, this is a bad movie prototype! We traditionally open up bags of pipe opening music during credit. Of course, this is to emphasize that we have uncomfortable viewers that this story should take place at the top of Scotland, not the birthplace of director Larry Buchanan in Texas. For the same reason, cast members have also been told that they have the vision to surprise tremendously and speak with brutal accents. American Marine Biologist Prof. George Sanderson arrives at Loch Ness with a new and very sophisticated sonar device to track the location of the legendary monster by the lake. In the meantime, there are many other parties around the lake, such as a group of children in a research camp (a boring way to spend their holidays), retirees looking for a Luftwaffe plane that fell into the lake during World War II and a bunch of thieves and unsuccessful scientists who sharpen a monster egg. You think these numerous subcategories bring some diversity and excitement to the plot, but unfortunately this is not the case. "Loch Ness Horror" is a general boring flick with only a few remarkable elements. For example, the monster itself is a delightful chewing creature with cute eyes and smoky breath. His teeth are also glowing in the dark, which is quite useful if you are stupid enough to go by boat in the middle of the night. Near the end of the movie, the other cast members were more interested in the lost Luftwaffe plane than the monster, so it was time to pack it up. "Loch Ness Horror" is carefully recommended if you are a fan of bad B-films of the 80s, but you need to be informed that it includes an unnecessary overload of conversations and an unusually fast end that suddenly turns your movie off the budget.
