Toxic Avenger, Part II, begins with a surprising revelation that after Toxic Aveneger (John Altamura, who was apparently produced during production and replaced by Ron Fazio) was released from his home town of Tromaville. This meant that Toxie was no longer a superhero, and now depression and feeling completely useless (as leaders Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz feel after being produced) are now working in the Tromaville center as a doorman for the blind. It is not a long time before it grows, it is a ugly head, but an evil chemistry company called Apocalypse Inc. intends to take Tromaville for some stupid reason or other, but to do it to free them From Toxie. After the first plan of Rick Collins failed, bribe was given by Toxie psychiatrist (Erika Schickel) to visit Japan and see her Father. Leaving her girlfriend Claire (Phoebe Legere), her mother (Jessica Dublin) and her home behind Toxie's heads in Tokyo, Japan. If there's a Toxie about finding his father and the woman Masami (Mayako Katsuragi) helps her in her quest. Meanwhile, back to Tromaville Apocalypse Inc. move to kill and without Toxie citizens are unable to defend themselves. Finally, Toxie finds that Big Mac Bunko (Rikiya Yasuoka) whom he has believed is his Father, but Big Mac is all part of Apocalypse Inc., who is going to destroy Toxie once and for all ... <br /> < The successful The Toxic Avenger (1985) produced and staged by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz proves that the first film was a complete fluke, a happy accident that combines the right mix of bad taste with comedy, outrageous violence and so bad making movies, The Toxic Avenger, Part II is a load of crap compared to. The Kaufman, Phil Rivio & Gay Partington Terry Script's "Additional Material" credit load does not contain any funny moments during the 102 (uncut director cut) duration. Visual gags are terrible, for example, walking in Tokyo with a wig and glasses to mix, for example, or a scene where he warms the bath with a bad boy and as he cooks Toxie throws vegetables and spaghetti into the load. The scene where she sticks to the shape of a woman's nose, sticks her head with an antenna and mouth microphone, which is spoken by a Japanese radio transmitter, where a bad Japanese boy has burned a fish shape, where Toxie grabs a swordfish head and uses it as a weapon, or an embarrassingly idle and foolish idiot facial expressions, a man who has a literary fish head and becomes a literary sushi, a terrible comedy of music and sound effects and the whole film is generally pale imitation of what made the original lightly amusing and memorable. The bad taste of the gags does not exist at this time and the first stupid childish minor humor is also missing, it just seems like a real step back to the original and should not be forgotten that it is Troma here, so it's definitely a bad thing. Few fears and some serious times and violence, at least in the allegedly 102-minute version, saw crushed heads with blood-drawn bodies, crushed face, intestines, roses that were exhausted in the eyes and throats around the throat. , ripped ears, broken arms, and a very graphic and passionate person who is cut. Unfortunately, the special effects of Lewnes in Pericles are not particularly convincing and usually come in the first twenty minutes. Action is embarrassing, as I have already mentioned. Reasonable action is an ultra-cheap search for a car search and a couple of unmistakable, harsh struggles that use cardboard ninja to throw letters at one point. Horror wise is not a couple of gory set pieces apart. The comedy reasonable it is very inconvenient. In fact, the Toxic Avenger, Part II sucks at all levels really and from top to bottom all that is intimidatingly done, most of the cast people seem to be the people closest to the corner of the street, there is no consistency, cinematography is the focal point and shoot and special effects are nothing but. One or two gory scenes apart from this is a complete nonsense plain & easy, make yourself a favor watch original again instead.
