WEBS is a rather strange film, though a little traceable. Richard Grieco plays an electrician who sucks in the parallel crossing of the Earth by mutant spiders or something like that. The film was made with a modest budget that explains a limited local spot and a somewhat tedious scenario that can make very little of an interesting assumption. Basically, the 90-minute TV show "Sliders" is an episode and something else. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed overview) and reviews of other genres
