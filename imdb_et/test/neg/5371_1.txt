This show is completely ridiculous. Yes, of course, its fake. But it is embarrassing to look. I personally know more about a creative film that influenced the thoughts that could do it. The young lead man couldn't be more convincing. He talks about everything he says. Do we really think he knows what he's talking about? There are many ways to show it to Blair-Witch. Fear does not develop from what seems "cool" and computer generated. Nor does it create vocabulary lines like "What was it? Did you hear it?" There are also really convincing psychologies that are not just "Want to be on screen". Another DUH-Factor is ... how these manufacturers think we actually buy, that paranormal activity just happens magically within two possible 3 days (if we're happy) that they're filming. I do not belive. 2+ weeks a week in one place would be more convincing. There is also disarmament that they think "NASA's radar controls" and computers that proudly show bs are making us scared. AND IE: Exorcism should not be staged like the movie "Exorcist". When will they get this right? Having a devil or other evil spirits affects people differently. They do not speak and cast their voice like Linda Blair or fallen as Courtney Love on drug use. As said, "psychological ability" would help to show better concentrations. We want to see and hear everything that is supposed to flash in front of them. Don't cut the other story bs. Final Note - Shooting Stars Do Not Interest When You Display UFO Counterfeit Images Prematurely. Maybe I would like to emphasize once again that the young dark haired man who organizes this exhibition is terribly terrible. Avoid this example. For fear: look at the old unresolved Mystery episodes ... not new (entertainment got it oh-so wrong). But that's for another blog.
