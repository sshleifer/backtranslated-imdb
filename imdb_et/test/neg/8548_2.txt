YOU GET MY (1941) Example of "ScrewBall Comedy", which began in the mid-1930s and ended in the postwar World War. Some of these films retained their status. Others have earned great praise when they were originally critical and inbox floppies. Like BABY (1938) or MR. & PROUA. SMITH (1941). Then it is that which just values ​​sinking. <br /> <br /> Why the scenario / story can take root. It tightens confidence when it goes on, betraying the superior cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to millionaire HENRY FONDA, who is very jealous. He would be happy to sit with his million dollar and love him, he wants to keep his invitation as a doctor. He wants him to become a useful member of his society. This conflict should entertain us. It cannot be saved either by the principal or by the backlight. The character of HENRY FONDA has been written with such a wide hit that every viewer does not recognize him immediately. BARBARA STANWYCK has nothing to do, but to respond to any idiotic situation. TRUMBO had to spend a lot of time outside the studio, which is a "useful idiot" which is then in the workplace. COLUMBIA obviously didn't get the value of his money, maybe ROBERT RISKIN had to take over.
