Another film that punishes us for the crime of enjoying "Pulp Fiction". <br /> <br /> If you like to see people killed by a machine gun for an hour and a half, this will fit the bill. The "Aeon Flux" debut episode fans, where the title character literally has thousands of seemingly false soldiers, really goes to it. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's not a smart movie. In fact, it is all an excuse for a bunch of young people to act rude and shoot people. Sometimes the whole scene and the only thing that happens is that you guessed it! anyone can shoot. Or, to get things done, twenty people get down. First, they just sit there, the next minute they sit there dead. Yahoo! <br /> <br /> Harsh plot: Young American goes to Paris (Paris America, get it?), hires a prostitute (essential Julie Delpy), contacts some old French friends, one is AIDS, they plan and try bank employees. Of course, the film convention says that movie clips will not shut down, and this engagement will take about three-quarters of working time (this is like "Dog Day Afternoon" without Sidney Lumet's clergy, patience or humanity)). Things are wrong with the bank (surprise!) And Paris with AIDS goes several times with its Uzi. There are no spoilers here, but it is enough to say that you are so emotionally away from these signs that you probably don't care about who lives and who dies at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Some have called it stylish. Maybe it is, but it's someone else's style, it's a movie that's already done, and "Killing Zoe" is trapped in the convention. The film's director (Roger Avary, "Oscar's" Pulp Fiction co-founder "") does not make anything truly original, stylish, functional or annoying in the film. If you don't think any movie in the bank has had such a large body number, there is nothing else to separate it from any people.
