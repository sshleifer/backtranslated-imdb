From time to time I ran a movie that is so embarrassingly bad that I don't know why movies are there. This is one of them. This is a terrible attempt to parody. Eddie Deezen is just annoying when Tony, the annoying twit, takes his father apart from Don (William Hickey )'s application for a family business. Tony, as I said, is a tedious bit of twit. It makes the whole movie complete. The film is terrible. It's too cartoon. The main point I try to make is that you don't get a parody of a recognized drama, such as the Godfather, so much comic book. It doesn't work that way. Believe it or not, you must seriously look at the dramatic parody of the movie. If you don't take it seriously, it looks like a parody. The thing about making a parody is that you can't feel too much as you do the parody. You have to feel that you are taking the film at least a little seriously. It also seems that they just mock Woody Allen and this makes this movie very terrible.
