The increase in tax incentives and leaseback schemes has resulted in a number of unusable films that collect dust in laboratories and vaults across the British Isles, as they appear to have been made solely because they fit rather than financial criteria. potential audience. Some lucky ones get a weekly DVD in London on a small screen, but The Riddle completely detached itself from the TV or even the rental market for the first time on a free DVD on Sunday. > <br /> It's too easy to understand why it was finally given away. In addition to a couple of bugs (the boom game is clearly visible at one end), this is not particularly badly done, and although Vinnie Jones comes over as a modern British cinema version of Freddie Mills Mills, who wants to board a crowd and a supportive alloy from vodka vaguely permeable, no one distinguishes here here, being exceptionally good or exceptionally bad: mediocrity is the most common norm here. The real problem is that, as with so many sales and leaseback fund films, it's a "soft" movie - there's no reason to watch it. This is because the circumstances existed, but it lacks momentum or progress. The goal seems to be to order the audience on Sunday's announcement (despite being beaten), but don't cut it. This pointlessly unreasonable story, unpublished from Charles Dickens' manuscript and a couple of suspicious deaths in today's Limehouse, has a couple of oceanic ideas, but the mystery element is so painfully obvious - as well as the last minute supernatural twist (you) I never think who Jacobi's illiterate tramp actually is. What did you think?) - that you've almost waited for Scooby Gang or Double Deckers to fix it. <br /> <br /> This is a very wrong movie for all kinds of reasons: some cast members play double roles when they shouldn't even play, and the whole shock that shows the truth of Dickens manuscript is completely stuck because it's all the first person Dickens rather told about the supposed nature of the novel. The main murder of the movie has been integrated into the main plot, where characters are suddenly reminded of Vinnie that he has already forgotten it, listening to the desperate last half hour, which sees Jason Flemyng's secretary putting some Rohypnol into Vinnie's drink. is her evil way with her and leave the accusing photographs behind, "so that you can look at her girlfriend," bringing her to a dream where she speaks to Charles Dickens ("You're Charles Dickings" "What's in the name?"), who offers somewhat less likely suggestion that "You read too many books." But everything that is unusual is completely absurd, logic and common sense that goes out of the window completely, as it plays like some odd Jacobean revenge tragedy with weapons on the banks of the Thames. Flemyng and Vanessa Redgrave look like they would be somewhere else (Mel Smith rises to a one-day home so it's obvious that the movie's "names" are usually easily $ 10k or paid for alimony). The final picture of the movie is so absolutely absurd and pointless that it is almost worth watching. <br /> <br /> One curiosity is a very prominent role in the first third of the Vera Day, a kind of prototype Liz Fraser and a one-time support point for British films from the 50s - Quatermass II cows, Hell Drivers, barmaids - presented as a pub owner while a standup comedian Kenny Lynch appears briefly to give the best results as an old school gangster. Oh, and the late Gareth Hunt is making his last bow like - irony - coroner ... <br /> <br /> The freestyle DVD also featured the director of another movie trailer to round off the package. Vinnie Jones, Bog Bodies, a ridiculous British horror with transatlantic scientists and Vinnie Elmer's Fudd duck hunter's equipment, terrorized by the redesigned 2000-year-old victim victim from the nearest peat collection ("Be Wewwy, wwwy qwuiet: I'm a yacht dwuids"). I can't wait ... <br /> <br /> But one thing I can guarantee is that every indie manufacturer based in the UK is going to try to find out exactly how much paid posts will be paid for a DVD in the coming weeks (they paid Â£ 250,000 to Prince for their CD). With so many British tax havens that are currently on the shelf and whose money is so hard to find, it can become an interesting stock market for British rifles.
