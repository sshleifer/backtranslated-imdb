I saw Mirrormaski last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience. <br /> <br /> This is a visually rich film with a slow direction, a poor plot line and two-dimensional characterization. <br /> <br I knew that when I went in. I was ready to trust the two gentlemen I went to (with knowledgeable comics) to make the visions normal and so they were. Unfortunately, the trend was that the scene after the scene underwent a little dramatic tension or conflict. Although this is a comment that could be made by many artists whose work is being screened and given instructions. The tempo of the story disappears when the camera loves beautiful pictures. <br /> <br /> I would not have confirmed without it that the style of the movie would be worth it. I've tried the work of Neil Gaiman, but I've always felt the "emperor's new clothes" feeling. I live in hope, but last night there was no exception. <br /> <br /> I don't think I can continue to analyze Gaiman's work without losing his will. Read the rest of the comments and all his mistakes are described beautifully. However, I cannot understand how he imagined that he understood the 15-year-old girl's mind, as well as what he had to say, adding something to the collection of human knowledge related to the increase and takeover of adult responsibility, or that the relationship that a girl might have with her mother. to be at. These are the central themes of the film and are treated unfairly, stereotypically and without imagination. All the beautiful images in the world cannot work out the work that is wrong in the core.
