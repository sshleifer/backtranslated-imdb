Director Godfrey Reggio must be a very charming and convincing person for this terribly botched project to see daylight. Reggio's message, so powerful and resonant in his previous two Qatsi films, is hopelessly confused here. Athletes, equations, oceans, keyboards, laughs, etc. mix without purpose. The banal image parade is usually a generic stock by Getty Images and others, and heavy digital manipulations are customary in the customary manner. Surely someone would be involved (Steven Soderbergh, CEO?). It might have been noted that applying a solar radiation filter to almost every frame was a very nice idea? The raw material loop, stratification and distortion of images reminds you of the fresh Photoshop class. And even worse, the computer's animation sequences are more artificial than the Wall Street pies of the 1980s. This does not mean that the improved aesthetics alone would have saved this film, but some of the effort in this direction could have made it a visual feed for music. I feel compelled to point out that the result of Philip Glass is definitely satisfactory to his fans. Not a radical departure, but rather the accuracy that glass does best with Yo Yo Ma's beautiful violin support. If you decide to see this movie, be sure to focus on a short opening sequence. Although you may already feel the majestic but long-abandoned Michigan railway station 89 minutes later in Detroit, you remember this 20th century disintegration image as a critical point if you had to go to the EXIT / STOP button, and so on. You have been warned.
