This film promised many, so many beautiful and well-playing actors, but with a plot that had almost nothing to say. So many potentially promising conflicts between family members that could have been developed and worked out, but it was all left behind and not cared for. No story was spoken, but acted as an actor, technique, beautiful scenes - all of which were EMPTY. But again, it worked great, so many single scenes were entertaining, but if you knew more and more that there were no ideas, even the actor lost his mind. So, from the promising start, more and more frustration was gained when the non-story went on.
