The only reason someone wants to see this movie would be John Leguizamo. I remember the previews, and it seemed to be second-rate comedy. But the fact that Mr Leguizamo celebrated tried to redeem it. His name, known or not, tried to sell it. <br /> <br /> I was quite disappointed with Leguizamo's performance. His "House of Buggin" ("In Living Color" clone) was his peak. There is a good line between the hero and the idiot, and we just say that Leguizamo exceeded it ten times. He saw that he was trying to be too annoying and crazy for the camera. In fact, I say he tried too hard. Madcap's humor broke into stupidity and the film was broken. I can't say I accused him if you had the opportunity, you would try as hard as you could, right? Your price will be expensive, though Mr Leguizamo ... <br /> <br /> Pest follows the tradition of every comedy film and plays a "racing map" and more. No group is going to have fun. Black, Latin, Whites, Jews, Koreans, Germans, Homosexuals and the Blind are among those who are out. Again, things are moving too far and too much trying to cheat too little. The movie resolution is all five minutes to clean and return to normal. it's funny or all you have is a 90-minute nonsense movie. What would Leguizamo "Pest" quite nicely put together ...
