I went to Crooked Earth to see a New Zealand piece. I found it to be badly written and badly acted out of the people I know. <br /> <br /> Great moments between characters? including many Temuera Morrison and Lawrences Makoares scenes together? they were often destroyed by the long and verbal monologues that the actors were forced to stumble upon. Pretty and badly suited phrases robbed Lawrence, especially when he was a new Maori Messiah in his beer box office. <br /> <br /> While watching a movie with Maori actors, I've found that I can always choose half a dozen characters to remind me. With Crooked Earth, I was trying to find one key sign that proved over the course of two hours. Most ?? including Wiremu and Peka? when I finish, say or do things that I don't understand and which I couldn't connect to. By the end of the film, the writer managed to transfer an audience where Maori was unable to communicate with it and Pakehale was allowed to dismiss it. My feeling is that the movie message ?? or at least the main one of the many people who are lobbyed by the audience? is important enough to prevent the use of marks on the extremities. Unfortunately, no one who read the script before reading the script will pass this suggestion. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was invasive and irritating because of the terrible bing-bong noise they cut through the Eyes Wide Shut. The audience was not annoyed, scared or angry when the music changed. It reminded me of Darth Vader's entrance to the music at Star Wars: obvious and easy. <br /> <br /> I think there are some people who could enjoy this movie. It is partly funny, it has a fair action and has some very powerful scenes. Calvin Tuteao and Quentin Hita also put the job up. As a whole, I didn't enjoy this experience as much as I know. Barb Wire, Speed ​​2, Dr Moreau Island and Crooked Earth look like they're going to be a Temi quartet.
