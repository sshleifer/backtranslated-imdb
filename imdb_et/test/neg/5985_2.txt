If it is part of the life of the author and the director, they are clinically manic depressive. At best, it is a sad, moody movie, where there are meaningless and unhappy characters everywhere that communicate negatively with catastrophic results. This film is a comedy. What was so funny to lose your home was allegedly due to deliberate firing or rape of one of the main characters. Does this art imitate life? Jack Black was a little fun, like a mountain man, a weed producer. But even this movie segment was common with sin. What was the point of living in the middle of the environment with the attendant. If Black's character was so paranoid, why did he immediately get out of Woodstock with people in the acid group? There is no end to disconnected relationships, less scripting, and scene transitions that lack cohesion or logical chronology.
