Of course it is difficult to be gay, especially in the south. We get it. Over ... and again. <br /> <br /> What stood out was that the filmmakers almost completely focused on these "extreme" characters of gay bars in small towns; dragged by queens, a sloppy sleaze of a long closed bar and a boy who was murdered brutally for homosexuality but had nothing to do with any of the bars in this film. <br /> <br /> Other people had interviews, people would probably be better connected. But they were glossed over, practically missed, maybe a glimpse of the background. <br /> <br /> For me, it would have been more interesting to hear more about the experiences of more common men and women who have either enriched or otherwise had the experience of a small town gay bar and / or the lack of this community.
