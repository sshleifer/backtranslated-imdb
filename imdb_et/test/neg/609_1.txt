Exhibition incredibly stupid, male-child and his harsh hot woman. 99% of the plots rotate around Doug, doing something incredibly stupid, and then it becomes a variable: a) whether he hides his wife or b) tell his wife, he shoots him and then his father (Arthur): the character of the type of Seinfeld situation. <br /> <br /> And writers dare to say that it was influenced by "Honeymooners" (absolute classic), and that plots have come from real situations, if you don't live in a cave, you know it's not true. <br /> <br /> Anyway, let's just be that. If Kevin James had been thin, the pilot would have been canceled on the ticket. If you are 12 years old or are happy with jokes .. be my guest, check out this exhibition (or some Kevin James movie on this issue). <br /> <br /> I have noticed that some posters are comparable to this travesty for much higher shows like friends, seinfeld and everyone loves Raymond - I still don't know how anyone could do it
