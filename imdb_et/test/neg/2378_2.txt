I think this is the first time I go to the theater and go so disappointed. There were two reasons I went to look at "Astérix et les Vikings": first as a film buffer and second as a large Astérix fan. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film does not match the film. It is just a big animated confusion and it proves that the Astérix franchise is getting worse off. In fact, it has been since the death of René Goscinny in 1977 in the first scenario. , Illustrator Albert Uderzo took his place, but the following books were clearly lacking in Goscinny's quality over the years. <br /> <br /> "Astérix et les Vikings" is based on the book "Astérix et les Normands" published during Goscinny. The main story is the same: Goudurix, Abraracourcix's "nephew" arrives in the village and Astérix that Obélix has to make him a real man, while the Vikings come to Gaul to find out what fear is because fear seems to give wings. <br /> <br /> Similarities end here. The book observes an independent series of laughter, jaws, and fun dialogues, resulting in Vikings discovering fear and fleeing from Gaul. The film is silly, uncomfortable, fast paced, rhinitis ... Well, just by default, the name has a good application ... <br /> <br /> The difference between a book and a movie may be more acceptable if the film was good. But new ideas just run into its bottomless hole. Even the older Astérix films, such as "Astérix le Gaulois", which almost carried the lines one by one, do not change, are better. <br /> <br /> Animation is the quality of other 21st century movies, but it has errors and every beginner can find mistakes. The biggest example is the consistency error where the day follows the second after the second, in the same order. <br /> <br /> Imagine. They took animation studios from many countries and still do not get enough movie selection. <br /> <br /> Changes to the original story are simply intolerable. And they could be even if the original story wasn't. Goudurix has a pet pet called SMS and acts as his mobile phone (!). The Viking leader Grossebaf is a rebellious daughter named Abba (!) And she is constantly abandoning her father. There's also a stupid Vikings wizard, his cartoon fool and a muscular son, Grossebaf's loyal bride who is embellished with a decoration (her name is Vikea!) And ... I can't keep it for longer. <br /> <br /> We are far from the original gags of the original book. The biggest problem is the difficulty of transferring images to the big screen, mainly because the biggest laughs of books come from verbal jokes and visual gags that do not have the same complaint on the screen. I remember that the biggest moments of the book were laughing at the names of the intruders (all completed by 'af') and Goudurix trying to scare them in a ridiculous way. <br /> <br /> And if everything was not enough, someone in the advertising staff decided to write a movie poster that there already exists a Céline Dion song that would be featured on the final credit. If that were a new song, I could have understood. However, using an old song is only one proof that the film is so badly made that they are ready to do something to attract movies. <br /> <br /> The only good point for this movie is that it is so stupid and the end is so bad that we just can't go out of the theater without being cold. Unlocking in the summer cannot just hurt ... <br /> <br /> The only acceptable point in the movie is how Goudurix becomes bold. His psychological transformation in the book is too spontaneous and unreliable, while the film has a better picture and a more motivational point. <br /> <br /> So if you haven't seen the movie yet, don't waste your money. Grab a book instead. <br /> <br /> Oh René, why did you leave us?
