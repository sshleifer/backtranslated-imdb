What really appeared to me about this film was how little this plot made sense. So many characters were accidentally introduced, it was like I imagine that Tommy Wiseau's 'room' would be for the Disney Channel. We had a clever older couple who stuck where Jane worked, telling the same story as "soda" they brought together, or Jane's mother / stepmother / randomly witching woman who would all appear randomly. /> <br /> Aaron Carter is sure to be the highlight of this movie: I watched every scene he appeared on. Editing is painfully bad, scene cuts don't make sense. "Jane" character is really irritating, mooning and moping "J.D. McQueen". "Music Awards" scenes are more frustrating than anything else. And the end of this movie is surreal.
