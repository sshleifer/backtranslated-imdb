I decided to watch this movie sleep. It kept me awake so it was interesting; but it was pretty acute. <br /> <br /> The show was good. I don't think any of the participants did a bad job. Mickey Rourke is just as plausible that maybe there could be a hill. The dialogue in this film does not give these participants a great opportunity to show their full potential, but they still seem. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere was great. The music was good and the colors matched the mood the director wanted to paint to the audience. Even the weather increases the mood of the film. Everything was well done. <br /> <br /> The failures of this movie are in the development of this story. The story of Mafia and Blackbird doesn't get enough attention. The story of Carmen and Wayne's divorce is not clear. The FBI seems to be working very fast here. Are there any paperwork for all these processes? Is it really so easy to dig your brother's body out of your grave, burn the body, and is it identified? There are too many loops to give this movie something more than 4 out of 10. I wouldn't recommend this movie to people unless they're really bored and have really smoked good weeds. Even if WoW is for maintenance, look for something better than watching this movie.
