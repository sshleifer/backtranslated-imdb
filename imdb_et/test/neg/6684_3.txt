First: The recent campaign for this movie is a huge hoax. Judging from the cover, what do you think it was a scandal about Kylie playing sex, drugs and whatever. It's just a cheap market plan. He's hardly in it and neither. Marketing here is incredible and I'm surprised that filmmakers are not against it. The film itself was a great disappointment to me. It seemed like an episode of Sunset Beach, directed by the reckless hand of teenage Quentin Tarantino. And it's not meant to compliment, remember. <br /> <br /> I think the film's weakness is story. It seems to be something. Just about cool teenagers living on the "edge". However, characteristic individuals have some personality, but the film does not use its potential. As said, there is no substance here. It seems to develop too much in a cool dialogue and looks like a colorful MTV ad. Certainly this is a feeling. Still, I think some people enjoy it, but I would say there are many better movies.
