There were so many things wrong with this movie I find it hard to keep them all straight. But one thing that really disturbs me is that if Jigsaw were in the bathroom on the ground, what would happen if Zep never appeared? What if Zep was killed by Danny Gloover before he reached the bathroom? Does Jigsaw just rise and walk out? Can a man in the middle of a bathroom not be a jigsaw, but another part of Jigsaw? What if Zep kills a woman and a child, how can Jigsaw get her poison when she is in the middle of the bathroom? Why does the doctor wait until the last minute to finally cut off the leg? It was too late, after six and as far as he knew his wife and child had already died, it was not the best hero of the time. These are just some of the questions I had about the film, but I may have something or everything because I've only seen the movie once. Please help!
