In the movie gallery I saw a flick that I just saw. It looked like a fun low budget horror / action / west that I could get into. Yes, I knew it was a miracle, but I still rented it, hoping to laugh. Just a few laughs were found. It was a very stupid movie. It starts with the creator, our protagonist, who is probably the weakest protagonist in film history. She looks / acts like Chuck Norris, but she can't. His dialogue also sucks. Anyway, he goes to the village, takes some zombies. You could say that they were trying to do it longer, putting those boring scenes where it takes 3-5 minutes to load or watch some zombies. At least zombies look cool. So, some people are shooting, some zombies are dying, and finally all are dead, except for our protagonist, who should have died when he was killed by four people.
