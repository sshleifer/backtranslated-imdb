This Canadian "film" is the worst! Amazingly amateur. When bad guys kidnap, we see two women with machines and one of them says with a very low voice: "We rob your ship!" She blinks and is completely shy! Very scary. ROTFLOL !!! <br /> <br /> Two karate heroes are 40 years ago, five feet long twin brothers! They are very bad actors. In fact, all those involved in this production are inactive. <br /> <br /> This cheap production has so many continuity errors that are amazing. In one scene, boys wear one type of swimsuit. In the next picture, they wear a completely different swimsuit. <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible! You must see a fan of bad movies. I have it in VHS. It is very rare. I love it.
