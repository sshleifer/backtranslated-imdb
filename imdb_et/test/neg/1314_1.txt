You would have thought, given how much this overflowed trash has to cost, that the budget could have stretched to a decent scriptwriter. Instead, they seemed to have chosen a film and dialogue for disaster disasters with Hollywood color standards. The only cliché they seem to have forgotten was a lovely boy. But every other is there. There's a sullen hero, accompanied by his former wife and alienated father. There's an embarrassing father and a rebellious teenager. There's a 'professor who everyone thought was wrong until it turned out he wasn't' (played terribly usual in the grip of Tom Courtney's seemingly some powerful drug) and the comic duo migrating on the abandoned underground railroad. <br /> <br /> I sat down to foresee it. The cast is, as noted, amazing. But after a few minutes it turned out how bad it was. Such useless things should contain a warning. Something like this: <br /> <br /> 'This movie may have been made in Britain, but it was aimed at the American market. That's why it includes tired clichés, stock symbols, shifted dialogue, and a plot that has been so demolished and simplified that even George W Bush understood it. '<br /> <br /> Avoid.
