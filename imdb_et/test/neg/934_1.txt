I don't know what some of these filmmakers think about doing the same type of clich√© movie over and over, where bad guys (in this case, bad girls) win. Weak operation and very predictable. Something original. The same movie has been made over and over again, which is no different from GOODBYE LOVER (1989), SLOW BURN (2005) or at least ten other movies with the same story and end. The film also has many holes. It would be like running out of money and just stopped filming. Or maybe they had run out of ideas. But don't waste your time with it. It only leaves you distracted when you waste your time watching it.
