Of course, you can see some boobs, but if that's all you are looking for in the movie, you'll get more passage from youtube. I just paid the dollar out of the redbox because I saw Val Kilmer's name. Bad movement. The plot did not thicken, the dialogue was dirty, the best characters. Someone said cinematography was fine, but didn't expect too much. This film moved very slowly and ended with no mercy. Black list. I spent a great deal on the film, wondering if any event or color scheme was symbolic. I have never really finished to think about it, because at the end nothing was ever explained. No twists. It also left many questions that when I got out I had no desire to answer. One of the worst films I've ever seen.
