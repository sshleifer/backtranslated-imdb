The title allows you to find out what you get. This is grade C, but not as bold as I expected. The story, directed by Eddie Romero, was originally directed by Jonathan Demm (before "Sheep's Silence" and "Philadelphia"), and was filmed in 1972 by a third world country. Lee Daniels, a wholesaler and retailer of short-term drugs, playing blaxploitation superstar Pam Grier plays the first half of the title role, while the long-forgotten Margaret Markov is the other half, Karen Brent, unlikely to be a political revolutionist like Patty Hearst, who wants a partner his comrades overthrow the oppressive local government . Of course, they are opposed to each other in the women's prison camp, where they wear inexplicably shining yellow mini skirts. The prison is led by a closed guard and a forced matron, it is just a pretext for a long shower scene, and some semi-hearty cats are fighting like Lee and Karen against each other. Of course, they are fleeing, but they break up The Defiant Ones and continue to fight against the cat until they attack a few nuns to steal their habits. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, there are various groups of disgusting men pursuing - a loutish drug owner is looking for Lee, who stole $ 40K from him, rather passive revolutionaries who were looking for Karen, and an incompetent police (who suffer from humiliation that they disclose to their private people) drug to the master). Needless to say, all Philippine women will eventually get to the head, but not before the nudity free, the dog will wear Karen panties and some of the worst men of the 1970s (one straw-colored revolutionary wearing a leather strap with a straight face). It's a pretty sad ending, but it's really sad how much of the potential black comedy has been completely lost in this funly useless exercise. Unfortunately, Grier is disappointed at this trip because his character is not allowed to do much than to deal with all the "jive", while Markov is the Amazon blonde I am sure he is desperately trying to be trustworthy. Since no one shows any talent for action, the rest of the cast is worth noting, except for balding, bug-eyed Sid Haig, who uses his standard psychological person as a master of drugs. The 2003 DVD contains only the original trailer as an accessory.
