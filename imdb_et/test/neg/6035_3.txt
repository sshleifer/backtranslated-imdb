Reeves plays Haji Murad, a hero in the 1850s in Russia. <br /> <br /> This is a badly dubbed movie with a few votes at the end of June. Unfortunately, the one who once thought the voices were synchronized with the lips was blind because the words would never fit with lip flaps. Anyone who says that Japanese films are bad has never watched this movie. <br /> <br /> The film's plot is instantly forgotten, and so I have forgotten the time she finished the movie and that I sit down and write it down. Perhaps it is more related to the fact that the film is one of many that Reeves hoped to move away from action to plot-based film. Perhaps it was good for Reeves, but its deadly for the audience, who must slip into despair like the one where his whole court intrigues little action. was a good actor, he just wasn't real happiness in choosing the movies that were good. They all seemed great, but very few of them made them look at the driving time of the comma movie. <br /> <br /> This movie will make you a coma. Look at it only if you have the need to sleep and all the other more lenient tools have failed.
