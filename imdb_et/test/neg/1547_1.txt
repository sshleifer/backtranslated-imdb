I bought this movie on garage sales when I was like 15. I hated it and looked at it again, just for this hell, it's even worse. You can hear the director and the operator in the background that punishes the words "Zoom, Zoom, Zoom !!!" There are no special effects, but a raw piece of meat that should be in the brain. It's cumbersome and I thought it was one kind of home movie or something I bought. But it was spread elsewhere and it's just very weird to know that other people have seen it. Instead, I need 10 lines .... well .... it may be interesting to see how no budget was made before the invention of digital cameras. It sucks. Actually, yes, look at it just to see if you can sit down the worst. If you can do this, you can do something through it.
