Pretentious claptrap, updating Herman Melville (!), About a young man's vaguely incestuous relationship with his aristocratic mother to get over her long lost sister who has been raised by the gypsies. Or something like that ?? not that someone really cares about pornographic sexual scenes, pseudo-symbolic images (blood-sucking brothers and sisters) and other bizarre multi-layered parcels (the gypsy child repeatedly insults the passers-by on the street until he is anonymously beaten to death, the demolition of old buildings) Considering the source material and the presence of Catherine Deneuve (who is at least naked to swim), I was expecting much more, probably there is a longer version of POLA X TV?
