I was ready for the Crouching Tiger-style movie and all I got was the worst movie I've seen for years. It was almost as bad as Baron Von Munchhuasen. Dead Script. Dead works. Dead of everything. <br /> <br /> Some good scenes were allowed, but the positive side ends there. When this movie arrives at your home to drive the phone screws and selects 911 and says, "Please help me have a movie in my house that forced people to commit suicide"
