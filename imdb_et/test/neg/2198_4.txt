Computing. Could there be something more boring? When you sit in front of the computer all day, typing every day every day, tap tapping. It's a big problem with this movie, the heroine sits in front of the computer's VDU, touching the keys and no matter how much she's waiting for agitation, or how many suspicious notes the composer is using, or how many extreme businesses out there are not too excited about the little things that are less exciting than looking at someone's computer. <br /> <br /> There are some other problems with too many factual errors in the way computers work. Is it possible to hack into a computer that is both off and not connected to the Internet? I think that when NET NET was made ten years ago, very few people would understand how computers worked so that scriptwriters could have been in the length of BS, but because we are now living in a global village with almost every homeland in the western world. audiences are definitely drawn over to the factual mistakes of the film. And, of course, there are too many cases where somebody acts out of fool or character at critical times to convey a plot that makes NET a very mediocre movie
