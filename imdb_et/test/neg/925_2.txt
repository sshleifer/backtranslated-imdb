this film is an indisputable attempt to turn to the younger fourteenth to the 24th century. younger demographers and offend them all. I refuse to believe that this age group is that this unnecessary "transformation" attracts it. At the beginning of the movie, one of the characters announces: "I am surrounded by idiots". it is the decisive moment in the film that is constantly falling from there. full of clichés, "frightening" with red herring and unexplained events, the film also has many characters that are not exactly brains. and it's funny "it's as dark as i can't see the stolen scenes from Chainsaw Massacre, but just annoying, not tension or fear. In the dark it is difficult to film and sometimes darkness is a great movie in the film, which presupposes that they have tension. but my own feeling was that the less you see in this case, the better. maybe he didn't want to wait until morning because he didn't care, besides that it might cost him more money to do well at night, or he doesn't know. who knows? If you have never seen a horror movie in your life or you are two or three years old, every aspect of this movie is predictable and done before. Warning: Paris Hilton is in this movie. enough said. at all blasé slasher film, which raises the question of where h * ll is a wax, it was considered a lost leader. if you are bored as possible and all other rentals are over or you are just in the mood of a bad horror movie that is not really scary or you want to see that Paris has cracks in your head, go and take the opportunity. this is not the worst film I've ever seen, but if that's what the filmmakers think the younger audience wants, I pray that they will be misled. a profit-based film that does not try to achieve any art or respect for the genre. you know, smart characters make a scarier movie. I believe this is the debut of Collet-Serra as a director other than ads and music videos. he still has one in 2006, named Goal 2, hopefully his goal is to make a better film.
