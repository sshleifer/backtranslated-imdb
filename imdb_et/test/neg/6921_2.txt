Sometimes showing is a good current debate that creates interesting opinions for the public, unfortunately, there is always a desperate sad person who is seeking approval, who finishes all interesting discussions instantly as he rises and says the proverb "Everyone should love each other and love each other" because they know that they get applause and confirmation because nobody would dare to agree. <br /> <br /> Well, they're the same people who marked this movie, why did they do it? INSECURITY. Anyway, that's all I say on this issue. <br /> <br /> Film, it starts with a reasonably interesting way, so you hope it builds, and if I like you, you have a nice pair of glasses of wine and some cheeses, then you give it even more opportunities just because you can't move. <br /> <br /> But then you dream, you travel, think about your other things, why? because the director did too! he took his foot off the gas and then he realized "ooops" that he would compensate him for accelerating, but then he would go over and over again, so the story slows down, the plot weakens and almost disappears, you even wonder "What happened again?" When you think of your screen, Nick Nolte shows some movement with a presumed goal, but you've long been worried about what he does and he appears something other than a screensaver dreaming about your day. <br Michael Moriarty, who plays John Converse, has the amazing ability to speak without his lip, or indeed without moving his face, which is somewhat similar to ventriloquist, he must have gone to Nicolas Cage's expression-free facial art school or attacked by a Phantom Botox sprayer. <br /> <br /> Tuesday Weld had to play Marge Converse, but he played Mia Farrow perfectly. <br /> <br /> There are hundreds of thousands of movies to see, so leave one of them, you see, I just wasted an evening watching what I could have seen, learning my mistake, relaxing the night is valuable so don't waste it watching this boring story, do something else, cluedo old game dust, train the guru in the evening or with a loved one, trim your nose hair, get rid of unused files from our laptop, it's better time to spend whatever you choose .
