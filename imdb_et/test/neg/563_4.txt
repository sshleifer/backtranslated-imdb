This movie should have been called "Alexander for the Eyes" and they should have done the Bogart concept completely. The film began with a slight approach to the legacy of Bogart and some comic moments on his surgical face, but after the first 15-30 minutes, it became a more serious thriller, where two palm-sized sapphires, allegedly marbled as eyes, were placed in front of and by Alexander Alexander, just before him. his death. So the gems are very valuable not only because of their quality and size, but also because they are associated with the world's biggest conqueror. Being an Alexander expert, I tell you that this is a complete and complete fiction, but it still makes a good movie. So the film comes up with some early stupidity and stumbles with all kinds of Alexander tips in the foreground and background (which I really liked), ending with a dated shark attack (you couldn't go to the '79 movie). 80 without sharks showing danger to the audience). There is a yacht called Euridice (Alexander's young wife), a man named Alexander, Philip, Cleitus? (It's been about 5 years since I've seen the movie so I don't remember all the details), Olympias, some street names and many others. It was fun to watch the movie just to try out all the background information that the director (obviously Alexanderph) himself put in. When everything is said and done, the eyes are searched and the camera is placed on them on the bed, the role of credit. Stylish end. What would have been more fun would be when they went on the Indiana Jones and had an adventure. There were many, many real objects that could have been used to make it more interesting or, for example, the Iliad hand-written (Aristotle) ​​version that Alexander held with him throughout his life, even on many of his journeys across Asia (a presumed value if found in today). Olivia Hussey (my all-time favorite b-movie actor) is being killed too early and it should have been the main actor, not the mother and poppa girl ... although she was easy with the eyes. If you find this flick, it might be worth the historical stuff and see Olivia Hussey in a very funny sense of humor, which is a little early, but after that I'll give it something interesting. > <br /> You, Nick
