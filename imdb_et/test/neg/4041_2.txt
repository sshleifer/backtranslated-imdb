It's tempting to watch this movie as a bold avant-garde. I like to think that the director was trying to see if it was possible to take all the comedy film conventions and produce something that was completely, completely, completely unusual. <br /> <br /> Answer to evaluate "Venus" is a surprising "yes". It may not be the worst film I've ever seen, but my brain seems to have repressed all the memories of others. This terrible flick hovers just on the border: bad enough that the thought still causes pain, but not so bad that my inner censorship has removed it from my consciousness. <br /> <br /> I find it hard to imagine what the director and the cast thought they did when they did, or why they went on and released it when they did. I doubt that someone who is involved has earned a lot, but they could have had enough money to buy all the prints and burn them. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that has nothing to suggest. It's not even a bad thing. This is just a non-movie, where nothing interesting happens. I was serious about returning it and demanding my money back, which is something I have never done before. <br /> <br /> Don't even think of this terrible non-movie!
