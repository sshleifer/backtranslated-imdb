"This life" is really as bad as it gets. His mercenaries, innocent, merciless, double, low stars are the aftermath of this eighties, and I have to admit in this regard that this is an exact creation. Unfortunately, it does not leave me with any compassion or concern, and I just consider it as a further step towards fraudulent television on high quality television; amazingly bad, cheap, reality and "celebrity" saturated television; and other cut and guided attitudes that have destroyed this medium and indeed a large part of British society. Sounds exaggerated? I don't think it is. In this context, programs like "This Life" have indeed been as powerful as they are often called.
