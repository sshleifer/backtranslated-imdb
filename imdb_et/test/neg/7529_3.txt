... but I would lie. The relative was a crew member and we had to watch the production of this movie for a few days (and I was extra). I can die and there is another time on the screen, not that I'm going to Hollywood soon. I just thought it was fantastic to see how the movies were made and be part of it. Plus, I got a copy of the movie when it was finally released. They didn't have studio support for making this movie, so it would be truly independent. Why writing and acting is so terrible that it's outside of me, but the main character "Cherry" is the director's sister, which could be part of it. But cinematography was good. :)
