Barney is an idiot dinosaur who (regrettably) did not go out with other dinosaurs several times ago. Instead, he sings stupid songs and has a stupid moral life that is 100% worthless and / or extremely dangerous: it's "STRANGERS IS YOUR FRIENDS WHO YOU HAVE!" The reason I say he is evil? Well, YouTube has a video of Barney's song about toy balls. If it has been played back, it will look like "WE ALL ALL COME HANG YH! Don't Believe Me? Check it out for yourself! I read from another review that they are now reading PC folklore and fairy tales. Now it's just stupid with capital S I mean, really! Anyway, I do not recommend my children to watch this filth because it contains foolish morals, as strangers are your friends (as mentioned earlier), there is never a reason to be sad and if you are sad to eat junk food, being an individual is a sad taboo, magic can solve all your problems and other ridiculous mess.
