I know if you buy used (oops, excuses, previously viewed) DVDs for $ 5.99, you shouldn't have very high expectations, but even this was the steep price of this bad box disk. <br /> <br /> I give credit to manufacturers to give the viewer a challenging challenge. . . Determine what is the worst, functioning, scripting, camera work, special effects. . . they are all terrible. Oh, it's absolutely WORST a fake car accident that was ever used on film somewhere. <br /> <br /> Now this is just a serious laugh at a movie fan who proudly recognizes "Police Academy", "Nude Gun", "National Lamp's Loaded Weapon", and a number of other campy records in their collection, but at least those people know that the language should be planted firmly in the PW molded cheeks, but unfortunately they use their tongues in an effort to offer a man. And although it is almost without my conviction, it seems that the film's characters think they could actually make something valuable. In the back, pornographer would be ashamed to release this confusion. <br /> <br /> Oh. I'm happy to buy the worst video ever made at the same time .. .. "Fraternity Demon" ... Maybe the name should have given me a hint.
