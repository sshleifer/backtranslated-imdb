All in all, don't wait much and you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And if you want to see a movie that will take you back to 1983, it certainly does. The only reason I gave this movie 2 points more than it deserves is 2 reasons: <br /> <br /> # 1. Brazilian People, Sights, Culture and music <br /> <br /> The film is almost entirely carried out by Caine as it makes it seemingly impossible to make it a viable and semi-believable story. Even Joe Bologna and Valerie Harper can't. Michael Caine is a pure class, as always. In addition to a talented classic and comic actor, Caine brings all the film he does, combined with self-awareness, misery and sensitivity ... his focus on focus as far as his role in Alfie ... and why he won the Academy Award for Hannah and his sisters for 2 years later. In this farce he is gently enchanting ... funny and vulnerable ... melancholic and sentimental .... and besides the jewel that is Rio de Janeiro, the only reason not to find better entertainment. > <br /> Well ... maybe look at two cute young actors, Michelle Johnson and Demi Moore. But see that everything is possible in Michelle (although her look seems to be dated) .... there could be no more painful movie experience than watching her "try" to act (most of her dialogue seems too much). Demi's behavior and vision are 100 times better and you could easily transplant it, as it is, into any movie today (she's not really very different to be honest). Mrs Moore is definitely undervalued, especially given that she was the 2nd biggest star. <br /> <br /> Save it as a silly farce, finally, as I actually like maturity, with which all these people handle this scandalous situation ... that it does not end friendships or marriages and that even your best friend's minor The daughter can be forgiven and everyone can move on. Afflicted parties show anger and frustration, but all work best .... a bit unrealistic but surprisingly refreshing. Hope is always there.
