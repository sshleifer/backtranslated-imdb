Most criticisms of this flick have been pretty damn accurate. It is an hour and a half waste of time, followed by a bunch of very beautiful colleges that cry and cry out of life. There are about twenty minutes of magic and absolutely no frightening or exciting moments. Our actor is treated like a piece of ass and seems to be completely satisfied with his position. These ipsmith sons, who are leading characters, go to poster boys in a shop of all kinds of pop culture clothes. You can't communicate with them, hell, you hardly understand. The story goes over all this and when it finally reaches the final battle, it's not just a volleyball game that won't last long enough to make up for O.C.
