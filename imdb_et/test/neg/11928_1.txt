If you are a fan of the original series, DO NOT see this movie. The series did not include Aeon's family and his motive for adventure does not save selfish interests. Obviously, the chim-writer in charge was familiar with the film that was needed to "bad grrl" demographics, making her character dead, but she has a good reason to kill people. <br /> <br /> You wouldn't have thought of it, but the film is more two-dimensional than a comic. The signs are all well illustrated and some conflicts of interest that are finally resolved. All dogs go to heaven and the same for every dead person in this movie. <br /> <br /> The selfish, twisted, perverted, dominant people of Aeon and Trevor are nowhere to be seen. Finally, they literally become a cudey pair of Annie Hall. The only character left to the exhibition was the floating machine in the sky. I think if you ever thought, "I like Aeon Flux, but I want it to be more like every other face of a good v-evil sci-fi Hollywood that slides out there," then you're here to treat. <br /> <br /> They didn't even look out. I think black metal bikini was too much to ask, but the whole device is wrong. For 400 years the future seems to have been over 30 years. Obviously, instead of the mayor-apocalyptic world, the eye of the viewer attacks the furniture of 70's eggs, mod-squad frutopia of wood-paneled walls, earth tones and many plants. Bregna was a dystopia, not a utopia. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Breg, this is the only city on earth according to the film. The exhibition is clear that there are two cities, Bregna and Monica, which used to be one. In the film, "Monicans" is simply the freedom fighters of the Hollywood storybook. They also have the same technology as Bregnans, which is not the case with the exhibition. <br /> <br /> The only possible conclusion is that the real writer of this movie was a high school child and wrote the day before it was due to the studio, and he never saw the whole Aeon Flux. The overwhelming amount of contradiction with the comic is confusing. In addition to certain names such as Aeon Flux, Trevor Goodchild and Bregna, this film is not an exhibition. <br /> <br /> The real part of the movie is trying to mix the colorful soy-green plot, the grain runner, the Logan run and the grave raider that came out of the dull brown shit.
