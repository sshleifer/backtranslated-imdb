Everyone has a choice of "the worst movie they've ever seen." Some want to choose Gigli or Battlefield Earth. Some choose classic plans like Plan 9 From Space Space. Since I was 14 years old, I have said that I have a problem with the 2nd child and 9 years later I feel exactly the same. It's not "one of the worst", it's not just an expression. This is the real worst film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> How much farting, pooping, peeing and puking can one film? I don't have to see a dog that takes his waist! Why am I so dirty? I have nothing against the bathroom or tougher humor. Heck, I like American Pie movies. It is a bad idea to overcome such excess in 90 minutes, but the real point of inclination is to do it with children! Little children call each other a sexual name (IMDb doesn't let me even write this word, but here it comes out of my 8-year-olds. Think of irony!) And urinate and tuck each other just makes the whole thing more recognizable. The worst line of the movie: "I think I should go to the people's office." <br /> <br /> What other film has: urination for lemonade, dynamite sticking to an explosive toilet, a little boy filming his babysitter with sex and projecting it on the side of the house, and a little girl joking about scratches? <br /> <br /> But my absolute favorite must be when the same little girl is driving at the carnival, "I beat," opens her mouth and fakes off looking straight out of the dress. its open mouth perfect at 90 degrees! The Scary Movie 2 puking scene seemed more realistic. <br /> <br /> I think Gilbert Gottfried is the only redeeming element of the movie. You get the impression that he didn't even have a script, but was his usual. It is too bad that he must behave stupid when he is thrown out of pizza. <br /> <br /> You know what? Thinking of a movie that's just that I have to go to the bathroom. Goodbye!
