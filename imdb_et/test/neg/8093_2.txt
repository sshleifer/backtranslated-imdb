A very flawed but easy-to-follow comedy that runs like Farrelly's brothers, rejects. The most criminal thing, however, is pain. For one minute I couldn't believe Jerry O Connell and Jake Busey in the role of superstudents who could pull any woman's hat into the drop or believe (very beautiful) Shannon Elizabeth as a tough street policeman! The story is predictable, but it succeeds to raise the titre a few times, although the "gross output" is intended for "shock comic" scenes (one includes amputated testicles and another set for sperm bank) is just plain terrible. If this movie is on television, it may be worth watching if you are extremely boring, but please don't waste your money on renting!
