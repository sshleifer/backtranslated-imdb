It was one of Christie's later stories. Throughout his long career, he was interested in the shifting narrative and the idea of ​​opposing agents. Both are essentially the same and subordinate to questions that control or create the situation. <br /> <br /> For detective fiction, the game is against reality. The killer intends to change the reality to fool the detective, the writer intends to do the same to the reader. Both the reader and the detective are in the same battles to create what they see. That is why his stories are often a writer. <br /> <br /> In his work, he explores every combination of gimmicks he thinks about it. Along the way, we often have bodies that are not the ones they see, and times and intended victims and such. But the true magic of books is the concept of control. At "Bertram" it was literally a building. <br /> <br /> Here's the dead man. Well, sometimes it happens, but not so. Just like the writer would be famous for Mr. Rafiel. This is especially sweet for Marple's readers who remember the same sign of Carribean Mystery, which in some ways was also his nephew. For this story, Rafiel was a transmitter to the authorities. <br /> <br /> The manufacturers in this series are almost terribly committed to using a different creative team. Sometimes it does a strange job. The "Bertram" episode was quite brilliantly staged. It is the most abundant batch and has an active camera. But unlike Bertram's work, it has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> Camera moves and hits only because it's possible. The quote of Citizen Kane at the beginning was a bit too written and blunt. This story is good, but the adapter took some pretty critical things and the irrelevant camera is irritating. <br /> <br /> Tedi Assessment - 2/3: Are there some interesting elements.
