If you read Errol Flynn's autobiography, My Wicked, Wicked Ways, you'll see that this movie is full of poetic licenses. Not that it makes a big difference because Errol Flynn was quite generous with a poetic license in autobiography. There's no need to worry about spoilers because there's nothing to spoil. <br /> <br /> It seems more reasonable for me to use the story of a fictional Hollywood actor; then you can go out and find a better actor than Duncan Regehr to play him, and you shouldn't worry about the audience's words like: "But he had no mustache in Captain Blood." The second failure of this movie is that it shows Flynn as a two-dimensional character. Flynn was an intelligent man, well educated, well-read. This movie focuses only on your own amusement picture. <br /> <br /> Regehr is a disaster. The rest of the majority fights with their scripts. Hal Linden is OK when Warner and Barbara Hershey make credible Damita, though Lili Damita didn't think so. <br /> <br /> The best thing to do about this movie is to forget and let it be forgotten. So what I write is not what I can imagine.
