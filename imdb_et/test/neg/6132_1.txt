Here's a fantastic movie concept - a series of meteors that fall into a small town and the resulting alien infection has been caught on the dash clip of a deputy's camera as the city slowly took over. Leave it to Albert Pyun to close it! Don't get 100 feet from this paw! The holy crap that bomb ... it can be the worst of Pyun! The crazy thing is that here is the germ of the creative idea - the entire outbreak that was spoken of by the POV of the dome camera. When I heard some time ago, I imagined that the car would get into things, people would go over and infected types would break the windshield and surround the car chaos. Would it be cool right? Instead, we are always in the forefront of the forest in the area, occasionally getting into three infected types that just stand there. The last bit is literally a 15-minute image where nothing happens in front of the camera, but only the noise is displayed. Stay away !!! From a somewhat alleviating note, I think I'll officially call for the end of my Pyun ... but I took 20 crappy movies to understand that I have better things.
