I saw and I have the original 1959 black and white, which marks Shelley Winters and Millie Perkins, and no matter how many times I watch it, I can't help but cry. <br /> <br /> This version was (probably) like 1959, with so many errors in the layout. Spiral staircase? There were elements in the film that were not present during this period. Doris Roberts, sad to say that she can't play drama, she's a comic actor and it doesn't change. James Coco was terrible Mr Van Daan and Mr Dussel reminded the college professor rather than the dentist he was supposed to play. In the original film, Anne walked "revenge" to go to Peter's room, which seemed to take her more than a minute. In this dirty remake he took less than 10 seconds. The first reviewer was right ... This remake is just that remake. What was the director who was thinking of comic strip makers in such a drama role? I'm sorry, but James Coco can't play the drama. Max .. Schell was Deep Impactis better than this movie. Creepy Mrs. Frank was just that tough, I couldn't hold her. Referring to the 1959 version and recalling it, I love her better, she did a better job because she was an overwhelming mother. From 10 stars, I'll give it a transformation. 3. Don't waste your time, get the 1959 version and box Kleenex.
