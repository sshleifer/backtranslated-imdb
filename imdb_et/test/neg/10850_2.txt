Rigoletto is a Verdi masterpiece, full of drama, emotion and powerful, memorable music. Maestro had to roll up his grave when his bare travesty was freed from this unnecessary foreskin and cheap copulation, and that imagined naive but essentially Gilda as a horny ditz. Opera can definitely customize the cinema --- check out Zeferell's great La Traviata --- but if the job is as good as Rigoletto, it doesn't need cheap tricks. It may even be acceptable if music dubbed music has been good, but it is on average consistent with the second level of libretto sound quality.
