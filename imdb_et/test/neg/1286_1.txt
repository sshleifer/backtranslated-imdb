This film comes out like a square square hole. Badly done peg. A cheap price that couldn't even be made on the Sweatshop conveyor in Chinatown, Mexico. In fact, when you try to press the tango hole for which it is obviously designed, it breaks down into sticky, nasty pieces that smell like rotten fruit and do not wash. Quigly is such a peg. <br /> <br /> This movie is so desperate that it wouldn't even be possible to create it. Such a film must be caused by a natural disaster; some amazing items that worshiped somewhat in the corner of the office room and swelled and grew until it was too big and terrible. Such a thing would only interest science; somebody who has not learned hard, it casts out this world. <br /> <br /> What it is is: if you are the one who enjoys first-year violin cuts, racism or Coke Zero, it may just be your birthday.
