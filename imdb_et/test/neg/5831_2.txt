After a while 4kids will bring new exhibitions to their company. In recent years, they have brought pure gold like Kirby: right back to Ya! or Mew Mew Power. But Recenetly, 4kids have been out. CatDog is one example. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to write a negative comment without showing it, but actually Weekenders is a clean garbage. It rotates around a group that has over the active brain. The catch is something he thinks it's bad. It may sound good on paper, but after you look at it, you will understand how far away from this exhibition. <br /> <br /> Pizza Guy is extremely stupid. He's very one-dimensional, he doesn't really have much. He's hyperactive, the end of the story. While many feel that all characters are hanging from South Park, I think it's the opposite. Mechazawa cromartie high school has an interesting character and she can make me laugh. Tino doesn't do either. <br /> <br /> The cast is no better. Like Tino's mother, they suffer from a lack of character. They're just one feature. The only quality of redemption is that the exhibition can cause a smile. Is that the scene can be funny or you can just smile because it is stupid. <br /> <br /> Weekend is a very funny show for Disney / 4kids. Although it seems to love some fans, it should actually stay with the kids.
