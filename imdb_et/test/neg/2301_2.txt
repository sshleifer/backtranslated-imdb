This film is the last shoulder in the list of films I saw this week that pushed me and forced me to join the IMDb and spread a warning to the public. It was absolutely terrible. The film was pulled out and painfully boring. Sound, effects, and even picture quality seemed to come from Willow (1988) or perhaps even Conan Barbar (1982). Bannockburn's battle was completely absurd. This "The Greatest Filmed Reconstruction of the Medieval Battle of the British Isles" made me beat. There are no single designs, but some guys who walked between them. Douglas scenes, especially in the last battle, were just terrible, as most of the film had worked.
