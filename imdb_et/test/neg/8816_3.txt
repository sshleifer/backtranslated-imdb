Saw's main problems are related to huge script errors, which only the critical spectator simply excludes. The main question is what is the killer's purpose in his lying? The film attempts to show that the killer's goal is to cause evil and destruction to his victims, he loves to play with other people's lives and has control over his fears and abilities. Why does he just say he's dead between the two main characters? There is a tremendous improbability: can a man pretend he has died more than one or two hours without moving to a single muscle or even without breathing so that two men in the same room would not be discovered? It doesn't make any sense, except for the final effect of the movie. The killer always seems to be under control and if it is like a dead body, it is not possible. Finally, it doesn't work. The right place for the killer should have been a darker and untouched shadow behind the wrong shade (male sister), but not the floor of the white space. The director should not show the killer's face and perhaps the site where he is hidden. Then the film would be a pretty good thriller. But Saw is just a fiasco. Hitchcock, please, come back.
