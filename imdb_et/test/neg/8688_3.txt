The VHS cover for Evil Under looks like a cool underwater horror strike. Unfortunately, it is closer to the boring adventure clamp and has no real horrors. It starts with some divers who attack and see a little blood, but it's the only blood on the film. <br /> <br /> The evil below is not the worst, but the horror movie is annoying boring. Action is decent and frankly the only thing that keeps track of you is the evolving romance between the two wires. There are some nightmares where it just seems the director didn't know what to do. I took it through to sit (almost), but I wouldn't recommend this movie NO. Horror fans may want a copy of the cool VHS cover, but that's the best.
