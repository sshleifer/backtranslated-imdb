I looked at this film with some sort of dangerous fascination, like a hedgehog stuck in the headlamps. No doubt it's a bad movie, even if you enjoyed it, but the important question is why? It's a good cast; it's lively; it's ready to deal with sex, some characters get a part of it and that is unusual for British comedy. It also has Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook, Marmite performers have agreed, but they have had moments of the past. <br /> <br /> Mainly no magic. Characters are impossible idiotic, unbelievable and alienating, so manufacturers have made men who play badly. Any mediocre writer who would like to shoot the sexual attitudes of sexy, sexist British men would have received a copy of Loaded, a zoo, or even Viza to read about Sidi's sex and write about it. Instead, manufacturers obviously tried some of the signs of moral, difficult to care for. Character comedy - as opposed to slapstick, etc. - works only when the audience can feel the truth for some people. But watching this movie is like saying annoying jokes, what you know is that it doesn't stop funny, but you can't stop it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film has been badly made. The plot structure is weak, there are little signs or development, and many scenes are not funny. From time to time, the same flat reggae scenes start sharing, meaningless and intelligent. There are many unnecessary repetitions - if you have made one joke about parking outside of sex, you don't have to do it again. One wonders what the UK Film Council saw in the script. <br /> <br /> This is a world where most men are stubborn and most women are constantly on it. The apartment and Alfie satirized the same worldview, but the producers of this film accept it without criticism. Thus, they have reached a lower update of the window cleaner Confessions. Anyone in Britain must have another kind of thing and do it right? good next project for Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright ...
