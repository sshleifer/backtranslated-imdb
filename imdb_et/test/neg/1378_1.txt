Sometimes I accidentally leave television after "South Park" and I end up trying to share a train wreck with middle humor that is "Mind of Mencia". This is the only time I want my room to be cleaner, because I can find the distance a lot faster. The truth is that Comedy Central needs an alternate "Chappelle show", and what they got was an exhibition that invites idiots that are so much left by Dave that they stay with a minority breed or are happy "Mexicans love tacot" jokes that Carlos Mencia shovels every week. However, I have to realize that there are some people who actually find Mencia * trembling * jokes. I stand firmly in my words when I say that I believe these people exist only in myth. However, if you really are there, I ask you never to be in my residential area and read these great differences between Carlos and the "Chappelle Show": <br /> <br /> 1) Dave was funny. You can highlight this. <br /> <br /> 2) "Chappelle's Show" was five times as sharp as Mencia could ever hope. But every time his little exhibition promo, it's all about him who brings his horn how he has never seen anything before. You got it right, Carlos. And not well. Chappelle didn't have to tell people he was nervous and funny. We all just kept our eyes on the show to find out for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 3) Chappelle actually had racing jokes that were identified in different cultures - things some people didn't know about. Like his "I know black" game segment. The main prize was the hair cream used by black people. It's deeper than Mencia ever dares to dive. So how does he dare to call himself nervous? When Mencia wrote that the sketch would be a grand prize had been fried chicken and school-aid. And my accusations have some value. I saw a promo for my show (which I have kindly called "My TV Monitor, which takes S within thirty minutes") a few days ago, and that was some of the stereotypes of the Olympics I promised. funny concept. Then I saw Mexico, who won, got a green card as the main prize. Is that so? Is it as close to the fire as you want? Who doesn't think about it in the 7th grade? Because fans of your show, if you ever look at and you forget one of your punchline, perhaps because you and your friends discussed how "Duh-De-Durr" will never get old and in no way is a joke where someone it would be funny to say something wisely - remember that there are only five possible options: green card, tacos, traps, lawn mowers and, of course, duh-de-dur. Remember - no matter who it was, yelled. Enjoy! <br /> <br /> 4) Regarding number 2. Every time he says something that laughs, he stops to tell people (although laughing at his jokes) that he thinks he "went too far with this last one ". Then don't say it for God's sake. Or let people decide for themselves. He and Comedy Central are holding this throat down to show that it is more controversial than the "Da Vinci Code". You are not. You will never. <br /> <br /> The content of the exhibition has never been offended. I never give that much credit to it. I'm offended that Carlos Mencia is given thirty minutes to scream unnecessarily. Yes, I know it literally.
