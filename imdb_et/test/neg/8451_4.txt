** SPOILERS ** If the movie's title is the killer's fish name twice, you should see them in action attacking ripping and eating almost everyone's characters. Instead, you have to wait until the movie is almost over to get a glimpse of Piranah. Even when you see everything, it is the water that turns and mixes when a poor person disappears under it, assuming that the fish eats, healthy and alive. <br /> <br /> "Piranha Piranha" begins with a frightening look on Piranha's screen when credit goes down, but **** SPOILER ****, the only time in the movie you see on the killer's fish or fish that you never see with Piranha. again. What you see is the exchange of Venezuela and its people and the jungle of Venezuela by the Amazon basin. Together with many nice and breath-taking scenery photography, but also with people and wildlife, but that's all. <br /> <br /> Is there a story related to this great white hunter Caribe, William Smith, which ironically means Piranhat in the mother tongue he is talking about, is what the movie's title "Piranha Piranha" really meant? "Caribe Caribe"! The person Caribe is played by the legendary Hollywood Hell's Angles biker and the whole tough guy William Smith. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this movie, the American tourist trio Jim Pendrake and his sister Terry, Peter Bown & Ahna Capri and their American guide, Art Green, Tom Simcox, are on their way to the Venezuelan jungle to go home with Terry. Terry is afraid of weapons when we learn that when a young girl saw her father was headed. Even when art saves his life, when you see an attack by Terry on a six-foot rhomb-shaped rattlesnake, he fixes him with a gun; what he promised him he wouldn't take with him on a trip. <br /> <br /> In Jungle's resting or bar, three of the Caribesse get caught in the jungle, who saw a movie in the jungle. Caribe makes himself three more welcomed, knowing the jungle and his half-burned philosophy of life and death, as well as his ability to get where they go to the deep local diamond mine in the Amazon basin. > <br /> Even if at first a bit strange, the boy is not noticing that there are people around him, Caribe proves to be swelling and pleasant for a long time and friendly motorcycle racing through the swamps and jungle Art. Caribe even shows Terry, who in the movie almost knocked out his teeth, the fine points of yachts and wild game, which he thinks are not really dead, but become his part after killing them! A little crazy, but you have to admit that this man has imagination. <br /> <br /> It's much later in the movie that for some strange reason it might have been cheap drinking, Caribe suddenly goes crazy and becomes murderous by attacking and raping Terry and then murdering his angry brother and feeding him to the deadly Piranha. In an attempt to escape from the striking madness and then being forced to fight with him, Caribe collides with almost unconsciousness, beaten so vigorously. Just when Caribe finally kills Art, he died of Terry's death, who, after what this crazy walnut job is, finally decided that weapons are really very necessary and should be used very rarely, but to save life. br /> <br /> It is worth watching, if you look at it at all, but landscapes and nothing else. It's just a shame that the movie has to advertise as a killer fish or Piranha, a horror movie, if it was honest, could have been more or less the average jungle adventure with Smith, he has built it, plays Venezuela in Tarzani, not Africa, Jungle
