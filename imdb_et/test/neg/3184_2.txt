"It had to get good comments," says g / f. If so, I can't find them. She's going to sleep and I'm suffering. Michael Douglas is a good boy - now it's new. Matt Dillon all spun. John Goodman loses his cool. Paul Reiser runs in BDSM leather. Oh, it's a rebellion that's right. <br /> <br /> Hitch is probably about to lose interest soon. Liv Tyler plays femme fatale and critics complain that he may not have his part. But this is irrelevant: this film does not mean character development. In fact, I would go so far as to say that there is no character at all. What you should evaluate here is the plot. <br /> <br /> No one in this movie is "bad". Some people do not know why all these "stars" - Reba are here for good - to register for such a junk project. The odds are when they think it would be fun. Maybe they were fun. Who knows? Hey - maybe they have a good paid. And this is probably not a good idea.
