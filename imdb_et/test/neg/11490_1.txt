I haven't seen or heard the original version. <br /> <br /> I am not Russian but I am studying now. <br /> <br /> I also have no preferences for Russia, Bulgaria, USA. But what I have to mention is: <br /> <br /> When the German films are synchronized throughout the film, all Russians talk with a Russian accent. Americans talk about "Hochdeutsch" (without accent)! I've never heard such stupidity! Besides, it's boring. <br /> <br /> I hope the original is better. <br /> <br /> The rest is a simple thriller, not a really good idea. Like the cheap version of James Bond.
