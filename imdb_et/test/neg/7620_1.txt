Do you know what farmers are spraying on the field? That's right - manure, so when the BBC decided to make a lot of GMOs and agricultural production into a mortgage thriller, we got some of the fine manure that the BBC has released to its audience <br /> <br /> !!! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> GOLD AREAS opens up in a lab where a female scientist (Trendy BBC for all scientists has women) announces, "A new wheat strain will save the third world from hunger," then the story goes to another equal fool. If you are going to do any type of thriller, shouldn't you open the hook that grabs the audience? DOCTOR WHO was excellent in this respect as well as the X-FILES and 28 DAYS LATER were opened with a hook that took place in the laboratory. I think no one in the BBC thought that this thriller needed to be hooked because the viewers had been engaged in adult trailers for weeks. One drunken man whose morality is lower than Bill Clinton and Dubya Bush, while the other is a female journalist full of virtue, studying patients in the county hospital who could get through "Mercy killings". At this point, things are starting to get confused because the female journalist is threatened by MI5 spooks and the first episode ends with the killing of the main MI5 spook. The second episode shows that patients in the county hospital are actually dead due to VRSA superb infection. This is when things go completely to the hay line. In the THIRD AREA, the audience has believed that the intelligence services and the company shown in the opening order have been behind the deaths - But they are not. It turns out that a bad boy is an organic farmer who has made a VRSA superb in his bedroom and the story ends with a MATRIX camera that works with a drunk male journalist burning in a field running with VRSA, thus spreading the super world all over the country it is impossible to say good words about GOLD OF GOLD. At that time, I was a member of both the Scottish Green Party and Greenpeace. Since then, I have given up my time in the field of environmental protection, but even now I am somewhat offended by how environmentalists are depicted here and a bad man is spreading a fatal genetically modified virus as a warning about the dangers of genetically modified organisms. It's a bit like a CND member who lets London warn of the dangers of a nuclear war. I was a little offended by how male characters were written as bastards, while all women were very intelligent and morally higher than men. There are other problems with the script, especially with VRSA. If, unlike the scriptwriters, you take the time and effort to study VRSA, you will find that it is completely different here. And if you burn diesel, it won't explode like a napalm. Perhaps the worst criticism of the script is that it is similar to the structure of JEEPERS CREEPERS, according to which the last ten minutes are in conflict with most of the time that has gone by. When JEEPERS CREEPERS only lasted about 90 minutes, the GOLDID OF OF GOLD lasted twice as long, so it's twice as irritating and illogical <br /> <br /> As a footnote, environmental protection never does a good thing for a thriller (someone remembers them) Steven Segal Movies?) And it's about time that TV and movie makers understand it
