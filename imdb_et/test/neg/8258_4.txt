In the "Red Letters", Coyote is a professor of college who writes in a female prison and gets more than she wanted. There are two reasons to see this flick. Kinski is one and the other, although their sparks are hard to see in such a full accident. Everything is wrong with "Red Letters" ... a twisted, weak scenario, camera, editing and the most important action under Coyote etc. Battersby has taken the story potentially and has made it a serious flaw and an amateur flick is not worth the time.
