Since I have no television and I have never heard of this mini-series, I didn't know what to expect from the second coming and hired it purely on the basis of a summary of my lots, which was interesting. > <br /> Dear God! When someone told me that it was written by thirteen-year-olds who had been given a project that the second school game was not surprised. Why, why did they decide to depict Jesus II as an idiot? Is there any suggestion in any gospel? Okay, plain blessed, but big North Moron. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Probably all Jesus made people impress that he was his miracle, because he would make his preaching confident if hell had never been influenced. Surely it would be a night without a trick without Jesus Eccleston tearing down without a canoe, paddle or any other way. <br /> <br /> And the strange little geometric polemics put the barren, without the rhyme or cause. Other than, of course, Russell is on his QAF fan base. Jesus comes to work in the pub to recruit "disciples" (more profound North-losers and, of course, a gay-writer standby - harp woman, claw, nervous, nervous). Gay rights have been drawn down to his throat for real purposes, almost as Russell thought he was "boys for that" to put Jesus on the ground. <br /> <br /> I don't see the real Jesus who comes out "Well, I'm nothing against it personally, companion." Only someone really middle-class and wool can imagine that Jesus is so moist. <br /> <br /> Don't start over. "Please come in and eat the poison of rats, because the only way we can really be free is when God dies." <br /> <br /> It was like Eddie Izzard's sketch of God Gates. "Hi, I'm Bill Gates, and now you've reminded me that my global domination is cramped in your style. I'll give it to you all, my customers." And, of course, eat rat poison. <br /> <br /> I'm often mystified with IMDb ratings, but a high rating for this is a cookie. <br /> <br /> Don't forget about Jesus for the new millennium - this is Jesus' brain-free MTV boys. <br /> <br /> God helps us all.
