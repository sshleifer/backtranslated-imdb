The title says it all - Ed Gein, the butcher of Plainfield. <br /> <br /> This is not a delicate action-packed movie made high on energy drinks. This would suit the well-established genre of what kind of people entertain, something like "Halloween" or "Texas Chain Saw Massacre". <br /> <br /> It's dark, slow, stuffed with dead bodies and quietly evil. There are few shocks, no monster points, no loud electronic scores. I don't know who it is - maybe - ghouls. <br /> <br /> Under the credits, we can see photos of the skull, the carcasses hung up, the skins surrounded by the backrests of the chair, such a thing. And they are reluctant to think that this film was better than offset by the opening of the Grand Guignol. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is not the case. Action is equally terrible, as in high school. The script does its best to sink below the vulgarity. Ed Gein, who killed only two middle-aged women and maybe his brother, runs through a screaming, bloody young woman in Weir's forest and only bears a modern bra and bikini, not underwear. Gein also revokes the night watch he never made in a historical sense. <br /> <br /> Direction? You could do a better job. In the first few minutes, lawyers will discover an abandoned car that has blood blown across the windscreen. There is no body. A beautiful young sheriff turns to his boss and suggests that they seek a victim who may still be close and living. Sheriff, who has no motivation, shouts to him, "Now you just forget that! I don't want you to go off the HALF!" It should not be just an entrepreneurial exchange of views. Why is the director sheriff so angry? Versatile characters listen to radio programs or recordings playing old jazz pop songs - such as Louis Armstrong's "Ain't Misbehaving". This is - what - rural WISCONSIN in the 1950s? And the characters demand music that could be in the 30s for Harlem's cotton club customers or New York's intellectuals like Woody Allen. No. The radio would be played by Kitty Kenny's "Fortune Fortune" or Theresa Brewer or equally likely by Lefty Frizell. Not that interference between music and events adds something to our understanding of what is happening under the pictures. Someone who participated in the production liked the old jazz pop music, that's all. <br /> <br /> Of course, you can only do so much with a low budget, but it may be in the meat industry. See "Ed Gein" with Steven Railsback to give an example of a much more complex way to deal with this crazy and desperate body, and a budget that could not have been much exceeded. <br /> <br /> These comments are based on the first twenty minutes of the movie. It's as far as I can. If someone thinks that this story is well done and exciting, it should try to find some understanding of their taste. It's under me - and I find myself quite twisted.
