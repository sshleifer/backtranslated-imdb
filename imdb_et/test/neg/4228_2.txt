This French film is probably a creepy, twilight policeman who is investigating rape and murder of a young man in a small town. But the film is not really something and it never lets you say anything. If it takes ten minutes to walk from A to B, the film spends 10 minutes walking and these are "action" scenes. There are also static frames that last for minutes, so the viewer doesn't know if he accidentally hit the pause button on the remote control. The script has enough material for a 20-minute movie. The film lasts seven hours. You're doing math. The actors were probably amateurs and it shows. Note to yourself: Dumont never sees a movie.
