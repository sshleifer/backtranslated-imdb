This thing that shouldn't be called a movie is almost worse than Manos, but you just have to see it as fun. If you see it in a video store, if it's a 10th anniversary edition, then yes, there's a special edition to buy for less than $ 10 when your friend borrows it, you just have to see it. Action is so bad and gore is so fake. After seeing it, do you ask yourself why they did offend the film's art? This requires your face not like the Nazis "Raiders". If you manage to see it, be sure to vote for this movie as 1 (terrible) so that it can get to the bottom 100, it deserves spot on the spot. I'm surprised that this is not number 1 right now.
