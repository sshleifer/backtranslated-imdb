Over the past five years, I've rented some bad movies ... utterly meaningful. See how I want to be a film reviewer, and as we all know, there are terrible movies every year. Anyway, about 3 months ago I rented it. I watched it all the time ... and yelled very much. This is one of those films that are so bad that he wants to joke. It made my stomach sick. I've seen a lot of bad movies (Mystery Science Theater 3000 anyone?), But it takes a cake. The plot was difficult to follow, lighting scary and sounds almost unheard of. If this scale had a negative rating, this film would be for me -11. It may seem strange, but I highly recommend it. It's something you have to see for yourself ... but don't tell me I didn't warn you. I don't think this review could be more accurate, so I've done it now. <br /> <br />
