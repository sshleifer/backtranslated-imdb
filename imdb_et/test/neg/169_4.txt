I think I was looking at a very edited version because it wasn't nearly as graphic as I expected - based on hearing from others. <br /> <br /> Other than 1, written by the same person who wrote the original "Emmanuelle" (1974), Emmanuelle Arsan, lead 2 is a sexually free spirit, and 3. when it is placed in an exotic place in Asia, no "Laure" has the same elegance as her predecessor. br /> <br /> I found this movie with just philosophical themes that I really don't care about, ie a voyeuristic and open relationship between Laure and Nick. "... something on this line. I can't associate it with the mentality and the film / characters don't shed any light. <br /> <br /> The other side of finding Mara's tribe seemed just like it was a completely separate movie. What I don't care for By this time I hoped it would become porn, so at least it would keep my interest. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just didn't get it. <br /> <br /> Ma I leave it.
