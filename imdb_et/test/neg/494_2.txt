I don't know any idiotic rock'n'roll clicks that aren't used in this movie. Ouffcourz, rock recording life is just sex drugs and parties and tons of supermodels are trying to ride with you. Tell it to foolish young boys. The filmmakers seemed to have read too many songs by Guns'n'Rose or Motley Crue. I've seen the everyday life of a regular rock band closely, and this film has nothing to do with reality. If you're successful enough, your life is a sightseeing visit. That means you're mostly on the bus and sleeping. Just yourself. Because you have to be fresh, sober and clean in the evenings. After living, you have little time to complete your performance. Then you have some time to have fun. But it is not a luxury or a dream. This film was artificially zero. Stupid and idiotic dialogues. The movie was funny - the main character left a heavy metal band and formed a grunge band! Yes, what is moral. Real 90s.
