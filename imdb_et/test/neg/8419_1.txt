I watched this video because I like Malta and this movie was filmed there completely. Very disappointing because it doesn't catch the taste or beauty of the harvest - just the hot, dry and barren elements. The film was boring, boring, completely inconsistent from beginning to end, pretentious and without any unthinkable plot. You had to be holy to observe the plot line or its absence. It was certain; but so goes to the dentist. In short, I rather suffer another colonoscopy before I look at this terrible confusion again. It was so bad, I really couldn't sleep. There are quite a few "Eurotrashi" films that were apparently made without adult supervision. This is one of them. The bright side, who is Nadia Cassini? Never before have I seen a more beautiful set of legs. He is one of the sustainable graces of this film. <br /> <br /> The disruptive wolf hunt, depicted in the closing credits, was also disturbing. Emperor who was released to someone's property (there are very few local mammals in Malta; all of them are small rats, bats, etc.) and then dogs before shooting. Despite this film, go to Malta - a beautiful, colorful island; rich history and fun.
