Dustin Hoffman's debut feature is not as bad as it is reputable; Spanish / Italian co-production, filmed in Italy with the director using the pseudonym "Dan Ash" (!), Is uneven, but generally directs and deals with numerous shady characters to search for the hidden $ 1,000,000 of the gangster Cesar Romero. who is on account of Elsa Martinelli and Hoffman for the third bill - expires before the next roll of the credit!). <br /> <br /> Hoffman's work is obviously not so much nuanced as in later films, but manages what is basically a friendly klutz - an American Treasury agent with an Sicilian accident (called Puzzu, which nobody seems to have been able to right!) to avoid stigmatization. ), which his company sent back money and said to remain "inconspicuous", but instead is forever in trouble - although it eventually seems surprisingly inventive when found looting, looting and putting the girl (Martinelli's daughter Romero, who is here somewhat wasted)! Still, the best moments of the movie are provided by the Suave Gangster Riccardo Garrone: In addition to his hard-boiled personality and fun to use the dialect, he has adjoined the trio of nitroites, who more often than not prove to be an obstacle to their various schemes! Given the story set in Rome, it is also strange that the case officer is a Spaniard (undoubtedly the demand for a co-production transaction)! <br /> <br /> Over the years, I have lost Hoffman's other Italian comedy several times - ALFREDO, ALFREDO (1972) - I think that Leonard Maltin only appreciates it * 1/2 in his "Movies and Videos" .. but MADIGAN MILLION BOMB!); Pietro Germi leads and observes fascinating Stefania Sandrell, the credentials of this film are certainly more respectable, and I hope that it will soon come back to Italian television ...
