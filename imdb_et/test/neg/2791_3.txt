The film begins when we see a huge drought in the 30s in the United States. Then a short story of a scary farmer Elijah, who was engaged with Satan to get a good harvest, appears. Elijah hired young men to work in her garden, killed them and used them as peacocks. He also fed the earth with his blood. Some time after 2 police came to visit him. One of them gets hit by Elijah, the other kills the farmer himself ... After that, a modern man and a man named Seaman say he has an old farm that has been left as a legacy. She decides to go with her friends to see what it is. Little Sean knew that the next night would be "Payback Night" ..... <br /> <br /> Like me, this movie was a good story for a horror flick, but low budget and bad special effects just ruined it. "Dark Harvest" is a great example of lazy movies. For example, we see a peacock (a normal boy wearing a funny, cheap mask) behind a girl. When he raises his hand, we see normal human skin over his glove instead of rotten meat. Gore is also not very impressive. Our "sweet" peacocks have some nasty killings, but everything is very cheap and unreal. Surprisingly, this action is somewhat OK on this flick, or better to say it plausible. There are also some nude scenes for fans (even the lesbian scene), but these scenes do not record. <br /> <br /> Decision: Good music, good story, confident action. However, with terrible effects, cheap gore and plot holes slow down this movie. Not really recommended.
