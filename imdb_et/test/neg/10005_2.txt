This German horror film must be one of the most strange I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I didn't know any relationship between child abuse and vampireism, but it should be based on a true character. <br /> <br /> Our hero is deaf and silent as a result of repeated beating in his father's hand. she also has a doll fetish, but I can't figure out where it came from. Her associates discover and tease her terribly. <br /> <br /> During the day, the dinner and the evening in the tomb and funeral home will break and drink the blood of dead girls. They are all attractive, of course, otherwise we will not care that he will tear his clothes under his waist. In the end, he actually ends up killing and it gets stuck with him. <br /> <br /> As I said, there is a very strange film that is dark and very slow because Werner Pochath never speaks and just spends his time drinking.
