This is the answer. The question is: what is the only reason for watching this movie? I loved her "My name is Julia Ross." This is the best movie ever. Noir or anyone who calls it is a very amazing film. That would be "Janet Ames' fault". It has a spooky, promising title. That's a good cast. He has a good director. I was waiting for something blind. Maybe something a little bit. Instead, it is an intrusive, routine espionage film. It's pretty much a complete cage. At least it was for me. Mrs Foch is exciting. And that's it.
