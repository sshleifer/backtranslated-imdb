yeesh, let's talk about craptastic.this is brutal. terrible voice duplication, even more horrible action and not noticeable plot.apparently have some big chase scenes but the problem is you have to reach this point first and i just couldn't 20 or so minutes i felt that I felt like a root canal rather than a movie. I think I could have transmitted it quickly and I suggest that you do the same if you do not have very extreme pain tolerance or masochist.i do not belong to either category. I still have migraine about this thing so I am going to do some dental operations without anesthetic just relive migraine.bottom line, terrible. 0/10
