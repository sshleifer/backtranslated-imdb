I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me and both had the same feeling: it wasn't terribly motivating and didn't even raise the idea of ​​what a training plan looks like, so non-marathons could have an idea of ​​what they were doing for their training and leadership would take. In fact, there was almost no technical information. I didn't expect it to be a technically challenging video tutorial, but if that information was close to zero, the film wasn't balanced and wasn't particularly helpful for non-marathons who were considering their first race. <br /> <br /> Other issues occurred. Some of the first pictures were people who collapsed at the time of death during the attack. Yes, real inspirational. The timing was hard to follow because it was semi-chronological, but filmmakers rarely gave you any good clues as to when you were watching. And they kept the information. You can see that Kantor has an injury, and you just assume it is all his training, but later on they get some scenes because he's finally swung around his pine cone in his yard. <br /> <br /> Some parts were very good, though like women who competed in the competition officials who wanted them to be just men, and the coverage of the Chicago race, where two runners who ran earlier won the first place. <br /> <br /> I have to think of other chronological documentaries on top of my head, such as Supersize Me and Grass, where you always know where you are and you feel they have told you everything you want to know. In short, it would not have been difficult to make a better marathon film, and it cannot be recommended for non-marathons now to educate and motivate them because I don't think it has such an effect.
