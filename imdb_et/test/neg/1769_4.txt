Usually Steve Railsback's leading film is a good film. But this film does not respond to this opinion. Lifeforce is below the average movie, which at first is very confusing (reminds me of Star Trek: TMP), but is able to bring things out a little when London becomes Zombie City. A fear / sci-fi confusion that is very difficult to sit around, although a naked space ride / vampire is very easy to watch. This film deserves a rating of 4 out of 10.
