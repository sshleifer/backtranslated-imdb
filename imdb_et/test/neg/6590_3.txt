Yes, it may not be historically accurate (in fact, only 6 9th rat soldiers were killed there), and yes, it has some bugs and exaggeration (bent machine gun? Come on! Or this "lesson of history" about how Afghanistan was never someone - An educated Russian officer who has captured history would be much better off - for example, a British campaign in Afghanistan). And yes, it doesn't have many millions of dollars in Hollywood-style special effects, but it is the strongest point in showing a soldier's life, in their relationships and feelings, when the best friends are killed in front of their eyes. In my opinion, the 9ya rat really does a good job of showing all these things. <br /> <br /> Again, the film has weaknesses, but I think it seems to be one of the strongest Russian films for the last couple of years. <br /> <br /> 8/10
