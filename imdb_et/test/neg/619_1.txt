One of the worst things a movie studio can do is exploit other tragedies, commercialize the "shock" or "gore" factor to sell tickets to buy their new diamond necklace. Another worst thing is to completely reflect the real facts of the incredible saga by making events, dialogue and pictures of the director's own wishes. Finally, one of the worst things a movie studio can do is to use barrel-based actors and shoot it all at the sound stage that was rented fifty cents a day. All three of these travesties, who are the filmmakers, are to blame. It's down to the hands, the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands. The '1' score is too good for this cellulose waste. Not only when the filmmakers are ashamed of doing so, they should be ashamed of the negative use of the story of the heroes who, for the first time, experienced this tragedy, both living and dead.
