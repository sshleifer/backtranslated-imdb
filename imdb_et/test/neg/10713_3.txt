During the three quarters, the story gradually develops into a central point. Although it is overwhelmed with scenes that just seem to be intended for the viewer's eternity and to attract him away from the actual plot, there is something going on. It is not much and it is certainly not obvious. The impressions of the palace and the scenes that drive the story do not produce any depth or overview of all the characters. In fact, they keep them sterile because there is no character development at all. Everyone is spinning and focusing on their clichés and role - a cute, general headstrong girl; fighting überwoman, snobby aristocrat. The men's head does not seem to have any difference at all, he is a low presence, which is not really important, because he is only there because the storyboard needed him - he seemed to be on vacation and got stuck. When it comes to changing the angle of what is happening, the movie first shoots for a few minutes and then becomes ridiculous. It solves - or better - dissolves - with the book Deus Ex Machina, more clichés and some crude equipment and choices I've ever seen. It's history, well. First, there is the drama of the film, although it should be a comedy, and then it becomes a farce. The main players do what they are supposed to do, and no surprises. However, the first somewhat serious antagonists are replaced by a pair that literally was just boring. Maybe it was turning to an audience. <br /> <br /> This film does not give me any bonus for philosophical meaning (as it does not exist) or its technical realization. Animation and editing are fair and so is the mixing of sound; but it is by no means outstanding or even larger than the average Japanese productions of the late 1980s. In fact, the visual places seem static, un-inspired and original. <br /> <br /> Worst of all - it won't work, even if you don't care about characters and things. There's too little here, and the rest is horny at best. Get a real Ghibli, hold a party and keep your fingers out of it.
