Director Delbert Mann was a much better director than this movie shows. He led the HIGH DAY OF APPROACH, ATTENTION, and LONG DAYS. This mediocre, made for Dicken's masterpiece television, is so bad, even those who don't know the often filmed story are happy. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that the film is only available from two well-known suppliers (Brentwood and BCI Eclipse LLC) for poor quality delivery and scratched and filthy soundtrack make it a movie that is not worth the effort. <br /> <br /> I've always believed that if a company is going to put a movie on the video and ask for public money to buy it, they should have at least a movie copy and do a good job. Unfortunately, neither of these two suppliers has such a work ethic and the result is only suitable for a discounted local discount store. <br /> <br /> The story is mainly about setbacks, making the movie episodic and talkative. In this translation, much of the rich detail of the novel is lost. Marta, Traddles and others are cut off and the relationship between the young David and Steerforth is not explored enough so we don't know why David would be with the boy. <br /> <br /> David's relationship with boy and young Agnes has never developed and it's hard to see why he and David finally get married. As Martha is left out, it's the secret to Dan Peggoty finding his niece. The absence of Traddles makes David a very lonely man. <br /> <br /> Some have approved this movie by shortening a long novel. I disagree, this is at best the book's work. Anyone who has seen the 1935 version of George Cukor agrees. <br /> <br /> In this version, fields like Micawber and Rathbone as Murdstone are definitely worth looking at. And the newer version of the Masterpiece Theater (April 2000) and Hallmark (2000) are both outstanding achievements in customizing classic TV sets. Simon Curtis and Peter Medak are responsible for these films, and they deserve the greatest praise. <br /> <br /> My Last Comment David COPPERFIELD 1969: Don't buy, there are many better versions of the movie available. If it is on television, turn off the channel for something else. It's a waste of one and twenty minutes of your life. Sorry people, but I can't praise this terribly bad movie.
