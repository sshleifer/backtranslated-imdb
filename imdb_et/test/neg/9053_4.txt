Eaten Alive is a small film that opens in New York and the Arctic, where gentlemen come to some people as a snake poison, then a woman enters the police area, trying to find her sister who has disappeared after 6 months Sheila comes from Alabama, but her accent sucks, she is with an adventurer who just seems to want their money and seems to say it all over the film. They're out through the Amazon only to find people with people and they find a sister, they find a sister, they're He's facing a mad man who's probably seen too much Jim Jones. He brings them to the right place, it may be in the sky, but no, Mark and Sheila will later find their true suicide culture. <br /> Why do I call Eaten Alive a "small movie"? Tell you, but when I looked at it, I had an insertion through all the cannibals, Robert Kerman has a different role from his professor Cannibal on the Holocaust. like russian roulette we know he is one tough guy.Plus strong misogyny just makes you spit and it seemed i saw it somewhere, oh sculptures animals kill each other.But the whole movie revolves around these scenes, its similar ones were actually watching nature's images together But after watching this movie, I realized that most of the scenes in the movies were taken from other cannibal films, even 2 characters, even from the movie. name it as a small movie when I discovered that the scenes were borrowed, I felt the disc thrown into the room, not a movie, but a simple assembly.
