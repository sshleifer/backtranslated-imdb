It must be one of the worst films I've seen in my life. I can't believe people actually a) write scripts like b) have a budget to make a movie c) expect it to be a success. The words can't even describe how terrible this movie is. I enjoy my fair share of teenage movies, but it wasn't even funny. In fact, it was funny just because it was so terrible. I can think that there is one (maybe two) part of the movie where I managed to even look out (besides laughing how bad it was). <br /> <br /> Renting it was one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made. It's the day I've seen the movie, and I'm still in shock, how terrible it was. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> 2/10
