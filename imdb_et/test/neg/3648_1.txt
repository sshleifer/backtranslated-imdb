A feminist tactic where the viewer believes that: i) singing is rarely hibernated, but attacks, kills, and eats (a line that is never attacked by grizzlies unless it is provoked) when "does not"); ii) Homosexuality is as immoral as it is in itself - and its acceptance is almost always related throughout history, when the disintegration and disintegration of society is revealed iii) Few women are bisexual (in which almost every woman has experienced no preference for men and women) iv) Divorce is much worse if infidelity v) the land is there for the people to use, develop and enjoy vi) the mother of the adult son is bound to keep in touch because it is the son vii) raising the mother of her son alone is a sad and real tragedy for the child viii) the idolization of parents is worth for ideals is a good and healthy thing ix) adults still bear responsibility for their sexual behavior, regardless of their age and commitment to participate in the most intimate and active activities of only the most intimate and open-minded victims: marriage - believe me, you are not going to like this movie! Basically, this is a companion like Howard Stern, brought down by Jane Fonda, a kind of woman (think The Electric Horseman). This is an ugly thing, because all the values ​​of the scenario, the ideals are so damaging. <br /> <br /> I share the other written objections: a) Why should this man lose every girlfriend - because he refuses to reveal that his mother's death and funeral could not keep him? It is a mystery why he simply says "it was personal" to angry and disappointed women. AH? b) There is enormous inconsistency (ie the screenwriter wants it in both ways), telling us that the main character's mother loved her all she had - and then later it was said that there was only one great love in her life - her lesbian girl. <br /> <br /> c) The underlying legal assumptions are meaningless. We have never said that the executor has the right to live in the real estate - only that he determines the law of the sole heir and the right to acquire the property. However, it seems that the film seems to be a legitimate rider - it is crazy. (Try to think of any executor who uses the property of a destroyer before performing the wills of the will - it doesn't happen). <br /> <br /> d) The premise of this film is that women are equally drawn to men and women - it's just absurd. So they say: i) Penelope Ann Miller's character is designing other men at the end of the film - after she has been a criminal for five years - and before her in the relationship with the protagonist, ii) that the main character's housekeeper after she's in her adult life devoted his kind wife - is now another woman, iii) that one girl who is disturbed by the protagonist "now would like to try a woman". <br /> <br /> iv) That man's transsexual is eager to date the main character v) The nature of Mary Kay Place naturally saw other college women ("and they looked back", she says with an idiotic triumph head). <br /> <br /> It's all just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I agree with others on DVD sound (I had to keep it to maximum volume and repeatedly rewind to understand names, phrases). <br /> <br /> This is someone who really despises the traditional heroism of every human being, hates the idea that a man needs to raise a child, does not recognize the idea that a connection between marriage and sex is necessary. The film is unpublished - and this false message propaganda does not sit well.
