This movie could have been great, but not. Among the talentless no-hopers and filmmakers who wanted to help, there are some light talents. The film's main character is a good leader. He's convincing and he's got these frightening Italian eyes. But he has joined the worst of the participants who have ever met. The scenes that open the film are one of the worst and most embarrassing. It looks like Gay Porn. Fortunately, no one was left behind. The alleged rape is garbage. The prison system was the best part of the film, although it was not appropriate. The movie soundtrack (if you can name it) sounds like the first attempt by teenage boys to use a cooler and some sample CDs. It's boring, repetitive, and extremely flat. In fact, the whole film is flat. Go out if you can still!
