Compared to the later ARABIAN ADVENTURE by Kevin Connor, this is a masterpiece. But it doesn't talk much. ATTENTION ATTENTION is a silly fantasy adventure where Peter Cushing - who seems to be strong - and some other actor (whom I do not know) use a giant digging machine called "Iron Mole". Road down to Earth's core - only to find that the interior of the Earth is pink and inhabited by non-human beings who have enslaved people. There's also a gigantic city that controls monkeys with telepathy, and we see it blinking around the film. Most importantly, Cushing and what-her-name also meet the lovely Caroline Munro underground caves. And here's what I really fought against for this little flick: why is that when Munro is in the movie, he's just getting around. 5 Minutes of Screen Time? YOUNG, MANIAC, DRACULA AD 1972, SINBADI GOLD VOYAGE - always in the background! How does Kevin Connor probably think we listen to Peter Cushing's fake call and look at the ridiculous ape-man whose voice sounds like a scratched cd as a look at the beautiful Munro? I can't get it. Please, someone directs a movie where this English brunette is on the screen all the time!
