I have this movie, I felt it behind my head. I have wanted to talk to people over and over again, but never remembered. now I found it. Now, finally, I can tell people exactly what is the absolute worst, toughest film I've ever seen in my life, the bar is not one. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete trash that is not suitable for landfill. all prints and other copies of this movie should be uploaded to a large rocket and into the sun. Only the sun's cleansing heat and pressure can clean up the materials that this film saves, so they can be useful to the universe. <br /> <br /> I like movies. I like bad movies. and yes, that's the opinion. but this film was a clean trash, dirty and some beast stools that should never be seen, let alone a human name. <br /> <br /> I look at the Uwe Boll Movie Marathon rather than watching this movie. and I hate Uwe Boll's movies.
