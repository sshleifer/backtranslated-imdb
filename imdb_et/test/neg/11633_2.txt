With a terrible sequel. The reason I give this movie two to two stars is because it is a movie that has violence and gore and critters, but it's planned badly. And this godly sequel took place other than BUM-BUM-BUM-BUM !!!!!!!!! Mick Garris! The cup that brought you the rebuilding of The Shining, which almost got Kubrick to discover his grave when he discovered it. Garris is also a man who brought you the fucking sequel to THE FLY, THE FLY, which was a great movie, but the Garrison movie almost destroyed John Getz's career. Anyway, if you really want to see that dirty critters are trilogy, don't do it. This is a mistake I made, rented first or third or better, but DO NOT ALL FREE! This movie was so bad that I couldn't believe it, please avoid it. Shame on you, Mick!
