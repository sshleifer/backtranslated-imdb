Ever wanted to see how low a film can drown? Well, look no further! This movie is all! Racism jokes, funny jokes, overweight jokes, suicide jokes, murder beds, drug jokes, animal abuse jokes, eating dirt jokes, old man young women jokes, cancer jokes, gay jokes, jokes joking, flat face over jokes, overuse of blood jokes, overuse of blood jokes rape jokes, pissing beds, alcohol abuse jokes, anal rash jokes, a lot of people who have their coffee back in jokes, jokes, nudity jokes, see who knows the most swear words in one scene jokes, lesbian jokes, girlfriend abuse jokes and the list goes on people! The worst part is: No one is funny! (Not that someone feels that most of these funny ones would start.) It seems that if it is not in the worst situation, it will pull your expectations on a completely new basis, as it seems that the viewer always feels worse than you. There was one scene that I had almost thrown away and at the same time almost completely suppressed. I don't think I have to figure out which one, but then again I'm sure there are other scenes that give people the same feeling. <br /> <br /> A movie that was really meaningful and was a little realistic, when suddenly one of the scene characters was beaten with a trash can and was thrown to the ground just to smash beer bottles in his head. All this probably when he deserves less. So all the thoughts of a 1-point redemption were held quickly. This is really a terrible movie. This is what you need to learn and deviate into small parts of the film school to teach students what not to do.
