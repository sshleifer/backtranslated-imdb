... And the boy is this soft <br /> <br /> I saw it on cable TV Bravo one Saturday night and here in the UK we often have those terrible "erotic" soft core films that turn to Bravo late at night. This is followed by a couple of college geeks WEIRD SCIENCE type graphics that create a virtual reality headset that makes you sexual fantasies. <br /> <br /> If you have seen one of these films, you have seen them all with a bimba that looks like they are advertising-silicone implants. Come on, I've actually seen the breasts in real life (I'm sure some of us are too) and they're discouraging differently here, where they break, if not physics, or at least gravity. Sexual scenes are these annoying things, where a well-rubbed geezer robbes himself of his letter without dialogue or sound after some musicals, and when they run, they both seem to have a bad constipation attack. The girls themselves are very beautiful, especially Brandy Davis and Nikki Fritz, but they are wasting this kind of soft core film. <br /> <br /> And if it is fantasy, I suggest the Lord of the rings trilogy
