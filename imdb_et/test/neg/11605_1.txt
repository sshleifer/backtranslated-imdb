I'm surprised that so many people find this movie even close. Let me explain that I am a big Hitchcock fan and went on my way to have as many of my movies on the video as I could, but what I felt was so down not just for Hitch movies - aw heck, I'm too nice here . It's really sucked in the picture. I don't care about Hitch doing a very talented Carole Lombard, but I've seen 50-year-old engagements more clever and style than this boring Turkey. Chemistry between Lombard and Robert Montgomery? Listne I like potato porridge and ice cream, but I wouldn't like to taste them together. I've seen better chemistry in the chemical industry on the road than here. <br /> <br /> If you really love Hitchcock, watch out for this movie and watch one of his best. To sound the sound, the bits of Hitch made the old TV shows more funny than anything that the film could not offer unhappy.
