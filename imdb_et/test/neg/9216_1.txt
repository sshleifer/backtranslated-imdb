I remember it many years ago, it was a pretty promising start, an interesting assumption, but then it degenerated quite unnecessarily quickly. Untouched characters, unsuccessful attempts to add drama and tension, and a bit of simple philosophy that was thrown away by all that culminated in a terrible ending. <br /> <br /> Just, it's a trash. <br /> <br /> Before I saw this TV movie, I didn't think I'd ever have the movie I thought was the "worst" I've ever seen, but after I watched it, I knew that since then, when someone asked me what was the worst film I had ever seen, I can say without hesitation - "The Second Coming". <br /> <br /> Avoid.
