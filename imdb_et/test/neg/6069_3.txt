I'm a music student and I was glad to see this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I was ready to walk halfway through the movie. I couldn't find any characters that meant I didn't care what happened to them and lost interest in the story. Well, Ed Harris seemed exactly like Beethoven and the 9th Symphony is always a joy to hear, making it part of the film acceptable. The parts where they talk about the bridge, too, redeemed almost the whole movie, but it couldn't support me. The participants did what they could do with what they had to work on, but the scenario was simply not enough to make it even more interesting. The little "wash me" was a complete garbage. I don't know how much the actors have to do (I can't say those lines without breaking the laughs.) Anyway, such a shame could have been so much better.
