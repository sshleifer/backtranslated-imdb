Disney-like entertainment with some Disney-like graphic violence and sexual references. Lousy comedy with clich√©-ride moralization. Noah like Abraham, Lot as his evil friend. Smiling special effects. Overdose that works with poor timing. Sodom and Gommorah were destroyed before the flood? Strange twists and too many sub-plots that the Bible does not mention. God, as a suspicious father, who must first lure the world before deciding, must be saved from the disaster. <br /> <br /> B-film wannabee director John Irvin adds another failure to his worthless poorly targeted movies that seriously affect the plot and direction.
