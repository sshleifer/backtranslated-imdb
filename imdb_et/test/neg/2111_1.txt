Can I start by saying I'm a fan of bad movies. And this is really a bad movie. For the first 100 passengers, he claims 3000 snows, but I think it's more accurate to tell 12 passengers and about 20 snakes. <br /> <br /> Snakes do not do anything particularly interesting, but the whole thing really happens. Although from time to time there are pulsating weapons and green goo puke (a very bad film doesn't have to be green), it is uncommon. <br /> <br /> But it ends and ends in quite a literal sense. you sit in hysteria. and for this, this movie gets up to 2 * rating. <br /> <br /> There are some movies in the world that you want to show to your friends so you can see a reaction from there when a particular event occurs. <br /> <br /> For example, the arrival of "Big Man" R Kelly '' trapped in the '' LINE '' 'Shark Attack 3' (you know it when you hear it) Mama's Shark's Arrival 'Shark Attack 3 '' almost every "troll 2" into the "Dracula 3000" scene (just a surprise belief and confusion) and the end of this movie is proudly in this category. It's worth sitting on. So drunk, stoned, whatever your poison is and watch this movie with some companions. <br /> <br /> Just if you like bad movies, get it, but don't get confused with the plane. "There's no connection. <br /> <br /> And don't pay more than a fiver.
