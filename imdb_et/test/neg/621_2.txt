Creating a movie based on a true story, especially as incredible and terrible as the 1972 Andean air accident, is difficult even for the best filmmakers. But the Mexicans may not even try this behind this forgotten and cheap exploitation! The real names of both the survivors and the victims of the Uruguay Air Force accident have changed in ALL, the crash is obviously very slippery, and the cannibalism aspect is unnecessarily and gorily played. Excitingly, it made tons of money on both sides of the border. Luckily, it has been thought to be mercifully forgotten. But the same people behind us would give us the same reluctance later in GUYANA: CRISED CULTURE! <br /> <br /> This cheap horror exploitation demanded the introduction of ALIVE about fifteen years later. This movie was a masterpiece. SURVIVE!
