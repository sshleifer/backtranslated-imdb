This is the real move of the mill's family movement, which I am sure most children will enjoy, but really not as much as you would like adults who watch the film. The prerequisite for the film is that the Belush policeman has retired, but pulls the case that will result in him becoming a private detective. The film plot is so obvious that most children will definitely choose to finish before it happens. But in addition, the story seems to be forgetting the story and the sub-region as the film progresses. It is related to the subkey where Belushi pulls out the title K-9. The one to be avoided is scared.
