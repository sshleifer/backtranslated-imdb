Okay, so it never changed the world, and it was bombed in the box, but Honky Tonk Freeway is one of the films I fell in love with as a child (the BBC showed it a few times in the 1980s and it happened that the machine has a high quality VHS tape - happy, that's it! ) and looked endlessly. I watched a DVD last night and unfortunately this time has not been a big hit. Whether this or I have grown out of such a broad and humorous mood. Come on, if Schlesinger laughs so desperately, he will give us news of the panties that are "fun" with the slogan you can cast or say about the scenario? <br /> <br /> It is certainly ambitious, interesting, unusual and sprawling, but it's never funny. I would describe it as a film for some adults - you can safely let your youngsters watch it, despite the 15 certificates. They don't get any drug references, so don't worry about it. I had a pleasant surprise when I realized that I forgot the song of the songwriter "Everybody's Going Faster, Faster", not to mention the Ticlaw Patriotic Anthem. The whole production gives praiseworthy performances, photography is crisp and captures the mood of different places and there is a real-time capsule sensation of fashion, cars, gadgets (especially dashboard mounted drum machine), interior and pop culture references - I was more than a little surprised when I heard that a bank nut has said aloud to everyone, "I am OJ Simpson," especially now, the Simpson's lawful ambush has overshadowed his athletic achievements. There is a cold, almost no plot to talk about, it's too obvious to be witty and not funny enough to make many genuine laughs. I wish I left it in a pleasant memory.
