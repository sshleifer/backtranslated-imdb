Yes, yes, I know I'm a whistle and I don't have any information or love for opera. I admit that I can feel different about this movie than I did. But I don't. So, for those of you who like me, leave it out if you don't want to look at pretty (sometimes dressed) girls. What's worth, I thought the first segment with Theresa Russell (who I didn't know) was the best of the lot.
