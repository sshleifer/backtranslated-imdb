I was originally excited about this movie and was expecting it to be a combination of Equilibruim and Farenheit 451. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the depth and lack of interest in the plot and sub-blocks. In the middle of the movie, I released fun between the characters and the sets to prevent it from turning off. I enjoyed the presupposition and independence of the future of united cultures and they do not. What could have been a visionary and intelligent look, has engulfed the semantic sci-fi midnight night scary, cheap kits and Tim Robbins vaginal final free look. Maybe he should stay on his socialist political rig - it has been downhill after Shawshank.
