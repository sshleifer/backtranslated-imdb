A sad, unfortunate but ununny satire of detective films, where the rock-faced Michael Caine plays a British author who speaks to the Mediterranean to help write possible gangster memories; he will soon realize that he is being followed and his life is in danger. Caine talks about a remarkably insidious and low-key sarcasm, but his actual performance is lost in energy (Caine's shrinking wrath or frustration seems not to come anywhere, and he connects anyone on the screen). Other cast members (especially Mickey Rooney, Lionel Stander silver hair and Lizabeth Scott) are doing very well in color-rich roles, although Al Lettier has an insulting manifestation of homosexuality (Lettier is offended without being able to defend) in itself, a viable position). Writer-director Mike Hodges has a good idea for a germ (satirized in the 1940s with detective films without hard-boiled talk and milieu), but he doesn't have a very sharp sense of humor. If Bogart lookalike - asking for some real leather - is the best joke, then this is next. ** from ****
