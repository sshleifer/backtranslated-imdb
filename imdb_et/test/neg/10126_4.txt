For the Kolchak-inspired series, it is ironic that the first attempt of the X-files for the vampire episode should get its ass. 3 I am always puzzled and - if I run the risk of sounding like a terrible Hans Keller, I have often wondered if I have a point missing. The story seems like a mosaic with pieces that don't fit in the box and as a result, you spend a cozy evening with a fire trying to match the sea to the sky. This incomplete feeling, no matter how many times you look at the episode and no matter how much attention you give it. I know this review puts me at risk that teenage vampires drinking my blood while listening to Busted are dragged into Whitby, but that is the risk I am willing to take. I've always been a werewolf man.
