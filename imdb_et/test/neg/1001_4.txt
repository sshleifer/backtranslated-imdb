I am a big fan of both Emily Watson (Breaking The Waves) and Tom Wilkinson (Normal) and I was delighted to see them built by Rupert Everett (Dellamorte Dellamore) in this shockingly small movie with all the ingredients. Scenes that are too short, in which he depicts a rich, infinitely right and valuable son of the Lord, are both on-site and entertaining. But there were very few chemistry for talking about the language of love. Music was a weekly movie-of-the-week quality and voice over jarring and utterly unnecessary. It is clear that for a small budget, a first-time director who lacked or did not have enough good advice. Too bad. <br /> <br /> I appreciate how people you hate at the beginning are the ones you like, and vice versa, so there is a trait, at least for perception. For example, Watson's character, being freshly honest to his wife, to feel his other person's feelings, began to come to an end, especially when he told his wife that he had no control over his actions, and later when he just announced that he moves back to his marriage without asking for permission, no excuses are offered. And I went to remember Wilkinson's control mechanism / moral relativistic character to understand and not really want to change him (unlike his wife). <br /> <br /> This movie barely frightened the "love story" or "Steel Magnolias" disease drama without giving me enough notice, so I missed out on the next plot twist after they Everything was revealed (Was it the Lord's car? The Lord's dog?) The scene where Lord Wilkinson visits and associates with how brave Watson is, the best sisters who die would ever ask, embodied in Florence Nightingale, etc. Was OK until he started a surprise like a baby, heavenly grace! If you ask me, he is just another brisk rich man who has too much time on his hands, and so he drives his hard work by offering his wife mad with unnecessary dramas. to take life; the man who died was an additional benefit to him because it somehow made his previous activities inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Look, all would have been better if Wilkinson had just left his secretary it seemed to appreciate him for who he was. Instead, he acted as an abusive dog, his open desire for the affection of his wife, which increased for every kick he gave him. I'm not an anti-PC or something, it just didn't call, even after we took into account all the harsh realities of middle age, which we all tend to face. For me, the ending (and not the director's intention I'm sure) was frustrating. The film spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just did not belong together, so I did not enjoy the promise of their relationship. I don't want to manipulate my emotions in the story, but it must be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed. Does it ask too much? <br /> <br /> My score: 4/10
