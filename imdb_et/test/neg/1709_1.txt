holy cute murder, this is probably the least funny movie I've ever seen. you can take that word for truth because it is currently playing on television. it's really one of the most miserable productions I've ever seen. there is no redeemable aspect of this flick. he just doesn't have any humor. the only good thing it may be is that it is so weird that it is completely unemorable. In fact, I just sat through some ridiculous sub-plot and I can't really tell you what went on. the only reason I might even remember seeing this movie is that it is so absolutely humorous that it will remain forever in my mind, depending on it alone. <br /> <br /> absolutely must remain. if your friend wants you to show it, shoot him and save boredom.
