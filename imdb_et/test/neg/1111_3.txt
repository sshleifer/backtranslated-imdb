The concept of this film is quite convincing: zombie children are climbing down an abandoned mine to seek revenge for their death on the fields of Pennsylvania. Cool. The problem with the film was the lack of creativity in dealing with zombies. The filmmakers could really have this movie in a "camp" with spicy images, such as stopping measures, backward camera walking, or such things. When zombie children walk through the woods, they look like 9-year-olds who play in the West Philadelphia playground. Instead of turning axles and shovels, they could wear baseball and gloves. Why am I afraid of these little kids? Anyone can just run on a straight line. Also, who would have been in their right mind for one night with their children in this horrible, hanging house? The moment I opened this door and looked around, I would have said, "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Son, go to the car start. I'm going to pee on the bush and then we're out there." Don't waste your time.
