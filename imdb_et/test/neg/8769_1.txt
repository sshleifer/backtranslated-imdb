An enticing fan of a Christian film and a person trying to keep a glimpse of Christian filmmaking, I was glad to see this movie. I was ready to see something that would make a new mark in high quality films. I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> The original scene is a great, albeit small Leon-The-professional, at an angle, it shows some great cinematography early on ... everything after that was pretty much downhill. <br /> <br /> I was hardly able to sit through it, I was tempted many times to just stop it. <br /> <br /> By acting, though quite sincere, it was incredibly terrible. But then again, the problem was the scenario itself. The dialogue was worse than anything I've ever seen, and even my amateur scenario "The awakening" looked like a Hitchcock thriller. (What's not to talk about.) The bright side of this film is that it was filmed with Sony's brand new High-Definition 900 camera that was shot with a 24x picture. This movie and Star Wars: Clone Attack were the first films that ever used these new technology cameras this year. Unfortunately, the performance of the camera seemed to be due to poor light, bad angles and inconvenient handling. <br /> <br /> The only good feeling I got through watching this movie was how good it was to see my film on the novice. ; ) 4/10
