After watching the first 20 minutes, I feel bad, luckily I went out and got out of the rest of the brain, people should watch better movies and be aware of why they are highly valued, not because of the budget or special effects of the movie, just good actors and simple things, and most importantly - Not LAME--, but I think it was produced for those Sheeple without flavor and not a clue about what '' Good Movie '' scares the evaluation of low films, save your undervalued high prices in '' life time movies ''. Keep in mind that many use IMDb for reliable reviews and opinions, do not break the broth in sugar colors, peace and love
