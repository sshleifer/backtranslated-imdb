An absolutely amazing western, containing crazy shelter, is the southern hell of the mountain, one of the first films to be released at Cannon Film. Comes with William Sachs, who later offers fans' favorites such as The Incredible Melting Man and Galax, the film tells a very golden robber trio stumbling upon two women who hide some secrets. is not worth the discovery. Cast (most of which never made another movie) tries to play, but it is hampered by a scenario that generally doesn't make sense. Shelter scenes are edited little and they are ridiculous sound effects and tape eyes. Ultimately, it's a lot to talk about and little.
