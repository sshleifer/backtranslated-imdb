This movie was recorded using a digital camera and it shows. There were also enough terrible digital tricks to sell the viewer, even with a terrible score. As if that were not enough, it was terrible. Now Hartley's films are always unique, but here it was BAD, especially Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan) and Harvey, who (thanks to God) can't say much. After all these external problems, it is also very unfortunate that the story itself is not so good. Jokes are predictable and incredibly simple, and events rush from one incident to another. The so-called housing book with Armageddon is not much more than an excuse to see that the actors are fighting for their line. All in all, it's a waste of time and money. Slightly down.
