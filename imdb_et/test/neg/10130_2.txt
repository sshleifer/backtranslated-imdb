This is what the Disney Channel shows to children who are bold as posts. It fits them well. It's not funny, the actor is the worst I've seen in many years, there are more stereotypes than the actors, and everything about this exhibition makes you silence and roll your eyes. Want to know why? This is not only a waste of time, but also the leading "actor" Selena Gomez. Jake T. Austin's character needs Ritalin. David Henrie's character must visit the striptease club and waste. The exhibition writer is also controversial. In one episode, a security guard is called a "gentleman" as one character and is called a woman by another. <br /> <br /> Hello? This is called proofreading and editing. Is that sometime, Disney. <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen a new "four-piece saga" promo? Disney wanted his Twilight and Harry Potter version. Except a million times the lamer. Waverly Place Movie Wizards? Think about it for a minute. The family goes on vacation and a 16-year-old daughter wants independence from her parents. SAMAA PLOT Proud family movie, etc. <br /> <br /> What's even worse is Emmies and ALMA. And most of the audience is some age 4-13 (and young teens). for several years? before selena gomez shows her tits? <br /> <br /> and Disney shows are all nonsense .. hack writers ..how show..destroying today's youth minds and purses.
