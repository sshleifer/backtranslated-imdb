A rather terrible company suggests a Welsh artist who has been helplessly drawn into a violent milieu that he knows best, but is unable to resist the fascination rooted in banal fantasy. The first story is tooth-fisted, meaningless faith in the B-film's sci-fi assumption. The other is gaining some momentum, but only by reducing it through the wasteful surplus that was visited at its center. The third and most hesitant seems to have been trying to be the abandoned sequel to the child's games. The direction is consistently uneven - all the rotating sound and rage who are the slaves of extreme environmental discomfort; stifles badly chosen music scores and indifferently flashy. It's just stupidity that disguises as guerilla sensitivity - both arbitrary and hollow, as abstract images that connect three sections.
