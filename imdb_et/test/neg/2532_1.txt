I just saw Princess Raccoon at the Asian Film Festival in New York. The gentleman introducing the film congratulated the audience for their fine taste. "You could be in Herbie: Fully loaded," he said with a smiling smile, "but you're here to watch Seyun Suzuki's princess raccoon." Audience praised and rejoiced. Well let me tell you I would have watched Herbie: loaded twice in a row. Princess Raccoon, supposedly lively music based on Japanese folklore, easily matches one of the ten worst films I've ever seen. It is so sad that because of her sadness, the other Seijun Suzuki films do not like, which is quite amazing. <br /> <br /> Princess Raccoon has so many things I can hardly know where to start. Perhaps the worst mistakes are both aggressively incomprehensible and outrageously monotonous. If the reels are mixed or half of them are lost in shipping, the audience does not know the difference. If you don't believe me, I dare to steal you and print that someone runs the rolls at random. If you can tell me what's going on where I give you every penny I have. <br /> <br /> In the first third of the movie, there are scenes, songs (including those that are not at all related in any way. A stunningly integrated computer animation is thrown away, adding another brick to the wall of a huge and rapidly growing misunderstanding. I'm not surprised to find out that the writer wrote all the Japanese folklore that came to mind on some note cards, put them in, mixed them, shared the cards on the table, and then wrote the script in their order. <br /> <br /> About thirty-five minutes of the film arrives at the scene. Something in the shape of a changing raccoon princess (human form) and a regular man in love, I was hoping it was a movie that is nothing more than an amazing set of scenes, but there is no such happiness, and the film continues in the absolutely amazing way I would. but I was trapped in a narrow line. In retrospect, it would have been a worthwhile scene. <br /> <br /> Ma I mean only the last roll. I spent every moment hoping and praying that it would be over. Every big dolly movement, the expansion of music or the scene that saw things far out, renewed my hopes that credit began to roll. For the agonizing minute after the agonizing minutes, it went on. And on and on. Finally, after dozens of false alarms, it was cut into what was certain to have an abstract pattern around which credit will be displayed. Then he cut another scene for any reason. How did I forget? A completely independent subspace for ninja capture, urination and boiled soup was not yet packed. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to get them back for 111 minutes, but you can save yourself pain. If you don't want to enjoy your memory or future big Seijun Suzuki movies, such as the Beast Youth and Tokyo Drifter, don't see Princess Raccoon. I'd rather have spent my time.
