SPOILERS FOLLOW - and I haven't even seen it. <br /> <br /> Let me assume that the murder is related to an evil real estate developer who wants to develop a riverfront, and Dickens was murdered because he was trying to uncover a similar dirty plot. If somebody who has seen it would have let me know when I was half right, you saved me the time it takes to look at something and the rest of us know that this film and its enthusiastic reviewers can't. On the other hand, it * sounds * intriguing; but if it were good, would it be * Sunday towel? And what experience does Foley have anyway? <br /> <br /> So I managed to sit through it as a public service. It is worse than "Don't let". Really. I've read stories for eight-year-olds who have more drama than that. Really terrible. And I was half right.
