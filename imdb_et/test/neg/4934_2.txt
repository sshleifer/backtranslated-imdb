I had a hard time doing it. Every single twist and turn is predictable. You're sitting there just waiting for it ... waiting for it ... and yes there is! Just as you predicted at the beginning of the movie. Or 10 minutes out. Et cetera. <br /> <br /> Intelligent Writing? No. <br /> <br /> Torture porn? No, no nudity. Other comments that call this torture porn are likely to be written by people for serious drugs. Unfortunately, there is no torture and nudity (yes, no nudity). <br /> <br /> There is no tension in this thriller. The only good part of this movie is the end, but I don't break it. <br /> <br /> I'll give him 2/10. 1/10 would be a terrible B movie. This movie worked better.
