I saw this movie a few years ago and a man I never want to play golf again. I mean, ninjas probably don't have any respect for playing golf or developing it. And I'm not talking about "without sacrifices", such as creating a scoreboard. No - Based on what I have seen here, they shamelessly destroy policemen and golfers for so consecrated country club reasons. Judge Smailes sprang in his grave. And do they repent for these sins? No, here's not what I've seen here, the typical response of a killed ninja to take over a female female phone repairer and look for revenge. I think it is morally deplorable and it goes without saying that after watching this mess I stopped not only golfing and talking on the phone, but also decided to stop homeless feeding.
