It's a bad imitation of Die Hard's franchise that just sucks. The low ambitions of the film are clearly visible when terrorists hold hostage hostage, and he must invite the White House to ask them to transfer money. In most of the films in this genre, the president was abducted or held hostage because, after all, he (or her) is the most powerful person with a finger on the key, etc. etc. was robbed? The honest answer is probably not. Why would terrorists choose the Stanley Cup finals for their activities and why, despite the many explosions around them, the audience in the ice hockey stadium has ignored the situation, unanswered questions. Let's say this movie is really a hockey, not a hockey. Those who liked the film and found it to be exciting should have a life.
