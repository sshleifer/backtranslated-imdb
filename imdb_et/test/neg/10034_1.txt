I saw this movie with my girlfriend. It was a complete disaster. In fact, you can see it cheaply made. Poorly written and very bad. I have read several versions of the book from different authors and also listened to one audiobook version. We could not take the film seriously because there were no elements that it should have included. The experience of watching it was like a Blair witch who visits green acres. Then there were parts that were vulgar. They show this little boy in the bed pan and actually show its contents. The witch throws the contents to the boy and the whole family laughs. I thought it was disgusting and very strange. I really don't understand why someone thinks it would be fun. It shows the second scene where Dr. Mize arrives, and Betsy Bell is urinating in her dress with her mother and brothers. Instead of being led by her mother, she is a brother. How ill? A little boy in the first scene of many scenes, dealing with how body waste eliminates, creates toilet paper, and goes out and makes those bad faces happy. I think they should have gone all out. Thank you James Johnston, as an older man's makeup, didn't give you that he was older. It made you think he was a fish batter. Blood from Joshua Gardner falling off the ladder is even worse. The scene of John Bell's death looks like they got out of the flour and tried to do something to make him look like a serious sick man. For me, the comedy problems with the bathroom were very bad and the inexperienced people were falling in the picture. These people would do better if they filmed a bathroom for local television stations. They chose a good theme and couldn't produce it properly. I appreciate this movie Capital F minus.
