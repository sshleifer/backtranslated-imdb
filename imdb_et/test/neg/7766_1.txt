For the first time I saw it in HORROR when it was presented as modern, liberated women. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I can't associate with idiots whose lives are around the unloved sex and Gucci acquisition. , Prada and Louis Vuitton tags. It is worrying that some may actually think that career women live in NYC. That's definitely not. These women are incredibly low and materialistic, and as the other reviewer said, they act like gold mining. <br /> <br /> It's not released by a woman and I'm glad it's gone. 0 stars and just perfect
