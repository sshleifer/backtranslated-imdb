Was it supposed to be funny? It's one of those movies that just doesn't work. The first, Bruce Almighty with Jim Carey, was some very funny moments. It had no one. <br /> <br /> Steve Carrell, who was Bruce Almighty's excellent, can't offer it here. His performance is very common and he can't leave it like Carey. <br /> <br /> One good thing is that I only paid $ 1.95 for that. It's a movie for kids ... for very young children who have only seen about 4 movies in their short life. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that when Jim Carey celebrates a movie and follows a sequel without him, it is usually a big turkey. Does anyone remind the Son of the Son? (IMDB's worst 100 movies all the time) Avoid this movie student.
