"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"! If IMDb allowed one word review, it would be for me. This movie was originally meant to be just for children and adults or older children to look at the film. Singing, the story, everything is boring and wash - just like this public print. Like other comedy films with roots from traditional children's stories (such as the horrible SNOW WHITE and THREE STOGUE and overpriced BABES IN TOYLAND), this film is limited and simply outdated. Now that I think about it, I seriously doubt that many children today find this movie even more enjoyable! So my advice doesn't look at this movie. If you have to look at Abbott and Costello, almost every other of these movies (except A&C GO MARS) would be better.
