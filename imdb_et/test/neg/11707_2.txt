Another Boleyn Girl - this must not be confused with the book she claims to be the basis. This film is not even close to faithful adaptation. I realized that they changed or worked out some things. The book is not perfect, but it was well written and became very popular. I can understand if the BBC wanted to make it a little more loyal, what actually happened, who really was Boleyn - but it's not even historically accurate. It's just fluffy. Pleasant, ready to fluff. Real shame. <br /> <br /> First of all, it seemed that the writer and director thought it was a good idea to set the story as it was in the reality TV show. Seriously. They have Boleyns sitting in front of the camera, recognizing how they really feel what's going on in their lives. Anne Boleyn sits in confession (not in the church, in the real world) and chooses what she wants to say and what she just wants to sit and smile. He feels that he should use a modern cinematographic device on the 1500s film. This is "The Real World: Tudor England!" <br /> <br /> Jodhi May is a very good actor and after "aristocrats" and "screw moves" I was a true fan of him. But she would never have been poured into Anne. Actually, I think he would have been better Mary. Natascha McElhone was a bad choice. She is a good actor, but she has very modern features and does not seem convincingly in the costumes of the period. (Honestly, I spent the first part of the movie trying to find out if he was "this girl" from "Truman's show." He was. Did Mary do from older sisters. There's no point I know. The BBC seemed to have forgotten that these people actually lived. They turn the story around and do things left and right, and I feel ridiculous to correct the BBC in the event of historical inaccuracies, but really! <br /> <br /> Besides the two sisters, the rest was actually very good. The great choice and casting was the real reason why I decided to look for this movie, a big mistake, she does a great job, but she's hardly at it. How can anyone pretend they're adjusting another Boleyn girl and hardly mention George Boleyn? It's just absurd, Philip Glenister was another very good decisive decision, but again it was almost in the final product. <br /> <br /> The real problem with this is the script. b. It is really bad, it's too melodramatic and not interesting. Anne is depicted as an airline, Mary as a leader and a follower of George. Mary's first man is not mentioned, his relationship with the king has never been explained - they just don't say that Phillippa Gregory wrote. The whole thing is very big waste. I don't want to see this thing a second time. I think I have to read the book again and I hope that next year's release of Natalie Portman will be much better. <br /> <br /> * Note: This writing is the only way to get the United States mini-minis on the last disc of miniseries "Henry VIII's six women." It's a great mini-series, but it can cost $ 50 to $ 60, and it's so much to spend if you're looking for just that garbage.
