Like the previous poster, I am from North Vermont and I loved this movie. But not after the "Red Zone Cuba" I have seen such a disturbing plot. Things people do bootleg do not make sense. Two gangs across the border send the other party in the car. Uhm, why? Then they meet two of you and hide at night in luxury Packard bad men. - Would not only two people on a flat truck make more sense? Then parked outside the garage, which keeps the targeted hook, four sleep! When they wake up in the morning and start pulling the whiskey, they are naturally noticed and shot, losing their valuable cargo in the process. Then two smugglers put a whiskey on the boat and swam across the border. Again, why? Someone whose big uncle really smuggled in the region was telling me everything needed to drive a vehicle that could cross the US Canadian Border Guard, which at that time was a fraction of resources. <br /> <br /> And don't start me in the last half hour, which didn't make any sense. <br /> <br /> The only good thing you can say about the film is that Kris Kristopherson has actually grown a bit of charisma over the years.
