Why was this movie made? What were the creators of this thinking?!?! The first 8MM film had at least a plot that was meaningful and potentially interesting. The first film concerned the snuff industry. This sequel is about ... hold ... porn industry !! Yes, as if you were a sniper film industry, an industry where people are killed in entertainment movies, an adult film industry, an industry where people are filming other people engaged in unpowered sex acts and situations at all. for eroticism. The idea alone should warn you about how bad the idea of ​​this movie is. This is not helped by the lack of plot, character, behavior, direction, script, logic, theme or even sound design. This is a remarkably boring film that has never paid attention. Literally does not work. Why should a mysterious thriller movie from the porn industry where murder and betrayal happen? I have no interest in adult films, but I've been watching them before. Why should someone film this evil and make it a continuation of the snuff movie? I don't even know if industry is involved in making snus movies, but I hope it is not. The idea of ​​snus alone is terrible and only people who are really sick and bad would be part of it. I do not believe that the adult film industry revolves around murder and torture. I'm pretty sure many people do pornographic movies instead of good intentions to injure and kill people. There is never any harm to someone else. Adult film industry does not hurt people. This is the creation of films, which is a waste of transformation and time for me. What does this film want to say? It does not work.
