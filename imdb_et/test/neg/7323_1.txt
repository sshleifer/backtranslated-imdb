Diane Keaton is a pathetic actor. He's so boring and fake. He's the same on and off screen. I saw her in an interview with Ellen Degeneres and she behaves exactly like in the movies. Her stupid facial expressions want to change my channels. He has been a couple of good films, but they would have been better than anyone else would have chosen for this part. Steve Martin didn't add much to the film either. He also acts and destroys the old pet. The ridiculous part of Martin Short plays only more idiots for the movie. I've tried to watch the movie twice, but both times I had to turn it off.
