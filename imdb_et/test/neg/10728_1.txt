Look at Dick's work. <br /> <br /> See Jane's work. <br /> <br /> Dick and Jane are married. <br /> <br /> They are successful. <br /> <br /> They have a son. <br /> <br /> They have a nice house. <br /> <br /> They have a Latino housekeeper. <br /> <br /> The host teaches his son Spanish. <br /> <br /> Son speaks Spanish. <br /> <br /> Ha ha. <br /> <br /> See Dick's promotion. <br /> <br /> The pompous executive is a cramp. <Br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Oops! <br /> <br /> Oops. <br /> <br /> Watch Dick and Jane <br /> <br /> Dick & Jane turns to crime. <br /> <br /> As a plot device, they decide to rob the Director General. <br /> <br /> Look at the robbery see botched. <br /> <br /> See the Dick & Jane Foundation Company Pension Plan, with abduction money. <br /> <br /> Yes. See the end credit. <br /> <br /> Okay, so you have a plot. In addition, Dick and Jane take care of one scene from another. One hardly combines the last or the next. The whole thing is terribly episodic in nature. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey didn't bring his "A" material, he just seems dull and a little ashamed. But fucking, if you get $ 20 million plus, barely. Tea Leon is frantic. I think I would not be accused of this flop. <br /> <br /> Dick & Jane is just about anything. Carrey and Leon are not funny and have little chemistry. The script is not funny. And it's not well drawn. <br /> <br /> But it may be bigger. Probably Dick and Jane's reality is a bit too real. Maybe it's not just funny that people lose their job in a situation like Enron, where there is no happy ending in real life.
