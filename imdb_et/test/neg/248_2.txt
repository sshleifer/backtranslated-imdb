I saw it in the Mystery Science Theater 3000, and even this show couldn't really tolerate that movie. I could make a better movie with broken video camera and action numbers. Of course, you expect awful special effects if you're an old movie, but I've seen better silences. Style has huge gaps that leave you with an opportunity to understand why they even have certain scenes. The operator probably doesn't know what a tripod is, and he had too much coffee or maybe something harder because the camera always shakes ALAS. I couldn't even follow the plot, but it's enough to say it's the absolute worst film I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: I saw some time ago Epic Movie decided to give this movie 2. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen!
