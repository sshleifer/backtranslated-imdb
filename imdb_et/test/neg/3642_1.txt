When I first looked at Zoey101 with my sister, we thought it was garbage. No one is so rich and living in a dormitory on the Pacific coast. At the show, Zoey is a popular rich girl who is always advised by her. Zoey is always a good idea and everyone agrees with him, no matter how stupid his idea is. She is always perfect, including her perfect figure. And he is such a diet freak he speaks of carbohydrates as he knows what they are. When he sees his friends eating chocolate, he confiscates it. And another thing that strikes me is that he looks every time you look at him. And everyone wants to do something about it, for example, in one episode where Logan's guy offers $ 4,000 to rejoice him and his friends in everything he does in his miserable life. And her friend Nicole is a very perky freak that screams a lot. And Lola sounds like a hoochie Houdini lady. In the 80s they wanted to have silver hair there. This exhibition sends a bad message to all children to think that if they don't have the latest I-Pode and designer clothes, they hate themselves. <br /> <br /> This show is big under your thumb. <br /> <br /> We hate you with Jamie Lynn, <br /> <br /> Ryan and Kara L
