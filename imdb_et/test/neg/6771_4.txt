I know we shouldn't wait for a lot of low budget indie movie. But the idea behind it is sound: an attempt to open American eyes between the government and the journalists who have to keep an eye on it. But somehow its documentary aspect takes this drama away. The protests at the 2004 New York Republican Conference were not so impressive to make a documentary. Such massive protests belong to the era of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> It would have been better to stay in the drama format. Perhaps a slow build-up, where young journalist eyes are gradually opened to conspiracy.
