This story was a good plot for about four elderly men sharing a deadly secret about a young woman they met 50 years ago. After that time, the young woman returns to look for revenge on men. This story changed me from time to time in the midst of the movie's tired lift music and ever so consistent thunderstorms. Ultimately, however, you should wait to find out who is the secret woman who keeps old men in dreams and intervenes in a young man's life. Most of what I liked about this film was the relationship where a young woman appears to men just before their death. Special effects were nothing. Every time I heard him call them, I would think, "Not again." But it was a good movie, I just want the pace to be so slow and not so tiring. And what I liked about the film was a setback in the 1920s, very authentic and costumes are original.
