I've never seen a story about talented clothes that have been so thankful that their golden goose hasn't been created. these rodent monkeys are parasites and bad examples of friends. I felt sorry for Troy when he tried to get all his friends out with Hollywood concerts, but as soon as things got sour, they all left to hang Troy. Overnight was a self-conscious effort for the man who went to the Hollywood forces to maintain the integrity of the stories. The simple prerequisite of the night is the transmission of the message, "look at this man, he blew it all", when in fact he has the next strong land, engaged in severe outbursts of friends and leaders all to get the project he saw. To be honest, the only productive parameter that none of these boys played in the firing of the Boondock Saints culminated in the first bar room scene with anything more than what they did because they weren't bigger deals based on their dirty efforts on the Trojan shoulder.
