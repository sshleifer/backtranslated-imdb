I saw this DVD on sale and bought it without a second thought, even though it didn't even know it because it is one of my all-time favorite books. As soon as I got home I drove to see it only to find disappointment. Although it is true that this film is based on the book somewhat, the similarities end. Signs have changed (ie Finny seems to be a pompous jerk as something else, while the gene seems to be somewhat mountainous), scenes are misplaced or completely changed (ie Lepper), many characters are missing and there are no famous lines / thoughts. The film tries to portray some feeling that the previous one was missing, but it is done in the weak ways that make a flat boring movie. It is the depth of character and feeling that makes the book classic and this film takes over these things and completely destroys them when rewritten.
