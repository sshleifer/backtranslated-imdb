Spiderman was one of the first comic books that began to change the genre: despite being a very well-made superhero comic book, the first series that adds a true psychological depth to the main owner was a complex moral issue, rounded by social and political issues. in other words: Spiderman was the age of a comic book. All these components are missing in this TV series. It's just a simple purchase / bad guy TV series that has obvious budget constraints that make the action scene moderately exciting. Spiderman nylon tapes are about as persuasive as Star track cardboard stones. Nicholas Hammond is too old for this role by then. I think she was well in her thirties where Spider, a man at that time, was really a teenager. For some pointless reason, the writers also changed names and deleted important characters from the comic book, which once again caused the tension between characters to disappear in principle.
