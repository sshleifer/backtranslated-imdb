I hate weapons and have never killed anyone, but even if half of the events taking place in "Shuttle" happen to you or your loved ones and you find a weapon, then you have your soldier. THREE TIMES. FIVE CORE. Whatever the pulse stops and increases on you. I think even God would say, "Good speech." Very 'Hostel' type, but more realistic? because it can happen to someone, well, if you're a pretty young woman, is it? "Shuttle" was a decent film, though on the long side. Some good shots (always call the AAA even to change the tire), basically just one surprise, but most of the time you'll see things in the future. And aside from the typical "bind him" instead of the aforementioned shooting, the most disturbing part was the revelation of closing one of the best friends. Getting from their past is enjoyable if it is. Basically, we have two unsuspecting women traveling alone from home in Mexico (wow, it's the original), and one lost their luggage, preventing them from leaving the airport late. And after the obvious hidden sign language scene, they enter the "too good-to-be-true" half-price bus ride. The Clich√©d shocks that were introduced earlier go on the bus to join what seems to be Alan Ruck's stunt at double speed. Here's obvious what's going on (I mentioned it was a "Hostel" knock), but still I didn't find too much terrible, but nothing remarkable. Though it would have been better for the audience about 15-20 minutes to leave, I would recommend if you had almost 2 hours of killing and sick fear.
