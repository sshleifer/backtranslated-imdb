A man that's a terrible movie. Like many terrible movies, this is a scary structure script. It is such a pathetic attempt on the psychological thriller that it gives the genre a bad name. Okay, here's one big problem: the character of Sandra Bullock is kidnapped by Jeff Bridges in his car in a busy daylight. Somehow, his boyfriend, Kiefer Sutherland, does not find one testimony of this action and then spends most of the film completely irrelevant in his location. Come on! Personally, I find it completely offensive to the audience in the darkest. But we are forced into this mess. Equally disappointed is the ill-explained motif of Jeff Bridges's activities. His character is a bit eccentric academic, but certainly far from the socialist who would do it. He goes through about ten minutes, gives or takes, beating his beans at Sutherland, why he has done his cruel activities. But the explanation does not even have the most basic logic. Thus, no intelligent audience can really believe in its evil potential. And if you divide this element from the story, the whole thing breaks down. <br /> <br /> There is also a big problem: -Jeff Bridges, using strange, pseudo-French accents without reason. <br /> <br /> - The whole boring sub-block of Nancy Travis, especially in his day of salvation, turning tables from bridges. <br /> <br /> A crazy woman who can somehow remember Jeff Bridges's number plate despite thinking that Lucky Charms leprechaun is real. <br /> <br /> -Sandra Bullock's character, Diane Shaver, fits comfortably to form the word "lost". Are you kidding me? - Logistic impossibility of drugs, rob and bury (in a very distant place) forty minutes (since Bridges specifically refers to). <br /> <br /> This is a movie that made me remember a fictitious, impossibly stupid (but very successful) adaptation of Donald Kaufman's character. Many scriptwriters are excellent, inspired artists. Some are just bosses who convince the studs of running nitwits to make their fire. This particular script is so amazingly dimwitted that Donald Kaufman himself would have been able to sell it. Unfortunately for all of us in the real world, Todd Graff actually did.
