MEMORY KEEPER DAUGHTER Kim Edward's novel was a very successful bestseller and probably more in reading groups than any other novel during its circulation. What happened when the novel became a movie on television? Maybe the mediocre scenario (oops !, teleplay!) Below John Pielmeier, which consistently tortures the uncomfortable pedestrian, removing the story of any sense of credibility. Perhaps it is Mick Jackson's cut-and-paste direction, which is skipped and without restricting character. Perhaps it will suffer under unlicensed source cinematography or Daniel Licht's "liquid tears" musical score. For any of these (or all of these) reasons, it will survive the novel-film as it provides a good opportunity to educate the public about the ability of people born with Down's syndrome. And that is remarkable. <br /> <br /> Dr. Successful Orthopedic Doctor David Henry (Dermot Mulroney) is married to the beautiful Norah (Gretchen Mol) and their lives change due to their pregnancy. On a stormy winter night in Norwich, Norah goes to work and Henry rushes to the nearby clinic, where David offers her husband (a doctor with a snow storm) with the help of her old friend, sister Caroline Gill (Emily Watson). After the birth of the perfect boy (Paul), Norah continues to work and (surprisingly ...) offers an unexpected (!) Twin girl. David and Caroline immediately acknowledge that a little girl (Phoebe) is a "mongoloid" (that is, before using the Down syndrome), and David, who has lost a little sister because of a birth defect, decides to send Phoebe's asylum application mentally challenged: Caroline must deliver it and Norah is told that the other twin died at birth. <br /> <br /> Caroline follows the instructions, sees the "home" conditions under which Phoebe is deposited, shrinks in horror and decides to keep the child. Thanks to a friendly driver, Caroline changes her independent existence and her mothers Phoeb, looking for her profession as a driver in Pittsburgh. Norah calls for a formal funeral for Phoebe - a thing that deeply disturbs David's psyche, and Henry's life only goes to Paul's one child, leaving the drowning pains out of Phoebe's absence. Norah presents David with a camera ('the lives of peoples are like a camera, this is where they live - in a room that has been seized from time to time) and David becomes obsessed with photography. Norah complains, drinks and loses David's attention, while David follows Phoebe's existence with Caroline - sends money and letters to Pittsburgh. Paul (Tyler Stentiford Jamie Spilchuk) is growing up, discovering his mother's unfaithful and angry about his father's lack of communication and understanding, and decides to fulfill his goal of becoming a musician and going to Juilliard. Meanwhile, Phoebe (Krystal Hope Nausbaum) has matured very well into a young girl and the way Henrise's broken marriage happens, and the air of healing in the life of Phoebe and Paul, with the courage that has supported Caroline Gill's struggle to accept the world-born persons is a film. The majority of well-known actors strive hard, but only Emily Watson is able to prove the reliable character of this dirty script. Jamie Spilchuk provides evidence of young actors with many promises. Dermot Mulroney and Gretchen find it difficult to create empathic symbols that make up what they are given. The film is confusing, but the message of Down's syndrome on children and adults is important. Grady Harp
