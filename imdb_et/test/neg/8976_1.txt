Frankly, I can take it or leave it on the death penalty. The problem I have with this documentary is that it is a murderer's complete love festival with no compassion at all. Wanda Jean's execution, along with this unilateral view, only strengthened my view that he should have performed his crime. He tried to argue that he was spiritually slowed down, but there was nothing in the video to support this view. He seemed uneducated, but so did his whole family, but that doesn't mean they were all slow. I fully understand that someone is against the death penalty, but to completely ignore the crime, as it wouldn't, and try to put Wanda in a moral mountain area, is offensive in nature and it is not an issue that I would associate with.
