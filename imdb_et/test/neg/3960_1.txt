This adorable dog (called different names during the movie) is probably loved by the whole city ... but he is alone. She is a two-child friend (Cindy and Paul played amazingly bad), but their father won't let them have a dog. Then Benji answers Tiffany - another divine dog. They (instantly) fall in love and lead the two hysterical assemblies that break the lawn, drink the fountain ... no less in slow motion! Benji also lives in a cleaner abandoned house I've ever seen. Then these two children are kidnapped by the worst, most uncomfortable robbers I've ever seen, and you don't know - they hide their toes in the exact house Benji lives! WOW it was bad! A big hit (for some reason) in 1974, which led to many successes (which I don't see). The movie is just terribly "humorous" so unpleasant and badly done that you just watched the TV in wonder. The film also has a song that is played during the movie NONSTOP - so much that you want to scream. In the Oscars, it was unexplained for the best songs - it couldn't. Yes - dogs are divine and much better than human actors - but I need more than cute dogs to interest me. but I saw it with my 5 year old nephew. After 20 minutes he missed the stupid and stopped basically. I looked in the hope that it would improve - it wasn't. Really weak - but very patient children or dog students might like it. You can't see it - you hear it and the dog survives, but it can disturb real young children.
