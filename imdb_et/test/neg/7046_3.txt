It's really a shame that this picture was surrounded by so many contradictions (in other words, the infamous thing between Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini), because it brought a lot of attention to a very forgotten movie. The story is incredibly slow, cheap and interesting. And to bring it up, the movie's climax is filled with amateur actors who can hardly speak English. I would have really preferred subtitles - it would have made the experience less exhausting. Back to rotten actors. The neo-realistic movement was great in Italy when making this film. Many of these films are absolute masterpieces (such as De Sica Umberto D., Children Watching Us and Miracles in Milan) because they got so much from professional participants. They acted like ordinary people, but in Stromboli they act like ordinary people who try to be actors and come very badly - like kids in school. <br /> <br /> By the way ... if you hope the film has a good ending (which makes time for the value of the movie), don't worry. The plot was just quite enthralling and silly - so much so that I really found that I could have felt less characters. Like the island they all live, this film is empty and without color or life.
