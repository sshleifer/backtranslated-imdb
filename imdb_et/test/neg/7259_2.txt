Other commentators have described this film as a "classic 1950s Sci-Fi" using smart materials and documentary materials and wise interactions. <br /> <br /> Nothing can be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a classic 1950s Sci ... but the most dazzling foolish of the 1950s SciFi. <br /> <br /> I think Mantis's first prey is a radar line that is first shown in the air, then in the ground. .. but the station is (aerial) in the picture like a mountain ball, on one side of the snow and on the other side of the dark ground, but when (on the ground) visitors visit the site, it is suddenly flat white flat, miles from the nearest mountain. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the highly recommended expert is a ridiculous scientific bomb that has been introduced to explore a great nail. He says, "Well, we know one thing ... it can't be from an animal, because every known animal species has bone bone. Even reptiles and birds have bones." He then says some creatures ... snails, crustaceans, insects ... are not bones. Excuuuuuse me? Let's define the "animal" here. Even in the 1950s, no one could take this man as a biological expert for more than six years because he does not know clearly what an animal is, nor can he name a variety of animals without bones (sharks, rays, jellyfish, insects, molluscs, arthropods) , gastropods, sponges, spiders, echinoderms .... you get the idea.) Characters are cardboard, 2D stock types ... scientist, sidekick girlfriend, big bad monster. There is nothing creativity here. There are no impulses, no vital signs. <br /> <br /> There are no clever dialogues, special effects are foolish for their time, and equipped with footage is used for continuity due to reckless continuity. It's the worst case of making a B-movie in your dead, manufacturing staff who can't be easily disturbed to try even half-effortlessly. <br /> <br /> Use poor science as a sleeping medicine or as a lightweight child.
