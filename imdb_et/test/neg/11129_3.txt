What a boring film. Although it was humorous, it was just boring and long (for a 90-minute movie). I believe the reason was lack of action. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, I saw that white blood cells are fighting against evil viruses, but there is no such happiness. It was more than the virus was defeated when hit. <br /> <br /> There was a promise in the movie, but nevertheless it wasn't for small children.
