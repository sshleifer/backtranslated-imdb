This movie is really a big trash that tries to look at itself as a Hollywood production. Silent story (stupid story of robots) ... ultra bad, affected by malicious pop idols ... and they're trying to "ALL" !! My goodness ... these unfortunate actors use wires to look like they are "good fighters" ... :( and I hate this arrogant Edison Chen ... the worst actor I have ever seen! Touch his films again I want to give him a negative value of ten ... even worth 0/10.
