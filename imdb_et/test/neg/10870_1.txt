This movie is so bad that it's fun. I looked at Hell Ride's half-thought that it was comedy, although I couldn't work out very well when they were really taking p * ss, or when it was really a serious attempt to do something decent. I notice that it is not listed here as a comedy, so they have to be serious! In principle, it seems to be about a group of pensioners who are driving on motorcycles coming to each other and exchanging the most unpleasantly bad dialogue you can imagine. In one scene, there are inexplicably two characters that break the bottles over each other's heads and then show each other the "get rid of the prison" they've done! See also Vinnie Jones's accent where hell should she be?!? Oh and there is also a naked girl load who seems somewhat unintelligible because she doesn't want anything other than having b * beats with these sexy skins! The man who wrote and directed it - the look of Pee Wee Herman with the Greeshan's 2000 beard and orange sun lounger - is for some reason a leader, maybe it's part of the joke, I don't know. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I am sure this movie is p * ss. It is produced by Quentin Tarantino and it is possible if it frees it as a little laugh. This is the complete removal of the Tarantino style, but it really is really bad. However, it is very amusing, and I think this may be the golden classic of the amusing parody of the style of Tarantino / Rodriguez or something that is very involuntarily funny. Must have believed.
