I love documentaries. Andy Goldsworthy's doctor was great. I was expecting it - but I was very disappointed. I knew Kahn and was interested in the idea that his single death in the men's room of Penn Station. There must be a story here, I thought wrong. The only story here is, unfortunately, deceived by women who had little to do with a famous married man. In the absence of an explanation of the dreadful behavior of such a man, we give endlessly repeated Kahn clips walking and painfully long - supposedly contemplative - in the frames of their unbound buildings. In fact, some buildings are interesting, but the film asks you to think for yourself. The transferred soundtrack refers to an emotional tug that is completely absent from the movie. Kahn's obvious gifts do not excuse her behavior or her martyr's lover. This film seems to want to give Kahn a free move for a great artist, and thus make the sympathetic figures of the director and his mother - I don't buy it.
