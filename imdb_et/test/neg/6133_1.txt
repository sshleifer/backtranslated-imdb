Okay, first of all I should say that I assume it was just a group of friends with a limited budget. With this in mind, it should not really be compared to blocking features and my rating would be higher. But still ... <br /> <br /> After giving this opportunity, it still broke some of the basic rules of filmmaking to such an extent that both the viewer and the amateur director was driving me. Consider: Blair Witch in your car, but really boring. <br /> <br /> Think: You left the camcorder on the dashboard and saved yourself in the park for the night, then watching your friends. <br /> <br /> The more frightening part (POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT ... WHEN POSSIBLE IS POSSIBLE) was to rewind the picture at one point and you might think you have to look at it all again. SCARY. <br /> <br /> Aside from Silliness, it's a pretty good idea to make small budget movies. But the concept goes very good and very bad, and we say it was not really good. There were just too many parts where nothing happened. First of all, I thought it was a director's plan - you had to be lulled into a sense of security and then things really start to happen. But ... no. <br /> <br /> I was trying to find good things about it (and I had a lot of time to think about it) and I say the music was cool. And I have to give a female lead credit for being around, looking really, really for a long time. But that's it. "Infected" gamers saw the zombie movies as fun. Or they got their motif from Bug, who suffered his Edgar suit from the MIB. It is possible that if for some strange reason you watch this movie, it is on a DVD or Tivol so you can post it if you expect something to happen too complicated. <br /> <br /> I hate to be so critical, but at the same time I've been watching many similar movies and nothing has ever been painful. If they just started off for one and a half hours and added some frightening things, it might be decent. Maybe it's director cut ...
