Of course, the above remarks made the film a movie by someone in the team. I never remember seeing a movie that is more offensive to talented actors or audiences. While watching my 30-year-old movie, it's the only one I've ever gone out of. Bad humor, bad jokes, bad gags, bad editing, bad piece, etc. <br /> <br /> Note to the producer: It is never funny to hunt racial people. Great, you were trying to politically correctly involve all the races, but you're still hunting for the race and it's sick.
