I almost laughed loudly when the director said in a comment that the film was strong, with a strong plot line. In this blah movie, there is no repetitive one original plot line or special effect. <br /> <br /> Crows ... Hitchcock did it well before CGI, and even with CGI, this movie doesn't match well. Shy creepy boy ... Grudge did it and did it better. Psycho ... done at Cold Creek Manor recently, but it's done for death. Not intended. Separated / Rebellious Teen Who Nobody Listens ... About a dozen movies have used it for Beetlejuice. Cheerful things from the basement ... can you say the horror of Amnityville? Doors open without banning ... What lies below, it made a lot more elegance. Shameful farmhouse ... to mention too much. <br /> <br /> The background of metaphysics, which should have been at the center, will be lost if you think what is happening, which, by the way, is about to begin. <br /> <br /> One thing (in fact, many) they never try to explain in the movie how they explain to the police that their attacker was asleep in the basement so they didn't really have the body. <br /> <br /> In general ... DO NOT otherwise
