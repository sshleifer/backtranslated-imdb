I was recommended to one of my filmmakers for this film and so I was expecting something good. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the first half - ah, about a movie that saw wimpi revenge on his hole boss, as original - and I looked quickly at the other half, hoping to find something that would justify 45 - If the minutes had already been wasted. But all I got was "shock" ... <br /> <br /> The main problem is that it is a movie that can't decide what it wants to say and says what it says (hard to say what it is) badly. Great action doesn't save a bad script that is full of characters I don't care about. <br /> <br /> Now that I do not have a month in the film industry, I would be surprised to discover a stupid policy and exploitation behind the screen, but as I am feeling, the above summary is "Ho Hum". <br /> <br /> 2/10 ... would have been 1/10 if there was no operation and a paper cut scene.
