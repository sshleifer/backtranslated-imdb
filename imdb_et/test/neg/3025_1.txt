Good lord. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you a bat right now, I only looked at 20 minutes of this movie. Since I'm a hardcore Eraserhead fan, "what, you can't watch plenty of black and white movies with a little-to-dial dialogue?" protection does not apply. I just can't look at TERRIBLE's wonderful black and white movies with a little-to-dial dialog. <br /> <br /> This movie is what happens when you give a talented goth child who has no talent and something to say and budget, and let him / her display as many meaninglessly offensive images on the screen. From the very beginning, it was clear that this film should have been 5 minutes long (assuming it should exist at all). The shots that should last for a few seconds will drag for a minute, as the director has the event "I-Just-Love-The-Sound-Of-My-Ow-Voice" and refuses to cut another picture until all the footage is viewed. From the moment the girl in the mask started "God" (the joy of opening the movie!) Body masturbation, I knew it was only a matter of time until I turned off the tape. At least 10 minutes after the second body was pulled around, I pulled the rope on the robbed mystery-men, I knew it was time to give up. I rarely give up the movie. I sat all over Blair's sorcerer 2 through the Book of Shadows, though not happily. It doesn't deserve the 20 minutes I gave. <br /> <br /> If you're an Eraserhead fan, DON'T give simple thinking a comparison with that movie about renting this amateur trick. Let me guide you to Tetsuo: Iron Man, a traceable and enjoyable piece of inconsistent black and white strange.
