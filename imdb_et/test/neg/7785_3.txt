I hate a movie that has no end. I don't care how good or bad the rest may be, I don't want to miss out on the conclusion. Such exhibitions should require giving up ... something like this: the movie you are watching is not over or it is so unclear that it is not final. <br /> <br /> In the movie, the last scene we're staying with is Dee and Dominic, who have a bit of a line, and she's almost unfortunate that I didn't get her because my fingers were either girls or kids. HOW TO END! Definitely a smoking gun in Dee's son, but what is Dominic's daughter? I thought we could find that it was him! Anyway, if you don't like unclear movies, I will avoid it. Otherwise, I thought the film was generally good.
