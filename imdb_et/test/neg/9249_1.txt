Action is awkward and horrible, not good. Literature, dialogue and chemistry between participants are terrible. Nothing is reasonable and the close-up of each participant's expression or reaction lasts 3 or 4 seconds too long, so it seems to be a Mexican soap opera (telenovela). Everything about writing is unrealistic and all involved parties make the script much worse with translated interpretations. Am I the only one who sees it? Using the word "cheesy" to describe the Canadian catastrophe would be an underestimation of the century. Did the director even follow the final paragraph before it was aired?
