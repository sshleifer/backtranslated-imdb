This is a completely forgotten picture. My friend chose this cheap box at a local rental location of $ 0.50. He should have demanded a refund. Or at least a discount. <br /> <br /> The plot is something like this: A giant monster is threatening the land and aliens decide that the planet's most average person must be chosen to save the land. Thus a small holographic space alien appears in front of the postman and tells him that he is "." <br /> <br /> The devil is in the detail when it comes time to rate the movie, and on this census Zarkorr! Invader fails. Monster Zarkorr has only a few short moments on the screen, which can total 5 minutes (high ratings). The cute alien hologram has even less screen time and this can be the most interesting thing to look at, and only because she wears a teeny bopper stereotype outfit with a tiny short pleated skirt. The climatic final struggle with the monster has ended before you can say, "Whisk Tango Foxtrot, over." The next time you are left wondering if you have just experienced a train wreck or if someone just emptied you three pins of blood. <br /> <br /> Although this film gave one line that my friends and I still repeat and laugh at, and was in this only bright place in this otherwise abysmal picture. Since casting "main characters" is "questioned" from fuzz, one of them answers the questions "What are you, an interviewer?" It is extremely understandable that if you sit with a group of friends (who are not your friends when you actually spoke to your friend when you look at it), maybe you might experience an itch or two incredible laughter. Although it is not Manos or Eegah (not even bad enough to be classically bad), this film still suffered from its terrible dialogue, unimaginable characters and non-existent special effects, and still deserves to live 100. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
