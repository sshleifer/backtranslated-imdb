The film was pretty bad. This is not so much a script problem. It's just that the movie is really boring. The film just seems to be a slow, tortuous speed. The story of San Franpsycho is that loose, who kills morally corrupt individuals (maybe I read too much, but hey, it's my essence probably), is a serial meter after San Franpsycho kills a few people under the golden gate Bridge, which we introduce the film to one of the main characters: Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's brother) as Bill Culp. Bill is trying to divide the killer now (seriously, he doesn't have a name, he's just a killer), and he's trying to force local news reporter Rita to help him investigate, Bill is a stereotypical sharp policeman and he threatens to throw him at jail to prevent justice from being jailed. Anyway, a couple of scenes are moving and Rita is again on the psychopath left behind (She is a cold-blooded psychopath!) And she has a change of heart and tells Bill and his partner Joe and helps them to help with the investigation. <Br>> <br /> The film is trying to be a tedious murder thriller, but this kind of simply fails. It is similar to the movie "Black Dahlia", which he is trying to be tense, but it is simply incredible. The film tries to be serious, but it has scenes where The Killer masturbates (probably a gore porni fan, such as "ooh blood" or something on it) and Joe Estevez hits the table: "He's a cold-blooded murderer!" There is more than once a hit, although I'm sure it was a deadly serious movie. <br /> <br /> One of the only positive points the film has made for this is fact. that I didn't pay the money to see it (huzzah netflix). And it is sad because I saw good things in my films after watching The Damned. Of course, the film had a fair share of errors, but it was enjoyable. Unfortunately, San Franpsychol is nothing. It's not too big, but it may be interesting. Instead of what you get, the murder is a thriller that does not burn or even get unpleasant deaths. Other reviews also claim that the film has a "big twist", which is shocking, apparently I watched another movie because I thought about what would happen in about an hour. The end did not shock me the least. I would like to insult this wreck of the movie, but I don't think I will. Short Story This movie is a boring uninspired thriller (I use the term loosely), which has no "Hitchcockian excitement", which another reviewer claims to have a predicted end, an empty death, acting on the entire wood board emotion and a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I am sure others are trying to protect it with normal protection: it was a low budget movie, they did the best with a low budget, and everything else. But when you get to it, there was very little that they would have actually spent that budget, very few special effects worked, the soundtrack sounds like it could have died from dead dead or dead, and it's the same movie team. This movie reminds me of a lot of other little estimates that were not good, and it was called Mr. Jingles, these two are about the same quality, they can't offer anything close to pleasure and should disappear quickly.
