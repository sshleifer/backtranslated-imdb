Post in 1988 after the disaster, GJS Amitabh's films lost their previous quality. <br /> <br /> The MAIN AZAAD HOON blockade in 1989, which was an excellent film holiday, was mostly released with the exception of HUM (1991) and later in 1991. /> <br /> This is one of Amraph's films that was rejected in the early 90's. <br /> <br /> The film he made as a sign of friendship with Shashi Kapoor, who directed the film and didn't take the penny. The film also included Rishi and Dimple (again, the couples were not linked after RANBHOOM). <br /> <br /> The film came in 1991 when Bachchan had 4 editions and 3 flops among them, INDRAJE, AKAYLA, AJOOBA <br /> < br /> Ajooba came 2 years after TOOFAN and JAADUGAR both supernatural films that were rejected. This is another type of nonsense Bachchan wears a mask and Krisshi-style clothing and fills a magical change for 1 person donkey.etcle. special effects, but the movie is too bad to watch it. Shashi Kapoor's direction is not good Musi c is bad <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Amitabh had become too old for 1991 and it seemed tired, his behavior was okay, but not in the best way for his best Rishi is okay Dimple's okay , the vacation is forgotten
