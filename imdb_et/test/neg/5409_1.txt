If you want to get a couple of brief insights into the splitting of an attractive woman, there may be a second or two enjoyment of this movie. If you like to see poorly designed and executed scenes, there are many. If you are both blind and deaf, I suggest you not use this movie in your presence. This is definitely the worst or very close to the worst movie I've ever seen. And it seemed to be money. Talk about throwing money! As an editor, I hope that the editor (s) for this "movie" will never be able to edit a movie, book, or even post-it note. As a writer, I hope the author (s) will never let the broken pastel. You think I don't recommend watching this movie. Not so. Record it (so you need to interrupt the pain) and educate yourself on how bad the movie is.
