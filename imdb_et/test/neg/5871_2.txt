This is one of the movies you will find when you are too late and you only have the main cable. It's hard to believe that this movie was made in '95. In the year, out of the late 80s. Diverse home-grown youngsters are faced with demented ice cream with a man on a mission to make the best taste: Soylent Cream !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is extremely demented and is only scary if it is horrible and absolutely, ridiculously large. In fact, the really frightening thing about this film is the nature of the children they see at home. The fact that these children do not get out of their quiet suburban suffering makes the neighboring random creatures in the park. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous part of this movie is that the stereotypical "Fat Boy" is so plainly thin that there is a paddling mountain range between his bags. I think either: a) they did not find / could afford the fat, b) the election director was too lazy to find a child or c) we have honestly thought that this child is hungry and has an enormously expanded belly. <br /> <br /> So if you are at 2 o'clock in the morning and need something ridiculous and nasty to hang out with your running friends, go ahead and see. I personally sleep.
