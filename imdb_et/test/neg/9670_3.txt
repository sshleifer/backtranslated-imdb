After seeing Shootfighter 1 and the blood vessel they were throwing, I was ready for a second revenge in the open heart massage and chiropractic cage. But nooooooo, it was like the Barney version of the first movie, Karate's boy with that camera. At least Bolo Yeung still gets the catch, although he has to make more movies like Bloodsport and Caddyshack.
