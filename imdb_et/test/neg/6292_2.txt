The terrible British film of the Japanese novel is a very worrying young man under the influence of Hitler's classmate and plots to harm his loved mother's lover. A couple of good scenes (Sarah Miles, who discovered her son, hiding her and hitting her with anger, a pasty boy trying to push Kris Kristofferson to her friend, but what's the point of provoking a shock?) Ugly and uncomfortable, it doesn't show anyone involved no advantage (especially Kristofferson, whose hollow tube and the usual gravel speech is like the psychological mishas). Coldly, without any sense of absurdity, director Lewis John Carlino seems to believe that this might actually happen. If he's right, it's much more shocking than anything in Sailor. * from ****
