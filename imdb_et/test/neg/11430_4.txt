Irvine Welsh's follow-up to Trainspotting reaches the screen for three short readings, located in Edinburgh, all with a Welsh brand, drug culture, depression, working class and Hibernian football club. Not uncomfortable when looking at places is not only very well written, 2 of them with a comic twist in their darkness, while the second story is a serious (and shockingly realistic) plot. Don't turn to most, including myself, but I will certainly accept the cult.
