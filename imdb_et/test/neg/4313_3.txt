I have read other user comments and I am happy that someone has compared it with Kamal's 2004 original Perumarzhakalam. <br /> <br /> The original had a dense story and loopholes, as described above for Indian Govti, who do not have proper documents or even bad shoots and dragons. <br /> <br /> The story is great and the other is very clean and well described. But unfortunately, Nagesh, who takes his story for this, is a sad thing and is nothing but plagiarism. <br /> <br /> I think he was influenced by Bollywood's so-called "inspired" syndrome. <br /> He must at least give credit where it is required. <br /> <br /> I liked some of her older movies, but now I suspect that if any of them were originals, then everything. <br /> <br /> Here is the link in the IMDb for the original masterpiece. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425350/#comment I recommend everyone to see the original even with subtitles to find out the class direction and class display.
