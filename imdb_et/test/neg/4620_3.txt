I have a affection for these British social norms and it is rare for me to lose. But our Betters lost me a bit. This is the story of social climbing tools and their joy of breaking the rules, but personally I found it a bit boring. <br /> <br /> I liked the Duchy, although she blews too much and Constance Bennett plays the role of Lady Greyston, a role Bette Davis could have played back. <br /> <br /> But the movie comes alive when Ernest joins the party in the third work. She is so lively and fun (and actually, apparently, wearing more makeup, then Lady Greyston). She gets the last line of the movie and it's gas!
