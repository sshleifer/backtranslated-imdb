I know this movie is a low-budget horror movie designed for those who are in favor of strokes and "cheap" gore, but even given that this film is too empty, full of inconsistent plot with terrible music and obvious signs that this movie is not never finished. <br /> <br /> Without spoilers, it is said that by the final reel, things are without explanation, whether film or story. Girl Anitra is really attractive, but that's not a good reason to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of these 60's and 70's gore movies, you should watch it, but warn that it will not even reach the usual plateau of such films.
