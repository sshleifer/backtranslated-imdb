The brilliant Australian comic genius Barry Humphries was a rare failure with this uneven and occasionally misleading comedy that was fired after a few days. Drunken, lecherous Australian diplomat Sir Les Patterson randomly fired the Arab potency at the United Nations and has been posted to his tiny country as a punishment coming just like a palace coup, placing a new leader (the American soap star Thaao Penghlis) on the throne. Sir Les, Dame with the reluctant help of Edna Everage (both played by Humphries), almost randomly fixed a new driver scheme to release a deadly, nasty, AIDS-like virus in the West. Joan Rivers is the US President of the United States at his desk "President Rivers"! The extreme bad taste mixes with slapstick and Humphries' usual miserable satire, which is much more fun than it is together. Dame Edna's TV fans may be overwhelmed by the presence of another Madge Allsop who is not familiar with Emily Perry's wonderful comedy magic. The film was written by Humphries and his third wife, Diane Millstead, and led by Mad Maxi man, George Miller. The fans of Humphries love me very much. All others, be careful.
