I'm surprised by the number of people who have rated this entry as their favorite "Chan" (have they ever seen "... at Opera" or "... Treasure Island?" Ironically wrote John Larkin who dropped the ball here). This plot is a wreck of the train and overwhelmed with meaningless letters. First of all, viewers are obliged to remind Steve McBirney (who is a respectable thug and HUAC squealer Marc Lawrence) of 1929 murder charges. Let us not forget that he escaped from the murder of the courthouse alone with the policeman in the crackdown on capital. There is also a victim who was caught out of the river 11 years ago that no one seems to be concerned. Then it is necessary that all beliefs remain invisibly in the wax museum (although Inspector O'Matthews can keep his fat in the back of the window). Why is Joan Valerie (Cream's assistant) in this movie? He can't even handle the pliers properly --- I know Chan suffers the same boo-boo, but yeeshi, he's 66 years old (and he has less than 10 rows --- and his character's motivation is too weak to never be "sorry (if I apologize when I write like Ricky Ricardo) the character of Mary Bolton (Marguerite Chapman) is written as an enthusiastic, wide-ranging moron, apparently only exists for the romantic interest of horndog lawyer Tom Agnew (played by the fret face Ted Osborne) Why Willie Fern why not McBirney's henchman from 8:20 (not a spoiler, ok? tape IQ manages to dress up or why he hadn't taken the buses a year ago, Toler has been given a slightly more active rope than a normal (plus) and real defendant goes to designer Thomas Little and operator Virgil Miller, who created a really horrible atmosphere ... but this item is less logical than the Ritz Brothers movie. a blow gun.
