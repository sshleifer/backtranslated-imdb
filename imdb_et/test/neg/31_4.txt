Watching this movie was painful, he really did ... I wanted to like it, even going there. Looking at very little money, I saw the past and said I appreciate inspiration. Unfortunately, even though I appreciated the film at this level, it was an exemplary and edifying thing, and the last 25-30 minutes were heavy thumbs. The 95-minute movie shouldn't be dragged. Its ratings are still good, but I'm afraid that friends and family might have had a say on this. What was their transition? Dear editor, did you just buy your first copy of Adobe Premiere and did this main purpose to use all of the rumors that accompany this stupid program? Anyway ... some better actors, a little more passion and some more attractive edits, and it makes a decent movie.
