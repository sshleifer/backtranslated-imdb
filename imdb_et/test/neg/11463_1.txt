I understand that most people do not know who Solomon Kane is and that the film is a much larger audience. But why not barely call it "Solomon Kane" if the name is not marketable? Certainly, characters are not characters in R.E. Howard's character. Except if he has a big hat. Then the similarity ends. <br /> <br /> This is always a bad sign if a superhero / fantasy / sci-fi movie is a story of origin, but if you invent one of those fabrics for a character that didn't. You have nothing at all, you have missed this point completely. Kane is no longer a fanatical Christian warrior of stories, but rather a former bad guy trying to save his soul (this part is in the opening plan). <br /> <br /> With the most basic elements changed or simply ignored, the use of Solomon Kane is simply puzzled. Is it just that they can say, "From the creator of Conan", and I hope that the new "Conan" will be out of the ground? By ignoring the complete deviation from the stories, the film is competent if it is completely common for the first semester, but then it appears in a climate image that includes several super baddies (at the same time think of three "superior levels"), and none of which is less interesting or less interesting. menacing. <br /> <br /> If I wasn't a Kane fan who was disappointed that they ignored the source material completely, I would probably give 1 instead of 3 or 4 even to (most) viewers who come to know Kane without knowing it this is quite thin.
