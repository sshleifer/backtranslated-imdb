I just went to see this movie with a friend. I looked quickly and read the summary and thought it sounded interesting. We came up with movies that didn't really know if we liked it. <br /> <br /> Operation was good enough and the link between characters was OK. The main character I thought was a lot like someone like Van Helsing. Yes, it was quite fun. <br /> <br /> But I thought the land was used in other films. The script was a bit weak, I'm not sure why every time something bad happens, the main character says "Oh my God" every time. <br /> <br /> Special effects worked well, but (sorry for that) spoiler) The main monster at his main peak reminded me a lot of rings from Lord Balrok. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was OK, but I felt it was already done. Go and see all the tools, but don't wait too much.
