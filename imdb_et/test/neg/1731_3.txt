My summary points to the fact that this film has 1479 voices - just 21 short periods to make it on the IMDb's notorious Bottom 100 list - 100 of the lowest rated movie websites. With a score of 1.8 alone, it would skip the movie in list # 38 and 46 - talk about very dubious achievements !! My score 3 is not so bad - but it brings the movie closer to the terrible list. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it stands for Aaron Carter - another pop-star packed and forgotten in the 1990s. When he first broke into the scene, he was a lovely boy who had some songs that triggered young people and attacks on Radio Disney. His songs, appearance and image were all carefully cared for and created by marketing, and did the trick that led to the sale of some big albums. Unfortunately, sales fell in 2005 and Carter hit his awkward stage of life - something that all of his kids' children will eventually have to deal with. Frankly, he is no longer cute in this film and lives in a very difficult phase. Now, I assume that he is a proud young man ... but he's never a heartbreak in Popstar. Here he is just very normal ... the death sentence for the boy under his "pop feeling". <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the film has some other ex-teen hearts. in the last decades - including the roles of David Cassidy and Leif Garrett - two men who also know what he wants to disappear from the limelight. Cassidy managed to get the pieces and make a niche for himself, while Garrett is a great example of a pop star whose life is a bit of a joke after stardom. Hopefully Carter will take time out after Cassidy in the future and, fortunately, he has managed to avoid the negative publicity and judgment of many former pop idols. I was very distant from the movie, but I want him the best in this department. It is not his fault when he was plastered over the radio and television throughout the early or mid-1990s. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Carter does not have to stretch himself - he plays a pop star. However, despite making millions and worshiping girls, he has no "all this". He is quite dense - mostly because he has little interest in learning. The problem is so bad that her mother decides not to take her home again - forcing her into a public school. The problem is, however, that he is quite phobic about doing the tests and changing the class at school is difficult. So, he gets the idea of ​​finding a smart girl so far - who would naturally be obliged to help him in school. She chooses a cute but bookish Jane (Alana Austin) and pretends she likes to put this scheme in work. <br /> <br /> By the way, this plot is not bad and can work even though it looks much like an exhibition like "The Brady Bunch" or Nickelodeon sit-com. Of course, this is predictable and you know that the formula means that it eventually learns its plot and gets hurt. And finally she understands that she really takes care of her and finally the movie is forgiven and they can watch the real couple. However, due to the good direction of action and competence, it may be worthy of its teenage fans, because the predictability is not always bad. And as it turned out, it's not exactly where the plot went ... but it was awfully close. <br /> <br /> There are some good things that the movie liked. Seeing Tom Bosley and Stella Stevens play Jane's grandparents, it was very nice - their role was pretty sweet and it saw them again. The film also appeared in the 1970s for the film "Andrew Stevens" - it was nice to see him again - although some of me was angry with him because he looks so big after those years and I still look 45 years. ! She did a good job and it was nice to see her in the same movie (Stella). <br /> <br /> With Carter, with his many previous experiences on television, he was surprisingly good. Although her relationship with Jane didn't seem very credible, she and Mrs Austin did her best. The film was not big, but they tried and I think most of the film-related problems were in writing - a better and less formal plot could have worked much better. Plus the whole "testophobia" angle seemed pretty complicated ... and rather irrelevant. Who cares about the fact that the mega-millionaire star would be trying at school?! In general, this does not mean that the current movie is in the current rating, although there is not much to attract the audience here. People who grew up with the loving Carter probably enjoy the movie. Older people probably care less than really young people who probably haven't heard of it. For them, there is no value for nostalgia in the film. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie ... Leif Garrett gives Aaron advice. I felt screaming "don't listen!" but no!
