Everyone knows that late night movies are not Oscar contestants. Good. I mean, I admit that I was a little nervous and boring and thought I could get skin-a-max. It is quite bad if the information on the TV control channel is fun in the movie description. It even gave him half a star. To be fair, I sat down to throw the whole thing because the man was so bad. I couldn't finish laughing. I mean the words coming from the mouth of these people and how they tried to be serious. Most of the time I think the people on the screen tried to laugh the hardest. In fact, I think they smiled in one scene. Anyway, the film didn't make sense. It was like one of the Sopranos episodes with a fat gay boy. Only Sopranos is a great show. But it was terrible, I mean, no nudity, only 90s. You know what uses shadows and silhouettes instead of meat. I gave it for two reasons, because this flick makes a good drinking game movie. I mean the whole cheese, it helps to get the wine off. If it is late at night and all that is on television is this and that Tony Little guy and his training bike will offer Tony Little.
