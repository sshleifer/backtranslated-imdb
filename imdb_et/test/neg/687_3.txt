I have the same amount of testosterone as the next bloke, and Raquel Welch on his best sides is definitely worth it; But the fact is that cardboard cutting could work better, and the hour and a half of Mrs. W, who show off her significant assets, do not make the film. <br /> <br /> Given the lie, it is surprising that it is as bad as it is. I've never been a big Wagner fan, and his tough guy Harry is about as convincing as the $ 9 bill. Godfrey Cambridge and Vittorio de Sica, both of whom I usually enjoy, seem to sleep through their lines; and as Edward G ... well, I can only assume that he had paid for the salary. <br /> <br /> This movie is a mess: a non-existent plot, a stop-start action, and an ununny script for slapstick and tedious 60's capri music. If it weren't for Miss Welch, I would have given it 0. <br /> <br /> She said she was against the eyes - even better than her tasty coat "Bedazzled" - and for that reason alone I gave her 3.
