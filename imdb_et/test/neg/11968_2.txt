So unfortunately I and my companion looked at it !!! It appeared here on the Sky channel, called "Zone Horror", which basically shows B-movie horror films 24/7. It was a boring Friday night so you decided to laugh and look at it. Apart from the terrible actors, terrible plot, terrible effects, bad camera work and brain anesthesia, it was OK, LOL !!! With all seriousness, it was a rather laughing joke where she created funny and funny jokes. There's a little half nudity that beat the movie a little bit, unfortunately it was a "uggo" who got topless to his team member: oD If you're bored in the evening and it happens to play, take your chance, you like it :)
