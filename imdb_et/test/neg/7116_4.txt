Mr. Brento wondered if this film was produced by the same man who produced the Dragonball Z TV series. Of course not. <br /> <br /> This is a Hong Kong real action movie based on the first episodes of the original Japanese image (also based on the comic book). And I really do not know if it was produced under license from Dragonball Creator ... <br /> <br /> But with special powers, Monkey Boy is an ancient story known throughout Asia it is Sonogong, etc.) and the story of Dragonball is a lot of this story. <br /> <br /> By the way, as I said, this movie is based on the first episodes of the Dragonball series (followed by Dragonball Z, although I think the US version had a different ventilation sequence). And all the scenes related to sexuality were also included in the original multimedia series (without it being so excessive and so much demanded!), But due to your comments I can assume that they have been completely removed from American dubbing. Anyway, I agree with you about the excessive activity of the film and how bad it is to adjust its original copy. But maybe that's why no one can watch it after that ...
