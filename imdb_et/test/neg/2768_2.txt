I couldn't bring out this terrible movie of the head or tail. <br /> <br /> The plot was confusing, the operation was fine, but the picture quality was terrible! Although I bought this "Gansters Double Pack" (8 films on two discs) at WalMart for $ 5.50 and when you put on the DVD, he apologizes for the terrible picture quality that some movies may have. The plot was everywhere I couldn't figure it out and didn't know what was going on ... then "The End" jumped up and the movie was over. <br /> <br /> What is my waste of time? I'm saying you don't waste your money or time! Or, if you also bought this Gansters Double Pack, just skip it ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
