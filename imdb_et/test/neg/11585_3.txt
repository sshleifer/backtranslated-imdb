Another ridiculously flat and meaningless low budget sci-fi TV product? but is it really funny? something similar ?? satisfactorily. Am I soft? I don't know why they came out with these headlines. Yes, there is a Komodo. And yes, there is a cobra. But what is the actual "versus"? Of course they come blowing? only in two sequences (one repetition of the incident and the other being the annoying peak) and the rather boring change I could add. The entrance is the same old routine on the exit of a scientific experiment on an isolated island (there are no dinosaurs) and some innocent bystanders (environmentalists who are hoping to uncover animal experiments). It looks like a Komodo dragon and a cobra will become a great shape if the government is about to destroy any evidence (including witnesses) about its existence by blowing the island. So it leaves time for survivors to find a way out. Known staples existed from the terrible video game CGI, the hack script, a few tiny sets (although the tropical islands setting was easy for the eyes), thrown characters (but I found the performances honestly), lifelessly sticky thrills (kept for some reason) using the same repeated shot of the victim who stood there terror, which meant I was waiting, please eat me now, I'm not going anywhere and finally they swallowed whole, almost always, as always seemed to be another ending to stop them or just save the effort, stupidly breaking them) and a very hysterical edge with some false message of survival. Director Jim Wynorski seems to be in the cruise control. Michael Par√© is having fun with his terrible dialogues and Michelle Borth added the much needed sparks. Renee Talbert is also very successful in poutis.
