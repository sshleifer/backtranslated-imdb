What the hell is this movie? Well, if I didn't know the "mask son" was classified as comedy, I would never have a clue! Comedy? Tragedy, this is the right genre to continue its another-so-called sequel. <br /> <br /> Yes, I looked at "Dumb and Dumber" but I never believed anyone ever made this title real in Hollywood. Yes, you look at the "mask of the son" and you think ... 5 minutes - Dumb ... 10 minutes - Dumber ... 15 minutes from Dumb ... And then after 16 minutes there is only one thing to say: / I'm here outdoors ... <br /> <br /> Sorry, my candidate for the 2005 comedy page.
