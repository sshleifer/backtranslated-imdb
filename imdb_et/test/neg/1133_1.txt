I was out of town, I visited an old friend. After dinner, speaking, he expressed some doubts about his daughter's boyfriend. He is 15 years old, beautiful, smart, athletic and young man is also a great family, nice, also sporty (if not so smart). I told him he might just feel normal father's concerns; A few minutes later, however, the young man came with this DVD, which he had probably dared to share with others for some time. These people have a bona fide home theater setting that has more than 4 feet on the screen and two young people before it, while the young swain continued to push out its virtues almost by frame. <br /> <br /> I saw enough for some time (and somewhat admiration) to confirm all the most critical comments I've seen on some scans here. <br /> <br /> I told my friend that I wouldn't go so far as to disqualify young smokers only from this opus, but it certainly seems like he has to watch his camp carefully. /> Some flicks are so bad - they are good: the classic "9th Space Plan"; and I think Bruce Jenner / Village People admires terribly, "can't stop music." <br /> <br /> But it is definitely in a terrible category. <br /> The second / third / fourth "bananas" - even the best of them (eg Tim Conway, Don Knotts, anyone with Seinfeld) have great difficulty with a later series of stars (or like a movie). And these were great supportive characters in their original situations. <br /> <br /> The Eddie sign, indeed about the 5th or 6th banana level in the previous Griswald films, and never added much to them, in my opinion. Randy Quaid is a capable actor who has produced good results. His contribution to the previous "holiday" was the best, at best. He and other cast members, many of whom have done a good job in the past, did nothing for their efforts except for some years of household fees or some IRA contributions. <br /> <br /> This whole presentation --- story, performances (from support to support) cannot be worse.
