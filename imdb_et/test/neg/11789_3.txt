I wanted to like this movie. Great Cast ?? Walter Pidgeon in the role that reminds us of his iconic "Forbidden Planet", Barbara Eden and Robert Sterling as young lovers, Frankie Avalon is a musically inclined sailor? Maybe it's a good baby, but I had trouble awake. Lorre was seriously unused. I think he was a red herring, like Pidgeon? you expect him to go to the nuts and try to throw the hero or his gallery in the shark tank. There is no such happiness. By the way, why is the submarine shark tank? It is a feature of the lack of ambition of the film. They explain why Lorre is walking back and forth of the shark (because we see it), but we are just waiting for us to accept that it has a shark for some reason. "Research?" Yes, scientists always do this research, who can understand them? Of course, if there wasn't a shark killing a lady psychologist (Joan Fontaine)? Sorry, even children of the 50s are able to be less predictable and honestly idiotic (not to mention exploitative). <br /> <br /> The first 10 or 15 minutes of really hopes rose. A big theme that Frankie Avalon sings. Pidgeon led Floyd Barber (Howard McNear actually, sorry Howie loved "Blue Hawaii") and Joan Fontaine with a guide, being careful to leave room on the door with a huge "WARNING" sign, passed Peter Lorre with the aforementioned sharks, and then see Eden's full-screen picture, shaking his moneymaker with Avalon's surprised horn. The film is moving downstream quickly. There is no real explanation for the threat to the earth, so there is a clear lack of dramatic tension and a villain who does not start. Instead, Pidgeon's character is made from Ahab's vague red herring (I think "Caine Mutiny" was still fresh in people's minds) and the character of Fontaine suddenly gets angry for some reason. I think the reason is that it is a surprise to the audience. And this is kind of surprising, because the only negative thing he has done is talking poorly about the mental health of the captain and STILL has no reason to sabotage after he has shown that he is a villain. Very poorly made and convincing. The boy who was a pessimistic bible was better ?? at least his character made sense. <br /> <br /> What else could go wrong? Endless, infinite diving footage. I never understand such a thing. The giant squid is attacking the ship in a minute, so there is a monster for the theatrical trolley. Maybe it will deceive some people to think it will be a fantasy adventure, instead of using a semi-burned arresting film from military scientists who are never wrong. Yes ?? Perhaps the worst, it's hardly a fantasy movie that is much less fiction. It never made my imagination because the whole premise was nothing more than a second catastrophe / apocalypse, and those characters never experienced miracles or discovery. I'm through Irwin Allen. I never wanted to like my later movies, but it got me when I pretended I was Jules Verne, if it's just another formula that is a disaster guide. The whole movie is just waiting to see what a character maliciously evil and dies. He has always hired an actor / actress who played them on charming and friendly screen staff to play these roles and this is the only "surprise" element because there is no logic for these characters. What is their pathetic waste of time. George Pal's films are 100 times better (the only flat was "Atlantis", which was not allen randomly), full of wonder and excitement and ?? think about it! ? ideas! In addition to some effects scene and Barbara Eden, I think it's worth nothing. I think it's fun for those who get into disaster movies, but I think they are hollow and boring movies.
