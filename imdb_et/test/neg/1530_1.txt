Not for the first time, I'm out of the majority. Oz is a terrible, pretentious, voyeurist series. The makers have their own cake and eat. Oz, Em City, etc. are used as ultra-dimensional signals that obvious grittus is complete fantasy. This allows viewers to have the weakest intellectual excuse to look at the zebrafish nonsense that is spiced with everything that is bad for humans. <br /> <br /> If you look at an episode, remember that while the fucking mouth, the violent, the absurdly complex convincing, the ill, the imaginary drama opens before your eyes are approved, several hundred babies in poorer parts of the world have died of bad food or water . <br /> <br /> Oz is the worst exploiting drama. He turns to the main instincts, but pretends to be serious and meaningful. It blows warm and cold and becomes more oftissimo to pianissimo than Mahler's symphony. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is unbelievably ugly and utilitarian. The freedoms of reality are foolish. Here is a nightclub with a dandy who arrives with Oz with her furry fine, with one eye ridiculously cloudy contact lens that denotes drugs that no one has detected. Here is a murderous wimp that collides with the death of the universe, asking to kill, but of course he refuses to approach and make himself unlikely. <br /> <br /> The action is competing at a pace that is fast enough for a voyeurist, dazed viewer to always think about what will happen next, not just the garbage that has just been shown. Don't worry, betrayal, murder, sex scene in minutes or two minutes. Finally, Oz is obviously pretentious. You don't have to feel embarrassed because of this stream. You can look at it and tell yourself that manufacturers, writers and actors make everything that is big for the audience (or the same word, but the vowel change). Yes, you can be fresh and apologized for the intelligence, postmodern, etc. skills of Oz's production team. They turn to the lowest common denominator, pretending that they act at a higher level. <br /> <br /> Really, a despicable series. And every hour he shows, rewarding its creators and actors and generating advertising revenue for the channels that show it to people who have nothing better to do than watch something so ugly and unnecessary, a few hundred more children could have saved their lives its a terrible, successful and widely acclaimed series of dollars.
