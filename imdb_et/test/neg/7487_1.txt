I thought it was a very bad movie. All the time I watched this movie, I couldn't think over and over how bad it was and how it was down to $ 3.69. The plot was so terrible. They did a great job at the beginning to find out who was standing in high school, but they didn't explain anything later. Was it a supernatural thriller? Was it an ordinary thriller? You probably decide for yourself because they didn't see the need to explain. I realized what happened, I guess. What I was confused about was everything before what was a bloody nose, phone calls, etc.? Did this guy come back? Did she wear "Carrie" or something? Who knows? You are not sure to watch this movie.
