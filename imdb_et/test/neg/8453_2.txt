This film was painful for me. I understand that indie films don't have the same resources as the other main movies. However, making the film has the basic elements you usually want to follow. First jump on the cuts. There are a lot of pictures to open the movie in 15 minutes. There are shots that show that two separate shots of the same shot were changed together. What I mean is a sign that says one side takes one row and the other line is from another. Second, dialogue. I understand that many writers are seeking a very realistic and real dialogue for their films. Since this film is very specific to its location, the dialogue must also be spoken in a specific tone (for example, put a movie in Boston, but people use the West Coast slang accented by Chicago). Even with that understanding, it is still difficult to sit between some of these parts. These are just two of the most lively problems I encountered with this movie. There were some others. I don't want to hear harsh criticism who knows nothing. I have years of experience in the film (more important is the low budget indie film). I also understand that many directors often have their madness. I haven't discovered the method that used this movie. This makes it difficult to decide if I look at this film as a unique style of film making, or just another small budget, a badly assembled movie. I sincerely hope that this is not the last. If anyone has any idea why things have been done in a certain way or if they have thoughts / views on their film, I would like to hear them. Hopefully I will get a better understanding of this movie and my current opinion can be changed.
