There is not enough room to explain how this film is disappointing. Silly special effects and incomprehensible plot are the few problems with this film. The film looks like it started in the mid-eighties and was buried until it finally came in the early nineties. A bubble titled "hero" (with a modern "Miami Vice" three-day shade beard), ham-fisted slams by Ronald Reagan, would be funny if he didn't take himself so seriously. As it is, the film is simply pathetic. I'm really sorry for the bad actors who are wasting their horrible movie.
