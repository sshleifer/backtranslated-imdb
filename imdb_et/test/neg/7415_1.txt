I think it's one of my ten worst movies I've ever seen! Every two minutes there is a drop. If it were on television, they would have a preview every 2-3 minutes. But I see that I personally enjoyed it: this is when the blonde goes to the bath with boiling water, where the man looks, and for about 10 seconds you see her whole body without a towel! It was the best scene in the whole movie because you can see that sasquatch is in their head, but for the last 10 minutes, it's all about seeing your body. In addition, most deaths are off and just shouting or roaring. And I waited for Sasquatch to die. But he doesn't shoot him and only 4 or 5 people die in the whole movie, I was expecting 8-10 people to die. Don't look at this movie. I'll give him F. Don't waste your time.
