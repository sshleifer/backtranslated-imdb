Definitely expected more than you see the cast list, but WOW! stop. Somehow, the budget allowed them to secure the D-List actors, who they were stunned for hours and a half. Unknown actors were just terrible, less Steve Wastelli doing decent work on Axlina. The story is so bad that it doesn't really need to be mentioned. The overall value of the production seems to be standard, some of the shots are above average when you get it through God-Awful's "slo-mo" scenes and painful "man fire" sequences. I knew it would be stupid, I had no idea how stupid and, unfortunately, this is the time I will never be returned. I think if you really enjoy the bad "B" movies, it might work for you, but if you appreciate any story at all, it's just terrible ... A complete waste of time.
