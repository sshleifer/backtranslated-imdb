When I borrowed this movie, I didn't expect high-quality results, but it was just sad. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors were so incredibly bad that you couldn't easily access this movie when you tried. Nothing likes when a child sees things like "Oh no! My father is invisible!" or "I don't know what it does?" the same monotone, which can be used to report radio traffic advice. There are some good actors, but they are wasted on smaller parts. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, though it would be fairly easy to guess, given that there are not too many real plots. Also a lot of holes. For example, the father is invisible and the inventor will find out what part is needed to see him again. So boy goes and steals part of electronics store. Couldn't he ask his father for cash? <br /> <br /> It appears in the comedy category, but most of the comedy in this movie was quite stupid, like an invisible father who saw his clothes as invisible and then almost restarting during a nude meeting or walking around with his head, which is always covered. It's funny at first, but it gets old. <br /> <br /> 2/5 because it's traceable and it's one of those movies that is funny in its own way ... like a monotonous presentation of lines.
