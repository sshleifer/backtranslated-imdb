This game was terrible. I think they saw visually too hard and didn't do much with the game, which is the most important part. I mean, the visuals look incredible, but is the game really "fun"? NO! I mean, it's like "hey jump out of buildings" and everything I do is stuck and A / X. The game isn't just there and I don't agree with what Ubisoft did because they had this hot girl manufacturer, Jade Raymond) and they were like "OK that we have this hot girl, let's pimp her" and if you're going to gaming websites, you can't see gameplay stuff in Assassin's Creed, you see her face microphone and it's like "We interviewed Jade Raymond on his favorite cookies! "It's like a man, close F * @ K UP, WHAT DOES? Obviously ... many people do because they bought the game and want it ... I mean to compare this game with Super Mario Galaxy. The Wii game that really doesn't abuse the Wii Remote, but STILL is very innovative and offers the most important part, GAMEPLAY! With Mario Galaxy they were able to do a little bit of everything, the graphics were still stunning, the music game was organized and sounded amazingly, and it is a game worthy of a year's game. Not Assassin's Creed, man, it's not even worthy of even NOMINEE's games for years. Jump around this game where it was like "oh it's the next generation of gaming" .... really? I think not! So let me do it right now, because I think people like this game just because they are Jade fans, so I'll tell you that JADE IS NOT OR HOW, HOW TO ATTENTION! If you want a REAL game on your PS3, you can get Uncharted: Drake Fortune if you want a REAL game for Xbox 360, get Call of Duty 4 (and many other games) and just want the REAL game on all systems? GET SUPER MARIO GALAXY! I know this comment hates many, but seriously, if you press two buttons to do cool stuff, is it really a fun game? The only reason other games make it more complicated is that after it is more innovative and fun. And this game isn't just that. <br /> <br /> 1.3 / 10 VERY HELL!
