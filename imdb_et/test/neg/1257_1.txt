Insulting the film and poker can be the most dynamic, bright and exciting feature of poker history. Still a fun movie that makes jokes, from the first half-enchanting gangster movie clich√©s to the incomprehensible sense of the second hour. With fun, Stu Ungar wins all three of his World Series titles without playing one hand. Her Infamous Dealer Abuse? 1 scene. His coke habit? 1 scene. Its incredible memory? 0 scenes. They didn't even get a real poker player. What did they cover? Lots of high angle shots from the house inland. Oh, and the Stu assembly wakes up every day and buys meat that doesn't come close to reason. Why do I care about this little summer camp in Sopranos, who is trying to get the money out of poker? Because I think there is still a big movie about Stu Hungary, waiting for someone to do it right.
