When writing this user comment, Tim Burton's interpretation of Sweeney Todd's story has made a lot of money in the cash register and the film even earned a couple of Oscar nominees if I'm not mistaken. I have not seen it yet, but I sincerely hope that Burton did not look for inspiration and / or stylish brands in the old Andy Milligan's "blood-sensitive butchers". Yes, although the title clearly distinguishes butchers, the main characters in the plot are the hairdresser (the infamous Sweeney Todd) and the female baker. Together they make up the Alliance of Fruit, where he kills his shop customers and processes the bodies into his famous London meat pieces. In other words, Andy Milligan's premise on his most typical, derivative, delirious and amateur. I think the IMDb rating on this film speaks for itself. Although the real story is certainly not the worst thing I've ever seen, Milligan inevitably attracts the intuition inexplicably. Production is one gigantic confusion with inconsistent narrative structure, truly frightening photography, poor lighting, weak functioning and control, ridiculous gore and zilch tension or atmosphere. More than half of the footage is a clean padding, and words don't describe how filming is even 80 minutes long. Ed Wood, Ted V. Mikels and Bruno Mattei; You don't have to be afraid because someone other than Andy Milligan is? hands down ?? the worst director ever, but i don't think he cares. Perhaps, if you lose a really high level of tolerance, it is worth looking at blood-borne butchers.
