Save some very early in Norris, "Breaker, Breaker" doesn't offer anything that can't be found on any channel ten times better. The unfortunate attempt to make a movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Nonetheless, I looked at it by quickly pushing the back and forth button, because the actor was so terrible that it was comic. Of course, the film should be a deed / drama, but it turned out to be a treatment not to film. Everything that may be wrong on the film is on this "dog" screen. If you do, look at it. It's so bad, it's funny.
