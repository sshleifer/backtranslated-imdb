I don't remember the last time the movie was so boring that I went out. Weatherman and the island were both so bad that I was thinking about it, but I even stayed there until the end. This film was incomprehensible and not funny and just went on and on. Like some other commentators, I wondered if the parts were just French humor that I didn't get or the characters were serious. Finally, I just gave up and tried the little one because I didn't want to disturb my husband when he enjoys it, but he noticed and told me that it was OK when I wanted to leave and leave the door. He would like to know how it ended ... when Denevue lived or died, etc. (I don't even care).
