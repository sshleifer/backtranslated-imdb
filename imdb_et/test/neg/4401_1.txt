<br /> <br /> This movie will not stay long. The first half hour was one of the most boring faces of life because I've started watching movies. The story didn't progress, nothing was explained by any of the characters. It seemed like a non-film. (Many people had already left the audience at this time). <br /> <br /> Many scenes were totally unjustified and inexplicable. <br /> <br /> The director should have learned to learn a little more about the movie, that every sequence, every scene, needs to go ahead. He never did it. <br /> <br /> The allegedly funny moments were built and only a few people laughed (people with a strange sense of humor). <br /> <br /> The Jury in Cannes 2002 ..... does not know what the jury was thinking .... apparently "politically correct effect". <br /> <br /> I would have liked to love it, so disappointment was even greater. <br /> <br /> You have to believe it. But wait for the video.
