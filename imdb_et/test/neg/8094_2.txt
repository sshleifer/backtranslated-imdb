What can you say about a movie with a more funny episode of a fat man wrestling in a garden hose? Action, especially the leader Jerry O'Connel, is embarrassing. The dialogue is so viable and inconvenient that it shines upon you. The guiding idea is not really bad for this genre (bad teen comedy), but somehow the director is leading it the least. I appreciate it in 10 out of 10.
