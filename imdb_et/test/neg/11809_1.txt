Previously Nerd Robert Carradine, pre-Automan Desi Arnaz Jr., and almost pre-pubescent Melanie Griffith are on their way to Alaska to make romantic dreams a rich salmon fishing. Well, their dream is about as exciting as this youth traffic film. They are not particularly interesting and the film does not have a lot of points, besides `We got together the spawning of famous people and made a small budget movie about their misdemeanors. From the cannons of 60's and 70's film films and rebel films, it is mediocre, advanced, appealing characters, not much wit, not a lot of freshness that is as understandable as films in a muddy landscape. But for those who care - they go to Alaska and probably Alaska was in the 70s a wild west because everyone carries a gun and is harsh and drum. Robert Carradine says about charming things like "I hope we find a shower, my nuts will definitely itch." (And he's one with Melanie Griffith!) They've been quickly kidnapped and forced to work, and the local bigwig, their employer, moves to Melanie and finally burns Desi that he's not corrupt. This is when they are not smart and do not leave the city, choosing instead to eat dog food or go hungry, get beat guys goons and then take the joy of bigwigs car. The last part of the film abandons the evil great attack when the trio kidnaps, rides and robs the robbery plan, and so on. The film is like an end, annoying and ambiguous, but seeing how they don't bother to character development and story first is quite appropriate. It is worth checking out if you are really on a low budget with 70's fare, but ultimately quite forgotten.
