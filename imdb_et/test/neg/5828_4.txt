All in all, this is a film for children. We saw it today and my child loved it. At one point, my boy's excitement was so great that sitting was impossible. But I'm a big A.A. Milne's books, which are very fine and hide behind intelligent intelligence behind the leading quality of their leading characters. This movie was not subtle. It seems a shame that Disney does not see the advantages of making a movie on the stories contained in these pages, although he does not have the right to use it. I found that I would like the theater to play "Winnie-the-Pooh and Tigger". The sounds of the characters were very good. I only looked at Kanga. However, the music was twice as loud as the dialogue, and it was not suitable for the film. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it was a bit preaching and military in tone. All in all, I was disappointed, but I go again to see the same excitement as my child. <br /> <br /> I liked Lumpy laughing.
