How terrible is it? Let me read how: 1) This is a feed-and-switch film that begins with a UFO investigation and then becomes a high-pressure sales work for Christianity. C'mon! If the makers of this film felt so strong about their message, why hide it? It irritates the non-believers and pushes the garden planters in the opposite direction. 2) It's not even a good point of sale! When the characters from this flick asked me to go to church, I ran like Hell in the opposite direction. They are scary! 3) Operation is terrible. They all behave as if they were on the label in the workplace in an educational film. 4) Cinema is a bad home film. Wait, actually, it's not that good. 5) The script is bad, bad, bad. All dialogue, no action. Like a tennis game, they collide between "back and forth". 6) Direction ... in which direction? Oh, there must be a director there. I'm trying to figure out where. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, I have some positive comments on this movie. Editing seemed professional but could not change anything. Good editing of bad material is still a bad film. The open topic music was actually very good! Very scary and UFO ish. The movie was not too bad about UFOs. <br /> <br /> If you can't already say, here's the bottom line. I wasted my money on seeing this movie and it made me angry. If they weren't hidden in this movie, I can say that it was my fault.
