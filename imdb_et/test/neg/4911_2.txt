weak direction, weak plot, unimpressive music, I don't know why Udita Goswami is the movie in the world first? he tried to reveal a lot of his talent (mostly skin) but was unable to impress. <br /> <br /> The music was not so impressive, but one song "Jhalak Dikhlajaa" is worth listening to. . <br /> <br /> Aksar, Title? well they tried to justify the title of the movie, but that didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> The story was a lot of unwanted twists that made it more boring. but if someone is a fan of Dino Morea, go ahead and see it.
