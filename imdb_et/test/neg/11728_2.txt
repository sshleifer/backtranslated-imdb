A totally forgotten movie, but an incredible sound: I'd give it (soundtrack) out of 9 out of 10. I have a CD and guitar work (Nils Lofgren) is great! I saw the movie years ago and I had to check IMDb to remember what it was. I confirmed that I got a soundtrack and has come out of that time. It ranges from blues / soul / ballad to the gospel dose. All the songs that are written, organized, produced and presented by Nils Lofgren, who is against Steve Van Zandt in E Street Band. This guy can play! The song is handled by Nils (she can't sing very well), Bonnie Sheridan (who is a great singer) and Tom Lepson.
