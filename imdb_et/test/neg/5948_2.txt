In fact, every person responsible for this staircase should be whipped, dragged and hung! If this is what the great Eugene O'Niell drama is like I never want to ever see it again. There are so many things about WRONG w / this feature where one starts? First of all, Elmer Bernstein's bombing score is through the whole film even in silent scenes where background music separates the character's motivation. Secondly, these characters are not pleasing people, and although some reviewers may enjoy being personally disliked by every scene where Ives drove the landscape, but it was the writing of his characters: disliked. W / Loren just doesn't explain if he's good or bad? and all his beating about how he intends to bring things back as they were before the baby arrived? Well, I saw what came out clearly. Perkins has failed and then plays a role like Norman Bates' warming (which he played two years later), even wishing to be guilty of murder. Hokey! Thirdly, this film is the sound production of the studio and it suffers from it. The story would have been a shooting place to develop the "place" feeling that concerns the farm (where all the major leaders fight). As it is filmed, the value of the property is not in the sense that the film has a sound stage in the studio that is not convincing. This is really a terrible movie.
