I started to get some interest in the movie. It appeared to be a serious drama that deals with death, grief and healing, with a somewhat realistic human conflict. Unfortunately, it couldn't get up. <br /> <br /> I need a movie with some consistent and credible characters. Too many symbols in this film were extremely light and controversial. Look, I know it wasn't supposed to be Shakespeare, but come on, I need some script and characterization. <br /> <br /> The actor was fine, not so much in writing. At one point, there is a James Brolini character that shows that he appears on the picnic. He claims that his ordering does not work. His new husband says that when he goes home and changes, he dresses up later. It's a beater. This movie had some unintentionally funny features. <br /> <br /> Jame's Brolini character was difficult to care for. When he gave his first wife so quickly to his new husband, even allowing his daughter to break, I lost most of my compassion. Who really cares what happens to him. I have to admit that I didn't finish the movie. If it's 180 in the last 45 minutes, let me know. It was just unpleasant to look at and so predictable that I felt that it was not necessary to stop.
