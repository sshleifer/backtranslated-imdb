undoubtedly, one of the most racially prejudiced films I've ever seen, and prejudices against Hayden Panettiere, because he must move in a tough city school. He is constantly called "white girls" and others by his color. First, would it otherwise allow a black girl to be the backbone of all abuse? and secondly, stereotypes of ethnic children from urban schools are also disgraceful. The obvious desire of the writers to show that they were "hips" also expanded that the city school won the cheerleading contest, not through the talents, but scaring its white opponents! these movie recordings took away the awkward harmless comedy that fits the family, a vehicle that no participant takes. Hayden Panettiere has star quality but would be surprised if any of the rest of the class would go further. All in all, a charming movie that was a waste of time.
