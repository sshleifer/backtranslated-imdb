The speed that I think is a direct copy of the Hollywood movie Cellular (I haven't seen it) gives an impression of a test game that is very exciting in the first four days, but then finally gets a very boring drawing. I watched this movie today on January 12, 2008, on a rented VCD. Its release date is October 19, 2007. But, fortunately, I didn't know or heard much about this movie except that it is a flop in the box office. So in a situation where I watch a movie, I feel that this film could have been a very good movie, but then the director will again fall into the Bollywood tradition and have wasted a great opportunity. <br /> <br /> Off course as a Bhatti movie to be copied elsewhere. But now is not the day for me when I haven't seen the original movie. I just found the main theme like "Nick of Time" and "Badshah". The movie shows Sanjay Suri's intelligence service, but her husband thinks she is a cook. It brings back the True-Lies memory. The only new part was using the phone. But what I found out now is taken from Cellular. So if the movie is made with a mixture of so many other movies, the future is pretty clear. <br /> <br /> Things like the movie are at this pace. As the name suggests, things happen really fast and there is not much time to think about scenes. But it will break in the last 20 minutes, when the film goes into the traditional Dhishum dhishum Bollywood style. <br /> <br /> The plot plot is also quite interesting. The three stories are parallel, one after the other. One of Urmila's robbery, the second of Zayed, who tried to help Urmila, and then the plan of the Prime Minister's murder. These three stories naturally blend with each other when the film continues. <br /> <br /> But the very usual action and unnecessary extra style has killed the spirit of the movie. Except for Sanjay Suri, no one else will impress. This is true even for Urmila, who is always promising in RGV movies. Due to this normal activity, some scenes do not really give the feelings the director wanted. For example, at the end of the scene where Urmila leaves all hopes and cuts the phone, it should have had a good effect. But instead of waiting for this scene to end. <br /> <br /> Other than action, the movie demoralizes some unnecessary style of love. To show such cool villains is good for Hollywood movies, not for Bollywood. The London background is only meant for creating style and there are not many intelligent backgrounds behind it. Especially at the end, all these dhishhumhhhhhum were completely unnecessary. It can be pointed out that the director has the impression that such a fight must be at the top of Hindi films. They seem unrealistic, increase the length of the movie and ensure that people leave the theater before the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Over and over, I find the movie can be viewed. If it's on a TV or you can rent it, OK. But then again, make sure you have a remote and forward button handy. The next time the movie is on TV, you can watch other channels safely.
