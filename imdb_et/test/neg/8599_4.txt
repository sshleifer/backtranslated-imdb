Now, I like Johnny Vegas, which is a good start, I also like toilets such as Young Ones and Bottom etc. But that didn't even bring a small smile on my face. The story is followed by Johnny after his wife. <br /> <br /> Knocking him out (how he got a good-looking wife and the child doesn't know) <br /> <br /> when he tries to move something. Usually not. I was looking forward to it, but I found it to be completely boring and a waste of my time. If you haven't done anything after 90 minutes of washing your car, don't worry ..... <br /> <br />
