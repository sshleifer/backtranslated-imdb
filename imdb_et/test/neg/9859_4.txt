Recognized as a male drug addict, I was delighted to see a documentary film about the 1997 relocation between Garry Kasparov and the IBM Deep Blue supercomputer. I was hoping to see the picture and much what Kasparov had to say. The boy was wrong and a few miles away. This documentary is much like many modern documentaries - there is a lot of flash but no real content. After watching it, I'm sad to say that I felt I was wasting my time. One of the most irritating aspects of the documentary is that it is not one place in a decent time. It has a typical MTV type editing, where the camera displays people every five seconds with different images and high-speed audio. It is very sad that filmmaking has left the attention of a 10-year-old child. <br /> <br /> I understand that chess is hard to do, but that doesn't mean you should make it plump. However, there were a couple of interesting ideas about the "game". This brought up the idea of ​​whether computers can think like people or not; whether computers have reached a new level. That is what Kasparov thought after the game, but this film is not deep enough with this idea. This film also tries to bring in a strange theory. It tries to mean paranoid that a person made a move with the help of a computer. Kasparov had doubts about this, but there is no evidence so far. At the end of the movie, it is a strange thing that Anatoli Karpov was perhaps the person who made secret moves with Deep Blue. It's interesting to think, but I don't know how plausible or realistic it is. However, I would not recommend this movie, not even for male drug addicts.
