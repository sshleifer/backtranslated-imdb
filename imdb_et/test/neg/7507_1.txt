Just when you think you have seen the worst zombie-sub-genre, another Buddhist Romero and his team who don't have the talent can prove to be wrong. <br /> <br /> I have suffered the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy, suffering from Death Valley: Bloody Bill's revenge, sat through the Zombie Diaries in a semi-comedy, and smiled hysterically at Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence and really thought the amateur film Doing so can not bring down. However, having just been watching the Zombie Planet, a two-hour-old publisher / director George Bonilla generation, I think I've found a terrible zombie film. <br /> <br /> In this terrifying amateur effort, part of Mad Max and part of Dawn of the Dead (but all bad), Frank Farhat stands for TK Kane, a tough fighter who hobbies is armed only with knives, machetes, some irritation grenades, and what he probably perceives is that it is really a thoughtless glare. <br /> <br /> After a desperate opening sequence in which he takes on a horrifying observable zombie horde, Kane is working with a group of survivors who need not only attack the Undead, but also have to hit the beaters who are in control of the area. (retrieving and handing over the transferred valuables). <br /> <br /> Of course, Kane is not a type of person who receives orders from z-grade post-apocalyptic bullying, and he teaches bad guys to be a lesson (mostly threatening them in a threatening way), but pausing to save him regularly zombies. <br /> <br /> Dreadful action by almost all parties, terrible script, ridiculous effects and poor product values, this movie has almost nothing to look at. To be fair, I like the basic assumption that zombies are the unexpected result of a highly popular anti-slimming drug that blocks the appetite of carbohydrates (we learn it when one character explains back to Kane who doesn't really know what happened), but it concerns the only uncomfortable aspect of the whole production. <br /> <br /> I have some respect for anyone who can finance and make their own movie, but if the results are poor, this honor is lost when they decide to make it available for public viewing. If I had done that, I would have wrapped it up.
