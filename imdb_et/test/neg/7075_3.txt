I saw this movie and I like horror movies. <br /> <br /> I didn't know what to expect, but as soon as the movie was on the road, it was nice to watch. The idea was pretty original and the actor was nice. Especially Jenna Dewan is an exciting / evil Tamara. <br /> <br /> The hardest thing to do is make a good ending. However, the movie failed. For the change, the hospital has an end-of-life scene where all the workers are suddenly gone. First you see the movement of doctors and nurses, but then they all went home? <br /> <br /> There are no helpfinders when Tamara is driving, getting to the roof (including smart movement ... not) and outside Of course the open movie. <br /> <br /> No .... the movie started off perfectly, the main part was nice to watch, but they finally ended up using all the clichés of bad horror movies. Jeffrey Reddick failed for this movie after making some really high quality movies like Final Destination 1 and 2. <br /> <br /> If you like a good cliché that is full of cliché, Tamara is a good movie to watch . I like the movies that surprise me.
