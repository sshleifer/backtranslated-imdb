The previous IMDb reviewer has said that "Rafter Romance" is the "hanging" of German music "Me Day, You By Night" (this is the second concept of the reviewer). Obviously, the reviewer is unaware that * both of these films have borrowed their "Box and Cox" premise, an English game written by John Maddison Morton in 1847. \ t It plays with two merchants who rent a careless house in the same room, every man believes as the only tenant. Because both men have different work schedules, it is not immediately detected. This game was so popular in the UK that "Box and Cox" became a common term for an agreement where two people were happy to share only one-person dwellings. <br /> <br /> Rafter Romance (and its predecessor) is that two tenants are now a man and a woman who inevitably develop romance. As usual in these cornball films, the dude and gal cast each other before they fall into one another's hands. Hoo boy. <br /> <br /> The landlord of this movie is George Sidney, an actor who specializes in playing Jewish stereotypes. George Sidney was never as irritating as nasty Harry Green (Stephen Fetchit's Jewish equivalent), but the images of Sidney's Jewish characters are still exaggerated and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> One of the most remarkable things about 'Rafter Romance' is that, to my knowledge, it is the Hollywood movie that refers to the rise of Hitler and Nazism. At one point in the film, the landlord Eckbaum (Sidney) discovers his teenage son, Julius, who works on the walls to criticize swastians. Eckbaum and his son are probably meant to be Jews. True, in 1933, in Hollywood, no one got any real insight into what Hitler planned to do for the Jews in Europe ... but it is surprising to see a movie depicting a Jewish teenager who thinks the swastika is a joke. His father is quite angry at the Nazi symbol exhibition. <br /> <br /> A very shameful aspect of Hollywood history is the documented fact that all major Hollywood studios continued their business in the Third Reich. Later in 1939, Hollywood leading women were documented as Aryan medically to distribute their films in Nazi Germany and Austria. For the same reason, Hollywood leading men Aryan and uncircumcised were documented. Except for Darryl Zanuck at Twentieth Century-Fox, all Hollywood studio leaders who agreed in this policy were Jewish ... but obviously there was no objection to Hitler's business. I'm surprised that the Rafter Romance contains an unfavorable swastika scene, as it would have changed Verboten in Germany and Austria. (Maybe it was cut out for the Germans' extract: it's not important to the plot of the movie.) Besides, the movie doesn't contain anything significant. Robert Benchley does his usual unforgettable testimony: I've never understood this man's complaint. I appreciate 'Rafter Romance' from 4 out of 10.
