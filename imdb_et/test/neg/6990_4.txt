Why do virtual "x-rated video games" get women to talk through their mouths, but Dante, a virtual champion of fighting games, has to use a combination of telepathy and dramatic facial expressions? I think they needed someone who saw more criminals (Michael Bermardo's big brown eyes don't hit exactly in the hearts of fear). heroic "bad boy".) OR they had to just let him use his true voice (and move his mouth) and maybe give him a costume that doesn't make him a painful thumb on the street. (but of course this is the future and we must assume that bad fashion taste is the norm.)
