What can you say about a movie that makes two hours seem like three weeks? The hero begins in Japan in Ninjavilli, passes an identity crisis (saves shinobi), makes a trip to America (saving a slave named Sami) deals with the little western west (saving French / Japanese native American Julie), rides on pirates gold and then rides back to Japan. The film obviously has no idea where it will happen at any given time; I think the director designed every scene after the last movie he was watching. If you look at this movie, I suggest you rent subtitles so that you and your peers can openly discuss how stupid the film is not talking about the film, maybe there are no other fools. <br /> <br /> The film director looked at the movie - American tail, Fieveli goes west, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, The Goonies, Teenage Mutant Ninja turtles, Kung Fu, Vampire Hunter D, Ten Commandments. <br /> <br /> Interest Notes - Most fear-inspiring lines all the time. Approximately 90 minutes (or 19 days) in the film, the lead figure has just become an American frog, and just like a leader for Vcr, to end the pain the hero declares "Let's go back to Japan" and the torment continues for another week.
