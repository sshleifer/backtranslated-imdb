"Hero and Terror" is quite boring thriller - a la: no real character, predictable plot and ... boring. For the thriller, I found this movie slowly up to my bad climax, because it seemed to be just dragging, until Chuck's wife's baby was born ... and then retracts from it until it reaches the end - which I hardly remember even though I saw the movie in just 10 minutes back. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie in 10 out of 10 - the first 10-20 minutes.
