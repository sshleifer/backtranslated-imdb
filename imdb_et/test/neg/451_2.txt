To be fair, I didn't see much of this show. Probably because it was not as good as the original M * A * S * H, but it seems like I am reminding them of moving this week's chart. Some exhibitions are not worth every week. But I tried first, so it wasn't all bad. Maybe I just waited for it to improve, but I can't show it. 1. Frankly, I can't give it more than 2. <br /> <br /> It wasn't MASH (I don't write these fools every time). And it was trying to be a MASH without any effort, as if it had just magically happened. Well guess what? No magic. The best thing I can do here is to compare it with other shows. <br /> <br /> Trapper John, M.D. But they should have called it B.J. Hunnicut, M., because Pernell Roberts looked just like the older BJ, but nothing like Trapper John. Just keep everything else, just change its name and the name of the show. Presto! After the MASH was not the only order for the complete bombing and failure of the original. Archie Bunker's place was a flat control of All In The Family's flat. He had no heart, no conflict, no depth? all the things that made the family so memorable. MASH was also funny because the doctors reacted to the impossible absurdity of war. Remove war and remove 99% of humor. Potter can't dress Klinger in the dress because Klinger doesn't wear a dress because he doesn't try to get out of the army because he's out of the military because the war is over. (Breathe) All jokes became forced because there was no motivation. The least motivated was the viewer to stay around and watch this example. <br /> <br /> And from what I remember, the whole performance seemed to be Potter, Klinger, and Mulcahy, who stood there unnaturally, facing the audience of Vaudeville performers. It reminded the Good Times, where they spent 90% of the exhibition standing on this couch, and talked to the audience, trying to look like a natural conversation. They weren't. And it seemed even less natural after MASH. <br /> <br /> Another random tidb that I remember is that MASH people never got license fees for spin-offs. The studio used an absurd excuse that after MASH there was really a MASH movie (which they had), not a television series. Nice to try, but Mulcahy was the only one in the movie, and he was never deaf. I think the studio is doing something for the box. Something other than a worthwhile sequel, that is.
