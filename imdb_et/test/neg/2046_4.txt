The thing that is really terrible is that filmmakers thought they were doing something intelligent and sexy. Instead, they probably made stupid horror pictures of the year. <br /> <br /> This movie begins with snob friends in the gallery. This unpleasant European weird walks and starts talking to the main people about pretentious fertility, sounds like he just walked out of the Dark Shadows episode. Then he offers him some stuck smoke (yes, freakin sticks) that he eagerly agrees with! He chooses a red crap and puts it in a spoon into a free-kick! If this happens to you in real life, don't do it! <br /> <br /> He is being transported to some strange wannabe Jean Rollin netherworld, which should be sexy, but not where it is that looks like a black lagoon creature! <br /> <br /> Soon he will turn all his artistic sleazeball friends into his new supernatural crack form. No matter how many of these idiots are amazing and blue, they can't leave hell alone. At one point he also makes a rotten creature. <br /> <br /> After the last battle and the foolish woman is steaming or whatever, the hero alone is left to wrap her copy of Michael Moore's My Country and can't resist smoking to paste one more time to try her a whore to save a friend. What a bell. <br /> <br /> There are four stars that are meant to be inadvertently humorous.
