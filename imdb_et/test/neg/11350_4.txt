One Chinese gang is attacking and sweeping another gang at the beginning of the movie. Unfortunately, the patriarch of the winning family is killed in this process. Strangely and for no apparent reason, the gang calls the volunteer to blame the massacre and leaves until the police decide to stop the investigation. Now that one man is the one responsible for about 50 deaths, I'm farther away, so sending one man just seemed silly, but it's a plot. Later, when this man arrives home, there is a betrayal and a success - it takes almost one hour and fifteen minutes to kill non-stop. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a Chinese martial arts movie that has a lot of plot, you should probably skip this movie because it's a virtually non-stop action and virtually no plot or sign development - even compared to other martial arts films. I think 80-90% of the film is fighting scenes - endless and reasonably well-made fighting scenes with knives. Again and again and again, fight scenes! If you want a movie with a body number to get into hundreds when people are truncated, nailed, and truncated, that's your movie. The problem was at the end of the movie that literally wouldn't kill people and the movie lost my interest! It's not deep, but if you only want excitement and action, this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie is set nowadays and no one thinks of heroing until the end. And when they finally create, it's too late and the effort is really flat! Such logical errors and the suicide of a lady (why ???) make this movie "turn off the brain."
