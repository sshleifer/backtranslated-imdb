I liked this movie, not good, but not the worst. While everyone else says it's one of the worst movies ever created, I thought it was okay. There are many immature jokes. Sometimes he wants to be funny but fails. <br /> <br /> The story is OK. However, for a younger audience it may be a bit difficult to follow. <br /> <br /> Actress is pretty bad. Jamie Kennedy is the most terrible actor. Sometimes it's even ridiculous. Alan Cumming is probably the best actor here. He's funny when he's supposed to be, but some of his lines are awfully gods. mask. The voice is HORRIBLE. Similarly, such scenes are so inconvenient that they are almost intolerable. I'm sure they could have cut her off and it wouldn't affect the film at all. <br /> <br /> In general, you can live without seeing it. This is a nice movie to watch if you have nothing else to watch. They could definitely go without a sequel, but this is a good effort. 4/10
