Just after the first look and it is very stupid. I happened to watch the Bones first and then the eleventh hour. The 11th hour should be embarrassing. <br /> <br /> It's so weak. Stewart introduces himself as a government scientist. It is not mentioned which scientist just general science. In the cloning program, they bring to the church a caregiver who was paid to dispose of the failed embryos, and made him kneel on the cross in the shape of Jesus and ask for forgiveness ... and tell them where the bad boy is. when they can move the plot. Now this is the science in science: (<br /> <br /> There's a stupid, not a good fool, where Picard rides on a TV that advertises the screaming of the skin, making you younger, shouting "It's wrong" as his Randy female assistant goes to the neighbour's local hot bobbie. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first episode, there is a bad cartoon where a bad old lady named Pinnochios father moves to the terrible plot of Picard on the street when she arrives in the taxi, Picard is one floor and he looks out of a window that goes quietly ... he went away, he might have wanted to try. or maybe get a taxi number and call it in or maybe he had something else ... I'm wandering and getting into a taxi now and there is nothing you can do next week until the end ... mahahahahahah. I'm sorry it is so stupid that Picard is a convincing father that even if the son of his son's clones was born, his son would never have been his son The right people in the hat the rationale is based on the fact that every soul is unique and sure why you would otherwise want to clone. Although the general scientist Picard finds cloning a bit tiny, he is all ready for stem cell research and goes so far as to say that an accident will hit humanity if it is not allowed. He has a rather striking story of how important it is. Of course, he does not mention any examples. Such a summary shows. Buzz and perception.
