It was just a misfortune to see this really horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Think of this scene at the end of Magnolia with this woman's slow pan. Now remove the frying pan, add breathing and waterless men to the blend, and you have what all 2 and a half hours of humankind had <br /> <br />. Twilight, slow-moving simpleton. How they ever dealt with the crime is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Compulsory sexual scenes are terrible and joyful. <br /> <br /> The endless (he raped and killed an 11-year-old girl) is labeled very early and is no surprise if you are not similarly thought out. <br /> <br /> Camera is not in use. <br /> <br /> The director was saying that his audience had their own task. interpretation. I assume that he also thought he was offering his dialogue (there is a mistake everywhere - adding his level of boredom), the work of the inventive camera (only static shots, completely removing the obvious landscape beauty the film is filming) and the plot! br /> <br /> Really terrible. <br /> <br /> From 0 to 10
