Marnie Bannister (Magda Konopka) is a terribly confused woman. If one of his colleagues finds the rejuvenation formula, Marnie sees it as an opportunity to become beautiful. If he denies the drug because of possible side effects, he kills his colleague to get what he wants. It works and it becomes beautiful. But the formula brings out its worst and it won't be long before it is behind your body. <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard the phrase "as exciting as color drying"? This is a Satanic summary. During the movie, one of the characters speaks: "Something so terrible, it's unthinkable." I wasn't sure if he was talking about anything in the movie or in the movie itself. I'm really disappointed because I had great hopes for it. Satan had opportunities, but they never understood. At every opportunity, the plot at Marnie is the most understandable thing. Writing is terrible. And part of the problem is Magda Konopka. He's not that appealing and can't wear the movie himself. <br /> <br /> Another big problem with Satanik is direction and editing. It's a mess. We see things and places that do not affect anything in the movie. The camera captures the shots too long after the end of the scene. I can't think of a blow that would call anything other than unoriginal. This group of filmmakers represents little imagination or talent. <br /> <br /> I may not be familiar with the Italian comedian that Satanik is supposed to be based on, but I'm sure it must be better than that.
