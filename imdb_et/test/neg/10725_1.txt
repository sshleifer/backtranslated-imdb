What is greed and money, what? Behind this fiasco, there is more greed than any of the things they probably try. Jim Carrey's reign was certainly short. He is an intolerable presence on the screen. The insecurity of her portrayal is nothing horrible. He also gave it to this "masterpiece," so he can't blame anyone here. "America's First Comedy" cries out a desperate TV. Of course Jim Carrey had to guarantee full-time, but the game is over. If I am angry, I am. I spent in California a sunny afternoon, plus tickets, parking, apartment coffers, etc., for nearly $ 45 on the subject starring Carry. Not anymore, do you hear? Not anymore.
