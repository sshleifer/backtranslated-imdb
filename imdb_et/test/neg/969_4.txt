The perfect show is under Showtime's surface. In fact, it is more than two or three ideas that are constantly fighting for screentime. This movie is not just a cake and it also eats; it's the whole bakery. <br /> <br /> Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) is a media busted medication and Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy). When Preston's partner is released, he cries the camera out of his wrath and tiffs him down at a new reality police show by Chase Renz (Rene Russo). In the first film, it is strange that the injured partner will never be heard again or refer to the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> De Niro's best gag is his speech to small classrooms. children open up the picture of how TV police officers do not act like real police officers. The funny thing is that, as the film progresses, its character and Murphy begin to act more and more with clich√©s that they allegedly are so strongly exposed to. In a smarter movie, De Niro's diatribe could have been such an ironic comment; here it only shows how the movie is really flat. While the stupidity of a reality-based police exhibition may be funny, it seems that the team of writers and director Tom Dey (who made a few years ago a better Shanghai Noon saw this film) seems to be insecure and instead of slogan TV industry, they really let them light (Harshest thing what they seem to be able to say that they are going to say about network files that they want to play ping pong at work). The Russo character has an odd joy in the eye, but his dialogue and activities rarely match the actor's enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> A little on the screen to keep my eye on, my mind started to rotate, and it is dangerous in this film with many holes in the plot. For example; if Showtime (the name given to the police show) is so popular, why doesn't anyone feel that they know De Niro and Murphy when they work? That's why when their smuggler and the whole boy, Vargas, is on television, why hasn't the devil told him that they are on his foot? And again, given this villain's activity, I shouldn't be surprised; it is the same joke that is very angry with a companion who uses his new superstar without approval, threatening the transaction and then sending him how? Of course, to equate your entire house with about ten supergas! It's like a fire with a bigger fire. <br /> <br /> Showtime sometimes laughs, but the movie's nearly two hours of working time is not enough. Worse still, really smart gags suggest that this movie would really have been something if they had written some script drafts. Murphy mugs and talks as soon as possible with minimal results, and De Niro looks like most of it. After a totally unnecessary fistfight between police and gangsters (this brings a significant loss of injury and arrests) Russo shouts "It's great for television!" Maybe it's a great television, but it's not a great movie.
