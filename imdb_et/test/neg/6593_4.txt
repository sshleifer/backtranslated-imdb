It is based on Michael's life from 1983/4 to 2004. Flex Alexander made good results, but it seemed like Michael. I feel that Michael was depicted as a fool whom I do not believe he was (although he trusted the wrong people at times). I thought Flex Alexander looked at Chinese when he made Michael white. I think Latoy should be depicted about it, she was always photographed with her brother in the 80s. I've never thought that any of the supporting pains looked like their colleagues. There were some things that were inaccurate Lisa-Marie Presley's son saw in the wedding picture about 4, although he wasn't yet 2 when Lisa and Michael got married. Even when Michael tells his mother Katherine, she thinks she and Debbie will marry when she is carrying her baby, that is Katherine's idea that the two will marry.
