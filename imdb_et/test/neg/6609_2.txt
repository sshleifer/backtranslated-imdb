the film is just terrible (2/10). Although the actors try their best (sometimes not much), there are special effects ... let me say it would be better if there was nothing. <br /> <br /> The script is based on Sapkowski Prose, so it should be the biggest advantage of this movie. Unfortunately, this is the opposite. There is nothing left in the original atmosphere. And it's all very chaotic. Maybe they just had too much material to show within 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you want to see this movie, I would suggest you look for the TV series (the same title, the same actors, even the plot), which was done at the same time as the movie. It is so much better (9/10) and the story there really makes sense :)
