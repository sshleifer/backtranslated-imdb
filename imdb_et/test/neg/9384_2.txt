Tell us horrible. If you really want to sit down and watch this episode where a later born girl in Firefly was kidnapped, you will be entertained, but only if you like such a thing. I didn't think frankly this episode was terrible. Fortunately, this is one of the three episodes of the season and the only episode of Charles Grant Craig, so you don't get a lot of things this season. So, general decision? Just read the summary above. This is a strong candidate (Hell Money says hi!) For the 3rd season's worst episode. Let's be honest, but I wasn't really expecting much. I wish I could do this episode at all. This is one thing they have the right: the title.
