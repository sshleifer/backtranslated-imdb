Christopher Lambert attracted me to this film. What waste! The plot has more holes than my string vest, the special effects were not very good, I didn't realize much about the creature's mother and the creature was indebted to the Predator more than the small debt. This climate film could have been done much better. However, this raises one interesting point. When will Hollywood discover a rich vein of European folklore there, but waiting for mining?
