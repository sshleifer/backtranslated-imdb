If the film has an unimaginable, hackneyed story and blissful characters, it must do it really, funny. If you're funny, you can get a lot. But when a grandmother's boy here and there are scattered some fun moments, they are still a little and a few sometimes that they can't start crafting when the movie is in such an abundance. <br /> <br /> The goal of the movie is not to surprise anyone. When Alex hides her grandmother in the way of her marinade, you know what will happen later and this will happen. The film seems to have been written by a committee who conducted a mediocre comedy survey and grabbed all the gags that appeared from more than one of them. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about film is its unusual device. The game takes place in a video game development company, which should be an interesting source for some smart comedy. But don't be fooled, it's not a video game developer movie. Basically, it is a college film film, where all frat boys have been put into a big room for playing video games. <br /> <br /> How a movie does not think about its setting and uses it as an original laughs to see the JPJP character. I think John Carmack, the creator of Doom, is more or less conspired. At least inspired to the extent that he is a strange genius who plays. <br /> <br /> The movie features J.P. a weird, unpleasant geek whom the testers of the game of the company have despised and jeered. It doesn't make sense at all. If you are one of the most important people in the history of video games (as should be J.P.), even if you are peculiar and unpleasant, people admire and respect you on some level. When Stephen Hawking is uncomfortable, his associates still do not make his face. <br /> <br /> Game testers are also likely to be geeks as JP, but they are basically guys in the movie. This is funny normal boys against reluctant filmmakers. And even though this formula has worked from time to time, it is absurd to set up a gaming company. If you decide to use an unusual setting for a movie, then it is not just the contraction of the movies in all the different settings. If you are not hacking. <br /> <br /> About two-thirds of the way I gave up. Something happened that I knew it would lead to a number of painfully predictable events. And I realized that I wasn't really laughing over the last half hour. So I stopped (although I made it fast to make sure I was right to follow the most predictable clich√©s they did). <br /> <br /> Normally, when a movie is bad, I just say it's bad and then it can be said, but this film is so phenomenally poor production that it deserves a long diatry. <br /> <br /> Shame on the film to attract a good actor like Linda Cardellini, surrounded by talentless nobody. I'll give the movie 1 point to give Shirley Jones the chance to be an anti-Shirley Partridge.
