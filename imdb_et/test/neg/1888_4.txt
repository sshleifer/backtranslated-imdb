There is evidence that filmmakers and their financiers who treat their audience with contempt are not a new phenomenon, as was the case in the 1940s, and Drakula House is a great example. You think making a movie with Dracula, a wolf and a Frankenstein monster would have dictated to the scriptwriter that all three would appear on the scene. They had the opportunity, together with the FRANKENSTEIN HOME, when they had another cherry, they blew them back to the Drakula house. One way of losing is misfortune, losing two cynical gaps. <br /> <br /> It is clear that manufacturers are despite. Larry Talbot turns up again, although he showed that he died in a previous film that summarizes the cynicism of the franchise. It also shows what a poor scenario is and what is being treated terribly when Talbot's condition is treated with a special plant type that softens his skull. I think that screenwriter Edward T Lowe could have softened his skull if this is the thing he says <br /> <br /> Director Erie C Kenton can't fix the script and throw his wrench. For example, Talbot is surprised to see that Dr Edelmann pulls the box after the truck, but looks at Edelmann climbing the wall and jumping into the Ch√¢teau courtyard. One cannot help thinking that the Talbot reaction shots have been misrepresented in the editing phase. <br /> <br /> Lon Chaney Jnr is famous for his roles in horror films, but they didn't have much careers outside of them. Perhaps it is that he is not a good actor, and here he is the worst type, very wooden. However, this is not entirely his fault, because all the characters cast a rather terrible dialogue and are all quite partly due to the uncomfortable leadership of Kenton in the wood. HOUSE OF Dracula feels a million miles away from James Whale's 1931 film and its stage since 1935. and would have been a very sad comment. But ironically, the wagon decided to make another movie to marry comedy, starring Abbot and Costello.
