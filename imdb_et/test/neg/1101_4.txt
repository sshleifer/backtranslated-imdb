Having spent all his money to take care of his distressing wife, recently, widow Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring), with her two daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz), moves to the countryside of her later husband. Pennsylvania, where local legends speak of a zombie who travels through the woods at night. <br /> <br /> Opening only the names of the writer and director of this movie at the beginning of the credit was enough to shade my back: Boaz Davidson is a "genius" responsible for scripting titles such as Octopus 1 & 2, Spiders and Crocodile, while JS Cardone gave us the godawful "video nasty" Slayer and the boring vampire flick The Forsaken. Under the responsibility of such a dubious talent, I did not expect much from Wicked Little. <br /> <br /> And just after finishing the movie, I'm glad I kept my expectations low. <br /> <br /> Although the film seems to be good at times, good for the local use of forest land, and it provides reasonable presentations, given that they work with clich√©s, the plot is so tense, poorly written, and derived that it is impossible to be enthusiastic about. Most importantly, the movie killers, the undead kids who rise every night from the mine where they died, are not the least scary, makeup, black contacts, and some funny jokes in the store's scars that add little to the risk. Scout Taylor-Compton and the company do their utmost to fear small fears, shouting convincingly with every confrontation, but their admirable attempts to perceive the feeling of fear for the audience is of little use: small fighters simply do not get what the blood is going to take. <br /> <br /> There are some shameless zombie scenes that are useless to win the gore-hounds and the ultimate killing that sees the victim's blood away from both Compton and Heuring. is suitably tasteless, but in general Wicked Little Things (AKA Zombies in the UK) are immediately forgotten in the trash, which is just another clunker in Cardone's and Davidson's filmography.
