This movie was so stupid that I couldn't believe what I saw when I watched it, it was like a big train wreck - I couldn't look at it because it was just so awful! I can honestly say I haven't seen anything bad during my whole life. It was so cheesy and the action was just so regrettable that I just thought "it just has to be a joke, right? I really hope it's all just a bad joke and these people don't really believe people would look at this straight Faces, and I really hope that the people in this movie did terribly and do not really believe they are good actors!!! Dragging queens are pretty funny to see, and so the special effects of the cheese are bad for 80 sci-fi movies. existence first and have nothing to look at again! I would give it "0" if possible.
