I really do not understand how this film will get a higher rating in IMDb than 4. It is just a big mess, and I have to admit that I really liked AvP 1: close to the story, okay, I can live with it, but at least they got quite a lot of points at once. AvP 2 is not. If a stupid assumption has been made, over half an hour is a stupid and inappropriate teenage clich√©, a fool like hell dialogue and almost nothing else, except for some alien scenes that know that the first side of the movie is and the Predator scenes that make you ask did those filmmakers even look at some other Predator movie or just don't care about it. <br /> <br /> After that, the last one where Predator starts attacking aliens or at least pretending to be. And boy, is it a Predator silly, blind and deaf. It's terrible. How he managed to even earn what he has is outside of me. He is almost unable to hit every shot, but only informs aliens if they are right on his face or if it is essential for the script to be able to move where he needs to be. He even experiences the surprise of human teenagers and ambassadors all the time. What should this guy be like? After the first hour I was more or less constantly shaking my head for every scene. You can't get this movie close to any scene without incredibly foolish dialogues, foolish Predator actions, or foolish shortcomings or foolish actions from our "heroes". <br /> <br /> Then this thing finally ended. To my surprise, not only did I and my friends know whether to laugh or cry, but all I left the room was half crying, half laughing for the 1 1/2 hour they just wasted. Don't look. Never.
