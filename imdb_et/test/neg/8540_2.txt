Good old Jess Franco! Always the choice of a reliable driver, if you are looking for an unwanted gap, shameless exploitation and 200% free. Indeed, Jess surpassed himself with this totally unpleasant jungle adventure. Let's face it, this film is basically just a pretext for the fascinatingly hot (and minor?) Actor Katja Bienert around paradise. In fact, it is a rather disturbing idea that an innocent 16-year-old girl had to walk around a film that was naked in front of the whole team and especially before the eyes of the perverted Franco! And it wasn't even the first time since the duo already made "Linda" together. Anyway, just when you thought: YES, "Kilimanjaro diamonds" has a plot, though very immaculate. During the opening, there will be planes carrying a rich Scottish dude and a girl, and a crash flock of cannibal African tribes. I say a vegetarian because they never even tried to consume human meat at one point in the movie. The perplexed Scot declares himself to be a great White Leader and the girl is growing up to become a beautiful and hardly dressed white goddess. How many years later does the expedition reach the middle of the jungle that the girl returns to civilization and ?? more importantly - steal some of the tribal legendary diamonds. It could have been a delightful and action-packed adventure movie, but Jess Franco couldn't seem to be disturbed. Why shoot jungle chase sequences or bloody cannibalistic clothes if you can sit naked with your camera for a long time with your camera? Most of the jungle settings seem to have been filmed in someone's garden and there is a huge amount of horribly edited National Geographic decorations to fill the gaps in consistency. On the back of the DVD, "Kilimanjaro Diamonds" is described as Tarzan's brilliant, feminist and adult-oriented version. Yes, they just put that sentence in there, because Katja Bienert's symbol appears several times from one tree to another.
