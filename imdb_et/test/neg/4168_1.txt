An interesting concept that just doesn't do it. I watched the whole movie, but I had to read the IMDb comments to find out what code 46 means. If / when it was explained in the movie, I had to be in a coma or temporarily dead. I only looked at it for Tim Robbins. The fact that I didn't know any other participants should have been at the top. We all have to start somewhere, but this movie shouldn't be it. As for the "anti-empathy virus" - Holy Utility Belt, Batman! Where were The Joker, The Riddler, etc.? Why are all women so cunning? If I want to see less than usual, I'll just walk down the street. The best part of the movie was a car accident. It was completely plausible and not like most movies.
