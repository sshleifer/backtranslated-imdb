After all, the film that romanticized the life of the Dublin gangster is a general heroic proportions that made Dublin a middle-aged ill person, coming from Kevin and his experimentation with Mr Lynch or Martin Cahill, the public. so bad that this criminal drama becomes a comedy for the native Dubi and a tragedy for Kevin Spacey fans. In short, the film is worth watching .... No, if u like bad, acting with fun "true Irish accents, ah sure be sure". The story hangs commercially successful "The Generalist", which, despite the renown of the famous Dublin animal, Martin Cahill, is still worthy at the national level, as it shows Dublin's real classroom and international level as he is a real Irish actor and killer, including John Voight. All in all, "ordinary decent criminal punishment" is nothing but a decent film. Avoid.
