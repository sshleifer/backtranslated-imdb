what was quickly destroyed by poor-quality acts, cinematography, numerous pointless scenes, and terrible scouts. Well, look, Joe Estevez is bad (as usual), but she's not the only casting problem, writer Vivian Schilling is not a big actor, in fact she sucks. His script is not so bad, it's just bad. In fact, if the direction had been better and the better actors were cast, it could have been a really good movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, with all these problems, "Soultaker" is not as amazing as the horror film, it is also amazing. <br /> <br /> The MST team had fun, but it was definitely not their best effort. 5 something for the original.
