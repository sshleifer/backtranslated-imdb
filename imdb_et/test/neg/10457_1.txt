If you're like me and sometimes you enjoy horrible movies (I think it's like a slowdown in a car accident), you can't do it better! The plot is a man, special effects are fun and the actors are some of the worst you see! 4 EMPTYED! WOOOHOOOOOOOO !!! Seriously, I have no idea how the director and "actors" will sleep in the evening! It is painful and still hysterically funny to look at and I recommend it to those who want to punish themselves. If you can do this mess without any trouble, then you're a better man than I ever am! I don't know if this garbage producer had a clue what he got (and his money)!
