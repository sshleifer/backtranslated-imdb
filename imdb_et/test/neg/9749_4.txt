This is probably the only movie I've seen where IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. "Stupidid" is a frightening, dimly lit film that has no artistic value, and is the leader of an attacker, such as John Landis. And that makes it great. <br /> <br /> To evaluate "stupids", you need to keep in mind the little known but very true maximum spoken by director Abo Kyrou: "I invite you to learn to watch bad movies, they are so sublime." , the movie must create and follow its logic, and if it does so convincingly and sincerely, the movie's action is actually possible. For example, if you look at "Freddy Ging Fingered" as a traditional comedy, it's a complete and complete garbage; if you look at it with the notion that it is actually a neo-surreal comedy, it's great. <br /> <br /> It also works with good movies. If the "jaws" hadn't created a reality, the explosion of the air tank would not have worked. However, many people think that "jaws" are significantly overestimated for this type of reason and they are not wrong. But it has the strengths, isn't it? What matters is that such a movie makes sense if you look at it in the right perspective. Some people, like me, get it right away, while others are never going to explain it as often. Jim Jarmusch made "Showgirls" for one-time protection and even after that I don't see it from his P.O.V. Does not mean he is wrong. If you have the right mood for watching this movie (and WHAT I ARE NOT BASED on, then put it to sleep), you can really enjoy an amazing, inexpensive, pointless slip film. The 80s / 90s start-style farce that it is. <br /> <br /> Defenders and hackers in this movie are right: it's STUPID and that's the point. The film accepts the foolishness of the characters in the same way that "The Jerk" accepted Navin Johnson's idiot. And because it takes it and runs it, the film focuses only on transmitting it to send a plot and define characters. The "bad" movie would actually do it and doesn't use that logic correctly; bad film is bad because they do it, while movies like "The Stupids" know where it goes, what it does and why from the start. <br /> <br /> I can't protect the film from an artistic point of view, so I give it such a low rating. The actors are mostly bad, the jokes are superficial and the quality of the live-action apparently hides what would have been a comic. But I can't deny that it's entertaining, and that's why I protect it. I got it right now, and I regret those who don't. <br /> <br /> I admit that I am drawn to this film because Christopher Lee's tasty cheeky appearance (hearing he says, "Release the bee!" "would have been worth the rent even when I hated this movie ), but I was astonished that I was never bored and never disappointed alongside Jenny McCarthy's applause of the TV studio applause, in fact many jokes were fun because of my comic book context (especially the airbag-cigarette explosion). and the film does not pretend to be anything else: the STUPID comedy about STUPID characters and instead of apologizing for it, it is itself. <br /> <br /> And that's why it works.
