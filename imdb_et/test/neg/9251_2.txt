It was shown on the premium channel, so I didn't know it was made for the TV. However, I like some movies alive (lifestyle here in the UK), but it was terrible. The family was so cheesy, "Love you mum" "I love you even more honey" Then when they were broken for the second time, 10 minutes later, they were again "Love you mum" big cheesy smiles, and so on. She calls her husband and tells her she doesn't have to come home. They were cut off only by the man who wanted them dead, who has a neighbor who needs help? She has her teenage daughter and a cat (not long) to take care of her. <br /> <br /> But as a comedy I would give her a good 7. I can even show it to my friends the time I have them. Vodka or a 10th bottle can be great fun!
