When released, this film created a feeling. I looked at it and was glad. Beautiful, usually young, naked women, filmed in classic style, knew so well about director Hamilton's photography. His photos never change with porn and the same applies to this movie. Today I saw it again and I was bitterly disappointed. The soft core of extremely slow-paced scenes, all filmed with lenses, is actually all there. There is no real story, the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed, but they are not true souls. Actually, nothing happens. It's like Hamilton captures moving pictures rather than photos. And it gets so boring after a while. I didn't even look at the whole thing for the second time because I fell asleep. This is all the masterpiece that is a great dream. And you never get addicted to it! <br /> <br /> Then back from 7 out of 10, now 3 out of 10
