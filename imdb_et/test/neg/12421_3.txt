Wild Rebels is funny, but also frustrating thanks to a real good or at least a functioning element. It deals with a racing car driver (Steve Alaimo) who mixes with a group of cyclists called Satan angels hanging a lot until they decide to rob the bank. Meanwhile, Alaimo also gets to the police to let them know what the angels are and where they rob. It is not even that the film is really too "dated", although it naturally carries important raw and foolish music in the movie (from a scene from a scene to Alaimo's performance, if you could call it to do it, to a normal overall score) . <br /> <br /> The fact that the filmmaker does not turn more logic, direction and better participants into parts is not just more care. As I wasn't, I didn't like the film as much as I did with Hellcats, but it left me a little indifferent. What can be unpredictable comes only through fools like the name of the city of Florida (Citrusville 'ho-ho). So it's not worth it if his Mystery Science Theater 3000 status is late. The comment is good on the film, even if I almost wanted to hear what the on-screen characters were saying, if it was worth it. Wild Rebels can be a good time if you have six packages and low expectations, but like I wouldn't look at it again.
