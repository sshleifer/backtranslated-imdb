The only reason I rented this movie was that Val Kilmer rarely observed a bad movie. Of course, everything is the first time. This film proves in many ways that the oaks are not as simple as we think, especially the external leaders. The only one he got was probably Sergio Leone, but even his films lacked anything that is endlessly innate for our American psyche and panache. American actors Clint Eastwood and Henry Foundation helped. I see now why they changed the original title "Summer Love" to "Dead Man's Bounty". It tells me that the producers and the director had no basic understanding of the West except those standard shoot'em up scenes and violent themes. I think we can also say the same about American directors who are trying to make a Polish film, but are not impatient in this process.
