From this brilliant mind that brought us to "The Exorcist" ... and "Cruising". Unfortunately, "Rampage" is the last one. This is a general filthy film that has a great picture of it on television. The whole film pretends that it depends on the question: "What if" the next door of the boys "was the killer of the serums?" Instead, it remains a challenged courtroom as a drama and meditation on madness and death penalty, which makes little sense. The film is based on the case of Richard Trenton Chase, where there are some facts here to make a fake character and a different result. One of the main points of the film seems to be that ending the life of the final child and ending the murderer's life is somehow analogous. "Sometimes you just have to choose," says the manager. Yes, sometimes you need to select the plug ... from your TV!
