Grudge 2 is one of the films that makes me want the English word "terrible" to be more synonymous. If the plot is full of more holes than trawlers, this film will not be able to make a compulsive look even for the fanless film fan I am. I felt compelled to stay in the cinema until I was entertained for Â£ 5.70, although I was afraid I would be there for years. A better movie could be made of the extracts from The Grudge's first part, although I am not sure that this is the result of such an exercise. As hoped, in this fierce celluloid struggle, the plot ends with no resolution, thus leaving producers the opportunity to make Grudge 3 public when the time comes when they feel one more level of genuine hatred against civilization.
