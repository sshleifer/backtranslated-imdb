Why should someone make such a movie? Why should someone invest in these films? Why should someone work on a movie in a film? Why should every theater show such a movie? Why should every television channel play such a movie? Why should every critic review such a film? Why should anyone watch such a movie? Why shouldn't the spiritual writers / producers / managers of such a film do mental research? Sometimes there are films that are so bad that they are good. This is a movie that is so harsh that it's terrible. Indeed, IMDb must set a "0" or even a minus dimension to cover the works of this terribly intimidating horror.
