This movie has some of the worst things I've seen. Dennis Quaid's performance was a high school caliber. Although it is hard to imagine a character like Jerry Lee Lewis, it can be done. Just ask Jamie Foxx (although Ray Charles had more depth of his personality and musicality than Lewis ever dreamed of). The Phillips brothers were the Dukes of Hazzard and Alec Baldwin plays Jimmy Swaggard as Donald Duck, who performs Shakespeare. When Robert Duvall played the state preacher, I bought it. Baldwin never made me a single word credible. The part of Wynona Ryder was the best and she was mediocre. (And can anybody understand how he was 13 when Lewis met him for another 13 years more than a year?) Some online controls show important facts presented by the film, at least not more than most Hollywood bio images. This movie made the ticket office bad and it should be.
