They did it again: the title of the old exhibition was threw, then nostalgia was destroyed by boring "transformed" things. The 60's comic was one of the most funny satire of super-hero comic books of that time. This sign was drawn between animals and humans on a half way, as the Mickey Mouse is. Here they use a real Beagle; it's the same as looking at Mickey Mouse with a real rat. <br /> <br /> Most of the smart schtick that made the original show funny is missing from this movie. Instead, we get a clumsy former police dog who is even older than Cad. And some pet owners who don't add the story. Cheesy effects (dog-speaking animation is embarrassing). Poor scripting. Stereotypical dwarf playing Simon Bar Sinister. The green noise box boy they hire for Underdog is painful. You would think they would have received an impressive voice at least to bring Wally Cox's humorously special voice to Underdog. But not. At least some praiseworthy references to the source material (such as rhyming lines) that raise it. All others should get the DVD from the original series. Look at it only in despair.
