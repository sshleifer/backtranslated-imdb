It wasn't a good movie. Poorly written and acted - the concept was not new, the influence of the poor and not the actor of Arnold Vosloo, who is actually a half-decent actor. I looked at it under some protest and only remember that I saw it before the end - it's so forgotten. Action seemed to consist of a number of blinds and looks. I was waiting for it to actually go and I long hoped it would end. As far as medical bits are concerned, I did not expect a true version of ER events, but it was just comic - I know Dr. I know what I'm taking - and the operational bits were just stupid. Don't waste your precious time - if you have nothing else to do - go out, call a long lost friend, look at the color dry, sort your socks drawing, do some household tasks. Avoid your danger.
