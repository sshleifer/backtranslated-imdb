I've seen inferior movies. It's bad, but at least not trying to be good, so it deserves a short applause. This is definitely a small budget for the B-film sci-fi genre. <br /> <br /> This is a garbage film, but it's a nice way and definitely worth buying if it's in your favored box. local supermarket. Amazingly charming, not just terrible. <br /> <br /> For me, it is highlighted when a Galaxina lover is going to save her. Turning up, he shouts "Bunnyfluff!" , which pulls your fellow sniggers. <br /> <br /> Sit back, drunk, enjoy!
