There are several ingredients in this movie: <br /> <br /> First of all, the mountain bikers are loaded with loads of good oil boys who have a secret desire to take the law. Secondly, the cops with the evil mountain range, which were controlled by Texas-grown outlaws. The third made a karate fighter, played by Chuck Norris. Fourth, the chick teenager brother Norris, who was captured by evil mountain fishermen. The fifth show Chuck Norris is slowly fighting. <br /> <br /> Now mix everything and what do you have? <br /> <br /> You thought this was one very mediocre movie!
