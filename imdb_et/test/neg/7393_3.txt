Well, they sent it to the TV between midnight and 2.00 - it seems like it's time to watch it and then go to bed later ... <br /> <br /> No, it didn't really live up to my expectations. I think Dogma's concept is good because the film gets closer to what really happens between the characters involved, by cutting out all the unnecessary effects and mood-shaping music. But this idea again requires some interesting activities between the characters. <br /> <br /> I can't say that I know King Lear (version of Shakespeare) very well if I knew this game, I would probably have been able to predict a lot of movies. <br /> <br /> Well, the crisis can bring the best and worst of the display - and we will certainly see some of the downside. Oh yes, the color of civilization and culture can be very thin and you can find the animal behind this color. <br /> <br /> When you compare it to "Italiensk for begyndere" (for Italian beginners) or "Mifunes for a song sung" (Mifune's last song), you see the same thing, but the opposite: the crisis can definitely bring people to their life more constructively to see. And if you dare to do it, you can win. <br /> <br /> When the movie was over, I thought, "That's why I've never seen it before ..." The film has its own beauty. The quality of the work of the operator, actors, etc. is good. However, the script may need more. Probably the plot wouldn't hurt.
