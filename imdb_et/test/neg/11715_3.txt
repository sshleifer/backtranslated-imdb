A couple of years ago, a couple of friends visited the video shop and I and we were in one of these moods to rent pictures without seeing. My friend grabbed the head of the family and was greeted by the head in the wheelchair. Well, what made us laugh and we decided to bet to see who was going to go to the desktop and pay for the movie. Well you thought it was me !!!!!!!! I've never been so distressed in my life. We got home and put it on and rolled on the floor for about 45 minutes because it was the most funny film in the world. I don't remember a lot about that, but one thing I remember was a blonde girl who got it in the back of some sons every 5 minutes. This head made me laugh and when I look at the comments of other peoples alongside this film, it makes me laugh even more. Family leader is so good and head is funny and im still laughing ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
