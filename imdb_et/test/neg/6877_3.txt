Here he is. A new icon of fear for the new millennium. Better than Freddy. Dangerous than Jason Vorhees. More evil than Michael Myers. Hard to believe, I know. But his time is here .... <br /> <br /> Ray The Prick. <br /> <br /> Yes, an antagonist, Ray is a complete stabbing. This is partly due to the naughty things he does. Also because he has a scar on his face (oh, scary). But mainly because Ray Prick is milked. <br /> <br /> Yes, Ray does not carry evil. She's not even cursed, not even a voodoo spell. No, Ray Prick is milked. As DeNiro once said, "You can get some milk with milk". And Ray is milked. How Do You Make Milk Evil? Snake nipples, I'll answer. Snake Nipples. <br /> <br /> Why does Ray ask? Because he's a squirt, I answer. Capital P. <br /> <br /> <br /> Watch the New Line images entitled "Freddy Vs. Ray The Prick". <br /> <br /> Did you think your new horror savior was Jeeper The Creeper? No more, cause Ray Prick is here. And I'm scared. <br /> <br /> Less damage to the atmosphere, PG-13, unigiginal work-minded quality because Ray is a star.
