The Propaganda-American military film, which appeared in 1942, is difficult for East Side Kids to resist those Japanese neighbors they mark in their neighborhood when they learn that they are too young to recruit. Ultimately, they learn that they were mistaken for some people in their mistrust, but they also stumble across a spy ring that they would then hit. The film is fairly harmless in its fashion, although some may be guilty because innocent Asians really came out during World War II. Generally speaking, this is a rather general effort, and both Leo Gorcey and Huntz's halls would be better moments, the best of which will come here when they do.
