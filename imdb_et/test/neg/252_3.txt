The reputation of "RVAM" preceded it. I heard it for the first time in one of these Medved-style movie books, "50 worst movies ever" or "golden Turkish awards" or something like that. The review of each film basically said that this movie was so bad that it would make you bleed from the eye. So, when the exhibited film company finally got around to show it, I was expecting a cathartic experience of being a true cinema. <br /> <br /> But Robot wasn't really that bad. Oh, this is definitely a "Z" movie through and out. Some of the copying of votes (as usual for Gordon Murray's imports) is terribly cheesy, and the film itself appears to be structurally Franken, because much of it seems to be the previous "Aztec Mummy" film, which is said by a leading person. Dead giveaway: anytime the question "Then what happened?" Asked more than twice in the dialogue, you look at the re-assembled material that is put together with little consideration of plot cohesion or momentum. RVAM: "Then what happened?" or "What happened?" at least four times in the first hour. <br /> <br /> Even without structural problems, the older American audience in the plot and dialogue doesn't change well. For example, if the hero explains (and explains and explains) this is a story. he adds a note to Dr. Kruppi, a "doctor who suddenly became a master of evil" and began to treasure his guard by the Aztec mothers. Background, no explanation, he just "suddenly turned evil". Of course, it was aimed at an indiscriminate audience. <br /> <br /> But this is "Robot", the supposed "showcase" of this movie. This robot is the worst special robot effect because "underwater kingdom" or even "Santa Claus v. Mars". Compared to this junk, Wizard Of Oz saw a tin-man look like a Terminator chassis that drove Linda Connor through a T2 foundry. The Aztec Mommy itself is well designed and executed; he is a recognizable undead, familiar enough to look like a mummy, but is different from the collection of "Boris Karloff" known to most American audiences. But anyone who has created this robot as a follow-up did not sense this idea ... nor any budget. They could at least give her some knees for heaven. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the title battle has died terribly and lasts less than 60 seconds. (I've seen convincing races on the younger, higher playgrounds that are more convincing.) Then the movie basically stops. This seems a bit pendent, considering how much time the film spends on the battle itself. <br /> <br /> Despite all these problems, the film is not terrible or incompetent, like the film by Coleman Francis or the film by Larry Buchanan. Compared to the "Monster A-Go-Go" or "Eye Creatures" attack, "RVTAM" is like Coppola's movie. It's just boring and boring and stupid. Participants are competent (B-way) and reasonably photogenic; Krupp, in particular, seems to have a wonderful time when he writes and plots and capers for his head and "Phantom of the Opera" suit. I often found myself at her, despite being a villain. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I've seen a lot, much worse. "Samson Vs Vampire Women" under "Interesting Mexican Minors".
