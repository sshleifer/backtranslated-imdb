I didn't like this movie.se, it didn't make much sense. it was hard to understand what actually happened. I didn't think it was scary. But I thought it was stupid, even absurd, but not in good shape. He was also "Silent Hill" in 2006, which I found confused and meaningless. "" Not so bad, but I think it's definitely below average. It's just something special. The script is just too confusing and there are things in the movie that I don't think should be there. I think Radha Mitchell is probably a good actor if she has more work.
