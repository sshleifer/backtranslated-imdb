Let me start by saying that I love Japanese cinema, literature and culture in general. I've seen many Japanese movies and enjoyed them, but "Portrait of Hell" (aka Jigokuhen) makes you ridiculous. The two characters dominate the characters - the "evil lord" in his privileged bubble and the "stubborn, crazy artist" are pure types with zero nuances or nuances, and all of their activities come from cartoons. The film wants to show terrible violence and raw emotions, but many of these scenes are so upright that they become ridiculous and the general feeling is the film made for television that went off the rails. If this rarely reviewed movie falls into your hands or reaches your city, keep yourself and pass it on.
