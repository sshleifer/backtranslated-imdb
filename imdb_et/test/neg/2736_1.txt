This movie was so terrible that I don't even know where to start ... The only positive thing I can say is that Luke Perry gave a good result. The whole movie was all over the place, there was no explanation of the causes of the breakages (only theories) or the rationality of these solutions, or why it worked. It was ridiculous! All the characters and their relationships were so fun, you just want to laugh! None of them had any background. The "love" relationship seemed to be added to the script, it was so uncomfortable. There's an army man; a big black general whose mouth has a permanent cigar, "AaarrGG! I'm a man!" attitude, such a pathetic bad boy. The two connectors who should be geniuses act like two 16-year-old frat boys. And then, in order to create some activities, they decide to make a stone on someone's shoulder and for the rest of the movie, he or she dies like a pneumonia or something ... and then plays the hero (the most exciting scene) !! help plan what to do, who knows what ... it's never a good sign if you find yourself laughing loudly in the middle of a dramatic scene ... in short; don't waste your time!
