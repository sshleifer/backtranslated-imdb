Most of the fearsome incandescent fumes from the low-budgeted years of the 1980s are always smoother than the old socks. This particularly unpleasant and amateur unpopular Chicago-agreed favorable base for the "nasty necrophiliac nutcase is open" blood flow is a depressive affirmation of this borderline's inappropriate fact. The bearded, dusky, long-haired, hip-eyed psycho hip-tree cake wearing a bead and flower shirt begins your usual casual fearsome killing, graphically killing libidinous young couples engaged in a tight sex event when the Mansonesque attacks are spoken. (Hmm, can I find a fairly obvious and self-rightly puritanic message here? ‚ÄùGee, could be a man.) A boy, is it a mentally unbalanced sick real son: after the female victim's knifing, our certified crackers kill their freshly killed bodies. (WARNING: Possible * in front of SPOILER *. At the end of the picture, the corpses are stuck to the police, who are bouncing when he is in the middle of an amazing man with a husband. And "Nooo!" Ear splitting crying!) Now this gonzo boy is not a sweetheart and a half? <br /> <br /> Too bad this flick is so badly made; if it had only been done with elegance and skill, it could have been a terrifying little fearful object. Unfortunately Wally Kozi's ham-fisted, Lamar "Larry" Bloodworth's stubborn static and stationary cinematography, Frankie's "Hollywood" Rodriguez's weak, monotonously headed "hard stone" score, mercifully cheap and persuasive makeup f / x, flat plain restless plywood, which acts terribly everywhere and unappealing non-pro, letargic pace (too much screen time is tirelessly wasted by police drab efforts to catch the wacko), especially the flat probable shocking "surprise" ends (mystery killer real identity is guaranteed to make you angry), Evenly boring, incessantly sliding and positively braindead characters, and persistent consecutive dull soft core sex scenes that are about as erotic as looking at two images of 90 minutes straight all together up to one deeply dirty and unrewarding limp, soggy noodle crummy clinker. To be right, this film has one perfect virtue: the mad dog's slasher will undoubtedly have a wonderful taste in the tropical tropical, louder than the thunderstorms of the thunderstorms in Hawaii.
