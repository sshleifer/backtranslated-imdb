A couple of explanatory notes are in order. Herschell Gordon Lewis gave a brief introduction to DOCTOR GORE (aka THE BODY SHOP) video release, where he touched his co-operation with J.G. "Pat" Patterson, DOCTOR GORE Head and Star. At the end of the 1960s, Patterson created "Gore Effects" for GRUESOME TWOSOME and some other Lewis films. Lewis notes that although 2000 MANIACS was a "five gallon" film (the blood of the necessary stage), Lewis-Patterson's productions were "fifteen gallons". Lewis does not describe DOCTOR GORE as a "fifteen gallon" movie - he only talks about the movies he & Patterson did. Lewis has admitted (elsewhere) that his introduction to DOCTOR GORE was improvised before he even saw Patterson's movie! So take it with a salt blade. <br /> <br /> It may be an "unfinished" movie, but like some unfinished novels, it also has an "end". There is no connective tissue. <br /> <br /> Patterson has a certain number of stages and a dry sense of humor to help you monitor this simplified example somewhat more than you should. There's a lot of bare bones - even BLOOD FEAST is more complicated - and a gentle repeating musical score by William Girdler. A little nudity and a lot of skin. The entire middle part of the movie involves building a "perfect woman". it is concentrated gore bloody and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Director Patterson is on top of his head, but he tries to make his story creative when it is possible to use Frankenstein's clich√©s creatively. The best reason to see this movie (if possible) is that it has the perfect Nashville craze, Bill Hicks' "Heart Dies Every Minute". Isn't that the truth!
