It's a little hard to believe that it came from the same director who gave us HELLRAISER. Where is Style, Predictions and Magic? I mean, HELLRAISER is not a big horror movie, but at least it had something. NIGHTBREED is like a big bad ball of bad ideas. The problem is a nuance from the opening: monsters are shown in the first picture! An open dream sequence shows too much too much. Our hero does not show any professional action skills (but no one expected it in the bitter genre). There are murders that one wants more interesting. Then we have David Cronenberg. The man was never meant to be an actor. He plays a terribly psychiatric role, but what he should have done was a step behind the camera and saved this catastrophe. Then we arrive at Midian, who is a terrible fake grave with a horrible gate. This thing is not a huge improvement on the cemetery PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. It gets worse when we meet the beings in it. There's nothing really wrong with the design and make-up effect (well ... except the boy who doesn't have the scalp, the boy with the sharp chin and forehead, and the fat boy with the dark circles around his eyes) how they operate and the terrible dialogue given to them. Barker's underground city photography is tired and this part of the northwest could have been much better. Some may call SPOILERS. After our hero dies and becomes "night", we are looking forward to see what he is going to change (flights and werewolves are there), but when the time comes to change, they heroically thought their hero was too beautiful. decent creature design. Cronenberg's "character", in turn, makes the story more interesting until fighting fears and norms (which is just bad). Barker's mythology failed him here. There is no genius and little originality behind NIGHTBREED. The picture could have used a larger budget, a serious script and a character design that doesn't leave you saying "oh ... oh, how flat." What waste. Not scary, not cool, not very dark, but weak.
