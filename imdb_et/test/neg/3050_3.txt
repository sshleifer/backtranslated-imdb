Before Stan Laurel became the smallest half of the biggest comedy team ever, he worked under contract with Broncho Billy Anderson as a number of cheap, several major Hollywood attributes. Most of Laurel's "parody" movies are just a little funny and even less funny for today's audiences who haven't seen the original movie Laurel parodies. Fortunately, the "Mud and Sand" lampoons film is still well known: "Blood and Sand", starring Rudolph Valentino. "Blood and sand" appeared only nine weeks before this parody, giving you some insight into how fast Broncho Billy's films were performed, edited and distributed. <br /> <br /> Different sources (including IMDb) claim that Stan Laurel is the character of this movie called Rhubarb Vaselino, the ultimate "o". I have gone through the original with the title "Mud and Sand" (Hobo type letter), so I declare that Laurel's role is indeed called. But I agree that "Vaselino" is funny. Laurel copies the complicated shrubs that Valentino wore in "blood and sand" (he should have done them longer!), And there is a parody of this movie about Valentino's dressing scene, which made female filmmakers thrive in 1922. Carmen in the original film is parallel here as a caramel (a girl I would like to bite). <br /> <br /> This movie (like the original) probably appears in Spain, but there is a banned gag. Laurel uses the distinctive hats here that would have become her trademark (like Hardy's characteristic tie twiddle), but I've never seen it in any other Laurel movie. There are some interesting dialogues: rhubarb petroleum jelly tells other mathematicians to "save my bull." If petroleum jelly becomes a successful toreador, he says there was no "pull is, sir" ... which is funny, but I was disappointed that Laurel didn't replied "without WHAT?". <br /> <br /> Here is one funny moment that was almost certainly not planned when Vaseline shows bullfighter hearings. Laurel's bubbles are in bullfighting and - before you can say "repeat querida", he throws a fence over the fence where he lands near other auditors. The bull is obviously fake, but it's a funny joke ... and Dad, there's a title card with a funny "bull throwing". The moment of serendipitous occurs when Laurel repeats the gag and on Vaseline there is another horse above the fence. It falls on its butt and balances in an upright position just before beating. Very funny! If someone was going to have this effervescent comedy, I'd welcome an unknown gagsmith ... and a technical man who would stumble upon his position. It was more likely that happiness happened, and the director and editor were smart enough to keep it. <br /> <br /> In a quiet era, when Hollywood made a great-looking feature film set anywhere where people don't speak English, it was a normal cinematographic device to show a local text or caption in a link, then break the same text in English. I was surprised that this low-budget comedy spent money copying this device here: we see a typeface outside of a message with a Spanish message, then it dissolves in English with the same text. Unfortunately, the photos in this lowo movie are so dark that the effect is wasted. <br /> <br /> The actors in this movie are attractive ... including Broncho Billy's wife Leona Anderson and Stan Laurel's wife Mae Dahlberg; the latter dances briefly. (Mae was dancing in Stan's vaudeville work.) I was surprised to note that Charlie Chaplin's half-wheeler Wheeler Dryden was brief, because there was nothing to do with this film in Chaplin. "Mud and Sand", Laurel gives a funny performance that is quite different from his later familiar Stanley character ... but this movie is much less funny than his excellent work with Oliver Hardy. My rating: only three out of 10. TRIVIA'S NOTE: Twenty-three years later, in Stan Laurel's last American film "The Bullfighters" (1945), he once again played a Spanish bullfighter (with his Spanish voice post-dubbed). The movie "Blood and Sand" was randomly used: not a Valentino movie, but a remake of Tyrone Power. "Mud and sand" is more fun than "bullfighters", but not much.
