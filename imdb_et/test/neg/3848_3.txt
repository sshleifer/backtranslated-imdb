Just to save you $ 3 or whatever it costs to rent movies at your local video store. Go to your friend's home, talk to them about renting Pest, watch the first 30 seconds or do an excuse. The opening sequence is really funny, definitely worth it. Unfortunately, 99% of the movie is terrible. Without a shower scene, this is one of the worst films ever.
