The original WASC does not have to look at the film in any way. In fact, if it wasn't cooling down for the first 25 minutes, there would be no logical reason to see it. Transformation takes 25 minutes and makes them a mediocre 85-minute teenage horror flick. <br /> <br /> Now I have nothing against PG-13 horror movies, but the tendency around them becomes a sheep. If you see a PG-13 rating, then you are waiting for a movie full of false fears, teen t.v. or music letters and plots that have been used many times. Don't even ask gore or violence. <br /> <br /> I know it is not right to compare both the original WASC and the remake, but I think it is necessary because the new idea is based on the beginning of the original. Through the first film, sensitive tension is not present in the reprocessing in any way. Not even with amazing settings or high flash usage. There is no tension, tension, excitement. The movie gets too slow before it gets a little "interesting" and a stranger appears. The running sequence is probably the best part of the movie, because at least it is "what happens next?" But that's it. Situations created for excellence are predictable, boring and sparse. In the original case, the most important thing for the film is to listen to the scenes, but also to cool the most important scene of the movie. Now, I understand that this is a PG-13 horror movie, but when you respect the original. Why change its most important situation? Children do not have to live! After the end I felt that the movie was pointless. So the babysitter played the cat and the mouse with the wack ... is that? Then the hospital was a fool. And worst of all, it means that the sequel can be on the way. Camila Belle is the best thing in the movie. It offers cute, incredible performance. He must choose better projects, although this role will be for his thousands of teen fans. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. Some people say that in order to support Horror's genre, we should support any future movie. I do not agree. If we ignore movies like WASC, Horror film producers understand that we do not accept CRAP. We want good horror films, not flat flicks that are full of false fears. <br /> <br /> Look at the original "When a foreign call" instead of being the first 25 minutes, better than the whole (meaningless) remake.
