Well, well, I had seen a lot of comments about it and a lot of promo that always depicted dumping. But this flick is tough. And I mean it in every way. It is hard to find a copy because it was a small budget standalone publication, and because MPAA was hunting for every copy of VHS, it came out without evaluation, but it had to be rated MPAA. So the copies disappeared in the underground scene. All the people in this flick never did anything else. It made this flick unique. VHS copies almost do not open on ebay or other sites, and if they pay, you pay $ 100. But thanks to U.S. associations, I was able to get rid of DVDs all over the world. Limited, but it was supposed to be sort of official. Now and then there are still some splatterfest screens. But does it deserve the surrounding hype? As mentioned earlier, it is difficult, but also to sit. There are killings of murderers, there are necrophilia, nudity, but the caps are also much talked about. And frankly, if you want to watch the movie in 5 minutes, the killer's mind ends. Blood flows and it is indeed splatterfest, but not all 80 minutes long, spraying abundant for 10 minutes. The film's quality is okay, sound is fine, no lift, colors okay, black is black and not blue like in many small budgets. It's okay to look at it, but you're never scared, but it's one to look at your friends with beer and a seal that I think. 555, naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah 333.
