This film is far and far from the shadow of any doubt about one of the worst and most despicable films in the universe history. <br /> <br /> It's really * bad. Personally, I've always enjoyed the innocent joy of a terrible movie and I rented it, I thought it would be one of them. That was not my enormous disappointment. <br /> <br /> The script is delivered in a way that sounds like they read lines directly on posters, this story doesn't make any sense and the actual movie looks like it's done on a video camera. I couldn't even look at it. It is even worse than the "Witch Academy", and it is quite self-contained. <br /> <br /> I can't even understand how a director could shoot this movie, and then there is a point in believing it was decent enough to release. <br /> <br /> Painful, terrible, terrible.
