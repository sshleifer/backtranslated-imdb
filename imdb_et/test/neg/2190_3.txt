Los Angeles Doctor Tom Reed (Vincent Ventresca) is living in a tragic car accident, but arrives in prison in the California desert. When his time is over, he lands in a small, wind-sweeping city called Purgatory Flats. His first stop is the bar, where he quickly beats the beer and becomes an employee. So many former drawbacks that have hard work to find. This is the first in a series of long absurds that make up the foolish attempt of the writer / director Harris Done with a modern, desert package, a film of a movie. <br /> <br /> His first evening work, Tom meets a sexy femme deadly named Sunny (Alexandra Holden), who hangs with the bad boys' family: Mecklins, which consists of Uncle Dean (Gregg Henry) and his two nephews, a drug addict Owen (Kevin Alejandro, who is Sunny's wife, and AWOL's soldier Randy ("90210" Brian Austin Greer). After the end of the shift there is a shot there and Dr Tom is just near. He agrees to treat one wounded and most importantly not to tell the police. I'm not sure it's a good hand if the boy's fresh out, but this script (written by Diane Fine) is very little related to logic. <br /> <br /> Tom makes a lot of bad decisions that will further bother him and will become even more entangled with criminals Mecklin Boys, including stealing medical supplies and getting into Sunny's bag. Everything in the theater screams, "Don't do it! Walk away", but Tom does it anyway. <br /> <br /> In the classic movie Noir like "Body Heat" or "Double Indemnity" and recognize William Hurt and Fred McMurray as they are sucked into the bright, sexy, frightening femme deaths like Kathleen Turner and Barbara Stanwycki . It's not their fault. We would probably be tempted by all that money or that special dame. But Dr. Tom's weakness seems to be due to stupidity more than circumstances. Sunny is sexy, but not very convincing in nature and money is not tempted to attract. You don't know if he was in the same medical school as dr. Nick Riveria from "The Simpsons". <br /> <br /> A foolish script would, in your opinion, have believed that there is almost anything in the redhead rural area you need to have an inflammation of the abdomen and that it could easily be watched and effectively involved in fist fighting. It gives us an incredible car chase of one of these "club" affixed to the steering wheel. Oh, that oil tanker that just exploded - no one noticed it. <br /> <br /> I don't know how such a ridiculous script ever became green? Perhaps Brian Austin Greer has more juice than I gave him credit. It is obvious that he took a relatively small part of Randys, who is the murder of a hot headache, to show manufacturers that he has more scope than he showed "90210". <br /> <br /> It is also sad to see Nicholas Turturro playing a stereotyped Hispanic drug dealer. He deserves better than this. <br /> <br /> If you have more than 50 IQs, "Purgatory Flats" will shake you. I give this 3 star unintentional laugh and scenes where sexy Miss Holden runs around her red panties.
