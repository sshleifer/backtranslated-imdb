Doug McLure has some kind of movie that is a guarantee of uncertainty. His DG initials are like a special cinema certificate somewhere before 'U'. <br /> <br /> Cushing, on the other hand, seemed to be suffering from both the diluting agent and his own poor assessment. He did an excellent job in Hammer films like Dr. Van Helsing. I saw her make a very satisfying Sherlock Holmes "Baskerville hound". And his magnum opus was probably in the first "Star Wars" Grand Moff Tarkin. The only person, but the emperor, who could tell Darth Vadar that he was stopping bullying and going away. But - crikey! - He has made some turkeys. It was one unfortunate "Dalekide" movie. And here's another one. <br /> <br /> There is a machine hijacked from Tracy Island. It is a cylinder with a screw on the front and traction on the sides. I'm surprised that Jerry Anderson did not complain about plagiarism. Maybe he was bought. But if the movie is a guide, they can't pay him much. <br /> <br /> It's 1976 and we're still playing latex romper suits. <br /> <br /> It's really about that. Some movies have the value of entertainment as "bad for this good" category. It can't even manage it. It wouldn't even be kids entertaining. "Crash Corrigan" things from the 1930s have done more.
