"Finding Five Characters Out" must be one of the most boring "zones" ever made. It was this morning in Sci-Fi and, as usual, I changed the channel. I put it on my five worst "zones". Bored and predictable and not worth watching. Serling worked on the death of the subject (the fruits of foreigners, who were often giants) and in this particular version it just does not work. Anyone who hasn't seen it before will start to find out quickly. This is another Serling philosophical mood that can be parallel to situations in a prison prison or concentration camp, where a prisoner may lose interest in finding out where they are or fighting these prisoners. William Windom, the soldier who is the last to "fall", is the only one who wants to make an effort, and finding that result won't take long.
