I'm not afraid of bad movies. I like bad movies. I enjoy them in my friends company. We are all very well. By saying this, let me tell you how much I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> First, it was incomprehensible. Rob Lowe is attacking some people, they capture him, but he escapes in this great fire. There's the singer we think he died, only he didn't do it, maybe there are some who all work and look the same. Cue Burt Reynolds to come and ask the singer. She looks like she just walked into this movie from Walker, Texas Ranger and is confused. Then Rob Lowe dies, only he does ... And the worst thing is that there is not enough dialogue or action that does not involve killing people or even trying to make this movie fun! And don't even get me started on random chihuahua. Then it was that it was supposed to be about the decay of old power plants in Eastern Europe. We didn't know where we were, all the accents were probably "Eastern Europe" and what did Burt Reynolds and Rob Lowe do first? <br /> <br /> I was desperate to talk to people about the blockbuster I was thinking about this movie and get my money back, but since I got it special (only $ 99), I decided against it. But what do I want to know is HOW THE DIRECTOR WAS GREENLIGHT to make this tough film and what did the "stars" mean when they signed?
