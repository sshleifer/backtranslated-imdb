This is a film that is loved by 50-year-old teachers and people who are aware of social issues - but really have no idea. Actors - I think they are all amateurs - do their best, but the script is so full of clich√©s and stupid things they can't save. kids work - bring back all of your worst memories from classrooms at school. The lyricism of one song in the morning translates into fast 2.30: "I am a dwarf of society, an emotionally paralyzed person." <br /> <br /> Please!
