The final frames of the original "American Graffiti" provide one set of summaries of the fate of the four central male characters in the film. Although somewhat sexist, leaving out female characters, the end of the original film ultimately resulted in all the people who would even like the most horrific fans of the movie. But someone felt that mega-taala could be done by describing the harsh lives of these characters after the end of the original film. Bad movement. It was far from the talents of these almost impossible films that the insurer and his wife, private private Vietnamese making in Vietnam, dragging racer and overgrown hippies were interesting situations. Although most of the original cast is back, only Richard Dreyfuss is a good idea to stay away, "More American Graffiti" is a mess of foolish situations involving protests, car races, national singers and the Vietnam War. The use of shared screens, if it is believed to be innovative and bold, is too distracted here, and adds confusion to events that are already confused. This is a sequel that demonstrates almost anything that can be left aside. Perhaps it should be learned in film schools. Even using the music of the period, which was the joy of the original, has been badly done here. If you want more "American Graffiti", check the original twice.
