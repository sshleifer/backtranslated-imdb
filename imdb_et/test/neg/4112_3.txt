I start by recognizing that I have many movies with low ratings on this site. I find that when I see what the creators were trying to do, I appreciate their work. Thunder of Thunder was an interesting story for me. I wanted to see what angles filmmakers are telling the story. In general, they tried to create an entertaining film. The plot structure, but most action film plots are. Ed Burns doesn't know how to carry a rifle, but he still owns his well because he doesn't ask much. The main problem !! Destroying the whole movie !, is a terrible CGI. It is totally unacceptable for animals and backgrounds to see soooooo very fake. In addition, animal concepts could have been really good as well as action plans but failed because production failed. It could have been a truly memorable film if they had finished it. It seems they had to go back and fix all the terrible CGIs, but the money ended and still released. Save your money because nobody failed this movie. I give him three stars because it would have been really good, but somewhere else I couldn't say enough.
