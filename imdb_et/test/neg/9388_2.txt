On the positive side, it is quite observable. Negatively, it's uncomfortable to regret another 2 hours that was wasted on the screen. Long, small and pointless. And I don't want to say that, I wanted to like that movie, it seemed to have everything going on, so-called "buzz," and besides, it was bullying. There was a little more effort for this story, I believe it would have been amazing. And I hope that the team behind it will do a great job in the future, with a clear ability. But I suggest waiting for your future efforts, let this one.
