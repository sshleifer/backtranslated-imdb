Hubie - like the Stanely troll from the Blut A Troll in the Central Park - lacks a spark of personality, the main character who carries the whole movie. We should like him because he's nice, but that's all he's. <br /> <br /> Her character design is unpleasant. On top of her head there is a kind of dome that is narrower than her main red bottom. And penguins shouldn't have teeth. I know Iago, a parrot in Aladdin, had teeth, but maybe it worked because it made him see more of his voice artist Gilbert Gottfried. Hubie, with his small voice (offered by Martin Short), is keen to see that his rod has a large number of carts. <br /> <br /> Tim Curry, who is usually jealous of evil, makes some kind of accent on dippers like a villain (could have been a good voice for a comic book maker, not a supposedly threatening main villain). <br /> <br /> The whole plot revolves around the love of a hero and a villain against a woman's penguin Marina, who is just as dull as her two defendants. <br /> <br /> The worst is the pace. We look at her back to look at her threatening Marina even more - this time in a dialogue, this time in a song ... <br /> <br /> Barry Manilow can be a great singer, but in such animated films and Thumbelin, his songs feel sultry and hopeless - especially ballads. The only song I liked was the song "Good Ship Misery" of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> I read that the distributor made some cuts to the filmmaker's wishes in this movie and that could have caused some problems - although I suspect that the real problem is that they didn't cut the rest;).
