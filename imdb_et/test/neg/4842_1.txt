I mean, come on! Now my fellow countrymen have begun to do the Western peoples! Isn't it enough that our cinema already sucks? Now you have to infect English movies with Polish action and don't make any sense? Please stay away from this movie, don't waste your eyes. A 5-year-old child could make a more meaningful film. I'm from Poland and I'm ashamed that your title is actually following it. Please, I ask you, DON'T look at this movie and if you do, DO NOT evaluate Polish people and Polish movies based on what you see there. We had good movies in our history and we had some bad things, but that's - it's something worse I've seen in my whole life. Stay away !!!
