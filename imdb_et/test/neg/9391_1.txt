I have to admit right away that I didn't watch the whole movie. I stayed during the first hour of the Sci Fi channel transmission. Or did I save the first hour? The other reviewers praise this nicely. It was poorly prepared. Wrongly written. It worked badly. <br /> <br /> But for me, the worst thing was ADR. The whole movie, which seemed to be duplicated, sounded like what was done in someone's garage. The words had an enormous echo that just earned a bad dialogue. And hang. And hang. Even a movie made for television should have recognized it. <br /> <br /> And the idea that varying dimensions have been differentiated by color saturation went out in the 80s, people.
