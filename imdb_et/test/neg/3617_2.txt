Don't waste your time. One of those cool boxes you pull in Blockbuster, but not even worth it. You don't say, "It's so bad, it's good." Just, "It's bad." The biggest American hero is a writer who rents a salon on an African island called Snake Island. Some other tourists are on a boat that falls down, but they don't stay on the island. They just stop to let the writer down. Then there is a boat on the boat and - in true Hollywood originality - the only radio on the island. So they're going around and seeing the bunches. Like hundreds of those that really irritated you and you knew the plot wasn't going anywhere. It's not like it would have been one of the main snake. Like a gigantic mutated snake or an extra toxic king with all snakes. Instead, there is only a bunch of ham-egger snakes for all breeds. Their only purpose was then to escape from the island ... as opposed to conquering the enemy. Because there was so much snake, they knew they couldn't kill them all and they didn't try. I've seen a similar movie where the birds were haunted by the snakes and they took all the snakes into the caves and blown it up. At least then you feel that the good guys killed the bad guys and that was the normal end. Snake in Iceland (by the way, every single sign was shocked to see an island snake ... duhhhhh, that's for NAMED Snake Island reasons), there was no other plan to try to get gas to a stupid boat. Oh, they never do gas. They "just happen" to find another gassed boat on the island.
