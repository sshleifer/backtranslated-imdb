Interesting concept became a carnage ... <br /> <br /> My first vision of Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper), when I was interested in it for the first time, seemed an interesting concept at that time ... <br /> <br /> Shakespere + Aussie Movie + Gothic Setup + Melbourne Gangland <br /> <br /> A very strange mess that turned into a catastrophic Aussie cinema that gives my country a bad name ... <br /> <br /> Pros: -Interesting <br /> <br /> Cons: - Good cast waste - Strong and stupid plot - Curved camera corners - Not many different locations -Shakespearian diologist use <br /> <br /> Generally: Australia's worst experiment with Shakespere movie, Stick to Baz Lurhman ... or Romper Stomper (WARNING: This movie is dangerous)
