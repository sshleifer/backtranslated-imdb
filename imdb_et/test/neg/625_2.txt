When I was 8 years old and went through my Marx Brothers phase, I read from my father's TV guide that they would show Marx Brothers "The Big Store" late Friday night and set up a videotape for me. When I woke up on Saturday - there was no doubt in my TV guide that my father was in my print, and we found the story of "Humanity" instead. <br /> <br /> The "Great Shop" was probably one of the least funny Marx Brothers films, and yet it is one of the best cinema works of the century compared to "The Story of Humanity". I can almost justify TV Guide's bug, as Marx Brothers - Groucho, Chico and Harpo appear on both films. Although they are divided into several independent scenes: "Groucho plays Peter Minuit, Chico plays some guy who talks to Christopher Columbus and Harpo plays Isaac Newton ????? The harpo scene lasts about half a minute; Chic has only two or three lines; The Groucho scene is at least funny, but according to today's standards it is terribly racially sensitive. The rest of the movie doesn't mention. They trotted out some of the best actors of the day and made them all about garbage. What a disappointment. <br /> <br /> TV show, I sent you a nice letter, I'm still waiting for an excuse. <br /> <br /> For the record: "The Big Store" is a wonderful little physical comedy with Marx Brothers on roller skates and a couple of songs from Virginia O'Brien. I was really looking forward to it.
