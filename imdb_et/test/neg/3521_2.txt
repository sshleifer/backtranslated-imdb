usually a bad-start movie is in a badly philosophical form. This bad film began to become much better before a sudden dive. Except for the male antagonist, it was terrible. The plot was essentially created for the ultimate base, which is apparently good as a performance artist, but it was executed in the film. Not sure why this movie is made.
