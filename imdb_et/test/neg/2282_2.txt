I was extremely disappointed about it. Having just read the wonderful story of Oscar Wilde, I had hoped that at least one little charm would translate to the screen. Well, there was nothing. This version played like a condensed, buggy Reader digest movie. Not only did he feel hasty, but also cheaper and unwritten in writing. Larger characters and plot points were either modified or completely removed. I appreciate the difficulty of bringing the novel to the screen, especially what may be a very limited (TV) budget, but there is no excuse for a big story in this way. I strongly recommend reading Wilde's story about the badness that exists even on the most beautiful exterior surfaces. But I can't recommend anyone to rent this travesty.
