It was the most interesting horror strike I saw so far. The assumption is forgotten in about 1 minute. Operation is terrible. The scary thing about this movie is when two guys can, yuck! What were the judges of the film festival when they gave the "best movie" mark of this garbage? The only reasons I didn't turn off this movie were to see what not to do as a filmmaker, and if the paper plan line could really continue as it was. The latter concept was not disappointed. There wasn't even any nudity or gore to keep the kids interested! I also thought it was sticky to use for about 3 minutes in "Resident Evil 2" movie ... Was it supposed to be a filler? because it was the most interesting and interesting part of the movie.
