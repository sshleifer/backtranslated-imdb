I gave this film 2 mostly because it really is ok, but the film itself is just that (add an unusually rude word that begins with the sixth letter of the alphabet), meaning that I felt bad that I voted for its lowest voice at the time I voted. <br /> <br /> A very predictable plot .... two nare-do-well musicians do not have the money and the money. But when a friend leaves for care of purses (belonging to drug dealers), of course, they spend that and then "fun" begins. <br /> <br /> It's not the original idea of ​​the whole movie.
