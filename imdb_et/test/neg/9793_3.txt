The tedious bark of the film, which leaves nothing of its predecessor's "1933 gold-miners" attack. The production code was firmly in place during the release of this film, so humor is a hokey, wocka-wocka variety, and dry one-liners that sounded like a cosmopolitan that dropped the first film on the lips of gorgeous doods. The characters of the second-degree stars and characters are going through this movement, and the motto of the "puttin on show" seems terribly forced; here instead of a Broadway brand or break the world, the exhibition is a charity event organized by a swanky hotel. Who really cares about whether the display goes on or not? Of course, the big number of the movie "Broadway Lullaby of Broadway", which is accompanied by a long fantasy dance number from celebrating the final death of the society of New York, is not exactly the same effect as the "forgotten man" number as the finals of '33. Busby Berkeley manages this film and choreographers, and any promise built up in the film's liquid opening scenes is getting worse. Unfortunately, no one learned a lesson from it, and two more years later there was a film of gold diggers. <br /> <br /> Rating: C-
