All the bad comments about this movie and add them the same way. It may seem that Australians are frightening soldiers instead. In this movie, it was very horrible and too graphic. I didn't see enough heroism just about the coward that is ashamed because it's not something I read. We don't need violence like we could use our lively imagination of what they went through. It's like saving private Ryan, where the Nazis slowly push the soldier. For example, Mel Gibson is an extreme leader in his films, not because of violence but because of historical inaccuracy. Iwo Jima's letters were one of the war films that were close enough to history (though I may be wrong) except for our fathers flags and the Kwai River Bridge. You do not read this as an insult to the victims and the fallen people, if you do not speak it right, and the film goes on for too long, that there was nothing interesting in the dialogue and the Aussies were not enough to kill Japan. soldiers. Just read the history on the internet, masters and books. Movies always kill the feeling of realization. What they did to the military in Singapore and the Philippines was simply terrible for the civilian population. It just makes me proud that the goodies beat the baddies, but such films destroy it.
