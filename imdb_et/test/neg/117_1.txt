This flick is a waste of time. I hope the action film has more than two explosions and some shots. Old Damme is acting awfully. He was never a big actor, but here it is worse. He was definitely better at his earlier films. His part of the scenario for the whole movie was probably no more than one stupid abandoned one liner. The whole dialogue in a dialogue is a disaster, just like a plot. The title "Shepherd Dog" makes no sense. Why didn't they call it "Border Patrol"? The scenes to be fought could have been better, but could not afford it, or the choreographer suffered due to lack of ideas. It is a cheap low-activity cinema.
