It's currently on my TV ... but only so long as I can stop the panic with this comment. The previous comment told me that this film didn't improve, no matter how much I hope and pray. I agree that this movie is a colossal waste of my time and would be from your time ... it doesn't fix! I can't believe this scriptwriter makes Selr Shrugged! I hope he has improved a million times! I see some other credits in my CV that have had good reviews but I'm still not convinced. If you are familiar with your work, please send something here because I really want to see Atlas's shoulder and hate it when that man changed the garbage of this movie.
