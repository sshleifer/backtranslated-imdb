I was watching this movie for about an hour (against my will) and couldn't finish it. I value it as 0. Writing was bad, the plot was predictable and done too many times. The most disturbing part of this film was Melody Thomas Scott. This part did not require someone to appear as a snob, but he managed to see (sour) snob on each scene or someone who was going to be very sarcastic or cruel. <br /> <br /> Two pairs of romances that seemed to be almost serious at the couples meeting were a bit too much. <br /> <br /> I should know better when watching TV. If there is nothing on the TV and this is the only choice, read the book.
