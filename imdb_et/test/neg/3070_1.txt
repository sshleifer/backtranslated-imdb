Every movie should have an idea; Simple or complicated, needs one ... Problem with Fragata, it's once again that when he decides to make a movie, he wants to "do" that he forgets this main detail and as a result we are characters without any justification, no behavior for justified reasons ... they are simple dolls running along the wind of the film. It's boring and sad to see that they appear and disappear as the cards are thrown away. Fragata always seems to be a talent for her work ... and it will lead you to look at what she did ... but in the end there is always great disappointment. It is not enough if the movie is filled with "hot Portuguese pink magazine letters" ... especially if half of them fail to act ... but pretend to be funny. My only good point goes to actor Helder Mendes ... one of the few non-letters: She is making an effort to create a certain credibility, and in such a dirty movie without any direction (I) I give her a lot of credit. But this film is worth seeing as "how not to make a movie" ... and if Fragata's previous works are bad ... this is a "masterpiece" for the AWFUL title. In a few words, .. Just check it out! It makes you good ... ... and if you do movies in your home ... ... and you always feel bad about your work ... so just spend 30 minutes to call it "professional" ... your home made stuff looks like a powerful Hollywood flicks compared to Sorte Null.
