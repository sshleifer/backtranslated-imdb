Poorly captured, poorly modified, clumsy dialogue, flat characters, failed novel customization. It's not really much worse. Decent action and a good popcorn saved me for half an hour - I felt more than three hours - boredom. Occasionally good linings. David is a twilight young man who has never lost his brother. She believes in the Chinese philosophy of mumbo jumbo video, although it doesn't seem to her much in real life. David is a gang of debt collectors, where each member has an IQ below sea level. The missing script, along with creative imaging and even worse editing, is what could have been a very funny case if the debt collection failed to look like an amateur homemade reality. <br /> <br /> David rents an apartment from primary school Harald, who trusts a couple of sentences about his importance, convinces David that he is dealing with Iceland's most dangerous. A seriously missing script does not give David any basis for its opinion. A couple of scenes showing that Harald was doing something David could have misinterpreted would have done the job. The potential of the film as a media, unlike the text of the book that this film is based on, is not used. <br /> <br /> First of all, David's relationship with the Haraldur in his debt collection gang raises his status, but the overwhelming paranoia criminal world forces David to show where his loyalty is. <br /> <br /> The plot is good, but it is based on the book. It could have been a much better film. A good scriptwriter could have done something like this. Unfortunately, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> Operation is generally good. Pétur Jóhann is great and credible as David. Eggert leorleifsson can't do a lot of work, but he does his best with little. Ingvar Sigurðsson and Michael Imperioli (in a small role) are right. <br /> <br /> Overall opinion: What could have been a rather funny and entertaining movie in the dark heroic anti-hero debt collector gang, after a bad manuscript, becomes a boring, poorly designed film. Being one hour and one and a half feet toes would be more enjoyable.
