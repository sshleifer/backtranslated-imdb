Some movies are not for everyone. It describes precisely Igmar Bergamani's Skammen (Shame). At only 18 I still have what I think you might call a small ADD form, and watch movies to be attracted. It was a shame that had a very interesting prerequisite for trying to spread the impact of war on ordinary citizens, but it couldn't do it for me. I don't know if it was subtitles, black-and-white filming, movie length, or the fact that my studies took two hours to do a huge chemical exam, but I didn't enjoy it. I understand that it is considered a big movie and very important in the history of cinema, but I think my teacher said that not everyone likes or likes it. I think I just want it to end all of its many aspects. Perhaps the translation lost something, but I felt that there were infinitely few shoots that never came to a conclusion. You would meet the characters and never see them again and understand why they were involved with the film. My general suggestion of this film is that it is worth noting, but only to shape your opinion on it. Whether you like it or not, you need to respect the point it is trying to pass on.
