I have one word: focus. <br /> <br /> Well. <br /> <br /> IMDb wants me to use at least ten lines of text. okay. Discuss fine focus points. I don't know about others, but in my first film school they taught us a lot of useless stuff like "you are one of the famous avant-garde filmmakers one day", but they also taught us how to make it crazy FOCUSING! it was amazing! you give a little twist and a spirit! everything is clear when it comes. the person who shot what alice found must learn some things about finer focus points. also lighting. this movie is not only out of focus, but also illuminated as in someone's basement. <br /> <br /> Don't even start with a stamp or plot. they could have cut every ten seconds from the beginning and the end of each individual picture. <br /> <br /> But who nevertheless cares? this movie is not fond enough to make up for the complete absence of the best friends of the movie - FOCUS and LIGHTING. <br /> <br /> Words of Wise Men.
