Lou Gossett, Jr. is a wonderful and enchanting actor, but in order to play the role of "president" and then act like James Bond, he runs around the Gun and enters the warehouse to expose the plot to kill Christians and then it is possible to escape the allegedly high security to ensure that one more day to live, does not do justice - this film is so many unresolved issues. <br /> <br /> I try to list just a few: <br /> <br /> 1 - what was the purpose of vaccine stocking if no one was vaccinated? for example, a preacher could be vaccinated if the "tribulation" had already received the vaccine - later, when Will Williams' husband went with the sick preacher and himself became ill; so the virus was therefore contagious? - If it was contagious, why did Ray and his wife go to church without proper protection? - Why didn't they get sick? - And when Chloe drank wine and was "treated", how did he suddenly know that wine was "an antidote"? - Was it a California wine, a regular red table wine? - Was the red grape juice sufficient - and if the preacher had at least every time he preached, "fellowship", maybe he would have passed his body with an anti-dote? - Buck and Chloe got a "heavy" vaccine box that was never used - what mysterious message should it be? <br /> <br /> 2 - The presentation of "evil" forces working with Anti-Christ Nicolai to destroy the world, because it is Russian, Chinese, etc., is really the era of the 1950s and early James Bond. shows the ignorance of modern society and humanity - do we believe that the Russians and China are trying to destroy this planet? - And what purpose, just destruction? - It was such a narrow-minded view of the world and was so clich√© that it would be ridiculous - the main purpose of this film was near the end of the scene where Kirk Cameron and Lou Gossett, Jr. promises audience non-conspiracy (showing Kirk proselytizing Lou) - it was a movie that didn't have a meaningful story, too much to a reality cut and a totally inappropriate plot for a great actor. available
