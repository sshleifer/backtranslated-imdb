As an alternative to reading the report, I rented a DVD store. But it is pretty much more daunting. <br /> <br /> Although the film may provide information on the information contained in the notification, you take the manufacturers' word - there is no reference to the Commission's report anywhere in the movie. None. <br /> <br /> Actress, everywhere, is pretty bad - pretty much all the stereotypes of "hot firing" nervous oral officials, each of whom knows more than everyone else. There may be a truth to this, but it really has a bad Hollywood smile. <br /> <br /> The IMDb user community ratings and comments tend to be correct rather than false, and I've started blinking ratings before I rent it. <br /> <br /> I wish I had this one.
