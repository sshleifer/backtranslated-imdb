I've never seen a B-movie like what the babysitter Sofia is killing ... a woman's hand appears on the tape ... how bad is it ??? LOL, I seriously laughed and wanted to stop watching the film, but I watched it to see if this movie could get worse ... LOL ... it's bad for yourself ... poor Pinocchio. for the first time you see the special effects of Pinocchio's face movement ... besides being the whole movie terrible ... it's not really worth your time if you don't have much to spare! But if you have nothing to do ... continue ... cure yourself with some "Z" movie cos B movie is too good for it ... LOL
