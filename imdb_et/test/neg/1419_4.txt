I saw this movie with Saturday matin√©e with a friend. The theater was about 70% full. <br /> <br /> Although there are quite a few funny lines, it is more like a drama / stop with humor sprinkled on it. Robin Williams gives a decent result like Laura Linney. Lewis Black is a good fan of the Daily Show. Christopher Walken also gives a good result. <br /> <br /> The film starts slowly and remains so for about thirty minutes, then the distance starts and begins to edge off the rest of the film. Excitement in supposed comedy film? I know that I, like everyone else on the ground, got a little bothered with it. The character breaks during the breaks of fun and you only hear one or two laughs in the theater. <br /> <br /> All righteousness was appalled after the end of the movie. So some people enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> I made this movie in four out of ten, because I believe that the comedy aspect doesn't work in the alternating / drama film and the actors' performances, though not bad, were just decent. <br /> <br /> Again, this movie is not advertised.
