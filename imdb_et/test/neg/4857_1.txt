I must say that this movie was really terrible. it was on average when the movie's pace was terrible and soundtrack and cinematography. I found that I had a boring movie in most parts and the clich√© lines didn't make me anything. The two main roles played by the boys were sometimes terrible and did not pull the emotions needed in the film. The little girl was sometimes horrible and looked like a doll that was scary. the end was not satisfactory, although the end of the movie that ended did not change me for hours. this movie was boring and did nothing for me, I recommend this movie to anyone.
