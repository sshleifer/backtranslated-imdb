What a depressing film. A small southern city is full of opportunities to explore the complexity of interpersonal relationships and the hidden undercover hidden under the bases, as anyone who has read anything from Carson McCullers. It doesn't. Instead, the writers agreed to cutesy twinkles, cheap warm fuzzies and banal melodrama. It looks like a movie made for television and it wasn't particularly different, but it's hard to imagine what anyone could have done to interest this material. <br /> <br /> The most depressing aspect, though It is a fact that there are many very competent and tempting participants in this casting, all trying to play the best things and doing what they can do - well, no other word - contempt . The tragic waste of talents, especially the waste of the great Stockard-Channing.
