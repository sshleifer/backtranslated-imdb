To get started, I love Steven Seagal, the man is the genius. But the latest movies leave me wondering if he's trying any more? His latest films show almost no effort on Seagale. It is too clear in Out of Reach that his lines are duplicated. . What Seagal does in this film is not only the face of the fans, but also Jean-Claude Van Damme and his fans. In Scene 2, or when he prepares a zip line for a drug dealer penthouse to steal jewelery and money, he shows him a gun and a hook to the neon sign. You can say to yourself, "Yes, what is Van Damm?" Well, the scene was stolen from a movie by Jean-Claude Van Damme called the Order. Rent both, look at both, compare both, and you lose the respect of Seagale. Not only did you die today, but it was, dare to say, insult. Seagal's Aikido moves are still good, but why doesn't he make good movies, such as Marked for Death or Law, he still has moves and attitudes, I just think about "Why Seagal, why?". His latest films include idiotic scenes that have nothing to do with story and such idiotic stories. I hope that the upcoming Black Dawn movie will be another Exit Wounds or Beyond Justice, because these recent movie discs, especially Today You Die, really made me wonder if he has things to do more great movies like Double Team. Please don't watch this movie if you hate Seagal if you love your movies, don't watch it, it will make you question in his future outlook.
