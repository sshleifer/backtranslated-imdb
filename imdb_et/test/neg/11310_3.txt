Only one word can be described by MR MAGOO - slapstick. Unfortunately, this is not AIRPLANE. It looks like MR MAGOO is doing it. Based on the old comic, Leslie Nielson plays Magoo, a worshiper near a blind man who steals a couple of jewelers. Now he must darken them ... with darkness. And all this movie is playing. The Darkness of MR MAGOO. Now, perhaps, if they had funny jokes related to it, but pretty much it is just one of those who "see your face that you're too ashamed to admit that you pay for watching this movie." <br /> <br /> But MR MAGOO is not as bad as it is hacked. This is at least some funny jokes, and it's a good healthy fun for the whole family (Nielson tried to make "NAKED GUN" for families in MAGOO, but it's not as close as it is so good). So, look at it once, you can hate it, you can love it. Personally, I didn't hate it, but I'm not sure it liked it or even appreciated it "okay." 2/5 stars for MR MAGOO <br /> <br /> JOHN ULMER
