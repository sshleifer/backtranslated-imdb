Detective Sergent Vince De Carlo (James Luisi) and the company are malicious for Serial Killer / Rapist. Will psychologist Carol (Susan Sullivan) help or become the next victim of the killer? And what is the killer fun with White Dude Afro? <br /> <br /> Inspired by the serum killer Ted Bundy, "Killer's Delight" or "The Dark Ride" is a rather boring Serial Killer story from 1978, which doesn't offer much. If anything, it is more of a police procedure strike than a horror film, because much of the violence is out of the camera. Of course, we have corrupted bodies, but we don't get much in the exploitation department, especially considering that they come from after-effects, not during crime. Those who like "Toolbox Murders" or "Maniac" are very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there is an impressive scene involving a woman trying to get out of the killer who gets to the right and is pretty suspicious to start. Also, John Karlen is quite effective as a murderer, although his fun hairstyle (white boys with Afros is always worth bothering) is more than a bit annoying. <br /> <br /> "The Dark Ride" is too routine and mediocre to really recommend a recommendation because it lacks the correct elements of exploitation, and it is dated even according to time standards. Those looking for a better example should probably turn to "Don't go into the house" and some others because it just doesn't cut it.
