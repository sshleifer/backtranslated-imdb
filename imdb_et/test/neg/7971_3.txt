First of all, I have to say that I have read all of this and I know it outside and I was glad to finally see it. But you just have to read this mini-book to understand that this is not a true story of what happened almost 90 years ago. It is loosely based on facts, the rest is taken from the imagination of the scriptwriter. And unfortunately, these changes are nothing more than successful and mostly completely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? Vita and Violet did not use the names of Mitya and Lushka until their thing began, and during that time Viita was named Vita Dmitri and Julian. It was Violet who drove Vitat with the servant when they were teenagers. The "seduction" scene when their thing began Violet was much more passive than represented here, and certainly Vitat couldn't kiss. I can go on and on, these examples were all involved when the series just started. In addition to any changes resulting from these facts, testimonials are also wrong. Sometimes Vita behaves like a crazy woman. Especially ridiculous is the scene she saw in the newspaper Violet recruitment announcement. Vita kept her emotions up and running. It was Violet, who was temperamental and lets her show feelings (good or bad). Everything Vita did when she read it, she almost fainted. Being a gentle nature, Harold kept confronting in real life, but here he is sometimes quite harsh and accusing. Harold and Vita always discussed their intimate affairs in letters, not verbally. And Violet ... I know that this series deliberately focused on Vita and Harold, but that doesn't mean that all other characters have to be just dolls. Here he is completely one-dimensional and the lines given to him are mostly embarrassingly low. In fact, he was an intelligent, talented, quite extraordinary woman, who has rarely given his earned credit. I've always thought he was much more interesting than Vita. This series ignores his misfortune, loneliness and his mother's problems. The viewer also has a small background image and family, which relationship (and marriage) was with Denys Trefusis or how hard he fought over Vita. Vita was the only love of her life, her raison d'etre, and when Harold suffered over time, Violet. After that, his life was in ruins, and he took time to pull him down again. Statue could have acted as Denys that his depth is his depth. Lady Sackville-West is just a badly drawn caricature; annoying chatterbox with exaggerated French accent. <br /> <br /> The series ends with a completely ill-written scene in Amien, and that was the end of the story, according to the scriptwriter. No, it continued throughout the year, and its end was much longer and more sad than the one presented here. But what cares about the stupid end when the whole series is stupid from the start. I have to give credit to the actors, they tried to give them the best roles, though Janet McTeer as Vita is the only one who really looks out. You also can't complain about settings. All complaints go to the director and most to the scriptwriter. Insightful character surveys instead have too many sex scenes and blissful conversation. Many scenes are too long, some are meaningless and do not produce a story on the line. On the other hand, many details are shortened or completely omitted. In particular, there should have been more information about Vita and Violet's young people and about their friendship. This is one exciting story that would deserve much better adaptation. Maybe someone can do it. Now you can read more about this story by reading the actual book or Violet's letters to Vitale, which are great things.
