I can't believe I bought this movie on DVD. I don't even remember that it was shown on television last year. Why couldn't they just make a real sequel to the next best Christmas movies in the world? The devil and Randy Quaid look like he's been on the same drugs as Jerry Lewis. I didn't know about this movie until I bought it this evening and thought I'd look out of the IMDb and see how it was rated. The boy made a mistake. If your reading warns this review, leave it away and just stay on your first Christmas holiday. At least I didn't pay more than 10 bucks for it. Maybe I can trade it and get half of that record. Then again not. PS I still haven't looked at it, my DVD player went to see another wonderful movie tonight, Riddick's chronicle (cut by an unrated driver), which was amazing.
