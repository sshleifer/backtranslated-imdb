I was ready for a bad movie and a bad movie, so I think I shouldn't complain. At Twentysomething, Tom (gay poster Robert Stadlober) has so many questions he doesn't know if he's coming or going. I wouldn't be left, but for beautiful girls: Serious Mavie (Anna Brüggemann); no-nonsense Angie (Emma Daubas); Sarah Baumann star in the movie star. And then there is Tom's soul mate, the wild eye of Margaret (Jana Pallaske). He reminds me of Béatrice Dalle and Gina Gershon. If you have to remember, these are good memories. She looks good even in more ridiculous equipment, and I mean even ridiculous even by Berlin standards. I don't know if I would have liked this movie when I was an age. I think I wouldn't. Watch out for Indie idols on Oli Schulz and Max Schröder's "Der Hund Marie" performing as street musicians with no pain.
