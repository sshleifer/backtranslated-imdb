It could have been a good biopsy, but what a mess! I had this movie when I was a theater director. When I put together the movie and watched it, I thought I had some rolls failed. As it turned out, it wasn't, and if I did, no one would have noticed. I couldn't figure out what was going on! Everyone who walked quite a lot felt the same way!
