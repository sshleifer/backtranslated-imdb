Cheesest movie I've ever seen, not scary, just bad. The first film made by WWE and trust me, the only person to whom this film can turn is wrestling fans. It has terrible action and the worst leadership I've seen. I found myself laughing at the story and the bad actors. I saw WWE people really trying hard to wrestle with many killings and several camera effects. I think they copied a lot from a quiet hill. Also, this movie doesn't work, so when you see it, you find yourself feeling it because it's not stopped. The end is the worst, no matter what you want, you want your money back
