In the mid-1800s, Irishman Dennis Hopper (Daniel Morgan) emigrated to Australia looking for a part of the continent's gold. Instead, Mr. Hopper finds himself a trademark and thrown into a torturing prison; there he is raped. When released, Hopper and Aboriginal David Gulpilil (Billyna), with whom he is seeking revenge for the Sadistic Hunter Hunter, Jack Thompson (Detective Mainwaring) and others, will be released. Finally, revenge becomes heroism; Hopper is admired and assisted by ordinary people and hunted by corrupt and powerful authorities. The "barely human" performance of Hopper is definitely suited to the scattered feel of the film. Mr. Gulpili manages strong supportive light. The staff at "Mad Dog Morgan" is not only worth it, but also a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> Mad Dog (1976) Philippe Mora ~ Dennis Hopper, David Gulpilil, Bill Hunter
