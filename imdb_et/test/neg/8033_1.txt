Even Mel Gibson could not save this movie slop. It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Why should mel Gibson make a movie that im sure he couldn't sit and watch? what was it? For all serious drugs that accused a schizophrenic woman who was also on some serious illicit drugs. For all the serious drugs there; you love this movie.
