Top weapon without internal hostility. Or class. Or money. Or Cruise. Sorry for the upcoming assignment of the next ambassador's actors to market their ability to lead a matin√©e is not really something someone would have their teeth. It is a disgrace because Charlie Sheen's opening game opens with a great promise that is almost immediately destroyed by a superfluous wedding set. Barking. <br /> <br /> Dennis Haysbert is a changing actor for me, but in this movie he's fine, especially the sequences of action. Michael Biehn is a first-rate hero, but not a leading person: Charlie Sheen is from all goals and leading people, but never quite an act. There are also hundreds of people who are also reputable. 3/10
