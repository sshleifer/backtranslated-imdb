My friend and we rented this movie 3.99. If I knew that this movie was totally terrible, I wouldn't have paid a cent. I had no warning about this bs. An actor can't even be called an actor, an inevitable sexual field is uncomfortable and you can say that both girls feel completely uncomfortable and a man's frog ... a god who can't say he's going to attack And musical hints ... my lord. This movie makes me cry. Never rent it. In fact, if you look at it, measure your eyeballs. This movie is not of God - it is hell. I'll take the last few lines to write blah blah blah shiz because I don't want to continue this review.
