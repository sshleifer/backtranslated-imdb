If you are a Catalan nationalist anarchic socialist who has outstanding respect for the mythologies of the Spanish Republic, this film may be for you. The two brothers, the real persons (one of them being Marc Recha himself), re-establish the fictional version of the actual journey they had made through the magnificent Catalan countryside, and history has emerged (bullet-wall pans, artillery booms) but has not been shown. There is very little dialogue and most of them are random: the story is spoken by a third person, the voice is an actor who deals with the actual sister of the actual brothers. The pictures have little to do with what the story is, which is not much. Many are stunning, burning pans over harsh semi-dry mountains and rivers (I think Terrence Malick or Gus Van Sant is not a bit of "Gerry" or "Last Days", with some stunning pictures and still frames. They can best be enjoyed with the movie's excellent natural sound environment and without the final annoying narrative or even the occasional background music (some pretty good, some pretty strange, but all free). The best thing about this movie is to say in these sequences, their occasional comments less than the inclusion of power plants and dams. <br /> <br /> Brotherhood remains sketchy and general; a big figure is a male biting cat that has never been shown. The more the director's Catalan-Nationalist anarchic commitments are suggested, the richer, unmodified the message of the film and the more irritating the narcissistic experience. While the director told NYFF screening that the film had been created with a third-party narrative from the beginning, I would like to see this version without narrative or music and only with natural soundtrack and minimalist dialogue - the result can be more mobile and in no way be so much uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, this is probably the only movie you see in the year when a man gets into his frame with his penis hanging (a swimsuit he was wearing?). This is one of the few moments of the whole movie where your interest is (sorry) hitting something that is actually happening on the screen (what is it? Why is it hanging there?), But as usual, no answers are provided. Very Warholian, very sixties and not a bit tiring.
