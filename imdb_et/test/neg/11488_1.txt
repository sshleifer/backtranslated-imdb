I'd like to say something about this movie. I saw comments on how beautiful the views of Russia and Russia were. Hey boys, this is not Russia, it is Bulgaria's more advanced capital Sofia. So it's not my country of Russia. About the film - well in Bulgaria, maybe after the Gray Zone - all films by American directors are terribly similar in one word. It is a shame that Patrick Swayze has to play in such low budget films. Most of the participants are Bulgarians, but really this film has no energy to say about the twist of the plot - a weak and boring film clich√© no more. Hey people remember that this is not really Russia it is Bulgaria.
