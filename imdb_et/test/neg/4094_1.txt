I hated this movie. Simply put, this movie is so bad that I almost never want to ignore it and never mention it. But on the other hand, I can't resist a good bash. And if there is one thing Evan makes to Almighty's audience, it will bring out the best criticism. <br /> <br /> The film (followed by a lot more fun with Bruce Almighty) will start again for the audience at Evan Baxter, just the best in the original film. This is correct. This movie doesn't show Jim Carrey or Jennifer Anisten. Not even a small cheeky look. You know your movie is bad than a man who agreed with Ace Venture: If there is not even a short role in nature calls. But somehow, they manage to consider Morgan Freeman as God. While sitting in a nearby empty theater in the absence of comedy, I wanted to remember that I couldn't wonder how much money Freeman spent on this movie. Then he hit an hour ago. It's just a hit role that takes all 20 minutes with a 100-minute movie. God just appears between scenes to tell Evan to build a ship. Of course, I know that Morgan Freeman doesn't look at this movie in a year and I think it's as good as his roles in Shawshank's redemption and Million Dollar Baby, but it's easy money. <br /> <br /> Where was I? Oh yes, the plot. Sometimes it is so difficult to focus on a plot if you realize that you thought more about the thought process than a scriptwriter. In any case, Evan (Steve Carell) has apparently left his work to congress the news as an anchor. Yes ... without a transition. He never turns to his wife and says, "I think I want to be a congressman." It just happens in the first five minutes and you are forced to deal with a big shift. As a congressman, he considers partnering with John Goodman's character as a bill to suddenly tell God to build a ship for Evan. No "Hey, how are you doing? How are you?" a little bit. Just "I want you to build a ship." Evidence of Wrong Writing: Evan decides that God will give him clues to build a ship after the fan keeps the mark, Genesis 6:14, when he walked his son, watching television with baseball. > It's basically Evani's Almighty plot. There are some randomly supported cast members who do their best to create comedy, but they don't do very well because they are not given almost any screen time. It's just the main activity of building a mill film. Oh, and there is also this mandatory scene where the father has to put his kids and women out of their travel plans because he gets busy with the job. They leave the disappointment, but they understand, as all other film films have done. Just once I love to see the youngest guy turn to my father and hit him in the jaws and tell him, "You're a real bastard to cancel your plans. I'm going to emo now." There is also the drama the father expects with his family when they understand (a woman, in fact, three children have helped to build a ship for the child) that she has gone crazy and she says that God wants her to build a big boat. But don't worry. Her family decides to hold her. Sorry, I just broke the drama. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that there is hardly any good comedy. I know it was decided to judge whether this is a PG movie to get a bigger crowd reaction, but I don't think I'm a minority if I think family humor is more than just boys who beat crapping in nuts and animals. Maybe I'm wrong and that's why high quality family humor is reduced. And if that is the case, please bring me more adult comedies so I don't have to sit over this mess anymore (no red is provided). <br /> <br /> The end is especially fun. Suddenly, the film takes a dramatic CGI filling that makes me tremble to think about how it is a terrible waste of CGI. I bet it was also expensive. Finally, after we wait, they say why God wanted Evan to build a ship. And boy oh boy hated the reason. I save the details, but it was like watching or reading the mystery of murder, and the killer was a person who walked behind the main game one second and had no lines. <br /> <br /> Oh and then it's fun at the end. The song "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" plays over credit and we are then cast under "dance". I can't get it. They spend 100 minutes in making an unsuccessful comedy and then they offer a thriller. I swear I wasn't scared to watch Steve Carelli's dance ... ... never. That's the people there. Evan Almighty is a movie of all time. <br /> <br /> All in all, I thought it was a wasted experience. I am confused by all the talented actors (Carell, Freeman and Goodman) who are present at this cage festival with Laurmore Graham, a wife of Gilmore Girls, who has not yet proved to me that she can get out of a paper bag. But first and foremost, I am surprised by my willpower to actually sit through the film without leaving. <br /> <br /> Rating: * Off ****
