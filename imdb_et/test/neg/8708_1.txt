This film was different from the Bible and so fell below the film line of 1956. I hate that they traditionally replaced the 2006 film with 10 commands. Moses saw in this film as a criminal who did not like the 1956 film Charelston Heston. I'm not wasting my time watching this movie. They tried to modernize this film so hard to keep you on the edge that it was rather a soap opera (not good). I am quite sure that the young people there, who have never paid attention to the ten original orders, may disagree with me, but my own. It also took ten years to make the first 10 orders, apparently it took two months to do so. The special effects were not as amazing as the first and after so many years of technology, you would have thought they would have done better now.
