If the alleged celebrity of the movie is that Martin Sheen's younger, lesser-known brand stars are in it, you know it's not really good. "Soultaker" is a small budget, a silly film about a group of 20-year-olds killed by an angel of death. It's a silly movie, but it's quite fun, and even foolish, even somewhat pleasant. <br /> <br /> The line in the movie is very small and stretched as far as possible. Joe Estevez is not much of an actor, so fortunately for the audience, she has very few lines and her role mostly when walking. This film really looks like it is trying to be a horror / fantasy franchise, given that it has the same plot layout as slasher. 4 characters, everyone dies one by one ... does he live? Who really cares. Although it seems I hated it, it didn't. I just didn't like it very well, but I was interested in it for most, so I think it reads something. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 out ****. 90 minutes. PG-13 for language, violence and nudity.
