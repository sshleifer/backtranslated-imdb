I apologize to myself, you know why. I feel wrong watching this movie. I went to the theater with some friends to see this movie, and still did not give it satisfaction to see it in full (I left about 20 minutes to leave ... hoping God could make me comfortable for at least a moment.) Most movies now, even those bad ... when I look at them, there may be a small part of the film where I sometimes feel joy because maybe a peculiar joke or a good line ... this movie on the other hand made me feel uncomfortable and crazy all the time, especially since I wasted money on it. It was badly written, poorly managed, ill-fetched and definitely badly acted ... <br /> <br /> For the sake of the well-being of mankind, this film is not even seen, even by your dude who wants to say seen like every movie ever. .. just not ...
