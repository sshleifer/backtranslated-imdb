I saw Ed Wood's biology several years ago. Tim Burton paid a loving tribute to this extremely forgetful but enthusiastic filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Then I saw Plan 9 and it pulled me infinitely. Stupid story, bad product values, but still fun and even funny. <br /> <br /> Then. What you can do about it. Well, as Wood has been reported to be a crossbow, it is amazing to see a movie that deals with it like a comic. Yes, there are some dances to teach the audience something about this subject, but in most cases it's some kind of really twisted self-esteem. One problem is that it has a hundred perspectives. On the one hand, this is a claim of tolerance. The second represents transvestism as a disease. And finally, it tells the audience, "Okay, if you're shocked now, wait until you see it!" The problem was that the wood had to compromise on making the film. You can almost feel this when you see the title of the manufacturer: Personally instruct ... So where we are. It is not a serious theme film, nor is it an extractor. <br /> <br /> Entertainment is practically zero. Speaking of wood is a little amusing, but only because it sounds so wrong. However, this was done in the 1950s, so it can be said that it was brave to make a film that even mentioned the word transvestites. It all comes down to what the film itself is trying to promote. Schock. Rape scene, while it is easy to do it. <br /> <br /> So, sorry. It has failed but Wood is not discredited.
