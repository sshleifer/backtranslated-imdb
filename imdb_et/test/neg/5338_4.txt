Oh gosh, I'm really tired of all these general Japanese horror films about the long-haired ghosts and ghostly children. "Ghost Train" is no exception. It is clearly affected by "Ring", "Ju-On", "Shutter" and "Pulse". Two years ago I was in such modern ghost stories because they managed to give me some goosebumps, unfortunately, there is nothing fresh or interesting about "Ghost Train". In fact, the movie is really boring. goes missing in the subway tunnel - as a primary school classmate Nana has to study the secret of several disappearances, with the help of a young train driver and the second "missing" mother of the child. The film offers somewhat creepy moments, but the effects of CGI are ridiculous and the climax is illogical.
