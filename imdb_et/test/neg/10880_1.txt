Under no circumstances will this film look. This is terrible for a number of reasons: <br /> <br /> No plot No structure No direction Not speaking No visual style No tension <br /> <br /> In word - no. <Br /> <br /> The best thing about the box and its end. Who could have guessed that 85 minutes could seem so long. <br /> <br /> Again, never watch this movie. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> No primer No structure No direction No action to speak No visual style Tension is not <br /> <br /> In short - no. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this box and the fact that it finally ends. Who would have thought that 85minutes would feel so long.
