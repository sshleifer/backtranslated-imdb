Cobb. It sucks. I didn't learn anything that he hadn't heard before. The performances were up. The scene where Cobb and Al are driving Reno women looking for a snowy road must be one of the worst ideas in the last memories. It's just STUPID and unusual. Backward sequences were terrible. And they used the same sequences OVER AND OVER and OVER again. When I saw Cobb's same stroke, who fought again with someone else, I would have been physically ill. Looking at this "movie", we can NOT learn what it was in the Cobb era. We don't teach anything about his relationship with his players, anything about his leaders, anything about his relationship with family members, except that "they don't like him". I thought when I sat down to watch this movie, I learned about SOMETHING's baseball timing, which Cobb played. Instead of seeing it, it was how Cobb hated everything and everyone and hated them. Boy, what a great movie (intended for sarcasm). Cobb is always depicted as a liar in the film, so one of his stories should be accurate? Who knows? Who cares? No one can see this mess after that. If you decide to rent this movie, make sure the VCR works fast and backward, because you are tempted to use it repeatedly. Hopefully someone will get a good movie Ty Cobbist. I liked this movie as much as Cobb liked people - that means I hated it. Now I know why I found this video store RENT ONE GET ONE FREE FREE. I think I'll ask my fifty centimeter from the video secretary because I can't get back when I wasted it when I looked at this trash. Well, what could I have thought of some film that would have Robert Wuhl.
