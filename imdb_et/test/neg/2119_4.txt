This is a great example of why many people say that 90s are sucked into horror films. A boring voodoo-on-campus story of a terrorist that is once as promising as Corey Feldman (STAND BY ME, LOST BOYS, etc.). There may be just enough things to keep you from falling asleep and it doesn't seem too cheap, but it is still a horror targeting an audience that was very early in the early 90's. Maybe I was part of this audience, but still I got it right now as I look at it. Nowadays, teenagers are already accustomed to much more and better, and I can't imagine anyone of them being aware of who was Corey Feldman. Or "is" actually, as the guy is still filming. But the only thing that still connects her with her prizes is the LOST BOYS 2: TRIBE sequel, which has recently been made. And I think even that nobody encourages VOODOO to look. Just another movie that lost horror for obvious reasons in the 90s.
