If you need a job, straight Bud Buddott (Jackina) and comic book partner Lou Costello (like Dinkel) will be employed by David Babi ("Donald").

Apparently it was a colorful children's fantasy for the duo. It fails, but this is where you can see the Abbott & Costello color, the silent movie superstar William Farnum (as the king) makes his last performance a bit, the boxer Max Baer's brother Buddy and Stollery before Disney's "Spin and Marty" > <br /> ** Jack and Beanstalk (4/4/52) Jean Yarbrough ~ Lou Costello, Bud Abbott, Buddy Baer, ​​William Farnum
