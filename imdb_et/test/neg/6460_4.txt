Why does Guy work for Buddy? Probably because Ari wasn't in 1995. Why does Dawn want to be Guy? Use Buddy. Why is he staying with Guy? I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There are a number of things about this movie that I'm not sure about. But is Kevin Spacey a wonderful, verbal tsunami like Buddy Ackerman? and completely believable because he is a great actor. <br /> <br /> Frank Whaley Guy is definitely working on his element Buddis? he wants to write and make meaningful movies, not a waffle that is verbally abused to get Equal instead of Sweet & Low. <br /> <br /> Michelle Forbes' Dawn, who also wants meaningful movies, seems to be out of Guy's league. <br /> <br /> The end leaves much to be desired.
