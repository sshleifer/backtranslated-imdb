Strangeland (1998) D: John Pieplow. Kevin Gage, Elizabeth Pena, Brett Harrelson, Robert Englund, Tucker Smallwood, Amy Smart, Dee Snider (Twisted Sister), Amal Rhoe. Torture-disturbing scenes "highlight" this dark and disgusting film about the sadistic psychopath that attracts teenagers to their torture chamber via the Internet. Snider (former 80s rock band Twisted Sister) plays a dirty psychopath who is a dirty "twist" (no pun) for Hannibal Lecter. Pena is wasted as one of the victims' mothers. Harrelson (Woody's brother) offers one of the worst police performances I've ever seen in the movie, and Rhoe proves why it's his only screen credit with the same pathetic power. Heavy metal soundtrack is finally anesthetic, torture scenes are very graphic and large and ending just sucks. EVALUATION: 3 out of 10. Graph R for graphical violence and torture, strong language and sexual situations.
