This film is based on supposedly non-fiction. I'm not sure what the writer of the book has written to write about their adaptation, but it has nothing to do with the real adventures of Frances Mayes in Italy. Instead, it is an interesting story that takes liberties into the hands of men at any time. Note the following examples: <br /> <br /> ************************************* ******************************* <br /> <br /> SPOILER DETAILS <br /> <br /> * ************************************************** ***************** <br /> <br /> Bash Number One: Lane's husband deceives her and her marriage ends with divorce. <br /> <br /> Bash Number Two: Lane's venture goes to a local Italian town and every man in the street demands it quickly. <br /> <br /> Bash Number Three: Lane is rescued by the charming gentlemen of horny city folk. He falls to him after making love in the afternoon. Later he discovers that he has already been confirmed and cheated on him. <br /> <br /> Bash Number Four: You have to expand your horizon for it, because the reference is definitely in the movie. Her lesbian couple friends decide on child invetro (SP?) Fertilization. I am told that in most lesbian relationships you have one person who takes on a female role and the other is the role of men. In the film, when a woman is pregnant, the "male" lesbian decides to stand, because she can't handle it. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie has nothing to do with the book that it is supposed to be based on.
