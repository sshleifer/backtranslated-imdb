A worthless movie. A complete waste of time and something I had to wait for. Packaging seems like an American Pie genre (it's not). Rather, it is a random, ridiculous string that makes the film a written exercise (we'll try to see how many mixed types we can write to do what should have been bad for SNL's full-length presentation). It is noteworthy that the director (based on his DVD comment) takes himself seriously. I've been a big fan of the films that the National Lampoon is lending to its name, including Van Wilder. With that, I feel completely deceived. Actually, I know DUPED. I had waited for van Wilder as a farce to live my college days again, but served half an hour of garbage. What leads to my ultimate unmet expectations? Well, starters, the fact that the cast all appear naked (with a huge sausage that covers what needs to be covered) on the DVD cover. Add to it the images on the back as well as the description, and you mislead people to think it's a movie that's not. Worse still, the film begins to start, because it can be assumed to be half drunk with drunk college students trying to try to take a photo of the photo, but in the end it's not about film. In fact, I didn't even think that people in this opening sequence should be the characters of the movie until the directors say it in the comment. Don't get me wrong, I love plot twists and movies, but I hate this movie trying to pull it out as something it doesn't. Ultimately, it is itself a huge service (artistic, though probably not financially), because it causes its audience confusion and frustration just because it ignores what it advertises. <br /> <br /> In short, don't rent this movie according to what you see. This is not your usual Lampoon movie. The only thing that is funny is that many actors have appeared in other films and TV shows that make their inclusion fun.
