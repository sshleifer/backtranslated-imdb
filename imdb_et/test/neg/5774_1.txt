And unfortunately, so did any movie based on a bad word because its title or title should be placed at $ 2.00 bin, but we decided to try another consecutive bad movie for the movie night. We had the winner of the "death house" - go to it if you want a ridiculous flick. <br /> <br /> Some witches jumped into the water after Mr. Miner's fire. Some guys threw the forest. And this same guy grabbed his new girlfriend right now. I can't remember much more. The last third of the film was completely pointless and we all waited until the end of the agony.
