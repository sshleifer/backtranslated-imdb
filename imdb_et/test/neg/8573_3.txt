I thought this film would be completely different from just another teenager. Well, I was totally wrong. A liquid nun comes out of the toilet and something very strange. I know Spanish culture is a bit different and their movies are too, but I didn't expect a fake Hollywood movie. Surely they did quite well. Why did they make a movie without new aspects? It's just boring and it's done completely without imagination. <br /> <br /> I thought if a nun was a bad guy, it would be something really original. It turned out to be a teenager. If it had been done ten years ago, it would have been something new. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie to anyone, but it definitely has a comedy value! It's like a horror parody at some point.
