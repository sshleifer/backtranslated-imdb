There are many comments about the film itself. I just wanted to say something about the German version I recently saw on television. It is severely cut. 103 to 76 minutes! It is common for German television to cut the most bloody scenes. I understand the reasons for this, but this movie was something else. Not only did they cut the "gore-frames" - they cut the whole sequence, saving only the glances. Like: "We have to attack them" - one 5-second explosion in the camp - the main character escapes. <br /> <br /> When an island attack begins, it is no longer possible to track this storyline. All the sections create something equal to the uneven, disconnected scene that no longer makes sense. <br /> <br /> I couldn't look at the end after spending 60 minutes on this mess. /> <br /> I think I would have given the original 7/10 The German version is worth only 1/10 <br /> <br /> Get it from the DVD (and check for the first time) or forget it.
