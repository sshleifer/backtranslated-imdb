If there is one thing I've learned from George Romero Creepshow, it is that if you stumble upon a mysterious old box that someone has obviously tried to hide, just leave it alone: ​​there is probably something disgusting. <Br Obviously, Professor Gordon Crowley, the character of Robert Englund's "Jack Brooks, Monster Slayer" Romero, "he says he will open an old wooden box he found buried in his yard to discover? Surprise, surprise an ancient demon that owns his body (initially causing him to eat and vomit quite a lot). <br /> <br /> When the demon finally moves from Crowley's body and becomes pupils to hellish, tearing animals, it is up to the plumber Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) to try and stop the unpleasant creatures, armed with only longevity and fed with lifelong anger for all things! <br /> <br /> The DVD package offered by Jon Knautz's small budget monster allows for a fun ride that delivers cheerfulness and splendor that could be expected from your average 80's creatures (toothy critters, rubber monster suits, merciful gore and absolutely not CGI!)? and in the last 15 minutes, that's exactly what viewers get: non-stop splattery effects; silly, tortacled Jabba-style demon; It's a shame that the rest of the movie's working time is massive 70 minutes or so? daily business: water supply, visiting its shrinkage, visiting a chemistry class and disturbing his girlfriend. If you think you might want to enjoy a movie that focuses mainly on managing childhood trauma and anger by buying backup chambers from hardware and the chemical properties of sodium, that's your movie; but if it is a huge dose of chaos in a monster, you are advised to look elsewhere!
