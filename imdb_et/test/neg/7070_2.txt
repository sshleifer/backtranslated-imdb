I was invited to watch this movie screening a small art museum. I had no idea what to expect. In the beginning, I was optimistic about opening offers to see Judd Nelson, Bill Paxton, Wayne Newton, James Can, Rob Lowe and Lara-Flynn-Boyle. However, after very disturbing grossed-out scenes (which did not add much to the story of progress), this film quickly became a torture weapon. The ascending growing handwriting trick has never really developed. I waited patiently for this movie in cash. The end result was small, but I had to invest and sit through endless gross ball, crude oil, sexually perverted, screaming on my face, ununny gore costing me too much (even for free viewing). What were these established makers in this terrible movie? The direction of art was very convincing and scary. This should be the least 75-minute film. This is a film that Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld embrace.
