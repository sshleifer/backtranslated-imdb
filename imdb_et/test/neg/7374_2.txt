This is the worst film I've seen for a long time. Historical accuracy is non-existent. For example, in the summer of 1759, James Wolfe, a French-speaking Canadian, will be shown in London. The natives are like the Indians of the 60's bad Hollywood movies: They wear deer and riding horses (The Montagnais was once a horse). The film takes place in the city of Quebec, but the footage is in Louisbourg, showing the Atlantic. <br /> <br /> The original scenario was to include the Battle of Abraham Plains, but the manufacturers abandoned the idea that the cost of uniforms and participants would be over $ 4 million! I think they never heard about enforcement. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is planned for the new Titanic: impossible love during a historic tragedy (New France's fall). At the end of the movie, there is even a performance by Celine Dion (Yes, I missed the end of the movie, but I am very sorry). But the worst thing is that this movie costs $ 30 million. I just don't know how they spend that money. <br /> <br /> Sorry for your anger, but I'm just too upset.
