This movie is a great example of how to take an exciting topic, come up with 25-minute material and stretch it for a six-hour period that resembles the shape of a documentary when Fox news decides to do it. Even the participants of this terribly exhausting film cannot hide their laughter because of their stupidity that they show that one of the few times in the history of the world where people stand and work for a better world. If only creators had talked to Ken Burns in 5 minutes, they could have brought out something somewhat intelligent instead of treating this insomnia.
