"Enchanted April" 1935 version succeeds at the same time annoying <br /> <br /> and perfect. It's hard to show Italy's transformative magic in a studio that has only stereotypical Italian behavior. The transformation of the four strangers fleeing from London is the first day of the week after the week. Instead of working out, the scenario pulls the switch off and the characters are different. <br /> <br /> Spouses are bored because they can't turn on even if their presence doesn't drive four women back into their shell and / or hostility. Jessie Ralph has the most fun (moving instead of completely chewing the <br /> <br /> landscape) and Katharine Alexander has a delightful charm with her husband's shadow (and away from her ugly droning). Ann Harding is here unnoticed (product code has come into force). He was in the earlier (pre-code) movie "When Women Meet" with a suitable line: "You're not <br /> <br /> worth one minute if any of us has given you," but "Enchanted Aprilis" can only hurt, rush and declare fame to his spouse.
