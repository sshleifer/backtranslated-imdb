Let me start by saying that there really is no reason to watch this movie. I just sat because I tried to kill for a while before starting work. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is your typical sophomore "comedy" that targets teenagers. There is nothing else except the total ridiculousness of the story, not to mention the existence of sufficiently large plot holes to drive through the Carniv passenger ship. Obviously, this should not be a realistic movie, it should be funny. Unfortunately, this is mostly the same number. I have to admit that I smiled a few times, but mostly "holy sh * t, I can't believe how stupid it is" this way. <br /> <br /> If you never see this movie, nothing is lost.
