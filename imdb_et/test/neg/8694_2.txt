It is difficult to compete against classical majesty, but once you've made that choice and the decision has been played, you'll need to find the best and brightest resources to keep your product's top drawer and top quality. If your goal is to achieve a second or third (or fourth) best, why even try it? That's why I don't know why this ten commandment is written, produced, and transmitted. I would ask the manufacturers: "What did you mean? Did you try to create a predictable deficit?" If perhaps the producers would think, "We want to study this biblical story from another perspective ..." Then I would say "OK, I looked at the exhibition, now what is the view?" This "theory of potential perspective" presupposes me. I can generally view programs and (right or wrong) at least understand what the creators are trying to achieve. Not so, here. I recognize such names as "Robert Halmi" (producer) and I can associate his work with some outstanding product; Tin Man, Earthsea, Flash Gordon, Jason and Argonauts. Low budget entertainment is based on myths, historical and comic books. The perfect genre for the Sci-Fi channel. So I still have to ask Robert Halm ... "What was the ten commandments you were thinking?" ???????? FJS
