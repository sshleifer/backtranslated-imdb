"Footsoldier Rise" follows the relentless cruel journey of the gangster Carlton Leach and his companions through drugs, violence, gender, violence, weapons, violence and I mentioned violence? Practitioner Carlton Leach (Ricci Harnett), member of ICF (Inner City Firm); The group's gangsters were turned by professional gangsters, leading the audience through the events that led to the 1995 Range Rover Killings, where three gang members fell victim to particularly cruel professional "hits". Leach's success as a doorman and talent to find terribly violent friends to control local nightclubs that are criminals, he launches a notorious company of drug dealers and gangsters who profit profitably from the 80's and 90's rave scene and drug culture. <br /> <br /> With an open brutal realistic picture of the dead, the viewer is thirsty to understand what happened but was completely dissatisfied. The next 2 hours tend to go through a number of introductions. Each of them, in principle, creates yet another typical "hard person", showing him an attack against the victims who are usually victims before even even more nastieric. What little emotional perception the audience may have on some of the characters (for example, a family member who is in charge of a missing drug) is quickly destroyed if they are climate-killed or their story is not resolved. Initially, the plot hints are inadequately conceived with vague impressions of how the murders occurred, as the events have been placed in a place where there is little reward that has stayed from the blurry of previous events. <br /> <br /> This movie is made with the usual formula for the audience who prefers violence and the real line of 'ard-nut' slang. "Footsoldier's rise" borrows too much from a "football factory", leaving out a good bit that does not reflect the moral consequences of a hooligan subculture or creates empathy with the main character. Violence, although it is excellent, seems excessive and unlikely, because no one is long enough for the audience to establish an emotional bond. The effect that the police are inviolable is fairly fair, but the masking concubines, who regularly make a blatant murder in public places, even put the imagination of the most deliberate viewer. The audience has been confused by the relevance of many important events and advanced characters that did not have any effect on the final conclusion. The "sharp realism" attempt is further destroyed by a substance called "The Truth of Serum" used by the Turkish Mafia to attract honest answers from unwanted individuals. This is not a genre where psychologically unrealistic drugs are invented and makes the questioning almost absurd. <br /> <br /> Actual violence scenes (before repetition) keep some tension connected to the fast flashing of colors or film reel. Smoothly choreographed shots with mandatory but effective dirty handheld camera recordings save the film, but unfortunately, the plot (or lack thereof) limits the niche demographics. <br /> <br /> In essence, the events that this film is based on are not worthy of being represented, and a sufficiently consecutive story is sacrificed for stereotypical characters and a unigiginal plot. This film has a place in the market, but if you like a bit of a brain with brutality, it's not for you. <br /> <br /> http://www.obsessedwithfilm.com/
