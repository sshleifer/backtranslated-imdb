Okay, this movie starts and it looks like it is a lovely comedy from a completely attached soap opera fan. He does not touch reality outside the soap (sort of "inverse of Pleasantville's main characters") and runs to Los Angeles to fulfill his fictional character. Well, this is a cute movie ... but at the same time, the dark, very violent film is from two hit men who are killing for Betty's reasons. Both lines would have been enough in itself, but "Nurse Betty" contains both tracks at once and the effect is very tough. I didn't enjoy that much.
