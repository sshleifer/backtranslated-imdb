Being a historical buff, I borrowed this movie because of the topic. The idea of ​​Ellis Iceland's experience at the turn of the century, focusing on a small group, is interesting. Unfortunately, the film gradually falls. Much of the story is just boring; Nothing happens with long stretching. The director uses funny images (offered in the form of dream sequences) in a visible attempt to break the ice movement, but instead it collides with the authentic look of the film. The characters are also poorly drawn. Finally, we don't care about them as much as we should. It's a shame that it wasn't what it could have been. I would still like to see a good movie about the experiences of American immigrants, but that is not the case.
