My mother and I went to watch this movie because my brother is serving in the US Peace Corps in the same area where it's set. On the side of the film, I decided that the title was abusive given its inability to measure what it was doing. The subject he was dealing with could have made a great documentary, but because of his poor performance he left me with a much less educated problem than I had hoped. I agree with laura-jane from Canada ("Powerful message but no focus"). I also agree with the user who commented that this filmmaker 's storyless style is the opposite of Michael Moore, but I do not agree that it presents different perspectives and invites the viewer to decide for himself. I agree with the comment of one user that "the lesson is better known when we make our own conclusions"; However, our conclusions cannot be justifiably wrong if we are given little relevant information to draw them. <br /> <br /> The main points of documentary films seemed to be 1) African people who live near Lake Victoria are very poor and suffer greatly. 2) The introduction of European monkeys by the Europeans to Lake Victoria destroyed this ecosystem. 3) The communities around Lake Victoria are financially dependent on the perch economy. <br /> <br /> The best thing I can say about the film is that he tried to link the sub-Saharan African average, which, unfortunately, is an anomaly of films and tried to portray poverty as a dysfunctional economic system rather than a universal, inevitable phenomenon . I liked the irony she found in a large number of fish that left the country before the famine. I appreciated how the United States team assigned to the region was portrayed with people. Like almost all documentaries that do not include the word "women" in the title, this film does not do a good job of representing the voices of women - most of the interviews are male. <br /> <br Maybe I have to watch the movie a second time to catch some of the key points I could have missed, but I was unable to identify Sauper's theory of the connection between the introduction of a perch between Lake Victoria and unfair living conditions, living in the Africans near the lake. In addition, I may be wrong, but it struck me that Sauper is able to improve his interview skills. The questions and answers he asked seemed arbitrary, but he seemed to have the real opportunity to make the interviewees uncomfortable and uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The most urgent development of the film is the recommendation that exporting monkey now works to hide arms imports and that the real economy around the Tanzanian population is war, not fishing. Unfortunately, Sauper ignores the idea of ​​thoroughly exposing (or at least extending an interview with a reporter who seemed to be talking about what he says about arms imports), and tries to "decide for himself" with his approach to Darwin's nightmare. I was told that the first exploitation of the world in the third world gives them a "better chance of life", it did not do a good job. If it were to show how the US and European arms industry is responsible for many armed conflicts around the world, he did not do that good job. If it was meant to portray what drives people to prostitution, he didn't do a good job of it. If it had to show the US's inability to fulfill its mission, he didn't do that good job. If it was meant to say that the small income of the Tanzanians earned perch, it is not worth the cost of the mother to create a profitable product, it did not do a good job. If that meant that Tanzania would be much better than the Europeans would never come, he did not do that good job.
