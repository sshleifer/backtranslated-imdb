I was entertained to see that some of the reviews presented here were ** SPOILERS ** and my family's joke is that the only part of this movie that isn't listed on the back of the box is given a title. Maybe I'm just a close American 17 years old who doesn't know art when it comes to me, but I prefer movies that have at least some words. This movie is made in 2001. This movie is just so slow that it's not even art, it's just boring. We're watching this horrible man watching the boy around Venice. The end was incomprehensible until I read the end of the book. The film should not return you to the book, it should be able to do it alone. This film has no chance to stand. He does not even have a lot of bone on the plot.
