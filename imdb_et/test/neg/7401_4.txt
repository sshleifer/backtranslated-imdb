I only saw this first part and came to the conclusion that I wouldn't miss anything if I didn't look at another episode. The cinema was OK, but besides that, the plot was just as common and a mill as any other military history. Actresses and actors play their characters without passion and really make up bad (Heiner Lauterbach with white hair and Kai Wiesinger, as if some colored white hair gives them more dignity and common sense). I mean, if you have watched more than two or three films of World War II (as most of us are), it would only barely see the third or fourth if he promised some new insights or twists in the plot. But Roland Suso Richter does not seem to be afraid of this, you will almost smell at the fear of not watching a civic and june-like ZDF TV channel while watching this movie. Millions of euros were spent on boring and unimaginable German filmmaking. These millions of dollars could have been spent on making three or four independent films, but no, let's give some filmmakers who make a movie that tells people that war can be explained by rational means. My advice: read Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut instead. They will tell you what war is! Or give me one million euros and make a better movie than this BS load! And one more thing: why is it that German films can only be awarded to Oscars when the film deals with World War II or the Holocaust? Probably because this is the only thing German filming is good for. And that should make us think, isn't it?
