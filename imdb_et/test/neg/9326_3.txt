Once again, I've seen from intelligent reviews that I probably made intelligent comments about a clearly filthy movie. In fact, I put on my shoes, got in my car, burned expensive gasoline and drove to the nearest rental place. After reading, they commented and paid the necessary $ 4 and changed their rent. I'm telling you it's not worth the small kilo calories that are spent on lifting the TV remote control channels. <br /> <br /> I gave it a few more minutes after I saw all the heaps of the pedigree dog. These are the clinical symptoms of a driver a. going to the hitherto or b. the film he is bound to create is of little interest. I saw a similar deterioration with John Carpenter's ridiculous cartoon string over the last few years. <br /> <br /> Here are a couple of scenes as accusing evidence. The priest has a worrying dream ... supposedly he's coming, because he seems to be curved to hell to open the archaeological sign surrounding the demon. A dream is a twilight collage of scattered images right from Twilight Zone's footage. A spectacular watch screaming through the dirt of the dream, which means what? The crushed head painted with demon features with a comfortable shop-quality Halloween make-up flashes back and forth in cramped madness. Every time I see this effect, Jacob's ladder has been cut off, it breaks me down. This in itself discriminates against the film immediately. <br /> <br /> The whole structure of the archaeological mine is ridiculous. Everything is so obvious ... both tired and burned ... the only possible answer is boredom. At one point, the priest's comments to find the angels surrounding the sarcophagus ... they all point down toward the crypt of their weapons. He asks, "Look at the shapes surrounding them .... That's how they would hold it. It should create tension ... a critical mass ... but it's not even close! The images are too much to do, but the comments I have added will only add to the injuries. Who, with a loud voice, did the makeup effects of this film? The blood was actually the pinkish quality that can be seen in the Tromaville of the 70s. Do not listen to strange comments on it! I also keep a suspicious eye on Schrader. It may seem that it's time to put on gloves. if you still have dignified memories.
