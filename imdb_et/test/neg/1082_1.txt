Well, how to get started? I saw the Italian work for the first time a few years ago and I visited a rental outlet where I didn't remember why I had a bad feeling. Now I'm doing it. <br /> <br /> After voting on the ratings for this movie, I saw statistics. Apparently this movie likes a girl under 18 years old. No wonder. They didn't pay enough for Charlize to flash and I think some girls have rated Mark Wahlbergs abs "AWESOME". <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that this movie is completely predictable, the actors are mostly B stars. and even the good ones are terribly abused, the film is full of obvious product placement and depicts it: it even can repeat itself without making a sequel! The first 15 minutes are the best part of the movie, and it's all downhill, and once they understand it, they finally decided to use the best hours again, repeating their details with their golden star. All in all, a lot of noise is nothing. <br /> <br /> I think Charlize Theron is good and Ed Norton could be more than he used to be. In addition to Donald Sutherland's "look, I am here too", which appears at the beginning, I would say that this film should have a "passport if you are over 18".
