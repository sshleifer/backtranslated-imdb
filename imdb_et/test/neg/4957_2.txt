Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) is a college student with some serious anger issues. His family was brutally murdered when he was a monster, and now he takes all and all his anger. <br /> <br /> So when his professor (Robert Englund) begins to show signs of monsterism, he learns that he must control his rage and use it instead of evil instead of good, and fight the creatures that have haunted his nightmares since this fateful night . <br /> <br /> Really earns your B-rating, but what it was cool about is that it didn't focus on crappy B-rated CGI graphics. In fact, 0% of the movie was CGI. The monsters were actually properly assembled, and although the story was missing, it was somewhat traceable ... than just once.
