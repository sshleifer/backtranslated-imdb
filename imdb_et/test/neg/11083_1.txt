Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen. The person who created this film probably did not learn to shoot directly into the bright light. Nothing can be seen in this movie. It's the way to the dark. Parts where you can see something the camera directs to the light source, so you get great lens glow colors. So you still can't see. This movie should have been a radio or something. Some parts of the film are turned upside down for some kind of damn effect. Low budget movies can do as much better than this. And the low budget isn't an excuse for that. The editor should have written something and saw you didn't see anything. Maybe the makers should spend some of their low budget on the preview monitor so they can see what they were shooting. The only good thing about this movie is that you can't see the horrible action. It also covers crappy sfx. People from new film schools will make better movies then. Movies made with handy dolls are better than that.
