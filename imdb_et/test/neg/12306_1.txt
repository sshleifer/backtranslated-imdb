There is no redemption function, this film is garbage. His jokes aren't going to be funny. Children's humor is pathetic and attempts to address adults simply add a sticky smuttishness to the entire accident package. Sitting with my children just made me uncomfortable, which could follow. I couldn't enjoy the movie at all. Although my child, to whom the DVD was bought, enjoyed having a new DVD, he and his sisters didn't express much interest in seeing it again, unlike Monsters inc, Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, and so on. receive multiple applications.
