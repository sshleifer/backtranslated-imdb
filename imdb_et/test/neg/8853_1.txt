Cairo or Pulse, as is known among the English-speaking audience, is located in Tokyo and starts as Sunny Plant Sales employee Michi Kudo (Kumiko Aso) decides to visit his friend Taguchi (Kenji Mizuhashi) to ask what computer he is working on when he he gets to his place, gives him a disk, but suicide him. Meanwhile, a student named Ryosuke Kawashima (Haruhiko Kato) has recently tried to access the Internet and keeps scary messages and pictures on his monitor, so he asks that the computer quiz Harue Karasawa (Koyuki) is happening, he doesn't really know, but it seems that the place where people's spirits go, when they die, is full and they need to go somewhere else and Earth is as good a place as everything, right? These spirits do not like to share so that they make people commit suicide or make them ashes or something like that, I don't know, because the movies are a bit confused ... <br /> <br /> This Japanese production was written and directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa & immediately outside. I have to say I hated Cairo, I hated everything, and this proves that Asian cinema can produce something like any American filmmaker. The script is a long-term confusion, it just doesn't make sense if scenes that seem to be different from the movie don't logically or in no way explain. Cairo is also the most boring movie I've been sitting on this year. After two hours, this is a real chore to sit down, I really wanted to pass it on, but I am fair if nothing else so I got stuck on it and I would honestly say I wouldn't. There are so many things to do with Cairo, I think filmmakers want to feel surreal and deliberately contradictory, but these are the traits I despise in the film if they are not done properly. Then the whole thing on the Internet that I just couldn't associate with, I use the Internet all day and it's not a bit scary to me in any way. Then it is that Cairo as a film gave me an entertaining value, maybe I am Neanderthal, but I like movies I watch to entertain me, make any sense and not carry me to death. <Br /> <br /> Director Kurosawa has done everything I have been worried about if you have difficulty staying on a DVD while you fall asleep and you are asleep for 10 minutes. I didn't think Cairo was the least scary, the whole thing on the Internet was ridiculous and, as scary, you should see some penis enlargement pop-up ads, which is now, it's scary! I hate this movie, I hate this movie, I'm sorry I need to redo this baseline twice. Forget about any action, tension or gore, because there's nothing. If you have a very nervous disposition, maybe there are a couple of scenes that can let you down, otherwise it's a child-friendly PG rated stuff. Urgh. <br /> <br /> The film is so boring and boring that it is wrong, the camera just sits there for a very long frame, and when it moves, it moves very slowly, it's the whole Mexican soap opera style. Since Cairo is headed, it is difficult to judge the original performances, so I'm not worried, it's hard to take care of someone if they don't even speak the same language and you don't know what they say. <br /> <br /> Cairo is a mess, I hated it and it's so easy and straight forward. Just because it is an Asian flick, it does not automatically do any good and story, the plot holes, the fact that it does not make sense, and it is an absolute cage, which means that Cairo would be rightly broken to humans if it were American production. The worst movie I've seen this year. Cairo received a Hollywood remake as Pulse (2006).
