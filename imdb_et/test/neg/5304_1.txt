OK, I bought this pair back in Xmas by my brother, who took me to "Get Shorty", both of which were used by the "uber" impression. And I watched both of them stay short and be cool one after the other. I have read reviews of people who have not seen the short and thought this film was pretty good .... I think this is another way to deceive the customer for the film companies. All I have to say about this movie is WTF? After nearly 10 years, and Chili Palmer had become a pussy .... The script was basically the same, they joined Travolta and Thurman after their Plup Fiction success, a couple of big stars threw (plus a pair of shots) and thought it would be good .... The character of Vince Vaughn was just annoying, despite being both his and a fan of Rock, both actors were still used and unrealistic. Basically I'm glad it was bought as a gift, if I had paid for it, I would have been very annoyed.
