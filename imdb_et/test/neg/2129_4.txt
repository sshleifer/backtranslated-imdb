I really wanted to like this movie because I admire the Italian rip-cinema (especially the Jaws rip-off!), But the simple thing is that Monster Shark is not very good. There are all the great signs of this sign; under the direction of the director, one of the trashcultural cinema, Lamberto Bava, one of the kings - one of the best ridiculous cultural figures, Michael Sopkiw, who has a leading role, and a central creature that is stupid enough to even give the best kind of movie to run for this money, but somehow the film can be quite hidden. The fact that "koletishai" does not occur too often is probably a good creature design, but elsewhere it is never enough to draw a movie without it. At the center of the plot is a resort on the south coast of Florida (or somewhere in Italy) where many local people have grown up in the water and their hands and feet are gone. It is not a long time before local authorities decide that this creature has never been seen before, and that is alive! The main problem with this film is that it always feels very pointless, and because there is little way to develop characters or plot, even the least demanding viewers are probably bored before long. Such a film is hardly famous because it is brilliant, although the fun part of movies, such as "The Last Shark" and "Killer Fish", has unfortunately been missing most of the time. I love the head of actor Michael Sopkiw is that he always seems to take himself seriously no matter what movie he is (though he only ever made four). In this case, this is certainly the case, although Bava does not let him really dive and often knows as much as a spare wheel like the rest of the film. Much of the runtime takes a look at the different characters in the United States and it's not very exciting; Although Bava manages to finally get fun, as a fun thrill, when a central monster can end up destroying its potential prisoners. All in all, there isn't really much to recommend this movie. As mentioned, I like this kind of thing and even I found myself for many times. Only for Italian horror!
