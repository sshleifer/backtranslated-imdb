This film is exactly the same as Ridley Scott, "Someone who looks over me", which is classic. He denotes Tom Berenger and Mimi Rogers and a bad guy from Fugitive. This is a high quality film with a good direction and a great acting. This movie is the opposite. This is the same plot, just minus any good functioning and adding a TV movie direction. I have to say that I like Lowe and his wife. He is hot and their romance is plausible at a credible level. Unfortunately, this alone cannot save this copy of the classic Ridley Scott movie. <br /> <br /> Typically, dirty TVs have some redeeming quality that makes them at least traceable. I think the redemption value of this film is that Rob Lowe and lead female are chemistry. That and I could see and compare the plot with another high quality film.
