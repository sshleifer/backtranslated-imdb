Mario Van Peebles tries to go on the route of Jean-Claude Van Damme and play the renegade robot soldier who goes to AWOL to keep himself, but the government is not going to lie down, so that among the simplified parcels, van Peebles protects villagers against rebel forces and defeat this frustrating film your own improved version. This universal soldier (it's much more fun) this blunt hanging just goes somewhere. The main problem is that the film is so incredibly inert. Van Peebles is just waiting around and just not enough to justify the ass-kicking. On the other hand, the film is reminiscent of a competent version of R.O.T.O.R, although if this crippled bad film was fun, it would only ridiculously ridicule its convincingly convincing sequence of action. Like R.O.T.O.R there is no point in its narrative and the film is basically boring. The advantages are disappointingly weak and basically the film needs a real scenario for the operation, because the material is too empty. Still, Solo is a very weak film. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 4- (Poor)
