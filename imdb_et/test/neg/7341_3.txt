In 1968, North Carolina was filmed in Randolph County when the country's film crew was rare. The locations were the municipalities of Liberty and Ramseur and the surrounding countryside. This is not a very good movie. It was Merle Haggard, and it brought life to the back for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot is a normal shootemup. Cinema is the fuzzy stuff that came out of the late sixties and early 70s. Local people were happy to be part of the company. <br /> <br /> If viewers have difficulty finding a copy of this movie, a copy of the document is available at Asheboro, NC. <br /> <br /> Accredited participants include Ben Jones, Mimi Pravda, Tommy Hull, Bill Nunnery.
