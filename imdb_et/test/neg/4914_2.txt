I often do not know how such films even get, and the most shocking part is that people actually pay for watching them. <br /> <br /> With Aksar, it seems as if the director had made a story when he passed, adding twists and turns when he liked it, no matter how ridiculous they were. The script lacked dialogues such as "Jo Sheena Roy softens shark, wahee fashion hota hai" and "Yeh Versace shark lady" (yes yes). <br /> <br /> Each of them was low and underdeveloped. Action was terrible. Constumes (for litsra Udita and terribly suitable tough Emranas), locals (numerous houses used in interior design, not even vaguely like the Victorian mansion), scenario, etc., just one word - garbage. <br /> <br /> For people who love Hashmi and his movies, check out this. As for me, I'll never get two and a half hours ago. The only redemption factor was part of the music that was decent.
