I know that many people have / have automatically given this movie to 1, but because they don't have the big budget and top-notch special effects they get used to. However, I knew what I started to get myself while I was on the VCR. The lighting is terrible, the sound quality is sometimes incomprehensible and almost everyone involved is very bad. But it's still a fun movie and the plot is interesting enough. It focuses on a Tom Russo (Asbestos Felt) colleague who has succeeded in his work. She very well protects her wife and does not allow her to work, pushing herself more. When he starts working for more hours, we see him slowly in the direction of madness and obsession, and he becomes suspicious that his wife is deceiving him and will be brutally murdering various men (most of the repair workers) he knows. I have to say that the gore effects are extremely cheap, but match the overall tone of the film. The brutal ways Tom Russo kills to give these men give us an idea just crazy, he's got it. The pace of the film is also very good and rarely a dull moment. The end does not really follow the rest of the film's plot, as it seems to want to go from a psychological movie to the "dead threshold", but it is still fun and I have to give Tim a Ritter credit that wants to use an unusual end. I can honestly say that I enjoyed this movie, but it is not a good movie if it makes sense. Its budget is its main stumbling block and its consequences are almost too great. I do not recommend it to people who have been completely damaged by high budget films and who cannot have particularly low budget movies. You just can't enjoy it. For others and gore fans - I'll tell him. You can find at least SOMETHING redeem it! <br /> <br /> My class: D
