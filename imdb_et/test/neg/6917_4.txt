Markoff is a crazy scientist trying to find a cure for acromegaly on the cause of the virus. By taking part in a piano concert, he suffers from a beautiful pianist trying to hide him. But if he does not want to do anything to him, he infects his father's acromegaly with a virus, trying to suppress money and treat her daughter. <br /> <br /> This is its B-premise. class low budget thriller. I have to say that under the film there was an impression. Not that it was terrible - it wasn't, but also something particularly remarkable about it. It was entertaining to watch, but it doesn't stay in my memory. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is sometimes somewhat brilliant and the actor is just mediocre. The story is quite predictable and does not give us anything new. Of course, I can't complain too much about a movie with a gorilla boy who serves almost any real purpose, and a doctor who has a Svengal-like foam that can't scare his victims. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's worth watching if you like this movie, but don't move it with too many expectations.
