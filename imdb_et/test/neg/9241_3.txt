Harmony Korrine - hates him or hates him? This evidence may have a better word. Not of course she just does everything she does. But it could have been so different, because the first ten minutes of this movie allow so much, including the fantastic idea that Michael Jackson has embedded Marilyn Monroe into the impersonator. Fantastic. And he was in Paris! It can be great. But unfortunately, Korrine can create a strange decent idea, but because he is a terrible writer, the story fails at every level, and the audience's way out, which I saw for about an hour, is proving to be the most boring and pretentious film art. Apparently, the fall of the Cannes Festival premiere in recent years was very shocking. Instead of focusing on two main characters, he turns the story foolishly into the boundaries of the church to introduce a number of other impersonalists that make the whole experience annoying and narrative fruitless. When will the independent cinema stop funding this structure?
