"The Cave" appeared more or less simultaneously with the English film "The Descent" staged by Neil Marshall. Both films have a similar presumption; only the "cave" is terribly ungrantly, unmistakable, and incompetent, compared to the great horror adventure that is "descent". Neil Marshall realizes that the main story was too poor and instantly added brilliant ideas, depth and personalized style, while "cave" director Bruce Hunt just went to his table to make the most original scenario. . The result is an incredibly mediocre film that contains every horror class that can be thought of and where most of the violence occurs off the screen. And we all hate that, isn't it? The story is introduced by inadequate caves that are trapped in a completely undiscovered Romanian underground ecosystem. Shadow-winged creatures, which are also parasites, are attacking them quickly and escape seems to be impossible due to landslides. In the first half of the year, it's still a little entertaining if you keep yourself busy with all the clich√©s and listen to your textbooks, but the whole thing just gets too awful. None of the events is even a bit plausible and it seems that the whole cast is competing with each other to provide a WORST performance. I've already seen better special effects in anonymous B-films, the shooting scene is not used to the fullest and ends up sucking! Not much recommended!
