Larry is the perfect example of the American Democratic Party, of which he is a solid member. The king was somewhat fair and unbiased in the past and had different guests. The celebration was also central, but it was another era. Now, like, Larry, it's far to the left. <br /> <br /> At least 90 percent of all King's show last year's two are Liberals who sit there and bashabs President Bush and every Conservative they think ... night after night. Bill Mahar, one of the most viscous, is - and you can watch it - the most common guest in the history of the King's TV show. You can count on the other left speaker to be in King's show every week, but don't hold your soul waiting for a conservative. They are little and far. <br /> <br /> The King was also one of the media innovators. It all started with O.J. The Simpson trial. Night after night, what you saw in the mid-90s. Whatever newest rumor Anna Nicole Smith or Petersen's murder or Paris Hilton, Britney Spears or any other tabloid, you can bet that Larry will win death. Unfortunately, all other networks do the same. Larry was leading in this respect. <br /> <br /> The king is also nervous to sometimes give advice, such as marriage. I'm not kidding; I've heard that he says it. The joke is that she is married and divorced half a dozen times! This man has little fear, believe me. When it comes to morality, it is helpless. Perhaps he is because he has Dr. Phil to regularly tell him some facts about life. Larry nods, but he no longer understands when Billy Graham talked to him. <br /> <br /> The King is also famous for the "softball" for the interview, which means he doesn't ask any difficult questions. This is much because most of his guests have his political conviction. People know that it is a pleasure for a king to have public relations in the class. <br /> <br /> All of this has meant a serious drop in ratings over the past five years. People see the mood of him and his liberal and tabloid TV and changed king and CNN to Fox News.
