... but had to see how bad it might be. At first, the plotline was thin, but it continually deteriorated. A female genetic engineering student uses her research on accelerated mitosis to create a male artificial, because the biological weapon used in WW3 killed 97% of the world's male population. Surviving men are either high-priced gigolods in back channel clubs or crazy rogues who run down on football pitches to capture the "lesbian conspiracy". The whole process is similar to a large number of microwave microwaves. Press a button and let the child get. Not only that, but he would grow old until the mid-20s, and then usually become normal (if convenient). In the end, Adam is bored in the cabin next to the forest, where his creator raised him, and steals his car to see the city. Several subplots that we never saw. As Adam learns quickly, men's survivors are treated as criminals / criminals because they are dangerous wild animals that cannot help them with genetic predisposition to violence. Propaganda machines have been in full swing, frightening women to believe that all men are rapists and murderers. It has led to the existence of lesbianism, the fall of Christianity, female reproduction only through cloning, and yes to other indirect results of world peace. All of these seem unlikely because only about 30 years have passed since the war. Adam stumbles upon one of the bad situations while being genetically programmed to be non-violent and unable to do much in his own name. The FBI, with its trail, the Madams, who are looking for fresh meat, and his creator, who is trying to restore him (himself), learns that violence is not limited to men. <br /> <br /> Not at all I would recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> However, I enjoyed Veronica Cartwrights 'image of the FBI Director's love for hatred and Julie Bowen was not bad at Hope the' hetero geneticist.
