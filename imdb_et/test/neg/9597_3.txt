Although many Billie Dove fans are happy with his work, I have to go.

The only real entertainment is provided by the outstanding Kay Francis, who plays the lacquered bob with the side curls, which is the role of the corrupted Countess who shamelessly eats men, including Rathbone, and then spits out. He pulls it with a unique aplomb. He is the only living thing on the dead sea of ​​the movie.
