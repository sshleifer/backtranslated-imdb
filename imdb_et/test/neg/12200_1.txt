My precious two hours is complete and perfect. The whole movie could have been done in less than 60 seconds, just showing people who are up to date, the car crashed, people getting more exhausted, people who have sex, people cry and people become more aware. It should have been read on the label of this movie: "Come see how our characters are fixed! They are stuck! They are coke addicts! They are confused! Who are these people? Do you really care? Please give us your money because we don't care something else! "Absolutely terrible movie. It never went anywhere, you never knew the characters (they never said what these people did to earn such a big house and so much money and cars and coke), and it was just boring. You may like the movie a little more than you are a stonemaker, but for most of us who aren't, it's a movie and a waste of time.
