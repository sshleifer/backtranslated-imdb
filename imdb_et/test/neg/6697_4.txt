A coach who had been good in the past but had to move to a new area to get away from what he had ever done; no hopeless team; a star player with a coach line; an alcoholic assistant, a little boy who arrives around the winning basket; the whole city against the coach (all except the leading wife). This is an old story - just out of the British comic books, where teams of teams and looters take Brazilians for football and win. <br /> <br /> This movie, which is well put together, is full of clichés. The only part I didn't predict was when a city star decided to visit the coach suddenly with the coach. There is no reason. It seemed a very strange thing to see that everything went so far. Maybe he felt sorry for the bad boy. <br /> <br /> Gene Hackman plays Popey Doyle in the dressing room. I am sure that Dennis Hopper's caliber actor didn't find anything particularly difficult about his role. The same can be said about Barbara Hershey. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie is full of clichés that could have been done much better than it was.
