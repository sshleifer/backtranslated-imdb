When a naive young Eddie Hatch, an acrylic cabinet from Savory's Department Store, falls into the shape of Venus and gives her a nice kiss, Venus steps down from her pedestal and gives Eddie more than she wanted. This apparent example of what Hollywood can do for Broadway music can emphasize the story of a man and eliminate most of the first-class songs. The goal was to make a safe and popular movie without too much investment, taking advantage of Ava Gardner's upward movement to superstardom. Robert Walker as Eddie disappears in his ungrateful role. Eddie is not just naive but dithering and unhappy. Gardner is proud, but the only things that make a movie for every life are Olga San Juan as Eddie's loving but jealous girlfriend, Tom Conway as Savory's and Eve Arden, like a delicious long-term owner, a clever crackling secretary. This is the role Arden plays in his dream, and he is good at it. <br /> <br /> In 1944 Broadway opened a musician and got a lot of Mary Martin. The only point of music, however, is the acquisition of music. Since Venus's touch was meant to be a social satire, Kurt Weill, who wrote and Ogden Nash wrote the lyrics, came up with several stylish, spiritual songs and one masterpiece. Without satire or smart songs, or Martin (or an equivalent showstop), the film is simply a weak comedy fantasy, where much of the comedy is predictable and fantasy is dead. <br /> <br /> Not only did the filmmakers beat almost all Weill / Nash songs, they brought the film to music director Ann Ronell to write new lyrics for one surviving song. Sharp observation of love-dovey romance. Ronell was not a cage; he wrote for me Willow Weep. Wonder what he thought when he replaced or tweaked Ogden Nash's smart work. <br /> <br /> One bright spot in the movie is that Weill / Nashi masterpiece. "Talk Low" is just as great a song of love as anyone ever wrote. Eileen Wilson provides Gardner's duplication of one of these professional and lifeless care. Dick Haymes supports the choir. As for Ann Ronelli, he was one of the few women in Hollywood to become a great music director, as well as composer and writer. For You Songs: Tin Pan Alley Women is an exciting documentary about a woman who made this business, including Ronell, Kay Swift, Dorothy Fields and Dana Suess. And for those who want to hear what the few Weill / Nashi scores were from the original Broadway, you could watch a CD, One Touch Of Venus (1943 Original Cast) / Lute Song (1946 Original Cast). The music is paired with Lute Song, another Broadway exhibition that celebrated Martin.
