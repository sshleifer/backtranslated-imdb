As Michigan, I got Michigan jokes. Very funny - the fun of Pontiac, Ann Arbor, all these suburban suburbs of Detone. Yes, yes, I've heard these jokes a million times. I give them credits to accurately portray Grosse Pointe's fool. It no longer got White. Did you hear those cute Michigan nose accents? When girls talk so fast, you don't understand one word that comes out of their mouth (nose) ...? As much as I love Michigan, I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> I've never been in touch with one of Grosse Pointe who liked me. Listen to this terrible live band and this annoying and frightening background music! What is this? One of your brutopointe homeboy band? Probably. Wow, what a great "Detroit scene" you have here. It's funny how the people of Grosse Pointe always say they are from Detroit. They're so white and rich, they want them to complain. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie blows. The whole flat of funny girls' straps to the dreadful character development. Wait a minute, do you think the character is based on saying a lot of f-word? With a deep personality. Great work, Grosse tips! And I love everything about a sexist loop, like how the narrator calls the first killed girl that we never listen to the "naive b * tchist". It's really cute. <br /> <br /> These Marilyn Manson contact lenses are very good. And I love how it was perfectly reasonable for cyclists to come and kill people. And how did their narrative master play such an obvious role in the film ... The main boyfriend was so boring that I demand him to sleep. Three idiots (or two or four? How can I say they all look and act the same way!) They were so desperately trying to make me laugh, but Beavis and Butthead already laughed at my butt humor in 1994. And what about gay jokes? No wonder this movie is sucked - all involved people have some minor problems with their masculinity, are they guys? <br /> <br /> The only rescue arm for this movie was the main girl. Despite what other people here have said, he was actually a good actor. Teenage girls talk about how he spoke. They really do as they did. His actions were very natural and plausible. I really thought he was an employee of Grosse Pointe's convenience store. .. maybe he is! And yes, he had big boobs, most women here. Michigan is the strongest country in the Union. In all aspects. <br /> <br /> So, those of you who think it is Detroit's office are not. This is the suburb of Detroit. They are very white and full of meaningless teen. Limp Bizkut, ICP (yes, ICP is one of our suburbs) and $ 75 with khaki pants! Let's have rich kids who are crazy because they have a lot of money and something to complain about. And they also do bad movies. <br /> <br />
