"Tragic Hero" is a movie that will surely try to imitate classic godfather films, focusing on family, crime, loyalty and revenge. This is also part of a series of two parts, as the godfather was (at the time). However, this film does not go far to the level of these classic films and fairs worse than other Triad thrillers released in Hong Kong at that time. <br /> <br /> One reason is action. Except for Chow Yun Fat, the actor is generally up and unbelievable. The public tends to find the procedure humorous simply because the participants cannot maintain a degree of difficulty. As a result, we find that the film is not really emotionally tied or intense, because we don't care what happens to those characters. <br /> <br /> Another reason is the lack of it. The narrative attempts to add a number of different elements to the film, but this leads to a lack of parts of the film and a lack of real coherence. Sometimes the audience disappears from the audience but does not know what the motivation of the character is. <br /> <br /> The climax of the movie includes a proper arms fight, but because we don't care about the characters, we don't care who lives or dies; Because of this, the scene loses its intensity and effort. Other sets of operations are quite everyday in nature, feeling that they are more controlled than free-flowing. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a strictly average movie and is not recommended for the general film to be used by the viewer ... Only Chow Yun Fat's central genre enthusiasts and fans should watch this movie to watch.
