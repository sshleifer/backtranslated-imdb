The fourth theatrical release (one of the National Lampons took its name out) looks like a comedy classic. A complete flaw and sad test once for a proud franchise. Painfully uneven and unobtrusive ... even for a TV movie! Cousin Eddie's character has become less and less entertaining, from the original vacation, when it was fresh and unique, during a Christmas holiday, when she started wearing a little thin, the Vegas Vacation, where it was actually annoying to see, is on the screen (but fairly many such things, that were on screen in this movie!). However, this attempt to move the character to status status is unfortunate to claim. The holiday clubs themselves met in Las Vegas with ugly deaths, and this hope for television even in the thinnest of the series's slimmest threads was wrong. Chevy Chase and the company put together a great trilogy when he was his prime minister; Now let's just pull the plug and let the headline calm. (One small note: the original Audrey Griswold - Dana Barron, the first of the four actors to play this part, including Juliette Lewis - returns 20 years later! One will only wonder ... Why?)
