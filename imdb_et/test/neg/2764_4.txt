Someone should teach people who made this film that the differences between "multi-turn" and "audience twisting" are different. They even use hypnosis as a tool to cover the plot holes; if they are unable to enter or leave the scene, they will simply say that it will now retreat to its past, or "it will now stick to it", and they think it will explain everything. This film is a dishonest fraud and in the last 20 minutes it becomes a perfect fiasco. (* 1/2)
