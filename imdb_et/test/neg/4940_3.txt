I found that Shuttle is an incredibly depressing film. It starts quite well and moves quickly until the first "injury" (which is cozy). After that it becomes very lazy and written as a story. It was the character's character, not the character's leading character. If you hate a movie where you do not understand why the characters are doing what they do, you lose the "Shuttle". Especially the latter is strange and seems to happen in the whole sense without the world. Finally, one character also admitted his friend's previous misdemeanor, rather than creating compassion for the public, most people began to do it. This was probably because the story "heroine" was a complete idiot. Finally, the end, which seems to be "shocking" and comes from "fear", "people are bad, audience, so just take it without explanation". <br /> <br /> Shuttle is neither good nor bad, but mediocre. And annoying.
