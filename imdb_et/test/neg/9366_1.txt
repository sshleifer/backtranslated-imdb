From the beginning, this movie is dragged and dragged. Cumbersome generations explaining history, black-and-white operations, boredom, the total absence of humanity, verve or style. Participants look like they are stunned. Potentially wasting an interesting story. Certainly, someone realized how bad it was at some point in producing it?
