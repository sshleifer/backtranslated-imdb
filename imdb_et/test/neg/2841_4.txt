(Some Spoilers) Dull like a dishwasher that is a hidden homeless man, Harry, Darwyn Swalve, killing a real estate agent across the L.A city because of their high prices. Like Clint Eastwood's "Spaghetti Western" additive who has lived in abandoned houses, where they eat dog food, it is very disturbed when his lifestyle is broken as the splitting ends. This happens when a number of real estate agents invaded their premises, trying to sell houses, staying with their potential customers. <br /> <br /> The stars of Joseph Bottome in this body are a horror movie as the receiver of the radio-talk show Dr. David Kelly is a beautiful and popular host psychologist for the survival of KDRX. DR. Kelly has been sued by one of her calling families, Tracy, who created her own air in the air that couldn't do anything to help her survive. <br /> The real estate killer can talk to Dr. Kelly about his adventures in the air, and the police are trying to get a document to get their phone number and address, keeping him on the line, but he refuses not to harm his rating if the potential callers don't call if they are afraid, that LADP monitors them. <br /> <br /> Kelly also has a hot and hard affair with a real estate manager and agent who is busty Lisa Grant, Adrienne Barbeau, who is the main victim of a salesman's office in her movie. Harry can also kill Lisa's main competition in the housing business, with Chubby and the outrageous Barney Resnick, Barry Hope, who threatened to add any way to end possible action, even if he has to kill him. <br /> <br /> Berney and her trousers alone with Harry will drop her head if she is one of her clients, a whore she will leave dead and hanging with Barney to stop. The movie ends with the kidnapped Harry, who takes the Add Hostage and has dr. Kelly only try to get to Det. Shapiro (Robert Miano), who looks like e, hasn't slept for a week, jumps out and hits Harry's brain. Harry quickly returned to life, subtracting the homosexual thing between his ears, and killing the film a second time when he was thrown out of the balcony and landed on the ground as ten LAPD members, M16 crashed and ready. scene. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie "Opean House" worked with tension that was almost ridiculous. Even the hot sexual scenes between Kelly and Lisa didn't record the movie because there were too few, only two of them, and sexy Adrienne Barbeau was a bit too under-exposed without enough light and too much clothes. in all of them. <br /> <br /> Harry, who was a movie killer, was also a little comic to take him seriously when he tried some point, Dr. rent prices and real estate prices in the country, and how people like to find a decent place to live. You can also understand Harry's concern for the high cost of living, but be very critical of him as he went crazy about correcting it.
