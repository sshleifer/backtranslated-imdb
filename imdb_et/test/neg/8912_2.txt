Ah another Seagal movie.Not less than a few months arrive to populate the video store shelves.As bad as drowned? No. But it does not say much.Like a perfume pig. <br /> <br /> Seagal is a professional thief who wants to give up, but goes to the last job to get his boss to double. He is imprisoned and friendly with a gangster who helps him break out and pay back. <br /> <br /> It is good to see that Seagal does not end up playing an agent, a policeman or what he usually plays. We are actually seeing a US location in Las Vegas. Then Eastern European territory as usual. There is no wire-fu here. Fauntleroy does the job properly. <br /> <br /> But most of Stevie's action and combat scenes have clearly doubled. Other films, the lack of reality and logic even the smallest situation. Seagull and Treech are doing so-so team inspirational (inadvertent) laughs one minute.Sighs rest. <br /> <br /> Several remarkable faces turn up to slumm this .. sleepy Kevin Tighe has a long way in his emergency. Nick Mancuso will appear in sleep mode to make check.No more rappers.Please? Here, scenes and plots are more predictable and recycled in general more than ever. This is a hidden scene that Seagal needs to escape or hang.
