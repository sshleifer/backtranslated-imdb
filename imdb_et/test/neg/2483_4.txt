This exhibition was a promising start, as opposed to the ocean 11, but has become a low-screen T&A. In fact, my little brother says the only good part of the show. <br /> <br /> The first season was the best, it was new and interesting things went down. The only salvation point for this exhibition is JamesCaan, the other participants are not shiny. The characters have no depth and they seem to be incredibly selfish and generally unlikely people. <br /> <br /> To quote a friend, "Las Vegas is like a Baywaych casino". In my opinion, Baywatch has become bigger and more realistic.
