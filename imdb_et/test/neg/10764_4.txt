Back to college I studied marketing and although I missed a whole range of classes and never paid attention to it, I always remember the main and most important marketing principle, namely: it's not what you sell; that is how you sell it! This principle is fully applicable to the "devil triangle" because it is basically a beautifully packed and enticing but empty package. The writer / director Richard Winer knew exactly that he had to deviate from the main inaccuracies of the viewer, so that he cast some elements that would never succeed when it comes to a horrible atmosphere, such as narrator Vincent Price and the odd evil voice of King Crimson's music. And I think that Richard Winer's dirty little tricks worked very efficiently, because in the mid-1970s there was a huge leap in the Bermuda Triangle and literally was every movie production? was it an incorrect documentary or a buggy exploit? Covering the topic earned a lot of money in the ticket office. "The Devil's Triangle" discourages you from unstructured and often irrelevant data, but the dramatic dramatization of the facts and, of course, the omnipotent harsh voice of Vincent Price, creates a sense of fear and fear. Talking constantly jumps from time to time and covers the "strange events" and "mysterious battles" of the Bermuda Triangle ship and aircraft for almost a century, but reports are always very vague. and Mr Price always ends up with the tortuous words of each chapter, "but another secret of the unresolved devil?". After a few cases, the whole formula simply becomes ridiculous and almost pathetic, but I think that in 1974 it caused a real mass hysteria. The documentary extends a little more from the notorious mysteries of the Bermuda Triangles, such as the five military aircraft 19, which inexplicably disappeared all at once and the unique case of the USS Cyclops, but even in these chapters only minimal information is given. The cameras are never under water at one point to explore the depths of the Bermuda region, and witnesses of exhibitions in reality show suspiciously staged exhibitions. If you are looking for an informative and objective documentary about the Bermuda Triangle, I wouldn't recommend this movie, but if you want to sit down and listen to Vincent Price's hypnotic voice for almost an hour, that's your chance!
