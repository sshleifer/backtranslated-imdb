Cartoon-like special effects, terrible action and dialogue, and a dry plot! This movie is all! My friend and I went to find a terrible movie that we could make fun of, but it was just too much. The film begins with women and her son who are resting on the island of Bahamas. Women who just happen to be a doctor / virologist are in the area where the man collapses. He has a strange wound on his hand and he knows immediately that it is an infectious virus. The story continues between two teenage cords showing surprisingly fast romances (this is justified by a girl who says, "I know it's fast, but it just seems nice." ??? We are told that within three months if the virus is not treated and it does not contain, spreads it to the United States and kills millions of people. This information does not prevent the CDC from rescuing itself from the island. Fortunately, this terrible virus is found in time and the whole island is rescued. everyone is dancing, having fun and forgetting the terrible epidemic.
