I think I don't break anyone from the experience of this movie, saying that you can't see it if you have something better to do than a clean oven. It gets down there and you have to clean it sometime. I think the film suffers from a lack of sex and violence, although there is one chase of the car that seems so dangerous that it could only have been filmed in a country where life is cheaper than beer. The heart of "Gargoyle" is in the right place, but its aspirations are conservative. It's not at least pretentious. But I had a very good time in this game, playing an all-year-old idiot who says, "What's that hole?" and dies in his hub. In addition, I have to meet Michael Pare. Every movie junkie should work with the B-Movie Staple at least once before his death. And the Romanians are the most pleasant people I met. The word is literally the most pleasant. Walk along Bucarest Street: If 7 out of 10 women are absolutely beautiful, then you will walk down the street where I didn't come across; and at least 5 out of 10 are available for drinking. <br /> <br /> Part of the movie was shot by Casa Radio, an abandoned, unfinished classic communist blockade-Georgian nightmare, originally designed for KGB propaganda ministries, a non-so-free radio in Europe. The five-storey building is long and takes the city block; Best of all, while its facade radiates the great strength of the Brotheresque state, it lives in the center, such as the post-apocalyptic ruin in the burdock and the cannabis jungle, with dozens of gypsies and many natural dogs. The construction of Casa Radio was suspended when in 1989 Caucescu and his wife were executed on television, and hitherto holes are falling from the upper deck (which offer surrealistic prospects of a modern quarter-mile roof decorated with the cutting of rails and parts of old cars that open a crumbling ancient city) up to the wet and horrible basement (which doubles the Gargoyle slot movie.) American style bumpers or warning signs for Bucarest. <br /> <br /> Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Casa Radio has organized a number of non-Allied film formats, including "Highlander III". This is attractive to manufacturers because it is a cheap place, a large and bulky space, a strange look and an insurance-free headache, as it is still a state property. Plus no one complains if you don't clean up after your production: everything on the site is interpolated to build the Roma population in their quiet city in this real city jungle. <br /> <br /> During the shooting of "Gargoyle", the wild dog bitten the auxiliary register bloody. Apples served by meals were used as molded and used by team members to keep dog dogs open. I was bitten in Bucharest by wild dogs, once in a bar (!) And once in a city park. For two weeks I also lived in two taxis, both in taxis and neither saw the drivers concerned as a reason for stopping cars. <br /> <br /> GEEK NOTE. was one of the supporters of this film (the smaller the budget, the more producers), so it's a bit strange that nobody was with the original title "Gargoyles" until it was almost time to show it. network, although Sci-Fi already had a link to that name. The title sometimes changed relatively close to release because I have a copy of the title-labeled color corrected earlier.
