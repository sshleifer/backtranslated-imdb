Your dreadful movie copying on Beethoven. As a professional musician, it is my duty to watch every film about any composer and Beethoven is one of my favorites. When the Hungarians and the Americans meet, this is a terrible combination of empty top emotions with a possible worst taste. You proved it in your terrible b-movie. The only thing that carries the film is music. Of course, you did not bother to look beyond good, but in my taste, the Tackacs quartet performs, but I have to admit that the performances have at least a quality that contrasts with the film you made. It starts with the deadly DEAF Beethoven, who fully understands Anna, who is just a whisper. Listening to Beethoven during a movie is better in a minute, but it must be because of some vague divine things. Then it is absolutely impossible to have a semi-pornographic "eyes closed" double-headed scene, which is finally up with the proud Anna and her cousin-brother (who also cries out with the red eyes of the extinct scenes, my God) on performance). And if the culmination is the hanging of Amadeus, which Beethoven dictates to Anna not in the notes, but in the utter sense that he fully understands, but no one else in your audience even understands the trained professional musicians. Of course, your reaction is that the negative answer is at least the answer, but I can assure you that Beethoven himself is turning to his grave with your precious creation and justification. This so-called sense of respect is blasphemy and I am so sorry that I have rented one of the worst films, although this is my favorite object. Ed Harris and others, you do not understand the size of Beethoven's most forest-like dreams and certainly not after a few lessons and playing violin. It's a problem with the Americans with you: you think you can understand everything even if it requires hard work. Yes, we can still do it! Keep in mind that a good product is hard work, talent, dedication and professionalism. All that you are missing from Beethoven's copying. See you in kindergarten.
