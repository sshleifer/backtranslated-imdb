Martha Plimpton has made some prestigious films, working with Phoenix and Harrison Ford, but he never got his limited, grave appeal to the same class as Molly Ringwald. This film, which was barely released, is only the beginning of the 1980s, the beginning of the 90s, trying to find screen-staff that was identified for people with reduced mobility, and that is another failure. Plimpton plays a worrying young woman who discovers on her 21st birthday that she has been accepted and - even worse - actually out of reach of elder parents! He's trying to find his biological mother and father, but the viewer has no idea why he'd even want it (can simple curiosity give him so much determination?). Unpleasant material used to handle sitcom; it starts on the wrong foot and never returns. Plimpton gives sour, harsh results, but Hector Elizondo and Mary Kay Place are good for his adoptive parents. * 1/2 from ****
