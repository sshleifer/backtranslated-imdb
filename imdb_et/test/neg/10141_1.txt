it's really a "okay" series. everything in it is pretty good. but I can't take Rebat. he's trying to be funny but he's just not and then he got a stupid accent! if they took it out of the show, I'd like to see it every day ... but a 20-year-old boy (doesn't know his name), but he's so funny, and he saves it all. kick Reba and then put the 20-year-old boy in the lead role. someone else in a leading role
