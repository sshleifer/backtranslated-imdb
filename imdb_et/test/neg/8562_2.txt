Nun is a revenge picture of a very rigorous nun being killed by a rebel trailer for his rebellion trailer, and he goes years ago to get even when adults are now visiting their old school. The story is predictable under the pot and it will not exceed the surprises when it slowly ends. It has a satisfactory effect on the film and a scripmer with a smaller than average script and scenario. Many special effects are low and the last battle is almost plausible. However, if you look at them, there are some temporary and active jewels. If you like a pointless cookie cutter, you like it, otherwise you should go.
