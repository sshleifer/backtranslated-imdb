I laughed twice watching this movie and when you thought, I had no bad day or any other thing that would have tended to be my opinion while watching my cinematic bowel movement. This movie is bad. I wanted to enjoy it and I just couldn't. With all this talent, you think it would have been at least traceable, right? Wrong. <br /> <br /> Let's play suck and wonder! John Travolta- Very pleasant. Although obviously buried too much in makeup, I found she was enjoyable to watch. Not suck. <br /> <br /> Uma Thurman- After killing Tables 1 and 2, the girl deserves more than this terrifyingly written character. This great moment of the character showed someone how to use the T-Mobile Sidekick. Vince Vaughn - The White Dude, who thinks he is black, goes to Vince "Money" for Vaughn. Is this character's template still funny? I love this man, but I want to see him better. He felt he was sliding. Suck. <br /> <br /> Cedric entertainer-This guy is good. He presents a great monologue after being called a racial divide (you might think what it is), which was probably the best part of the film. He was funny and indeed raised the material he gave with his presence. Don't suck. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel-Sucked because of a phone call. <br /> <br /> James Woods-Sucked, but not his fault. In fact, yes, it was. For some reason reminded me of my role in the casino. I don't like mania James Woods, I like slow burning James Woods. Maybe a victim of bad writing? Andre 3000 - Sucked, but he went down. I think he has the potential as long as his next picture is not hacking. <br /> <br /> Christina Milian - She is absolutely beautiful and obviously talented, but this movie doesn't make her a star. Not sucked, but needs a better vehicle for his talents not driven by the cage. <br /> <br /> The Rock- It should have been a role that put him on the stardom of the movie, but like F. Gary Gray, the winds sadly wrong. In this film, Rock designs this charisma that makes him so pleasant that I am losing him. He really tries hard and if he fails, he gets me A +. This guy is not afraid to torture himself and go completely against his high-bodyguard with his own eyes. I really want to see her be great. He's got so much time he won't hack. <br /> <br /> What leads me to what I felt was a weak link to this production. I can just get out and say, right? The direction of Gary Gray was about as strong as really bad diarrhea. Wow, it was bad. Who was the bright idea to give this man directly? The negotiator was good, but what else was persuaded by the rest of the people that he was the man of this work? Between her direction and the terrible writing I want to climb for both culprits to get a nice secret on my knees. Want to see John and Uma dance? Maybe I can think of another movie, two of which I'd like to watch instead. Not worth ten dollars and fifty cents that cost you to go to the theater. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been fine and it wasn't even "just okay". <br /> <br /> RATING: * out *****. <br /> <br /> PS Fergie Black Eyed from Peas is remarkable to note. Sizzling!
