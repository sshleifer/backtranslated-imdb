Fun! I would have sworn that Ed Wood wrote it. Terrible. I loved every frame. Bad movie lover, this is your trophy! I look at it again. Words can't explain how this movie is fun. The couple's career must be low, but I think he is moving towards Leslie Nielson. He was perfect for that. Terrible, just terrible! You love it !! Take some friends, a lot of beer and you have your life time. This is the MST3000 side who is waiting for it. Enjoy !! Worth Renting! You like a "Colombo-type" cop and a comic stripper. Bad boy laughs at you on the floor. He's also in another Pare movie, Komodo vs Cobra, and he's just as good. I don't know what the budget was, but they get it back because this movie is meant to be the best inadvertent comedy of the year.
