When it comes to art and essay film, there is not enough art, not to mention essay. <br /> <br /> If it is a thriller, there are not enough thrillers. <br /> <br /> If this is a teenage drama, there is not enough drama and for teenagers there is not enough NOFX and too much Nino Race. <br /> <br /> I thought it could be a trailer for Tony Hawk's upcoming movie, but not Tony Hawk, so I think I'm cheating: it's not Tony Hawk's biopsy. <br /> <br /> If this is an action movie, it will have no explosions that would interest it, or at least it would have made sleeping bags in its chairs. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters seem to be dead, but this is not a zombie movie. In fact, when it comes to film, there is not enough plot. If this is not a movie, it will take too long for your music videos. <br /> <br /> If it's a music video, this is an album that I don't buy
