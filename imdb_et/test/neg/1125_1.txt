I can't believe the participants agreed to make this movie. I couldn't watch it for a very long time because I'm afraid to lose I.Q. for every passing second. I think somebody in the network who instigated this stripe looked at it before placing it. IMDB ratings are only terribly 1, it's time to get negative numbers in such cases.
