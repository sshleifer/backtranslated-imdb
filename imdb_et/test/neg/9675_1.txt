I was so excited to see this movie, which I was totally surprised at how completely WRONG this movie was. I love John Voight, but I have no idea what he had that part of this traverse. The accuracy of the Bible was completely non-existent and I could not honestly watch the movie with the children. My children were amazed, because even they know that Lot didn't think even when Noah built the ship. I think NBC should be ashamed to allow manufacturers to look at the Word and create even more confusion in the world that hardly knows the truth, because it is ... PLEASE IS NOT THIS MOVIE !!! I've been considering burning my copy, but I have all the intentions to write producers and send them scripture references they should read before making a movie !!!
