Chuck Norris, like Danny, is a policeman who took the killer of a stray serum, but when he killed, Danny knows he's the only one who can stop the terror. But Danny's harbor has a secret, she knows it's just an accident that got intimidated by terror and even more lucky that Danny survived, but the last fight is ready, but is Danny ready? In my description, what is the problem with this film right now. Norris plays a cunning hero who still suffers from psychological trauma. With a better actor, this concept would be interesting and could be a great thriller. With Norris thriller, it just makes it ridiculous and hopelessly unhero. Also on board are American Ninja Steve James and Superfly's Ron O'Neal, but any attempt to character the development to capture a cruel script. There is also nothing to do and I always preferred Norris's film, which has more struggles and less talk. Given the rating of this website, I can't be alone. <br /> <br /> * 4- (bad)
