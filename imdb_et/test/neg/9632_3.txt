I watched this movie a couple of times and I never knew it. I'm not a fan called "nu horror" so I can't leave this account. I found it a little slippery, I think the thing about hammers is the aspect of sexuality, not sex education, but Sexploitation. I'm surprised at how many people are so highly appreciated for this movie, so I'm still looking at it. But for me, it wasn't horrible, he had no atmosphere, but a little omigode, look at those bad / stupid London prostitutes' women and the little innocent Anna, who became another nasty man, oohhh! "I think the film didn't have any depth for me at last, but a bunch of nasty men and women only for the titration value. That was undoubtedly somewhat what Victorian England was, but the kits are even too outraged and boring make sense to the Victorian threat." Corman's horrors, on the other hand, are now a style, an atmosphere, and an elegant horror.
