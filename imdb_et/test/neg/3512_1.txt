This movie was terrible, and at the end I thought why somebody was struggling to do it. Now it wasn't all bad, I've learned a movie, and this movie was put together very nicely and had a very good cinema that was at an interesting angle with very nice light and great camera work. I wish I had seen it back in school because it would have made a good movie for writing paper. IF ........ Since I have finished and lost most of my intentions about my film, I have realized that the film should be primarily entertaining, this movie was long and boring, and I'm not sure when it finally came to note that it was worth my time. <br /> <br />
