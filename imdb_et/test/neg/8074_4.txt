The film was a joy to see if you were a fan of Stooges. The story is about Moe Howard and his relationship with Brothers Shemp and Jerome (Curly) Howard, as well as lifelong friendship with Larry Fine. The film mostly deals with the fall of the camera's high points and the career of several decades of Stooges. The electoral director and the make-up artist did a fair job of finding similar actors to the famous ensemble. An actor who plays "Curly" Howard did a good job of portraying the most lovely Stooge camera. Must see three Stoogos for short fans.
