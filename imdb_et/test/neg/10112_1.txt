Hey guys and girls! Never rent it or buy it from God. I've rarely seen a movie in any genre as bad as that. Actually, it is worse than I and my friends did when we were 7 years old and had to act in front of all the parents and siblings. In fact, we would have arrived at the Oscars when we were compared to Darkhunters. The story is terrible, the makeup is terrible, filming is terrible, the set is terrible, the chair is terrible, and so on. I can't really find anything that would be worth the money spent watching this movie. Maybe, except all the cats that my girlfriend thought was cute. Please use your money for things other than this movie .... I didn't even see the last 15-20 minutes of the movie, it was terrible .. If someone really liked this movie, I really would like to listen to you, and I'll try to see if I will advise you in a psychiatrist's office near you .. <br /> <br /> 0 out of ten, actually down if possible .. Not worth a DVD or tape.
