Now I'm a big fan of Zombie movies. I admit that Zombie films are usually not so good, but I like them anyway. Despite almost all the dirty exemplary and worthless dialogues in Zombie films, it is the worst. Look, there are some rules with zombie movies. 1. Zombies are suicide. Tactics are rarely used and they never act like a boxer. They can't hit the head, they take it with a ugly smile. They don't try to hit you, grab your hand and bite it! 2. Zombies can't talk. Only Evil Dead. Otherwise, NOT SPEAK. 3. You're not fighting zombies with melee-armed weapons. You loose fighting zombies. Firearms are used. In this film, however, the fighting is a path that is wrong. Very wrong.
