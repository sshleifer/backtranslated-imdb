The film is about one day for a mad woman. To show that he is mentally ill, he goes far and the narrator tells us he is "crazy". On the way, he goes out with a fat boy who looks like he could be a brother of Orson Welles and later he takes one of the buildings off his head. is a strange little movie that has been made very cheaply - and it certainly shows. The movie was shot without sound (probably using 8 mm or some other inexpensive film type) and later had some sound effects and a superfluous narration. In fact, narration was the most confusing and inadvertently fun I've ever heard, and so it is said in a stupid and general way that you should listen. As a result of cutting these costs, it is not surprising that the film is bad, although the idea of ​​trying to make this movie was quite original. Plus, it's very hard to do the whole movie.
