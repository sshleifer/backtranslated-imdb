What can you say about this pathetic movie? <br /> <br /> - Very bad behavior! The main actor seems to be aware of only one facial expression: fear of mixed weakness. Like a poor beaten dog ... Another actor (the one who plays evil) looks like Ozzy Osbourne's twin skin, with a terrible red wig. The other participants are so pathetic that they don't even deserve a description. <br /> <br /> - There is no plot. The story begins with opportunities, but does not go anywhere: we do not know anything about the meaning of "11:11" or who really is Rayden, except for the simple "he evil" or "he is the child of the Apocalypse" ... which is not an explanation. We do not know why parents have been killed, what the danger is and why Sara was chosen. As the film continues, we look at pseudo-scary scenes with bad music. What's more, the end doesn't say anything: we just see two options if one of them were a bonus scene or a director cut ... There's no plot, so it's impossible to interpret. <br /> <br /> - "11:11" is just full of clich√©s! It's so obvious that I couldn't laugh. For example: abandoned library or bathroom scenes, ghost walks, ... even a fashionable "little scary girl" like "Dark Water" or "Ring". Of course, the main character has been bullied in the school and looks like a stereotypical Gothic girl (dark hair, red lips, skinny, black clothes). Is it a duty to make her reliable? I do not belive. Sara's psychology is so little developed and so typical that it doesn't make her trustworthy and relentless. <br /> <br /> - A terrible direction: as I said, something original, everything has been seen a thousand times and is used here without the real purpose. <br /> <br /> - There are funny connections. For example, I do not know whether "rubber science", "paranormal course", or anything taught at American universities ... in Europe is not so: teachers speak of negative energies or use the sensors of "material" beings. .. ridiculous. Also: how can you watch a movie recorded in the sixties with a Super-8 camera on a computer screen without spending an hour on digitizing (in the movie they are watching on the computer screen) AND how you can, that old movie, separate a small detail, then zoom in and view the perfectly recognizable face ? I don't know if a director has ever tried to digitize an old analogue film ... <br /> <br /> Finally, "11:11" is worth seeing if you want to laugh in foolish movies or maybe you want to sleep on your couch ... But this is an expensive way to fall asleep!
