Plot: <br /> <br /> - EBay Chair <br /> <br /> - Random People <br /> <br /> - Random People Speak ("Dude, That's Right." "Know It." "Let's get married now!") <br /> <br /> - If you are a "hippie" then you will love this movie. (You have to be high or drunk, otherwise you will doubt your life by looking at this junk.) <br /> <br /> This movie was obviously not end-to-end, and other comments are probably team upholstery reviews. If it is not geared to my demographic situation, I do not know what it is aimed at. I found the plot everyday boring. This is something I would do, and trust me that it's not worth filming. Muting the road and movie doesn't make a movie!
