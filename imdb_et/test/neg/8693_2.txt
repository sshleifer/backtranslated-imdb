A nice attempt to bring Shakespeare to life in a post-apocalyptic environment, but the end result is terrible. Futuristic Liverpool is not at all convincing; The budget was obviously not very large, but the production designer could have presented a more creative approach to this issue. Alex Cox has made good films, eg. Repo Man and the Highway Patrol Man, but I really don't know what he meant here. Just an opinion.
