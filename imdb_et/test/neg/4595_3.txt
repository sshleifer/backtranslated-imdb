I looked at the invaluable version of this movie and if the person who has been closely studying the life and crimes of Specki, I must say that this movie is a real but ambitious real story. During the capture of Specki's true horror and murders, this film makes the following factual errors. 1. Speck did not inject drugs in a crime position as shown in the movie. In fact, he was mainly an alcoholic and reed who rarely injected drugs. 2. The surviving Asian sister of the Specki massacre did not push down the stairs and the living room on the couch as shown in the film. It would have been impossible. In real life he hid under the bed while Speck methodically removed his 8 victims. 3. The film depicts Speck with violent and cruel women as soon as she meets them. Not true. In reality, Speck was initially calm and gentle, affirming the women he didn't do for them. So he could bind each of them. 4. True Richard Speck was not a deep thinker whom the film depicts him. In the FBI profile, Robert Ressler interviewed Speck in the 80s and said that Speck not only knew why he had committed the murders, but that he was not interested in learning why he couldn't shed light on why. Speck was known to be lower than the average intelligence and not the philosopher's king, who tells the film. If the story was neither tragic nor terrible, the voice would be ridiculous. All in all, Doug Cole's presentation is intimidating and cold-blooded, although I don't think the actual Speck was so successful in the violence. There was no doubt that he was a very violent person when he was affected, but he was also aware that he was a pretty slippery man who was able to relieve people before they became victims. Beverly Ann Sotelo as the surviving sister is the best of the film. He's a very good actor. If you're nervous at all, you can't see this movie. It's very graphic and disturbing.
