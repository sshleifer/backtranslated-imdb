I think most people would agree with me when I say that the movie Alien put a lot in the atmosphere. I have seen that there are quite a few movies on this bar, but none of them have ever crossed the alien spooky tunnels and darker sites. Cave is a movie that tries to reset the bar. I believe that the trailer even mentioned something as frightening as Alien, but I never felt the movie again that I even feel the slightest bit of fear or excitement on this issue. <br /> <br /> So now that we got the ball rolling Negativity You can also explain why the cave is the main hook (atmosphere if you didn't pay attention) tormented by the waste of my time. I say right now that most of the sets were beautiful and nicely lit, but what we hear and what we know is what we see. One music is terrible. We get either tougher music or over-haunted house music. Okay, maybe it will push it a little, but I couldn't bear it. Many underwater scenes were bad enough (it is a well-known fact that underwater scenes are always boring as hell). It actually caused a lot of inadvertent laughter, which was then amplified by the next crash of craft. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as I already mentioned, it was not just music, but the killing of the atmosphere. Being in darkness should expect horror. I have to be worried that they will start to appear, and just their glimpse should make my blood cold. The cave wisely takes the page from the alien's handbook, leaving the entire creature for a very long period of time and only highlights the glimpse, but it just doesn't work because the creatures are so flat. I think it would be a rude violation of specific features, but in principle they are foreigners with wings. <br /> <br /> I think you will get a point now. The atmosphere was destroyed. But I know a lot of people who still see the movie when it's exciting. I would like to say that of the caves, but I lie. This film is slow for action and when we get there, we wonder if this thing is finally called the day. We've seen all this before, except for some clean scenes (a guy hit by stalactites, eels and rapids), so you really don't get people excited about running endless aliens from endless endless tunnels <br /> > Ah, but the pain doesn't stop there. We must also take action and act. Well I don't remember any other dialogue than "run!" and the only character I remember is Jack, but it's just because it is placed close to every other line at the end of the movie. Maybe the actors were capable, but the script didn't allow them to do anything else when it ran and claimed. They had almost no background and when someone died, he just dropped off. This is quite sad when you think the CGI eel makes the film the best result. <br /> <br /> Speaking of CGI; there are many, most of which are terrible. I commend them for using costumes (at least I mean they were suits), but nothing really is surrounded by the environment and as a result most of the effects look for the soul. </p> It is empty, the cave is bad and very little. If the film had been a premiere of a SciF channel or a low budget directly for a video release, I might have a little more love for it, but this movie was a theatrical release. More and more meaningful it could have been a scary fun movie, but as it is, this movie is as frightening as entering the basement and it is not very good. //friderwaves.com/index.php?page=cave
