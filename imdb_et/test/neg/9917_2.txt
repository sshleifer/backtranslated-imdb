I was sitting at home and folding the channels when I ran over, which was a potentially interesting movie. I like the Destruction-type movies and decided to watch it. I don't know why, but I saw it for 2 hours. We've seen this type of movie I don't know many times. <br /> <br /> Between 1998 and 2000, there were a dozen films that were dealing with some kind of global destruction. The best in my list so far is the Deep Impact, which was more plausible than this. Here are my problems with this movie: 1) cheap special effects like something out of the old computer. 2) without explanation of background or weather conditions. If you intend to make a movie of the weather, you have at least a technical detail for the entertainment viewer. 3) How can only 2 or 3 people understand that the storm is approaching Chicago? 4) Where are the interesting signs? I really don't care about anyone except maybe a pregnant woman. I felt that there was no character. 5) There is no thought-provoking moment that is both an eternal and factually wrong subject. And that's just the first part of the movie. I bet the conclusion shows us little destruction scenes and search and rescue, as it has done many times before. And judging by the special effects of the first part of the film, I can only imagine what we expect. Of course, the main characters will survive and life will go on ... as the original
