Unfortunately, this is not one of those films that at least laugh with their incredible stupidity. He has no entertaining value at all. It just sucks. I don't know where to start to explain how much this film is bothering me. I think what the cake is really is an intolerable soundtrack. It seems that someone took a simple beating and then left the 5-year-old child with a synthesizer amok and recorded. It's really so terrible, and if that's not enough, there is no scene in the movie without "music" (= noise). At the end of the movie you are either deaf or already ears. What at least would keep you from falling as nothing in your movie will keep you in focus. Just a lot of bad behavior, a couple of cheap and unbelievable killings, no story at all (it just jumps from one scene to another and you as a viewer can understand that idea) and the last 30 minutes. can recognize some of the worst "special effects". It's very boring. Don't look at this movie! You could do a lot more fun by looking at the wall or reading a phonebook. Did I mention how much music sounds?
