If the copy of this movie fell into the wrong hands, the world would be in serious danger. I am a big fan of "B" and I have seen my share of bad, but there is no letter containing an alphabet that could adequately describe this hard-fortified piece. This film even goes beyond the "good" phase and goes straight to the "bad world that seems to be a little less meaningful world" stage. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say what's more annoying: .1. The fact that the people who thought it were from their political satire (I use this concept very, very, very loosely) was clever. They found so many other people who agreed enough with them to make little or no money for this rubbish. The fact that someone really thought it was a good idea to choose this horror spread on a horror anthology DVD. <br /> <br /> If I were a weaker man, I would probably have grabbed the grapefruit in my eyes and then, after dark, I watched my death in the opposite direction. However, as I stand, I live, but experience is forever scared.
