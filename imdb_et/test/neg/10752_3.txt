One reviewer tells those who may not like such a movie that "it is only appreciated by film-makers who tend to deviate from the film". I feel it is quite unfair to those who are bored of it. <br /> <br /> I am not tired or disappointed about film or filmmakers, but I found it annoying and self-conscious. But then, that's true, I'm not too big in the deep sense. I think it can be very important for those who know you know. <br /> <br /> It is very slow and takes a long time to make your own points, indeed using images, so. However, on days like these, it seems possible that such a film could be one you could meet in one of these dark and frightening booths in contemporary art galleries, not in the screen of the popular cinema setting. .
