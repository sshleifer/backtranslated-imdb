As a fan of Sci-fi and accidental Angelina Jolie, I thought that a film with this obviously low budget might be worth it ... maybe it had a couple of scenes or stories to make up for all the other mistakes. Plus, it may be interesting to look at Angelina when she started her star-related career. <br /> <br /> Oh, how wrong I was. One thing I learned - at 6 pm, Angelina Jolie couldn't work. So, for them to be comfortable, the producers create this whole movie with people who couldn't act. Looking at it, Jack Palance (who can actually act) struggled. Looking at it for 10 minutes, it's enough to burn your eyes. <br /> <br /> For frightening action and exaggeration, add a meaningless script, an uncomfortable dialog, bottom-to-barrel cinematography ... in fact, add all-of-the-barrel to everything. <br /> <br /> The story is characterized by Angelina as a cyber programmed as her high priest as an assassin. He escapes from the company's headquarters with the help of his combat teacher. The company sends a wage hunter after them. Stupid things happen. End. I'd tell you more, but I didn't want to waste my life watching this waste. <br /> <br /> I ask you - it's not worth watching. Watching it is not even worth it. Save yourself pain and move on.
