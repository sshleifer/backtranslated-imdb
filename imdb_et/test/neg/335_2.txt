I made great efforts to get this movie after reading this site's comments. I don't really have time to write comments, but I felt it was my duty to sci-fi horror buff. This is just another review I've written. The second was Dracula 3000. This movie was sucked. Simple and simple. I was still wondering if I was watching the same movie as those who wrote all these "cute" comments. I've seen movies that have bad effects, bad performance, bad sound, you call it and I've seen it. But it really did. I don't care about how much it costs or does not pay because such films and Dracula 3000 should be banned and the whole cast and the team arrested and imprisoned for the murder of time. By the way, did I mention that the film was sucked. I mean really suck. The plot did not exist and the operation was weak. It seems that the writer saw Pitch Black and became disturbed because he didn't think of such a plot, so he decided to make his ripped version. But instead, the miracle worker took over and conquered him. DO NOT THIS. You have more fun when you pull off the pants and sit on burnt coal.
