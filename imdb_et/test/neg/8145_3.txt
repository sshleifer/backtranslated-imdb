Two years after this short time, the last short "Our Gang" was made. Once you've seen it, you don't know how it lasted longer. The quality of "our gang" was shortly after moving from Hal Roach to MGM and this short is a great example. The gags are all very uncomfortable and Froggy's last line of being the happiest day of his life is, in your opinion, a bad picture of what's for him for the rest of the time. A very bad example of making movies.
