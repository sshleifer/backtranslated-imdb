I finished this H.P. Lovecraft's "The Lurking Fear", which was shot in Louisiana. Outside some changes (names, setups), this will follow a short story-by-point score in the first 70 minutes, but then try to enter the end of your own "twist" you see miles away. In both cases, it is a much better adaptation than the Full Moon LURKING FEAR. Too bad it's a terrible movie. Directed by David McCormick, it captures the industry with short beauty. I swear I took into account two camera movements. The creature's design is inexpensive (we are talking about the shops bought in the shops here) but shot in the dark (deliberate or not) where they are somewhat creepy. The most impressive thing in the picture is the abandoned mansion, but McCormick doesn't use it. File it for good customization, bad performance.
