Half of the movie is flashing lights and a shaking camera. The rest are predictable characters (think science vs. government, know-how vs. authority, etc.). <br /> <br /> What is the worst aspect of this movie? Are these cars thrown out in the first 5 minutes, is it a terrible "Russian" accent of the "cosmonaut", is it an uninspired character, a badly integrated Top 40 hit, or a "US saves the world" vitriol? It is a fact that, despite the "sad" ending - in this film, there is very little tension - we know basically what happens. <br /> <br /> One good part of this movie: "American Components of Russian Components: Everything Made in Taiwan!"
