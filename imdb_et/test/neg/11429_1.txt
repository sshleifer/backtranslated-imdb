Ah, here it is! The movie people say to recall the epic "Trainspotting". OUCH, I was stupid to believe, and OUCH, how my buttocks hurt after I forced myself to see this c ** p from start to finish. After the first 10-15 minutes I just wanted to stop, or at least they could have put some nudity or action or cold acid house music to be worth it ... But not when I was through it I put it on my CD shelf and I hope I will never have to pick it up anymore to show it to a friend who is so eager that he doesn't want to listen to his warnings.
