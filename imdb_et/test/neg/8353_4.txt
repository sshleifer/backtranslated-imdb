If I had never seen the original Avengers episodes with Blackman, Riggi or Thorson, I would have appreciated this series more. Although the cast did its best to keep the scripts in action and interest, I had just hit the episodes with the original series. It was to be expected that Steed would be more involved in the struggle, and continuity seemed as if writers were trying to keep up with the actors. Frankly, I can't blame them for trying out their original series of resurrection, but it just didn't work, as evidenced by the fact that it lasted one season. Tracking the Steed Workforce through this series reminded me of Major General Macarthur when he said, "Old soldiers will never die, they will just fade!"
