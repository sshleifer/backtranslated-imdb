The greedy land parade in the tiny western city of Prairie City wants all the shepherds to get out of their country using tactics of intimidation and arson to free them; it seems that the city is swimming in oil, and when a Swedish farmer refuses to leave, he mows the baron by a hired weapon. The farmer's sailor's son arrives soon and understands what he is against and tries to fight the rest of the population. Another lawless-western story where everyone is a villain (who naturally owns all the cards) under his thumb. Derivative instruments and occasional awkward views, a long wait, before our stochastic hero finally gets his dandruff. Sterling Hayden's half-hearted Swedish accent is a big problem, although it cuts the screen to a strong, sympathetic presence and makes the picture almost remarkable. Director Joseph H. Lewis steers most of the scenes rigidly, like the TV west, and Gerald Fried's bugle-hard score is not helpful, although Ray Rennahan's rich black and white cinematography is great. The independent production that appears through United Artists is a strange beginning for the film (starting with the finals, followed by shots from the middle of the film), but it has a certain stubborn force that is most firmly on the Hayden side of the viewer. ** from ****
