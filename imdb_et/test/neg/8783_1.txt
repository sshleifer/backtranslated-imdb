This movie sucks completely !!! Don't even rent it! You hate it! The plot didn't make sense, the characters wonders and why did the penguin anyway try to get a stone? If this girl penguin would only want her because she has a pretty pebble, then the relationship would not be based on love only for money! I didn't want this movie very well (hate is such a strong word!). And penguins can't fly! Even if they believe they can, they will not. ps.s. I'm not the one you think I am!
