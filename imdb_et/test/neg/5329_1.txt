Writer-director Emilio Estevez shows an intolerable lack of talent here with this irrevocable, supposed comedy. The script is completely hopeless, not to mention that it is unfair and badly worked. Comedy just doesn't work. If Estevez does not use the bad taste of sex jokes, she borrows the used gags and makes them very badly. You think that joining Estevez and brother Charlie Sheen would be cool ... but ... that's not the case. barely smile from your audience. Do it yourself and leave it on the video clip. <br /> <br /> Thursday, June 25, 1992 - Video
