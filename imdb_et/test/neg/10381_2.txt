Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a film about a young girl. Do I have to describe a lot more to you? Emily Rose's exorcism and exorcism are two terrible scary movies. Classics (IMO). Blackwater Valley Exorcism (BVE) is not. Not long shooting. Surely this is not as terrible as the exorcist's low budget might have been. From the beginning to the end, this feeling is "made for the Sci-Fi channel". This is one of those films that are likely to be violated and ridiculed at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (or similar exhibition). <br /> <br /> The composition and effects were completely ridiculous. Action was terrifying. There were no performances that did not lead me to eyes or strangle. Oh, except maybe Jeffery (Re-Animator) Combs as a sheriff. The script was not terrible, but it was definitely not special. <br /> <br /> It seems like most movies where everyone is more focused on the one who sleeps with the girl in the possession of the demon. in another room. There was something I learned from this movie. Obviously, if your teenage daughter is a demon, then you have to lock everything in the room. C'mon. And if your daughter has taken over, do not worry too much, because it all makes it a funny voice, eats rabbits, tries to stare you and put your bed in fog. Besides that there is nothing to worry about. Apparently he had a low budget D-List demon. <br /> <br /> No A-List demons such as crucifix, painful body distortions, or even vomiting of bullets did not do any frightening action. > <br /> A totally ridiculous movie. Not even worth the discount. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
