Or better still, look at Fandang if you want to see a truly intelligent and funny male college roadmap. Rolling in Kansas sounded promising (in fact, the program guide gave him four of the four stars, which usually means it is quite observable), but I passed it very quickly. Usually the movies on the journey are great music, but I can't even remember if the music was. The only high point was the small role with Rip Tower as a wise old hitchhiker / guru. Otherwise, jokes and timing were along the way. The four main characters are unknown actors and I don't remember any of them in the movie. (Oh, yes, I see Thos. The Hayden Church was in it, but he's all, good, bad or indifferent). This movie is as funny as looking at someone else's rock, if you don't.
