this film is basically the poor, having an old babysitter's legendary legend who gets a crank that tells him to look over the kids, he calls the police who watches the calls and finds out who comes from inside the house. if murderers have a story that is so easy, a little boy would have written it. There is not much intercourse, it turns out who the killer is in the movie half way. In the beginning, when the first victim is killed, it appears to be a pornographic site or something like a fetish scene with a prisoner. What's with it? The film is a typical ticket price, the plot is as original as the Beatles concert. even under low deficit standards, it is cheese. don't waste your time with it. enough said
