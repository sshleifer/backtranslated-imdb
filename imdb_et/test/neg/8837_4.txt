It is sad to say that this is one of the lines of John Wayne's poverty line in the West Lone Star series. Here he is a Marshal of the United States, which is just a bandit that I don't know like a shadow. <br /> <br /> No, it's not Lamont Cranston, it's some guy who gives his orders through the open wall safe so his men can't see who he is. But the voice is infallible, you can find out within 10 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> And another reviewer here is totally wrong, no hits or hurts from the audience, because Gabby Hayes still played different roles and has been cleared here. He had not yet found his niche in the form of loving old newspapers such as the Duke, like the kowboy heroes of various Duchy states. <br /> <br /> Later, he leads his men at the very open end, so I'm not sure which point the original trick wall was safe for. I don't think those who wrote it did not know. <br /> <br /> Wayne will become Yakima Canutt's Indian kick and this relationship is almost the same as unexplored Lone Ranger and Tonto. <br /> <br /> It's all stupid when you ask me.
