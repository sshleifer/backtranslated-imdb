I saw this movie about 8 years ago when it first came out, and the only memories I have are: 1. It was terrible. 2. Linnea Quigley applies a tanning aid for hands and feet for about 15 minutes in a single scene (it seemed so long). 3. One scene where a character can loot his head. In this scene, when the hammer connects, the head crushes like a glass. That's pretty bad.
