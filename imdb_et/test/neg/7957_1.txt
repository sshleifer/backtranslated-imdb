Copy cats have copied this movie from the 1974 Hindi movie "Call Girl"! "Call Girl" was an identical story. How the protagonists fall in love, then rebels and climaxes both films the same! "Call Girl" is better than Water, at least the story speaks. It wasn't as agonizing slow as Water! On the contrary, water does not progress at all. The goal is to change the audience forever to Kalyan! Are Indian filmmakers better than just those big copiers these days? Well they call it "inspired." In your language it is: "inspired (without any quotation!)"! :)
