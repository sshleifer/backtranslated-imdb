I watched this movie in the first 30-40 minutes on television the second night and I can agree that it is by far the worst. No one is funny, even Randy Quaid will not save that confusion. Eric Idle wasn't N.L. The Euro. Vacation and she's even worse here. The only funny scene is where they are at the airport and some guys dress like Santa are walking with the camera, worshiping: "Does anyone lose it?" if she has a prosthetic ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 star ****
