A nonsense movie about two girls and some boys they meet at the airport with the wrong late-night bus and get around the world. Great turns and turns are completely, and I mean completely, in a movie that is so incredibly stupid to ignore this description. In a general sense, it is good, I mean, the idea that a man who robs unattended girls is a disgrace. The problem is that the details are so incredible that I would be shocked if you didn't turn the film out of total disbelief. Gee, a man who thinks you're going home, doesn't go in any way you know, and you get on the bus? It gets deeper there, think about every bad choice, and this movie has signs, even that they could just walk, but never. What's annoying is that some twists and turns could have worked if there was something intelligent before that, but there is almost no intelligence in this movie. Okay, maybe it's the end, the end is smart. The end is something that should amaze you. it should be "oh # $ * @ !!!!" for a moment and become the classic of the cinema. Instead, it simply lies among the foolish ruins of foolish movies. One year of meaningless movies.
