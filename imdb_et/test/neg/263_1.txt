It's a formidable, boring, dirty and ridiculous movie that has ever been created. Under the film is a crazy child and his friends and they land with 747. His dreams are very horns and do not make sense at all and are very badly done. Every special effect looks like it was done without modern technology, and it could have been created by a child who plays a "leading role" in the film. When you watch this movie, it will definitely make you a stupider. I suggest you ever watch this movie, and if you do, good luck and don't leave the brain cells you've killed. My comment does not even reflect the terrible creation of hell. The person who wrote my comment did not look at the same movie I was watching terribly, and I would never have watched. Peace.
