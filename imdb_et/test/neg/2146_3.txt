After watching over 50 years of enthusiastic films, I have some simple rules for making good movies. <br /> <br /> 1. Introduce your main characters early, certainly within the first half hour. 2. Keep your characters to a minimum. Customize your novel by combining the characteristics and activities of the small characters <br /> <br /> into one person 3. Make sure your characters' actions are reliable; if necessary, create additional scenes to create motivation. 4. Keep the activity clear. Violence does not have to be explicit, but it must not be confusing. It is often more important than acting, photography, etc. 6. Usually, if the movie is not very good in the first 10 minutes, it doesn't go right <br /> <br /> "Cannon for Cordoba" is a textbook example of what happens if these simple rules are not followed. Elmer Bernstein's score is dirty, one of the worst I've ever heard in a modestly budgeted film. This is absolutely surprising given the powers of Bernstein ("Man with Golden Hands", "Great Seven", "Great Escape", "Sons of Katie Elder"). Paul Wendkos' direction is weak and confusing. The performances vary from very good (Don Gordon, Peter Duel) and terrible (Raf Vallone, Giovanna Rally, Gabriele Tint) and are usually trusted by George Peppard who fall somewhere in the middle. It should not be surprising, given the average direction and the amateur script that violates Rules 1, 2, and 3. Don't waste your time. I'll give "Cannon Cordoba" a "3".
