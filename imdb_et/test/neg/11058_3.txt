In another case of misleading marketing, this film has been added to a 10-film DVD, called "Women Who Are Beating", but even in the original cover it seems to allow Shannon Tweed to play a role. In fact, Tweed plays a typical smiley and ridiculous female, who has to be rescued by male leaders during most of the film, and even if she is trained in the jungle war, she must still be dragged! There is one female rebel who has a stronger character, but she is mostly on the film. The male leader is Reb Brown and has some (inadvertently, I think) funny moments (like a power outage). Active scenes are poorly targeted and poorly acted: some stuntmen needed some lessons "how to shoot and die convincingly". I think if you are in the right mood, you will find a few things that "Firing Line" would laugh at (at one point we can hear Tweed talking, but his lips are not moving!), But mostly I just forgot.
