The "Fucking House" (also known as "Specter") is one of the horrors of a small budget haunted house full of mediocre performances and cheap effects. It is a family that suppresses the old Irish mansion, and after the movement, they begin to experience strange phenomena and ghostly phenomena, including the ghost of a young man who was murdered and buried in the wall of the manor in the basement. The couple's young daughter is then thrown into another dimension and the help is sought from a group of paranormal researchers. <br /> <br /> The ideas that this movie borrowed from the 1982 haunted house film "Poltergeist" are obvious. I say this film has a somewhat horrible sequence, but sometimes it is very boring. The action here is nothing special, the mood is fine, the score (which was mostly in the Irish opera opera music) was somewhat annoying and the CGI special effects are really terrible. I think it was 1996, you think they could have done a little better than they did. The end of the house was the poorest special effect I've seen, very cheap. But hey, this was a cheap movie. <br /> <br /> The translucent monster wolf that their daughter sees is terribly fake. And what was the significance of the film? What the hell is a wolf monster doing with a haunted house? Here are the special effects that really destroyed this movie. Action was too bad. I usually enjoy a lot of low budget horror movies, but not that. The "Fucking House" is nothing special, just look at it if you have nothing better to do. But you probably want to pass it on. 4/10.
