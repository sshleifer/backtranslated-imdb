Why can't I make better TV movies that I loosely created today and watched this movie on satellite TV in the UK. What was a terrible waste of my time. Poor sets, bad behavior and oh my god, which is a terrible flood. Blimey, a woman can even cross water torrents! <br /> <br /> I really want people to make TV movies with better effects, better or at least more credible plots, and much better action. Killer Flood is doing well with bad behavior. A few pieces of ham could not work worse. <br /> <br /> 1 last thing I really agree with a dog comment, but I believe it would be in real life!
