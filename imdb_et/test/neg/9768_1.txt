This movie is absolutely terrible! I thought it had good actors like Gabrielle Union, Hill Harper and of course the notorious Billy D. Williams. The film is long-lived and draws a documentary style to show the Gabrielle Union, who died in the film, about his family; what else is a confused family because you never know who is who and who is involved. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, and I wish I could take it back from where I got it. I drank from time to time because of boredom. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. It could have been more to life with more drama and less boredom.
