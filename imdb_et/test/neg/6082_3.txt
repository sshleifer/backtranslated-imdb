The film was terrible. A manufacturing company should be required to pay a fine for wasting electricity from this house. <br /> <br /> The plot had too many holes. Why should DOJ send a killer to murder the world leader? If they weren't a DOJ, why could they send someone they thought wouldn't do the job? Butch Cassidy quote: "Who are these?" Probably the director doesn't know because he didn't tell us. <br /> <br /> The characters were incredible. They didn't behave in any way that seemed to be the one they were supposed to be. None of the characters, except the doctor, was particularly convincing or pleasant. <br /> <br /> If you want to spend money on electricity to watch this movie, feel free. Otherwise, run the opposite direction.
