... but memorable because it contains the actress I really know! James Horan is Lawrence Olivier by standards of this type of film. He has given some decent performances on things like Highlander and different Star Treks, so it's some amusing, if somewhat frustrating, looking at how he's getting worse here. Okay, yes, there's a plot. Horan's character and his wife are fighting, he communicates with the filmmaker when he tries to make his "masterpiece" movie, and their guest decides to enjoy the miracle of removal. However, viewing Horan is really the only pleasure to find here.
