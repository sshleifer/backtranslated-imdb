I can't believe I promised myself in this movie that my friends in my early April 14th 2007 preferred me. This movie is definitely in your fucked theater and sick of dull pain, I have not even felt a big impact on the "frightening scenes" that I have not attracted to my audience. The worst even trampled on me because my friend didn't come to the theater at the right time because he was busy helping his boyfriend looking for suitable accommodation to stay one night. I was not very disappointed with this, but this movie is really a thing for me, a bad plot, a useless story, naively created and I don't know what to say anymore. <br /> <br /> The title does not recommend anyway that slippers and horrors have failed to cross our viewers, perhaps beating the animals may slip more than they show in theaters with a real situation. Good luck to anyone who still tries to see it.
