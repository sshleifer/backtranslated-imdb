This is a very good movie called "Up In The Air" featuring Frankie Darrow, Mantan Moreland and Marjorie Reynolds. I could only go through about 20 minutes before turning it off. Almost all lines are identical, I have no idea why they are making the movie again. I disagree with a previous post that doesn't like songs (there's the same thing). The original song is first-rate, I'm not sure if Marjorie Reynolds actually made his song, it's hard to say, because the song is usually added later and the songs are very good, surprising "B" in the movie. If you can see the original available on DVD. You will be pleasantly surprised.
