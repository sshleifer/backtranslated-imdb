I am a big Amy Adams fan and have been for years. I'm also a big music fan. That said it wasn't a good movie at any level. It is quite boring and the acting overall is very bad. Amy Adams is uncomfortable in dealing with Scott G. Anderson because he is in the second league of action. All the performances come as very amateurs. Music performances are nice but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Scott G. Anderson is just a bad actor! I assumed he was put in this movie because he has a great voice, but that's not the case. He has an average voice and songs key but it's about it. <br /> <br /> I think I understand why Amy Adams wished this movie with the singer, what I just want her to be. I could scourge this movie for other bad elements, but I'll leave it on it.
