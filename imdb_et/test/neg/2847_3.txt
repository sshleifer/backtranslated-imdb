Worse than a mediocre thriller abused by a woman who goes to bed after she's killed by her husband and sister. After deciding to prove that her husband is alive, she will follow the whole country, her risk growing every time she stops. Following him is a traditional pair of "good police" and "bad police" partners. One is convinced that his innocence is more interested in ending the case and getting home. This couple is often able to put their suspect in the corner, but never alone. All the major players meet in a remote city and the truth begins to emerge and some have deadly consequences. <br /> <br /> Wow! It was a bad movie. Lead acted as if it were calm, police did not find the police suspected of being in the police station (this happens twice) and everyone else is one-dimensional. Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br />
