It's not honest. I was really expecting it to be a fun and fun movie. I mean, I like Drake Bell from Drake and Josh and Leslie Neilson is nothing to do after his earliest classics, airplane and naked weapons. But after seeing the Superhero movie, I'm happy that you don't even have to pay for it. It just wouldn't have been close to the $ 9 ticket. More like a dollar and a few pennies. Because it would be a total of an hour and a few minutes. And when this film was disappointing, I was delighted that the working time was short, if not shorter. I just don't believe how incredibly vulgar, unnecessary and above all STUPIDs, some scenes were! And I've seen better action on a wooden dummy (without ventriloquist). As Craig Mazin deliberately wanted to make a film that deserves its 3.7, if not lower, and even try to be worse than "meet spartans". Really disappointing.
