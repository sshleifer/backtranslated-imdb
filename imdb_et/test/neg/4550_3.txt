If you like the soap series, you might like this movie. I recommend this movie to fans of Dutch soap series such as GTST, Westenwind, or even American stuff like The Bold & The Beautiful. If you don't like it: stay away from this movie. It has the same visual style, the same quality of performance, redirection and writing. The film was a big blow in the homeland, but it was not sold elsewhere outside the Netherlands and Belgium. Such a commercial film is rather strange. <br /> <br /> Maybe it says something.
