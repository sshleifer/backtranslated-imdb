Don't put aside sophomoral humor that we can find in racism and be honest ... it's not funny. I was terrible that the two main stars would agree to make a film that was so offensive and so damaging to racial relationships, and I'm not referring to the obvious black-and-white commentary on the film, but to the slums towards other ethnic groups, such as the Betty White character for Spaniards. Should we just say a movie to make this movie an age mark ... is it too old to distinguish between comedy from a stereotypical trash? Or is it the writers' fault? How would a third assistant make-up person? No, the mistake is to stay with us in the shadow of a devil (in the shadow of comedy) that Hollywood will continue us until we have enough understanding that there is enough ... racism is real and it is not a laugh. We are all different, celebrating this diversity, not having fun and promoting divergence.
