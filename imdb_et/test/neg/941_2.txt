Inan, a terrible farce is basically a young man who refuses to use the law or uses it better to achieve his goals - to deceive his parents to think he is in college. The truth is that this jerk has been rejected by every school he has applied for. After seeing this spam, you'll see why. <br /> <br /> What a ridiculous name - South Hampton Institute of Technology. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to find out the initials of this nonsense school. The problem with such films is that the non-conformist will eventually become an accepted mode. <br /> <br /> Go back to the reality world and call this movie what it really is - excessive manipulative junk!
