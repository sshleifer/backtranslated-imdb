With a terrible interruption. Not only the title, but the idea is the same as Jane Fonda, the vehicle of George Segal, a few decades ago. Why? I don't know anyone who has the power of Jim Carrey wants, not just a star, but it's tired, ugly and pointless excuse for comedy. He can take a comedy to a whole new level, instead he goes for what he can expect to be a safe territory. Money, money, brands, Christmas. But I'm sure this uncomfortable confusion has very short legs. I call it uncomfortable because I felt like that. Knowing that I was a desperate attempt to make the screen funny. And failed. It could have been a failed, politically wrong, post-Enron days comedy, but no, it would be too high, too risky. What a shame!
