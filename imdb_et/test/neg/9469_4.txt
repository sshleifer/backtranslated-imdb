Telly Savalas performed a satisfactory (but not better) performance at Pancho Villa, according to the notorious Mexican bandit / revolutionary concept held at Villa Villa in 1925 in the city of Columbus in New York. The villa is not really a historical figure I know too much, so I'm not talking about the historical details of the film. It's not great as a film, though, here and there, there is both activity and humor. Chuck Connor's performance with Colonel Wilcox, US Army Base Commander near Columbus hit me a bit and Clint Walker, as Villa Gringo Sidekick Scotty, didn't do much for me. The film is probably a rather limited budget of technical quality. For a movie that lasts only one and a half hours, I have to say that this movie was dragged in places, especially in the last 20 minutes. The Villa's attack on the United States was interesting (as a general scheme of things, not particularly important) in the historical sidebar, and it was probably better than that. 4/10
