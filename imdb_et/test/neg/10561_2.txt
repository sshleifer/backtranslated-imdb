Maybe if you just laugh at how my favorite Jane Austen's works are depicted. Maybe I'm too serious about this adaptation, but I'm afraid I'm biased against the A&E version. I find it hard to imagine Mr Darcy being someone other than Colin Firth. <br /> <br /> Characters seemed low and often forced to dialogue. Lizzy seemed to be a lack of a true feeling that is so obvious in the book. His fiction against Wickham was over and then his steep as Darcy was not believable. <br /> <br /> Darcy was well tolerated, I give it. He managed to maintain the necessary weakness, but I felt that he did not plan for the feeling and inner struggle that made his character so wonderful, especially in the scene of the proposal. <br /> <br /> Mr and Mrs Bennet also played well, but it seemed to be inadequate in many ways. The average temperament of Mrs Bennet was not completely hidden in her performance. Mr Collins had a good idea. Very much in line with the book. <br /> <br /> I don't want to comment on Lady Catherine except to say she's probably the worst picture of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Other Problems I saw the little freedoms they took with events such as Darcy, who attended the first meeting with Lady C., and that Miss Lucas and Sir William did not join Lizzy on her on a visit to Collins. <br /> Choreography was terrible during dance scenes. A scene where Lizzy and Darcy dance lose a lot of their intensity because they can't ignore the fact that they look out of the dance hall. At least this BBC version left dialogue between Lizzy, Darcy, and Sir William when he praised them for dancing as they really did. </p> But generally I find this version a disappointment. I would not recommend this movie if you do not like me, and you have too much displacement. <br /> <br />
