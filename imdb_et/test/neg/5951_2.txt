I totally agree that reenactments will kill what might otherwise be a great show. I admit I saw 1 or 2 episodes last season and it wasn't at all clear that all this was done again. But when I recently captured one episode, it suddenly jumped with me to BIG TIME and I lost interest. Then, at the beginning, I noticed the disclaimer that followed the disclaimer. Has anyone followed this indicator closely enough to tell me if they made parts of "functioning" and "recovery" more artificial, or did I not know it before. I'm usually pretty good at feeling this stuff, but the recent episode was so obviously artificial that I practically fell over it. Now I have no interest in reviewing and abandoning it completely. It simply does not give any real value when it is written and acted upon. And at least lately it seems very badly written and acted. The above comment that says who cares if it's all reenactments, I'll do. Without the visual fact, it's just a bunch of "you know what happened, once this guy". This is the information you read better from the book.
