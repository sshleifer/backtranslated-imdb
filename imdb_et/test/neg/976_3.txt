Showtime I got the impression that the producers got the idea to make Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy just to get a movie that celebrated these two. Other than that, I don't think of justifying the existence of a movie. Not that it's not fun, it's definitely, but the concept is so ridiculous that laughter is somewhat silenced. <br /> <br /> What really got was the character of Eddie Murphy. I do not seem to think of the concept that someone is a police officer, so strictly a day's work. When I was working in the New York State Victims' Council, I had to deal with all kinds of policemen and ran between really dedicated and some real sorcerers, but I can't think of who thought it was just something I'll do until I get my career far area. Do you really see if Eddie Murphy or anyone else goes through the real police academy rigors, not the screen version, but to get the day's work? <br /> <br /> Anyway, DeNiro is your main hard-working detective on the road to a larger dealer. He is secret and Murphy is part of his backup. So, as Murphy showsboat shows, he calls a reality-based TV series like COPS to film the action. <br /> <br /> So DeNiro's bust burns high, but the exhibition's producer gets some good Murphy and DeNiro material and decides on a new reality-based TV series. So these unwanted partners are joining and trying to continue DeNiro's case around all television cameras. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy is a funny man, I loved him in Beverly Hills Cop and Doctor Doolittle movies, but he has done better than Showtime and Robert DeNiro certainly. <br /> <br /> I think Murphy wanted to work with DeNiro, and DeNiro must have received one nice salary to make this movie.
