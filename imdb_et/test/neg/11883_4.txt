It is the voice of a person who just finished Rome for the second season, almost once, and seized the opportunity to see what happened next - this film is conveniently at the end of Rome. If you find the abomination of Rome, with an unfortunate mouth with little historical precision, you can enjoy the Empire: Augustus. But if you feel that Rome is a good thing, if you enjoy the intrigue of the intrigue, the atmosphere of decadence and the work of the actors, then Imperium will obviously show you an overly shy, redundant and tedious soap opera that does not have many redemption factors. <br /> <br /> There are some actors who look somewhat better in Rome for my taste. Especially I did not like Cleopatra as a sex addicted to drugs in Rome. This woman must have a lot of strength and dignity, and the Empire actor fits much better into this part. O'Toole and Rampling are good and some others. But then ... If you become familiar - and love - Atia as a super cool bitch, you will find her image in the Empire - a teardrop mother with a goose in an apron - completely ridiculous. There should be some bitchy characters in the Empire, but these actors rely heavily on men and nothing else. There are no interesting female signs in this epic. There is also a painfully comic Maecenas, which we see as a scary queen of bull, although there is little historical evidence that she was such (she has repeatedly referred to as "joyful her pleasures"). The interiors are quite small and rely on clichés in clichés. Cleopatra's large hall features a computer game or children's playground in the Egyptian theme park. There's really bad 3D graphics, not up to 2003 standards. <br /> <br /> The action is presented as a series of returns that Aged Augustus lives on. So we are quickly looking at some historical events, some of which are well presented, while some are not. A disproportionate amount of time is wasted to show Livia as Augustus an "eternal flame". This thing doesn't even shine for a moment, dialogue is the ultimate, and everyone is flavored with tear-ripping music technology. Regardless of the amount of reality, it tries to show that every last cut is destroyed by dry synchronized copying (most of the actors are not English-speaking). <br /> <br /> All the epic is all lukewarm. True, there are more historical accuracy than in Rome, but to put it dramatically, it's plain boring. Characters do not have depth and sharpness of dialogue. Camera work is often reduced to static shots and lighting does not give you anything. <br /> <br /> Nobody wants to admire and hate someone in the Empire. Regardless of whether you liked or disliked Rome, there are many better films and miniseries. Ancient Rome: The rise and fall of the empire would be one thing I would recommend.
