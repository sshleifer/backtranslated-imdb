One of the worst surfing films I've ever seen. This movie is so bad that I don't know where to start - Okay, let's start with the premise - some French continents who hardly know how to surf in Hawaii and enter the big wave festival, which he mostly looks to win. A good analogy for those not surfing would be that it is a very overweight chain smoker who strikes pairs of running shoes and enters LA Marathon's expectations. Not possible! And the competition takes place on the North Coast, which is a 15 + foot wave, but the race day is 6 feet. Acting? What works? If you need to see it on television, don't waste your money on renting. If you want to see a pretty good surfing film - it's wrong, but it's another story - rent a big Wednesday.
