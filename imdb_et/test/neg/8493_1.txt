I just get a picture of how this movie came: <br /> <br /> "How else can we turn our career?" <br /> <br /> "I know! Let's take a movie that was wildly successful and doing it again! <br /> <br />" Perfect! We get B-class actors who have half the charisma and want only 10% of Carrey's original salary. We record millions and rack up huge profits, never mind the fact that no one wants to see a second level, if not one of the original actors who made it popular! However, as leaders, we honestly believe that the movie was popular on the name and story, not the actors who did it for the first time! "<br /> <br />" Brilliant! Let's put a huge budget and get the most affordable actors we find! "<br /> <br /> And in fact, this is what Son Of The Mask can describe as just a simple B-class movie that tries to suck, nevertheless, if the film does not contain mask words or something that would be masked , it would be a nice childrens ... terrible act, it really likes kids.It is a good character flick that really wants to shout "like me!" but only those 8 and younger really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Jamie Kennedy is the only thing that is very useful to mention this movie, it is trying to do the tangible work, playing the desperate father, but the script is so poor, the only thing worthy of what was worth was my drink after seeing it. he was the most pleasant character and really one of the only reasons why older people see this movie. <br /> Plot is so p I do not want to mention it here. It's all so clear that even a Disney exec would be green with envy. <br /> <br /> Save your money by going to the DVD within three months of its appearance. Shame on the studio that once again a terrible continuation of a decent movie is terrified. Did the dark and dumberer teach them nothing?
