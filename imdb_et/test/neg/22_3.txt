When you make a movie with the assumption of a killer-child, there are two approaches; You can make it as realistic as possible by creating incredible characters and situations, or you can play it as fun as possible by laughing (what the "Silent Night, Deadly Night" makers did for example was the same controversial subject: killer Santa). People who made a "bloody birthday" don't do either; they simply rely on their hand with a weapon (or knife or arrow or arrow) for the value of a child's image shock. The result is as offensive as stupid. The whole movie looks like a bad idea that was rushed through production (and then held release for several years). It is redeemed from small children for good performances, but it is very slow. (* 1/2)
