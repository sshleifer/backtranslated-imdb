In my opinion, it is amazing that so many people (probably Poles) have voted for this film, giving it such grades (usually tens). OK, the movie was nice, funny, but on the other hand it was nothing special. The only good thing about Kilyl is the dialogues, not the Poles. The scenario is primitive, acting (except Jerzy Stuhr as Ryba) - terrible. It's nothing but nothing - luckily it's not in the top 250. P.S. Further "Kilerow 2-och" ("2 Kilers") is on the road and it's just the same story.
