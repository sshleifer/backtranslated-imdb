How did I look at this mess? The worst ever. Acting was terrible when I read that it was a comedy that I smiled at least once or twice, but .... If you want to lose an hour and a half of your life, it's the right movie. I suggest just looking at the wall or something, something other than watching this "movie". Yoy can even watch a documentary (if you are a man) about pregnant women, I guarantee it will be more fun :) This one actor (I forgot my name) is not so bad, and I'm surprised at how good the role is. Anyway, "I want someone to eat cheese" is the right movie if you want to punish someone.
