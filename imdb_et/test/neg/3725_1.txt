I want 99 minutes of my life, which was wasted because of this pathetic apology to the film. The actor was terrible! I used to be a fan of Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio. I'll never look at them again. Keanu Reeves and Dan Aykroyd were no surprise. Everyone knows they can never act. Fortunately, only Dan was trying to accent. His accent was a disaster as expected. I think he was confused about the location of the movie or had never talked to anyone about Minnesota. I hope this review will help anyone who has decided what to do with their precious time. The only reason I was able to sit through the whole movie was that I was stuck somewhere without better viewing or reading.
