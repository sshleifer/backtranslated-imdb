Why did Jeffery Combs take the lead with a number of name specialists (Lance Henrikson, David Warner, Joe Don Baker)? Henrikson would have been in the lead, like Warner, Baker, or even others in the movie, like Charles Napier. The combs failed and did it badly. Everything he did seemed to be fake or understandable. <br /> <br /> The script is poor. This means that if Lance Henrikson (or another) had a lead role, he could have recorded the film (remove it from my "waste of time"), but it would still be a bad movie. The screen was completely missing. The director should have recognized it and helped with the film.
