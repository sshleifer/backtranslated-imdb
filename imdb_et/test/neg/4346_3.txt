Not "confused" in the sense that "Gee, this movie is very complicated and hence difficult to follow!" But confusing in the sense that "Gee, this movie doesn't really know what it does!" <br /> <br /> ATTENTION is Hong Kong / South Korea co-operation, but it is all pointless. The film of parallel universes that have traveled over time confuses the love story with confusion. The film has a mindset that attracts the mind. Again, do not talk about your mind because it is so big and complicated, but it says in the sense that it is so ridiculous and no one can imagine that no one reaches such a terrible assumption to get started. Nothing about DREAM OF A WARRIOR is reasonable and because the whole movie should never have been done. This is quite terrible. The only sustainable arm is an actor who plays a female warrior (not a female). <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
