Oh well ... its funny. it should have been a sadistic comedy, many horror films lacking common sense, but I think a slowed cave man would be dull around this situation. Don't wait for Hitchcock or anything close to it. it is good for friends, but I wouldn't want anything else. This movie doesn't contain all the content of a real horror movie, temporary, shock and good characters. The killer was not the unstoppable force I was expecting, and he seemed to be an average angry “D” student who was able to cross only stupid people. and the really funny thing is terrible action and the lack of "victims" emotions. <br /> <br /> 3/10 is waiting for it every day.
