First of all. I'm not looking at the Americans. I know a lot of people who are US intelligent people. But this movie is so bad that I just had to comment on it. <br /> <br /> First of all ... Movies are mostly far from the truth. This movie is no exception. Many scenes are so incredibly wrong. For example, the departure of two spaceships. You see, they empty the tanks full of space. Just far from each other. Remember what caused the explosion of the space shuttle in the past? Just came part of the brush. It is common here that fuel tanks of the same size, if not larger, are the entire ship. What idiot would allow 2 spaceships to be lifted and done at the same time? Secondly, the Russian railway station is a piece. I hate to give it to you, but today astronauts go to Russia. Because their devices are much more reliable, NASA. Space Shuttle is retired. And NASA uses it only to pay bills. And there's no better alternative to that. And the whopper list goes on and on. It is really offensive to people who take space to travel seriously. And I know the parties do as much as these guys do. But the most troublesome part (read: the whole movie) is the propaganda and patriotic crap that is being defrauded. MU GOD !!!! I thought I'd look at CNN's commercial trade as an hour. Actors solve their small problems by shooting each other, giving the middle finger to everyone they come into, start fighting, ignore the police, etc. etc. By sacrificing your life, all of you suddenly face suicide (bomb detonator)? Maybe I do not feel like a true "patriot" capable of singing folk in Swahili. When you drive with George Bush behind the steering wheel of a golf cart, it runs in circles until the battery is empty. But this movie was too much for me. And when I finally got hold of and pulled the flag of the American flag and fabric out of my belly. I realized I was happy to finally do this movie. I don't know why so many good actors took part in this narrow-minded, stereotypical and propaganda clip. But I regret them. It is a country where you can get a murder if you have the money or the power. As long as "Uncle Sam" thinks you are a good patriot. If everyone is happy, if it is another country that has been destroyed, no one will care.
