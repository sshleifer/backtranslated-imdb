What can I say about PLEASURE PLANET, which I didn't talk about about eleven other annoying soft core porn movies? Very little . This is just another film with a very weak plot that created very convincing scenes between men's non-actors who spend too much time in the gym and bimbos who have apparently had silicon implants. In fact, the sex scenes of this film are somewhat more convincing than you usually see in this type of film, because cast members grind their hips together, giving painful expressions like they have got constipation or something. No wonder many people claim that sex has been overestimated, they've probably watched too many of these movies at cable stations late at night
