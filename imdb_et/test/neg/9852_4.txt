Television shows slow motion and off-beat characters were sometimes irritating. Only through a quick return miracle could I do it in the first 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Writing shows that it is a comedy / mystery, but I didn't see much. <br /> <br /> If it rises after the first 2 hours, please let me know because I doubt I'll look at the rest of the suggestion. <br /> <br /> This review should be without a spoiler, so I will continue in a vague, non-spoiler way. I found two main characters uninteresting and uncomfortable. I found myself asking, "Is an ordinary adult doing this?" The man whose hedge trimmer looked out of the window was irritating, and when the man was communicating with him, he seemed pathetic. Did an ordinary adult irritate someone like her?
