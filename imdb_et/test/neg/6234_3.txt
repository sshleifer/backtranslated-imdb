I'm sorry, but I don't understand how the studio takes it out. The film is not just worth it. Maybe a theater game, but definitely not a movie! And why do they call it a thriller? The outside is good, but I didn't expect anything less from these perfect actors. Robert Redford plays very well and Willem Dafoe is a convincing "bad boy". Helen Mirren can play almost any role and always (still) looks beautiful to me;). I am also a fan of his British detective. Still they just don't save it so boring movie, I'm sorry. I hope that "Pieter Jan Brugge" will no longer be able to access films from this director, because this obviously does not mean the meaning of "stop and thriller".
