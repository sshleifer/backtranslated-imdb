"Oh, you pilots are such men." "They don't call it a cockpit, honey." Such a dialogue is just one of the many reasons why Concorde? Airport '79 (or if you saw it in the UK, where he pulled his heels free, Airport '80: Concorde) was the last and the least. The catastrophe was in the fears of the 1970s, which The Swarm offered a lot of inadvertent fun and Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, when Time Ran Out and City on Fire just offer a lot of boredom and despair to find a new spin from the genre here too obvious. This time it is a plot of conspiracy where Susan Blakely's news anchorman discovered billionaire boy Robert Wagner has sold weapons to terrorists and northern Vietnam. Of course he decides to tell him everything, not to tell the story, but he pulls him down, explaining, "I'm a very rich man. I have everything in life I would ever want. Why would I endanger it by doing something so incredibly stupid?" if he doesn't buy this line, let's say he's killing him on the spot, he decides to do things wisely, planning to destroy Concorde when he travels through Moscow to Paris. "I've done a lot of things I am ashamed of, but I'm not a murderer," he maliciously asks how to direct a controlled missile to destroy the plane. So there is nothing strange. And if it fails, he sends it after the jet. And when will it fail? <br /> <br /> Don't even think you're looking for something like a logic: it's a real barrel stuff that even the studio gave up and marketed in the US as a comedy after the critics laughed out of the screen. If all three of the previous entries had shiny high budget entertainment, then this small screen friendly effort (the only one that can't be shot on the 2.35: 1 widescreen) cannot even make the beautiful of Concorde, which is quite a feat. TV-veteran David Lowell Rich was expected to be heading for a quick, inexpensive, and previously staged TV movie SST: Catastrophe in the Sky, where Peter Graves's supersonic plane could not land due to sabotage and Senegal influenza (which was not, at least intentionally, comedy, despite the presence of the young Billy Crystal), it seemed like a natural choice that looks like a $ 14m TV movie that no one can get into the theater unless someone watches. <br /> <Br /> Cast is like a bad Hollywood squad episode, today the stars are very short, and most of the few vaguely familiar faces seem to be rounded off in rehab clinics and discontinued sitcoms. Alain Delon is giving Hollywood a career as the last pilot in the image, "Happy Fish" George Kennedy moves from executive to co-driver in the hope of reminding other films, while the rest of the ensemble includes a couple of Torning Inferno (Wagner and Blakely) veterans, soft porn stars (Sylvia Kristel, who tries to read respectfully), Ingmar Bergman regularly (Bibi Andersson and he plays whore!), David Warner's navigator diet, having nightmares for banana capture, fucking voice (Mercedes McCambridge), Charo and his eyesight Chihuahua (" Dohn miscon-screw me "), Martha Raye, and her weak bladder, Jimmie Walker, who plays scissors locally and smokes johnis (a few moments when Martha Raye didn't get it) kissed Cicely Tyson for her credibility as a compulsory mother with critical critics sick children and frozen heart in closed closet. airline Eddie Albert and trophy wife Sybil Danning occupy the best place in the house, Ed Begley Jr goggles and Russian Olympic players, and their lovable coach Val Avery and his deaf daughter (ahhhh!) in good will of the states (who knew about the boycott?)). Just to add one-off Simpsons to the proceedings, Harry Shearer gives one news report in the same tones he used later for Smithers. In spite of the wedding ceremony during the collapse, just George Kennedy should direct a heat-seeking missile by opening the window, closing his hand (almost twice as fast!) And burning burning? When the plane is upside down! And then Alain Delon turns off the engines so no "heat source" comes into the rocket home? Yes, somebody has paid for it in writing and someone was the future Oscar winner and Munich scriptwriter and Insider Eric Roth (hey, everyone has to start somewhere), although his defense was Jennings Lang, who came up with the plot. But what do you expect from a film that credits stunt balloons and ends with flying Concorde? Surprisingly, one of them does not recognize the moments that the studios were usually inclined to, and a few years later Universal released a 20-minute video footage to add to TV programs (not on DVD). Unfortunately, this box-office mistake led to the fifth entry, a laugh that would have been the 1984 airport: a UFO that never landed. Even more tragically, this film was used in Concorde, which fell in France 21 years later. <br /> <br /> (And, and if you don't know what Charo tells him if Chihuahua is not allowed on board, this is "What do you think? Don't worry. When the revolution comes, I promise you will fly any what do you want. I promise. What a shame, my love. What do they think they are? "
