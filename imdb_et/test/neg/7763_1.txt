"Sex and the City" are great things for it. The problem is that it is mixed with a number of negative factors that really damage the final rating and overview of your "six seasons". <br /> <br /> The good things about SATC are that many conversations are the right life, romantic stories are interesting, and the characters are fun. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is that few women act as full whores. These four women have so many partners, even in some episodes of lesbian, that you have no choice but to roll your eyes towards complete absurdity. The men on display are mostly depicted as low, degenerate, liars, scams and buffaloes. The wrong language used by these women is much more than the usual conversation. Why do writers do this? Obviously, to be up and get your attention. <br /> <br /> Another thing that disturbed me (without spoiling) is how some relationships ended. They just didn't tell me what I was discussing. <br /> <br /> But even though I gave the exhibition two stars, I am finally glad I saw the show. I've actually watched every season several times. I suggest showing anyone who is not offended by strong torture and soft core pornography. I could have done less offensive language and nudity and sex acts, but the romance was very good and the saga ended pretty well.
