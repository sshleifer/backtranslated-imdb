"Fat Girls" is one of the worst films in the indie gay genre. The Prerequisite is Promising: The average-looking gay teen is trapped in repressive small TX cities. His only relatives 'spirits are the other villagers' HS confusions: the "fat girl" class, the naive immigrant from Cuba, and the sensitive drama teacher. So far, it's interesting. Theoretically, this plot draws a decent tuning to create an attractive age story with a built-in audience - thousands of homosexual men who grew up in small towns across America and experienced this juvenile anxiety for the first time, pepper. A dose of humorous humor in itself. <br /> <br /> Ash Christian, unfortunately, is approaching his autobiographical subject with irony and dark humor. The result is unlikely, derived, two-dimensional characters that the viewer cannot get, but helps to feel indifferent. Sabrina (Fink) is almost a Goth bitter navel gazer. He is such a prickly, insecure person; there is no doubt about the reasons for his friendly status. Chemistry between him and Rodney (Christian) records zero. This can be bad casting, but it is probably due to a scenario that is simply irreparable. As a result, it remains to be considered if there is such a non-existent bond that could justify their almost constant companion for the whole story. <br /> <br /> Sabrina's new boyfriend Rudy (de Jesus) and Rodney's mother, Judy (Theaker), are among the main characters of clichés from each other. Rudy is a horny underrepresented immigrant / nerd who was lifted directly from any dirty adolescent "comedy" that has ever been made in the field of television or film. Judy was born again with obsession with Jesus-talk and big hair. Just when you thought that Tammy Faye's thing was dead, the Christian adds a scene where Judy's mascara works with her tear! Is there anyone in the civilized world who might think that this tired old stereotype is still funny after seeing it in 20 years' time? <br /> <br /> In addition to attempts at unsuccessful sardonic humor, many puzzling stories are inconsistencies. Rodney considers himself a "fat ugly" loser. At the same time, he is able to participate in occasional and regular improvisations, where there is a common school jock / hunk, Ted (Miller). Although these contacts lack emotional fulfillment, most gay teenagers (full of abducting testosterone, like their hetero brothers) find it to be an enviable agreement, considering the more common alternative to involuntary tibibati. <br /> <br /> Rodney finds his affection for an exotic transplant of Bobby (Bruening) from England. Against all the incredible coefficients, the boy does not land only in these small TX areas. Like Sabrina, Bobby is left, angry smart aleck, and the viewer leaves head-scratching on his magnetic appeal. Much to his joy, Rodney is invited to invite his new break after the city's gay bar, where Bobby claims to be a DJ. On arrival, the boyfriend immediately leaves Rodney's solo and rides to another area of ​​the bar to meet a pretty pretty young man. This is another ridiculously inexplicable plot element because Rodney's feeling of emigration is supposedly derived largely from his lonely existence in a paralytic city. As far as the city is, they have publicly gay gay students in high school? A secret bisexual football captain? Lesbian Mothers? Gay Teacher? and it is in the middle of a homosexual bar (patronizing attractive men, not less)? Apparently this place is not so modest.
