This movie should be in Milford NJ. I know a house based on both the person and the person. As you can see, he has been killed in the case of the World Trade Center. I know this because I was one of the police officers who helped to identify his residue. (She was the only one lost in our area). The nudity of the film went a little far. I'm not a bride, but the actors could have filmed a scene with two women without actually showing the whole thing. This film is a bad taste and I don't see how his family would bless him there. It is an offensive person to whom it is based.
