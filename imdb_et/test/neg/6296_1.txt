I saw it in the cinema during my initial release and I can only ask "has the world gone crazy?" The seemingly overwhelming positive response is that this poorly written, terribly predictable stapling stroke is puzzled. <br /> <br /> Stephan Elliot is not a genius filmmaker, proven by the consistent bombs he has produced since (see 'Welcome to Woop! Woop', 'Eye of the Beholder') <br /> <br /> I can only assume that a film that deals with gay / transsexual culture is the people who assume that the film does not like this sector of the population. Are we wiser than this? But interesting script and good results? Okay, so 3 managers will appreciate what they have to do, but this film contains the worst performance I have ever seen with the child's actor, not the respectful dialogue and really the flat resolution you see miles away. br /> <br /> This is a disappointing film and one that does not deserve the overwhelmed reputation it has gathered.
