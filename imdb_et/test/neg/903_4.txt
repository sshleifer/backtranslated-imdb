This strange contains Bunuel-type touches but doesn't support your interest. The 10-year-old travels to a stolen Mustang-bizarre America, while ordinary cult films suspect (Dick Miller, Mary Woronov, Susie Tyrell) malicious actions for comedy. Like his AFTER HOURS and VAMPIRE'S KISS, the scriptwriter also delights in making you pamper. I remained unchanged due to extensive action. You know that you are in favor of the most attractive fullness of meat oil and flea. (And what was this boy screen test? He's impossible.) Recommended for ten SONNY BOY fans ('87).
