If you see "2069 A Sex Odyssey" in the video store, please mark BEWARE !! The cover has Tori Wells and three more "80s" porn stars and they have copyright in 1986. Trickery !! It was made in 1974 and is dubbed German letters! There's nothing wrong with the 70's German porn, but that's not my cup, and that's not what the coat will believe you. When I went over my furious jacket, I still looked at it. It's a bad and bad movie. Sorry, I think I didn't get angry.
