Approximately 5 minutes later, the film that you found in this brutally dull cat and mouse theme, between the two main characters, becomes even worse. The biggest problem is the characters and if absolutely unbelievable. That's what the 50-year-old manufacturers and Hollywood script artists think the stoner's life is like giving them some pots for their friends. Bland, boring, annoying and completely unreal. I despise this movie.
