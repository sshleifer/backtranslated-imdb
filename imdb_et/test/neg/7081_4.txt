In a documentary film, this ridiculous camp is sort of a scriptural set of re-created Bible tables mixed with so-called "expert" festive interviews. Think of it as a commercial trade that pushes Jesus over the thigh masters. <br /> <br /> However, the detailed scene of the crucifixion is better in historical accuracy than similar scenes in widescreen Hollywood extravagans such as "Ben-Hur", "King of Kings" and "Biggest Story Ever Said." Crossing Golgotha, John Rubinstein carries his outstretched arms over his cross. The nails do not pass through his palms, but through his wrists. His legs are not nailed separately, but one is placed on the other so that only one pound is to be used. By the way, the Rubinstein slip before his crucifixion is in Book 35 "Lash! Hundreds of great scenes for men cut into films". <br /> <br /> Of course, Rubinstein and both thieves wear modest garments, which apparently do not correspond to the shameful reality of the crucifixion of Rome, but allowances must be made. Strangely enough, the "good" thief is on the left hand of Jesus, which is contrary to a long tradition. Just because the thief is in the puddle, the overweight person is still a mystery, especially considering the fact that the "bad" thief is something "hunk".
