Ahem .. I think I'm the only one who says it, but yes, I was bored during the movie. Not to say that this is a bad film, in fact, it's a very good attempt to portray the inner emotions - dilemma, sadness, love ..., that's the director's debut (read from anywhere, is it true?). I felt something was not quite right, maybe it's just me, I don't pull those characters enough to dive into my world. It's a simple story about ordinary people, ordinary life. Through simple and brief dialogues, the director tries to associate the life of a simple boy and how his illness will start to laugh every time. Oh ya his laughter was first cute, but gradually it goes to me, such a deep-hearted roar for a gentle man! I have to say that I didn't know the effects of most readers, I actually pulled on trivial scenarios like spitting watermelon seeds with my content, which clearly shows that they are happy with each other, grandmother who came back for another blow - that's a sure melancholic , a thoughtful gesture to write your father's procedures - hmm, but it's predictable .. Don't understand that I'm an act-lover, independent movies are my cup of tea! Maybe I have a lot of expectations after watching many deeper films with stronger pictures. Some Asian movies to watch: <br /> <br /> Tony Takitani (depicts loneliness) Wayward Cloud (only 1 dialog) My Sassy Girl (I like it!) 4.30 (loneliness) 15 (gangsters live in a local environment) Before sunrise and before sunset (I just have to mention them, though they're not Asian movies. Fans understand!)
