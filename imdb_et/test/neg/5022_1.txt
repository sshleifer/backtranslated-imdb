Don't kill the fans, but I have something to say. <br /> <br /> Pros: Well, the most interesting season I've been watching from all the seasons that Inuyashas just got there is the Shichinintai arc. Unlike the rest of the seasons, I think it has more real parcels and mercenaries; Good God they are so pleasant characters. Shame they were killed. Of course I wrote a 15-page essay, why I like Shichinintai so much, but it would be boring for some. So this series has really nice characters. I miss Bankotsu ... a poor, poor psycho little boy. <br /> <br /> Cons: Outside Shichinintai's arc, the series was bored, repetitive, and some signs were extremely irritating. For example, Kagome: He reacted too much to my taste; he acts like Yuka Elfen from Lied. Inuyasha: She is a hard-mouthed dog with a big sword. What's so unique about him? He has ADORABLE DOG EARS! Tch. Sesshomaru is all spoken, no action and very bright. Naraku must just be a wimpiest villain that has ever been in anime world. Miroku and Sango ... they have color, but they look too much aside. But what makes me the most mistakes is that they do not have any sense of common sense. Rumiko Takahashi has done that much better. I've seen it before. <br /> <br /> If you like a series with many activities, there is no annoying triangle of love, not repetition, it's not for you.
