There is something strange about anti-social moods that can be found in some of Cheech's and Chong's materials. One of the songs Up In Smoke, I often want to see more songs this day. But in this video apology, the stoner duo shows us videos of the four songs that are currently in their album, also called "Get Out Of My Room". At the time of the opening credit you will hear a certain voice in which an anonymous producer describes it as a novelty recording that simply takes the cards into space. Unfortunately, it hits the nail of the nail that opens, just over the head. <br /> <br /> Most RIAA-approved music files seem to be the rule at the beginning of the album. Often, when this first song passes, the attentive listener notices that there is little, if any, record to keep their attention. In contrast, bands that defragmented the mainstream convention often recorded their best material or even spread it on the disc. In this case, Cheech and Chong seem to have decided to hedge their bets. An open piece, Get Out Of My Room, is a fun themed song with incredibly bad video. Many 1980s music video viewers find a somewhat nostalgic direction. Cheech's concept of the British Punk is also very funny. <br /> <br /> If it all goes down, it's another number, I'm not at home right now. Nothing throws an interesting song quite like a repetition, and it's hard to get more repetitive than this phonetic turtle. Frankly, it seems like the desire is to hit Cheech on the face and tell him that we get the idea, he's not home now, so please continue. The next song, which is a strange thing, the theme of love, is the absolute rock, not just for this collection, but for Cheech and Chong in general. This is almost the same if the song was made just because the album's running time has been omitted. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the stoner duo recorded the best of the last, but it is also curious that Chong is completely missing this section. Born in the eastern part of L.A. is a simple number based on the old number of Bruce Springsteen, which captures Reagan's position on multiculturalism. If Cheech's story is one, one has to think about how many poor clergymen who could not speak Spanish were deported to Mexico simply because their skin was not white. Racism was an integral part of American culture in 1985 and it remains today. If this is something, it has become worse, so think about what was born in East LA if it was written in this age. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the two tips do not make the album, especially if there is so much boring filler between them. For example, interviews before getting out of My Room are pretty funny. Not sideways like a large portion of smoke, but funny enough to justify their existence. Unfortunately, the two average songs are reflected in the frame. The boring song makes a boring filler. If you cut this video out of the average hourly material, you would have something significantly better. <br /> <br /> I gave Three Out of the Get Out Of My Room. They are served by the first and last video. I'm pretty sure the stars look at this kind of material today and think about what they think.
