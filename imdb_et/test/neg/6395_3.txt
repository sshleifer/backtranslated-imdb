This movie should be called Blame in the script. Stanley Donen's director, Singin ', in the fame of rain, is not a bad thing in the midst of celluloid. It has some lush Rio de Janeiro scenes and a variety of little cladding that alternate with each other and strike the pillar's ridiculous sounds, but there's just something to be seen by fifty of what Michael Caine brings to teenage Michelle Johnson that makes you feel ... well. This story is also a full stretch. Someone who is not a pervy and a tiny old studio in Hollywood would not be embarrassed green. Maybe they're so used to having a young bimbos who forget that their fat purses are key, not their big Larry King style glasses and yellow cigar colored teeth. This is one thing when a young woman is an older man for sex, but her best friend's father, who is married? And then throw him shamelessly? Ugh! There's nothing fun about that. It is quite pathetic and grotesque. Note the talented * cough * talents of the young Demi Moore.
