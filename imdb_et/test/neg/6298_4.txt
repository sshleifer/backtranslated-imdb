Terence Stamp is able to take off, but it's still a one-dimensional film. It's nice to see - and so are the actors - and if you are a dragon, I think you like it a lot, but the plot and the characters are as thin as the cardboard. It is one of those politically correct films that integrate everything else to make the "minority lifestyle" look warm and cozy. It gets a lot of passage from the challenging dialogue that is amusing in this disinfected form, I think. <br /> <br /> Ninety percent of the action parabies a lot of costumes in awkward situations. Dramatic content is a symbolic addition - they are not trying to take you seriously.
