ATTENTION: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh <br /> <br /> Harlan Banks (Steven Seagal isn't as bad an actor as Kevin) Costner but ....... aaaaahhhh, you get it) is today's Robin Hood (listen close, you hear Brian Adams' music playing in the background ... no, not really), this guy who steals from drug dealers blood money and uses it to open orphaned orphanages. But now he has turned to lead Las Vegas manor to one of these last things before he retires. But, of course, it all goes wrong and it comes from the upper and the big boys in the prison. Here he meets a boy (although you don't know how to draw attention to this movie) Ice Cool (Treach), who makes up a friendship and quits. If he is free, he has proven innocence to find the missing money and, of course, even those who shaped him! <br /> <br /> Of all of Seagale's latest direct films today, the most important thing today is that it belongs to the cinema, even if its star star, like its previous movie, half of the dead and the exit wounds. Yeah, it looks like he's not making movies for taking care of the environment when he pretends he's black and playing with rappers. But TYD is not a cinematic film and it is a luxury A big one can never enjoy again until Under Siege 3 is realized (ever!) <br /> <br /> The film opens with a slippery, polished look that points out, but it everything is moving fast there. If Seagal is imprisoned, the plot will soon lose its coherence. Indeed, the character of Treach just seems to be going out of nowhere, without his sidekick, and you will quickly lose interest in it. <br /> <br /> That's it. I know I said it before, but I think I mean it this time. I don't think I'll give them more time out of Seagal movies. I have no respect for the Shadow Man at all. In fact, I can honestly say that I haven't really enjoyed his STV movies until then, and today you are by no means an exception, an apathetic, boring effort that is best avoided by everyone. *
