This is another imitation of an alien and not very good. Swap space in the South African desert, throw the same ingredients, a group of people in a tempting landscape, hunted by an alien creature, and you have the same old story of a very ordinary movie that is trying to tempt a classic movie. A group of miners and scientists wolf for some missing colleagues and finds their bones in the desert, which is pure meat. They drive and drive to civilization, being stuck in a monster. The location of Africa is quite enough, but it is basically the whole movie. Efforts are effortless, but I found that it didn't work and made the movie pretty boring. The creature didn't seem like much, and if it didn't, it didn't really make a horror. one scene where someone gets hung out of meat, but it was basically that gore. Finally, I found this movie as exciting as drying the paint. I give this movie 4/10 and it's just an interesting location, which alone is not enough to record this movie because it's a full stabbing
