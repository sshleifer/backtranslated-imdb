The Shamballa conqueror shows what happens when Anime creators don't understand what their fans want. I, as a fan, did not want a 1920 evil Nazi film. What I would have liked to see is a real final showdown between Ed and Dante, because we don't really know what's got of him. I would also have liked to get Ed back to my world much earlier and he would be there to finally get a chance to be normal. You know, raise a family with a certain blonde mechanic, such a thing. No, instead, I got from scratch mystics, Fritz Lang and a ten-minute-old twisted plot, Roy Mustang joke and just one Armstrong joke, one short joke and not Winry who hit Ed with a wrench. Above all, it didn't seem like a Fullmetal Alchemist to me.
