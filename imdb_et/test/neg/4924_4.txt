The film and the atmosphere that this film has, but unfortunately it does just the picture I just watched. Raymond Massey offers sheltered Sherlock Holmes, who is almost comic in the early scenes of his bathrobe, which he is working with as a worker's outfit to explore the horrible mansion of Dr. Rylott (Lyn Harding). It was not clear to me why Rylott wanted his daughters to be dead. If, like Helen (Angela Baddeley), she didn't want her to marry, she would have done the same thing when she was sent. . After the early wedding date, the fianc√© can no longer hear the rest of the picture. The presence of the Gypsy band at the time of Violet Stoner's death gives only an anomaly and what might have been an interesting murder tool, a poisonous snake, has been diluted by the fact that it was not a cobra, musical image. Despite the fact that Athole Stewart is Dr. Watson of Holmes, he is also a servant of Indian girls. As Rylott, Lyn Harding is threatening enough, it is a feature that would be used well in Holmes' nemesis professor Moriarty's two later films - the 1935 "Sherlock Holmes Triumph" and 1937 "Murder in Baskerville". <br /> <br /> With repetitive fraud and an insecure camera, it is surprising that the story is no longer disturbed as it is. Its integrity is generally preserved, even if one loses some of the gaps to fill. I think this would be my main complaint with the film, because spiritually, some of the jumps in the picture are real pain.
