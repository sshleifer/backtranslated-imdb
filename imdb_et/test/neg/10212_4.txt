Being a wrestling fan, movies usually wrestle with wrestling (Backyard Dogs, Bodyslam, Jesse Ventura), but it's not the worst I've ever seen. Yes, it is bad, but better than some others I mentioned. <br /> <br /> The stars of Hulk Hogan are basically themselves and for some reason they want to win him because he doesn't want to be in that network. Let me explain that everyone can understand .... picture US network with Rip ... and TNT go to every length to get him. <br /> <br /> Is it reasonable ... no? Well don't feel bad because it doesn't make sense. Nor does it make sense to have a real fight with Rip at the end of the film, but that doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> There is no point in this movie, but not so bad compared to other wrestling films and later Hogan movies. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
