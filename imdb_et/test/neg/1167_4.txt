Since he played Wolf McQuades, actor / stuntman Kane Hodder has been busy. His film, Hatchet, got all the ads last year, but every year he makes a few more movies. He should have missed it. <br /> <br /> Hoodder is the king of slashersi. he has been playing Jason Voorhees since Friday, 13th January, 13th, VII: The New Blood (1988) Jason X (2001). He is working on a new film that seems to be a remake of Halloween. He is very much what I would call the serum killer type with his methodical, inexpressible blood supply. <br /> <br /> But there was not much blood in this movie, and there was very little camera. I felt like looking at the actual law enforcement episode of A&E. <br /> <br /> I would not put the accusation entirely on Hodder's shoulders, as the rest of the participants did not make much contribution. br /> <br /> The Devil's Rejects by Michael Berryman ran his mouth until Gein closed it. Adrienne Frantz ("The Bold and the Beautiful") was lovely. The Veterinarian ("Three's Company") and Penthouse Pet, Priscilla Barnes did a good job. I'm sure there are other horror favorites, but all of them just showed their roles.
