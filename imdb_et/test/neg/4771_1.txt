If you appreciate your life in any way, shape or form, you make yourself courteous and go through this seemingly "interesting" movie on a DVD. <br /> <br /> I know what you mean, "I saw a preview and it looked great!" But the buyer, beware, I fell into the same trap. One of my friends expressed some reluctance to watch this movie, but I forced him to sit. Oh, how do I regret this decision. On arrival, they are disturbed by the appearance of two jungle people who are all but not greeted by them. If this is not ominous enough, the tour group will sideline large plant growth and declare the unused road used by wildlife as the ideal route to its destination. I think it wouldn't be much of a movie if they used rational decision-making and just turned to that time, but it wasn't much of a movie anyway. <br /> <br /> After some hikes, sixsome (a visitor to the resort brought a friend) stumbles and ruins their beauty and history. This means that until the reason for the arduous armed revenge of disgusting tribal peoples, there is no reason to punish inexplicable language. Because when there are brutal verbal attacks reassured by a calm, patronizing language - do not ask me - but still, most often, without any result. Suddenly, the sixth member of the track, Dimitri, strikes with several arrowheads of the Maya and all hell breaks open. Shooting stops working and terrible passengers are quickly retreating from destruction. <br /> <br /> Now that this movie ever had a plot, it ended here. The introduction lasted a maximum of 20 minutes and unfortunately the film was the best 20 minutes. After the ruins, people who are already living now realize that they have been kidnapped by murderous locals and continue to make countless good decisions, one of which has to use a warped rope to lower one of their members into the gut of destruction. Needless to say, the adventurer is seriously wounded and then trapped in the ruins and two girlfriends are seriously injured. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie continues uncharted, with no real horror, only blood and gore, as shown when one girl pulls a growing plant inside her, a bleeding blood, and then again when someone's legs are cut off, only if the girl has the same platform, strangles her later. My only satisfaction in this movie was the very attractive tracking of Jonathon Tucker, playing Jeff McIntire, growing more and more frazzled and exhausted and sitting long enough to make sure almost all cast dying of terrible, frightening death. Their simulated pain seems to be a sufficient reward for the time that was the film. <br /> <br /> It is said that the line of destruction is the old house of dangerous spirits, where evil, meat eat plants to prevent and consume unhappy visitors. Unfortunately, I did not receive such warnings from the screaming of blood-sensitive plants and the only evil associated with the film that I have really been terrified of.
