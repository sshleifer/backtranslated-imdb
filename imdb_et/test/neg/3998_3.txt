Should this be serious? I hope not. This is one of the most pathetically fun movies I've ever seen. Given that I picked this "Bad Movies" on the shelf, it will definitely live on the spot in the shop. What I can say is that gore effects have cracked (put) all over the place, some look pretty real, some look like a teddy bear that was an accident with a bottle of tomato sauce. Music is one of the most terrible things I've heard, acting as one of the funniest elements ... do I have to go on? Don't worry if you don't see all the other pathetic horror movies in the store, and that's all that's left.
