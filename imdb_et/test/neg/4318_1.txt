OK, I went to this website before I watched this movie, read the comments, pumped - because they were all pretty good for B-flick - I watched it and was completely disappointed. The main characters of the wannabe single rebels out right in the middle of the west act were the sick stomach, and can't even get me to start with two cops, I mean there's a bloody door straight from the normal view, check it out! The plot was completely predictable, the editing was quite limited, I swear that the editor was almost at the end of this movie, and the direction was bad cinematography. Now please don't get me wrong, I love B-flicke, some are really good. <br /> <br /> Want to see a good B-rated flick ??? <br /> <br /> Dave recommends <br /> <br /> "High Tensions" <br /> <br /> http://imdb.com/title/tt0338095/
