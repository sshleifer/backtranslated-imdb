In my local video mail, they have a special place for two girls and a boy. It's a long running joke. The judge allows people to rent it for free. They value their customers too much to let them waste their hard earned money. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that people gave a good overview of this movie. Maybe someone can explain it to me. (or maybe the positive comments were jokes? Did the people who participated in the film write them? Maybe the mother of the director / writer?) <br /> <br /> .
