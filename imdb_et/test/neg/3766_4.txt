I saw it for the first time when it came out of the theater. Although I was only 13 years old at that time, I was a natural science reader. The film's technical gases are burned in my memory. <br /> <br /> Some of the following may be important spoilers. <br /> <br /> Even when I was young, I knew the assumption was stupid. The rocket rises to a redemptive mission in space, where the crew always has a gravitational effect (although loose objects float like zero gravity) and because of this the "cab" (the area where the controls are, no matter what they are) was named) was girostabized to maintain the "right" direction (so when they landed, why did they not land on their heads?) and where at least the ground space had to run the rocket engines continuously - with a propellant that burns out without the oxidizer. When the engines left, the rocket stopped idling in the room and could not start until the PhD chemist identified it as a little oxidant. This time, the rocket reminded him of the momentum, and the next thing our heroes know is that they are near Mars (even a 13-year-old nerd knew that such a minimum energy trip would last over 200 days). <br /> <br /> They land, find that the air was breathing (though at a time when scientific data showed that pressure, even if the atmosphere was pure oxygen, would be too good). They decide to drive out of the camp and even build a campfire. They come armed, although they probably had to go to the firearms where they would not need them. <br /> <br /> They see the eyes of a collapsed civilization, with stray martyrs looking like humans. Nuclear war philosophy and those who survive are trying to come back to the planet and die in an attempt to break off! To do this would require such an orbital period, they would have died of hunger long before reaching their destination. <br /> <br /> The film he had previously, Destination Moon, used the real science most efficiently (though their "Rescue" with the oxygen tank forgot about the center of gravity of the current suction tank to the outlet). This film showed a terrifying awareness of even the most basic sciences. Only the most technologically illiterate should think of it as a fictional film: it is equivalent to the old Flash Gordon series, where their rocketship pulled out of their stomach and climbed into spirals and whose engines were always on. <br /> <br /> The story of what I thought to be banal, and I can only recommend it for a movie that is shown to students so they can choose the technical gases.
