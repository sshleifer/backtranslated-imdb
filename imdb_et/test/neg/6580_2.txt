I think Tom Hanks is a good actor. I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were small. I was very disappointed with the movie. One character has a completely annoying voice that gives me a nail feeling on the chalkboard. There is a totally unnecessary train / skateboarding scene. There are some characters and scenes that seem to be frightening for the children to whom this film is made. The North Pole Scenes Santa and the elves could have been cute and charming. These scenes or characters had no heat or charm. Usually, a short children's book doesn't work as a feature film. This film moves completely to my nerves.
