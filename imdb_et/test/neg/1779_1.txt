I'm a fan of low-cost B-films and sweaters, but it was too much, even for me. <br /> <br /> When you get past the weak plot, the effects of cheese and endless acting, then terrible writing kills you or you want it. The dialogue was most likely written by high school stoners who thought that when they said "sir, yes, sir" over and over again, these boys made a sound. <br /> <br /> The characters were all typical cardboard stereotypes: Gung-ho sarge, sorta gung-ho on the other sensitive side, evil scholar with secret agenda (bald or course), bitchy brain chick, too hot, if he would try, stupid sexy chick with important information, genius of idiots "nerd, random other sorta military dudes who die fast enough, and spoiler badge warning, crazy scientist who was responsible" until something went awfully wrong "Oh yeah, I almost forgot that there is a secret military (navy?) submarine, sitting on the ocean floor, 5 minutes from the headquarters (or it seems), full of radioactive scorpions (ok?) and corpses. Your mission is vague and badly defined ..... <br /> <br /> If you look at it, don't say you're not warned.
