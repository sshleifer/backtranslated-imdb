My poor tank girl, they ignored everything about you. Why do comics have as little to do as possible? I would have loved a movie that followed the plot, or at least it had characters. WHY WAN TANK GIRL AMERICAN? He's Australian, fuck! And he does not live in an apocalyptic war zone, he lives upside down with Booga as a savage. He does this because he wants to live in this way, not because he needs it because Malcolm Mc Dowell is acting. And why is he taking care of these children? The only children in the comic reach their violent exclusion, it is terrible that they turned him into a flat mother figure. In comics, the Jet sarcastic wisecracker and Sub girl are ... another sarcastic wisecracker with a strange sense of humor. In Jet, this mousy little thing and Sub is this ditzy middle-aged hag. And Booga doesn't see or handle anything he needs to be. Though perhaps the love of a hot cane / person was too much for the US box? Humor was so flat. What happened to Smith and the glittering slang they used all the time? What line is "Will it take a long time? I don't want to miss Baywatch." Even small children's programs can come out of this better material.
