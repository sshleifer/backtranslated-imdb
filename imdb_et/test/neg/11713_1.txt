I saw this movie at shows that showed bad B-movies and tried to buy them. Basically it was just a long trailer, but it really gave you a good overview of what the movie was. After looking at the trailer, I thought I'd rent this movie because it seemed stupid and general, but it might be entertaining. It is not in some sense inside the word. The film has two (or I should say four) things for that and it's not the number of deaths, it's women. They are hot and naked, and Mrs Lovell could be a legitimate actor, but not in a movie where the emphasis is on R&D and dirty dialogues. It is not even a horror film or frightening if you are not talking that watching actors try to act. The production value is pathetic, the behavior is worse and the writing is the worst. What was the idea of ​​making this movie? Scare people? Cancel "Texas Chainsaw Massacre"? Try and be funny? To show women's breasts? Do you put any boy's head in slow clothing, with fake hands and feet? To just say the characters, say "Snow" again and again? To have no real violence, but have enough nudity to cover this fact, isn't there a real plot of land? Has anyone ever seen or ever seen a movie to continue? I made a mistake in picking up this movie, don't make that mistake either. <br /> <br /> AFTER THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
