This exhibition is probably one of the most boring, most unpleasant exhibitions I've ever seen. Although humor was subtle, and I am all subtle humor; jokes were not just funny. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is about two kiwi fruit in the mid-thirties living in New York trying to start a career in their music. <br /> <br /> I saw the episode where Brett leaves the other kiwis during the robbery. Okay, the plot idea has a potential; but I got the feeling that half of the episode was just a filler and the other half was really important for the story. <br /> <br /> What I mean is that they continue to explain how the one who was left was betrayed and had a lot of mistrust about the other boy. I have one tip for writers: mention the times of idiots who can't figure out how it works, and move forward. <br /> <br /> And I found the characters were annoying. The person who left behind Brett came over too innocent and naive, the one who fell behind, spoke in this monotonous and robotic voice. <br /> <br /> The third character who was the band manager was probably incompetent, but he was one of the characters I liked. He's also the one who earned the show. <br /> <br /> All in all, the show has no intention to look again.
