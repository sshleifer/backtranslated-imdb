Creating comedy is like walking a rather thin rope. It works or not. Grandma's boy is one of those movies that doesn't work. It may have some very funny parts, but for the most part it is just a terrible marriage from the usual supporters of Adam Sandler's films (sans Sandler himself, he is just a producer). <br /> <br /> Alex (Allen Covert) is a game tester. She is 35 years old and is the best tester and gambler in her otherwise-filled workplace. He arrives at his apartment and taking his belongings so that they do not pay the bills (as his roommate had, he had spent the money on the Philipino whores and did not pay the landlord). He desperately moves with his grandmother, Lilly (Doris Roberts from everyone who loves Raymond) and his two roommates. <br /> <br /> This is the main picture of the movie thrown with the sublots hot new girl named Samantha (Linda Cardelli, unknown since her days when Velma Scooby Doos) is trying the testers to complete the game as soon as possible, a robot game that creates prodigy JP (Joel Moore) working with Alex and wearing the same clothes as Neo Matrix and of course all kinds of sex and drug related jokes. That's right. <br /> <br /> The film's problem, in addition to being a real conflict in the movie and solving it in the last fifteen minutes, is that it's not just funny. It's totally moody boring and just gently funny. Nothing happens at all. There are no emotions, no real trend, and tons of intense swearing. Maybe you will find yourself with some ridiculous laughter, which the actors say, but otherwise they will sit in complete boredom, wishing you would not even bother with the film. How this film was green and how Fox thought it could make money, is always a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> This is not just an entertaining value. Not one actor is really a good performer, but simply acts as an idiot for the camera and hopes the best. Stoner comedy has been done several times and sometimes works (Harold and Kumar Mine in White Castle and Dazed and Confused). Here it makes making the movie even less funny than it is already. The coincidence of the monkey and the bare chest does not make the film even better. <br /> <br /> Other than some funny liners, this movie should be completely unsuccessful. It's not very funny, the whole plot is silly, it's boring and it just makes a terrible movie. Avoid this as a plague. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
