My friend Zac rented this movie for free because his mother was working in a rental area. I still feel like I'm not able to get them back in my life for 100 minutes. After watching the first "Dark Harvest" after watching this, I waited to see at least the dirty remake of the first movie. Wrong. <br /> <br /> There is no peacock in the movie (except when you read the box on the cover) or the actual death scenes. The film got its R-grade 8-year-old girl, who cried with her "god d ** n". <br /> <br /> There is no tequila that could tolerate this movie. Believe me, we tried.
