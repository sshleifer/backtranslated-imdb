I found that this movie is mostly a posit was a small budget but it is not a problem. The problem is that the movie is just lame.it doesn't really do much sens.yes, it explains why things happened but that's not what i mean. It was just no reason for that. The film also moved very slowly. the last ice age was faster than it. I also thought they were going a little over the ship. That means they were too harsh, but the killer just seemed to spend too much time falling on his victim's head or grabbing his victim. maybe I am a little, but I just didn't like the movie. the whole thing seemed to be on the lower level of the version "When stranger calls" and maybe it was a whole point.
