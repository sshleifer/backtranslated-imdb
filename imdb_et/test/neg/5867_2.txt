I bought this DVD for my young son who loves the ToyStory movies. I never expected it to be in the same league as Toystory movies, but what I got was just another lazy Disney cartoon below what I expected from Disney / Pixar. The story is unoriginal, the characters are dull and two-dimensional, the animation is below par, even the buzz is not so big. The film could have been so much better. I especially hated color by numbers. I know it's meant for kids, but even kids know when something smells like that. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed some aspects of the movie, I really liked the film's opening part. a mutant monster, it went downhill.
