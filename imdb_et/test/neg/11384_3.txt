It was sick to start this movie. Here is your wife dying and you go to this blonde chic city. Then your wife will die and you will be with this chic within 2 months. Hank (James Brolin) definitely moves in this movie. I called him a quick Hank. Quick Hank is getting married to this beautiful lady and before she knows it she has sex with her best friends. The part that comes to me is when he "does it" with Kevin and catches up with another Hanks friends. Kevin Rises And Leaves, He Fails Into His Cloth And Bam! It is this other boy's hand and they will "do it" just then and there. I think he will finish what Kevin started. HOW GROSS !!!! I'm like it's a lifetime movie? This is a typical old male youth movie that says you have your own body when I get my money ...
