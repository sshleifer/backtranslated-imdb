After reading the books and seeing the 1982 Anthony Andrews / Jane version, I have to say the Seymour version is not good at all. <br /> <br /> According to books, Percy should be seemingly <br /> <br /> an unpleasant aristocrat if he is Percy, and witty and clever <br /> <br /> if he is with Pimper, but here She just looks boring like <br /> Percy and Pimpernel. Marguerite should be <br /> <br /> the most beautiful woman in Europe, not tiring and a frumpy-looking matron (she looks medieval, probably thanks to a bad make-up <br /> <br />). Richard E. Grant has done much better things and Elizabeth McGovern is inactive and confident. The books and Andrews / Seymour film thought and <br /> <br /> have been replaced here. <br /> <br /> I could add that a person who has not seen the previous version <br /> <br /> or read a book would probably be ok.
