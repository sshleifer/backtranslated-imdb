Disclosure of this movie suggests that it is shocking and sensational. Well, our opera players see some strange sight in the opera houses, so we're not shocked by the Duke of Mantua, who is urinating during the reproduction of La Donna Ã¨ Mobile, nor is it sensational to see Gilda sing in Caro Nome's bath. It's just crass and boring. What appears to be in this film is the lack of imagination. Director Corina Van Eijk sets the Duke's Palace on a drill for the pool. In fact, he is not a Duke, he is just a character named Duka, so it's hard to see why he has a lot of hangers and his own Rigoletto. Rigoletto lives in a council apartment with an orange sofa, which is designed with a spiky wallpaper that is de rigeur among avant-garde directors. In Duke, we apologize to Duka for heavy lanes (Yawn). <br /> <br /> The concepts of this kind of opera can create unexpected and unintended humor. What can we do about the fact that Gilda has a servant, though she lives in a council apartment. When the speech goes out that Monterone is taken to prison, we see that she is driven out of the pool by two shorts of pink shorts. One depicts that he is accused of urinating in a public pool. <br /> <br /> It was common for opera films to sync their lips 20 years ago, but at the moment it is not just an excuse. The dubbed opera is like soft porn. You do not believe what is happening because the performers do not make enough effort. The role of actor Gilda does not seem to have learned his lines correctly. She is moving her lips hardly when she should sing. When she sings in Caro Nome's bath, she's lying back on her feet. It is difficult to say which aperture is to be called. Later, the prince calls it at a time when he has broken up with Maddalena, giving a new meaning to the phrase yodelling in the canyon. <br /> <br /> Sound sensitivity never seems right when an orchestra sometimes sounds like it is played through a transistor radio. A rather slow, tumpity tump of the drum is preferred so that the overall effect would be karaoke in your local pub. <br /> <br /> This is Opera Spanga's production film. Spanga is a Friesland village in the Netherlands. They usually occur in the field. If I had seen the show in the tent of Friesland, I would have been quite pleased. When filming this film and making a worldwide audience, the villagers find themselves ridiculous to the world.
