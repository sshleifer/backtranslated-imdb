The film's tag is "You think you know who you are. You have no idea." I reject the idea I have suggested that I have no idea who I am and the conclusion that this film tells me who people really are. If people in real life are really like that, then man, we're screwed. <br /> <br /> An exciting movie that I walked late and left early. A film that is so surrounded by the goal of becoming a racing film of all time, losing sight of the sight of the tools the film has to use. <br /> <br /> The Hollywood rules are as follows: If you show something in the first half, it must be used on the other side. So the weapon that the daughter worries about buying her father will find the story on the other side. The Hollywood rules must turn the dialogue into a "real" change every decade. Is this "true dialogue" somehow less ridiculous than Kevin Smith's "true dialogue" ten years ago? The Hollywood rules state that we set the scene, and when the action rises, the camera moves closer to the faces - this film is mainly seen as seeing the shame, humiliation and transcendental realism of the characters. The strings increase, the frame rate slows down and our heart is meant to break. <br /> <br /> This movie is as tough as manipulative as the coats of arms. I have my prejudices against L.A, which I freely admit that to combat this prejudice, I am not saying that it is a natural situation of nature, but probably of the author and the director. The writer Paul Haggis already showed in his Million Dollar Baby, which was at least one director who understood how to make a film's vision, the flavor of humanity's controversy. Now that Paul Haggis has his hands on the camera, it is obvious that not only does he know how to write a real, natural human drama, but he does not know how to photograph or direct it. Paul Haggis comes from the TV country, forget: the land of expectations has fallen. <br /> <br /> Everything is obvious as a TV movie, simply presented to simple minds - in Haggis we are over and over again, when people on the surface seem to be terrible, they have hidden secret pain. This is a nice idea, but so vaguely, that all the bad / good sides have an amateur feel. Structurally, the film has broken down, in the tradition of Magnolia and other earlier films. Editing is as typical and conventionally "kinematic" as it could be - if there is a dramatic movement, such as opening a door or driving a car that moves between an object and a camera, the editors use such extreme movement to give the section there more kinetic quality. The problem is that, after keeping things moving, there are very few intelligence and thoughts behind the cuts - everything is in the books. Not only are his outrageous racial dolls or judy showing rude, but even curtains are lowered and lifted with incompetence. <br /> <br /> The film is desperately trying to present reality, but there is no talent at all. Some actors are good, some actors are bad, and all the performances can be broken up by the low, low aesthetics of the film. We have a cinematic art that is technically clear: we see the scene, we have a clear understanding of what is happening. But not only is cinematography unnoticeable, but it is a pointless camera work and framing that believes it is actually inspired. The result is a little stylistic bloom that you know, but you really don't add anything to drama or sin. For example - and this is a spoiler - if the father keeps his dying child (the father can also shoot, I don't stick to finding out) the camera sees his face and gives us the famous Vertigo trail / zoom. Vertigo shot !!! It was at this point that the film became hysterical and I just had to leave. I had to leave because it was so bad. I left because I was in the middle of a crowded theater, and wanted to tell the audience that I was sick with an empty Hollywood art, full of sound and rage, but that doesn't mean anything (Bard's own words). I don't want to waste such good Shakespeare references on something that's very bad.
