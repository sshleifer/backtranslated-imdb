Usually, moving is not boring. I do not have a great boost and my senses do not need to be stimulated during the film. In fact, I enjoy a good rational logical dialogue and story. Unfortunately, this movie does not have these features. Diane Lane is the only rescue arm in this movie and even her beauty can't save it. Terrible overflowing music equals moral dialogue and action. No participant is really connected to each other and as a result, the movie is not connected to the audience. I think the scenes where city dwellers are marching somewhere think they will add that story, but they seem to have just entered the space to fill it. The scenes were inconvenient and inconsistent. There were some nice shots of the ocean and the beach that were beautiful.
