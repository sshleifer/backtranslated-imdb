Finally, Quick and Undead is the first movie that actually makes your story void. It's essentially one giant plot hole. Besides, it was quite bad, the character's motivation was non-existent or unbelievable and there was no symbol that would hang on our hat. The most interesting cast member (who had a big chance of being a dark horse's main character) got halfway through the procedure. <br /> <br /> What Quick and Undead FILLS are, is a great example of how good to do color timing. It seemed good to consider budget considerations. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it looks like a man who got his hands on one hundred in size and looked at a few westerns (especially The Good, Bad and The Ineta) and then just threw a bunch of items that were randomly filmed ... "You know they have the movies where the characters do it! Is it right here? No, but who cares! It's here!" <br /> <br /> Maybe there is a good view of growing cinematographers and color artists (first year film schools). Otherwise, it must remain.
