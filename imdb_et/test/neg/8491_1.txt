11 years ago, Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City, seeking and carrying a malicious Norwegian god, the Loki Mask. The mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and gained popularity for his originality and just pure fun. Everyone knew how to write a party. P-A-R-T-Y. Why? Cuz I have to! Now, after eleven years, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new film "The Son of Mask". Someone asked Director Lawrence Guterman why did you do that? And he answers "Cuz I have to!" Unfortunately, this answer does not reflect this, because after seeing the woman's son, I still left the thoughts of the theater: "Good Lord, why?" People in Guterman and the rest of the Goddess movie must understand that the answer to why you do this movie should not be as simple as the answer to the debate, whether at the party or not. <br /> <br /> Maski's son begins with Otis dog, who found a notorious mask and brings it back to his owner Tim Avery, a tribute to the legendary creator of Loony Toons, Tex Avery. Tim, played by Jamie Kennedy, is a struggling animator left behind to work as a tortoise member for an animation company he wants for a one-day drawing. In the corporate Halloween evening, Tim will stay in the mask and turn into crazy, crazy things we all expect. After Tim comes home, he still hides and sees his wife with his wife. Nine months later, chaos arises because the child born on the mask has significant cartoons. Otis dog, jealous of the baby's attention, puts the mask and participates in Tom and Jerry's chaos to get out of the baby. Meanwhile, Alo Cumming's Loki is looking for his father, commissioned by Odin. <br /> <br /> First of all, sick to admit that I respect the fact that this film pays so much respect for classic cartoons, like Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons, with their Wile E. Coyote-type contractions and the notorious dance floor. However, this respect cannot save the film and makes it less respecting and wasting time. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie is becoming more and more stupid. The stupid thing is not always a bad thing, but in this movie, stupidity is a bit annoying. Characters are not fun to watch, and worse, they are not funny. The boredom of characters can also be due to the use of so many CGIs. One of the greatest things in the original is that, although computer animation was obviously used, he supported so much that Jim Carrey and his surprising style are just being. Jim Carrey, we were convinced, was a real comic. Jamie Kennedy does not have the ability that is clear when you look at her, rarely wearing a mask and her facial features. The child and the dog were mostly animated, which became increasingly disturbing during the film. The Loki side story that found the mask just became more and more stunning. <br /> <br /> The mask's son is sad sad. I recommend that you go to rent or buy the original mask and thank the Norwegian gods or someone who brings it to us. And next consider my sacrifice when I continued to ask the infamous "WHY?" The mask son gets one star, although this letter must be separated from the classical creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey, who is always a mask in my book.
