Pick a stereotype, any stereotype (either racial, sexual, cultural, etc.), and I bet you'll find it in Wassup Rockers. Do you think all Hispanic teen boys are stupid, furry, insecure and dirty harassers? Are Hispanic Girls Sex-Madness, Simple, Ass-Baring Sluts? Do black people want to start fighting and guns? Are all homosexual people throwing them around with them and asking the young boys to design this model? Are all white teen girls rich, stuck princesses who are bored with white teen boys and are looking for something more dangerous? If you answered "yes" to the "previous" question, you, my friend, bigot, and you LOVE Wassup Rockers. <br /> <br /> Director Larry Clark wants to shock his audience (I was 15 years old when I first saw kids and I think that's why I'm still a virgin), but Wassup Rockers isn't shocking? it's just bad. He tries to be a minimal dialogue and nervous and realistic at close-ups of body hair, but these characters and this story are completely unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Simply put, Wassup Rockers is a teenage boy's fantasy. What a 14-year-old boy does not want to be a skater who gets in trouble, runs together, drinks 40s and speaks hot, rich White girl that his uncircumcised penis looks "dangerous?" In addition to demographic, I really don't know who enjoys this movie.
