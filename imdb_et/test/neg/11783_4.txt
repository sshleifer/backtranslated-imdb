Jim Varney's first real film is a joy, but he doesn't have to wait for Ernest P. Worrel to be up soon. I felt that a large number of characters depicted in Varney were great, but without saying the rest of the movie should be placed in a mulcher or something. A pretty strange start to the movie icon.
