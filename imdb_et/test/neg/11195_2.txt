This show started well, but then it became a nightmare. The worst part was the contestants. Most of them were strange. They made stupid things to live in and did a strange hobby. In the second season, one man said he was talking about his pants. It's sick and reluctant. Nobody cared about winning money. Everything they ever wanted to do was alliances like "Survivor" or something. Men always feared that women would compete together. The women were the same. I just couldn't take it anymore. I had to stop watching it. It was really one of the worst shows.
