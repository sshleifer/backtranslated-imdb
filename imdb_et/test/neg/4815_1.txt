The odd stupidity created by the comic "Bullwinkle" a quarter century ago proves NO DEAD HEROES that you can cut off a good film (MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE) without copying one of the high quality images from your robbery object. Hardly registering on a cable TV scale, the plot is less nuanced than the old "Sgt. Rock" comic and only Boris J. Badanov's "bad boy" or the like. This movie gets an unusual face that is too bad, too stupid to be enjoyed by anyone with opposing thumbs.
