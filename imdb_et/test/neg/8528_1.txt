It was one of the slowest movies I've ever had. After being introduced to the "something" that kills a few people on the farm, we will introduce the white loose family that is moving on the farm - and NO HAPPENS if it is long-lasting. Then they meet the drifter who helps on the farm and nothing else for a long time. Then some charts of the family girl will be finished. Then something else happens, the drift goes to the nuts and the film ends. Just about how this family had to move when the girl returned home and had no money and so much so that I could care less for those pathetic people. I can't believe I actually saw theaters to see it! Not only did this movie work wonders, but some $ holes responded to his cell phone, the dark moorings made the noise and film sucked. THATS WHY THEATERS SUCK - bad movies, priceless crappy foods and idiots in the theater, I'm going home and watching DVDs, at least I could smoke when I was at home when I was watching this stupid movie at home. Stay home and bake some pies instead of seeing the theater to see this typical mess. Stupid stupid.
