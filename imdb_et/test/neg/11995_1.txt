The complete and perfect travesty of the movie. '' Strength '' is such a film that is even for the release of the troma. ' The script, direction, action and action sequences are so terrible to be almost painful to look at and one can barely help thinking that only 75 minutes of working time could have been better spent. The above reviewer must be related to the director because this is the only reason why I can see this garbage rating, some may call it b-fun or "so bad it is good" just to apologize for it, but if the leader the actor (and the most experienced cast member) can't give his lines convincingly, then you know that you have a very bad movie.
