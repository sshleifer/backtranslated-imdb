Seriously, Sci-Fi must stop making movies. They are all terrible. And it was John Rhys-Davies and he couldn't help the movie. Dr Pena (Giancarlo Esposito) captures the chupacabra of the legendary goat eater in Mexico and brings it to Captain Rudolf (John Rhys-Davies) captain. The creature then flees and starts killing the crew and the passengers. Captain Rudolf and the team go after the creature, the weapons ablazin '. But they can't stop it. So they call the Navy. Nor can they stop it. Then all 5 will kill (although many of them exist). Then take the captain and his daughter together with another son to figure out how to kill him. Stay away from this movie. Chupacabra sees incredibly cheesy, naval men come with the slightest movement, throwing grenades on the ship and acting terribly. 3/10.
