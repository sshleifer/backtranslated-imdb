I usually really enjoy Steven Seagal movies. Usually they are very fun and somewhat aikido adept, as usual, as Steven contains these martial arts techniques in the sequences. <br /> <br /> But this movie is really a bad movie making, and it seems to me obvious that the guilt lies with the director and the producers who obviously do not know how to make a movie, let alone Steven Seagal and the use of his knowledge and expertise. <br /> <br /> I didn't see the end of this movie. I just went out before the end just because I couldn't watch this bad movie anymore. I am sure many people share my feelings.
