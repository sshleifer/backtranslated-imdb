I went to this movie openly. I was too lazy to go to the video store to pick a movie and my friend returned with it. I promised him I wouldn't laugh at my choice, but in the first five minutes I told him I had to take my promise. We watched, but we hope it will improve but not; it was followed by constant despair. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was probably one of the worst ever devoted to the film and definitely deserves a place in the bottom 100 of IMDb. I really don't know how it was distributed. The lighting was bad. I've seen better action playing primary school. There is nothing positive about this.
