This film was very disappointing because several elements of the book were wrong. The main story is the same, but there are many film injuries. This means that he can't do anything about the season and Chris Comer comes with a team earlier. The Marshall's team was actually Midland High, which was Permia's main competitor, and here's the proof - Marshall High is a Mavericks colored Scarlet and Silver, Midland High is purple and golden. Look at the Jersey and see who it is. Also, the real Marshall High Football Registry is predominantly black, the team shown was racially mixed as Midland High. <br /> <br /> 3) Only one point in Midland Lee will lose to Permia. Midland Lee loses Midland High and Midland High loses Permia. These are the teams that put the coin into that. <br /> <br /> 4) Boobie comes back to the team for Chris Comer, and after he hasn't played Midland Lee, he quits the team halfway and never stops or goes back to any games. 5) Brian Chavez was a Tight End and Defensive End who suffered # 85 not Tight End and Strong Safety. In addition, Boobie # 35 and Cote d'Ivoire wore Christian # 62. 6) Coaches love Chris Comer more than Boobie player because he has better lifting ethics and runs more straight, so employees prefer him, this is partly why Boobie leaves the team. 7) Dallas Carter is played in Austin's Darrell K. Royal Memorial stadium, where the UT plays in the national semi-finals rather than in the national finals. Carter wins the national title but is forced to return due to an inappropriate player. <br /> <br /> Action is pretty good, but when you read the book, you see that these errors are quite true. I'm also tired of hearing that all the computer hypocrites complain about depicting Dallas Carter's football team. The team according to the book is as big, monstrous, talented and black as the film shows. People say it's a racist idea, but when you read the book, you see the real image of the team. The story has changed a lot, giving 3.5 / 10 to this movie.
