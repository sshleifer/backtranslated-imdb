Oh, Yawn. Not yet another chick flick, where men are all pigs and women even get their abuse. The only difference is that everyone in this movie has a pig or is eating brains. I hated the moral question of the film, why it is right to send a man to prison for life because of a murder he did not. Is it more immoral than its abuse and resentment. This movie shows all the ethics of bad writing. I saw it in the CBC's "Best of Britain" series. If it's the best in Britain, it's no wonder the British film industry is in trouble. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in this movie was David Tennant, playing his character so despicable that I probably spit on the next person who speaks Scottish accent. Kate Ashfield is trying to play the victim, but she will end up being as immoral as David Tennant finally ends up. They deserve each other. <br /> <br /> There are parents in the brain category who seem to see something wrong with Brendan's psychotic. English policemen have been designed to be so incompetent that they are unable to issue traffic tickets. The British police union should defame the authors of this film. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth the power the DVD needs to watch it.
