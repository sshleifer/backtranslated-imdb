Daily Mail's Christopher Tookey had no choice but to say about this movie, "look at it all your 82 unhappy minutes and I guarantee you shake your head and ask," Are we really going to this? 'Yes, we have, because once the film has been given and the British filmmakers have witnessed the film's total cynicism, taste and moral corruption, it's just abomination. Tookey continues to "aim at precisely unwashed underwear, dirty senses and vipers that walk the sidewalk while walking on the sidewalk, this sexy comedy is so uncomfortable, uncomfortable and uncomfortable that it is enough to make you sex and indeed movies for life" before "Men's sex is not merely a real hostile film, it is symptomatic of the new national culture of immediate self-harm, yobbishness and sadism that is currently being celebrated on the screen ". I usually don't listen to critics too close, but in that case Tookey was against money. This film goes beyond the bad, indeed, it goes beyond just uncomfortable and enters some strange parallel universe where every pain lasts for an hour and where the "fun" definition seems to be "saying tw * t Brummie accent". . It's frustrating for anyone who has half the brain that has grown up with Goodies, Monty Python, Spitting Image, not nine clock news and Fawlty Towers. quietly disappeared after the release of the cinema and equally joined the terrible Vix spin-off The Fat Slag (2004) and badly marked the All Saints vehicle in the honest (2000) celluloid cemetery, but since it seems to be designed for an endless late night schedule for sessions and wrong "best movie EVER! " robbes people who should know better, so I have to apologize in advance for trying to mislead what the British film industry has caused in its wisdom to an unpleasant world. Yes, I'm really sorry to bring it back from celluloid dead, but I actually remember, "It can't be as bad as the critics said ..." but as God is my witness, it was WORK. <br /> <br /> Mackenzie's Albert Steptoe feet are a special mention of the young man's body "Crook" from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack - Cutting and pasting "ladrock", mostly a ska-based lager-lout-friendly pub jukebox piffle that brought back awful memories to see how these lush cocktails make Lambeth a walk that is a special button-shiners Madness for every comedy / variety program of the eighties. ... and Motorhead's "Ace of Spades" as headline music? What the hell is ... trying to awaken the memories of one of the most exciting scenes youngsters ever offered, what ever comedy show ever offers? Cheap shooting method, below belt. <br /> <br /> Script - written at the age of 12 who just read on the back of each Smut and Zit during one long Red Bull session ... SURELY? No, no real, true, reputable, adult person could put this type of slowed hogwash on paper? And Mark Gatiss was in this ... Mark Gatiss ... The least annoying member of gentlemen and Goodies fans who takes part in such a harsh bunch of flying cinematic stools? "One of the brightest British comedy stars"? Not anymore, he's not! For the gentlemen's theme, someone gives me a couple of lead-lined diver boots and Steve's face like a collapsed rectum Pemberton and a long weekend in a soundproofed room before I die ... PLEASE ... <br /> <br /> Cinema, British or otherwise, just don't get much worse. Kent Bateman 'Headless Eyes' (1971) is a new wave masterpiece compared to its contrasting stroke.
