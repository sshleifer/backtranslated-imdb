Undoubtedly, this is every comic movie made by WORSE. PERIOD !! Yes, it is worse than Dolph Lundgren (1989) Punisher. Yes .. worse than the 1979 and 1991 Captain America films. Oh yes, it's even WORSE, then Christopher Reed wrote Superman IV: Quest for Peace. Sheeshh .. this movie was so bad that the man who was playing nuclear was playing in only one other movie and that was just T.V. = oP <br /> <br /> This movie is "D" quality. I was able to watch it on the SciF channel in 1997. I had heard that it was pretty bad, but he had nothing to do at night, so I thought I'd control it. Which one and a half waste. I would have been better off looking at different strokes. In addition to I've ever seen the most flat special effects and worse actions, the entire script was just terrible and not well targeted. Fortunately, a new fantastic four films are made and hopefully this version will make the heroes justice. I was hoping for a new SPAWN movie in the future, but it's not yet realized. <br /> <br /> Don't try this movie. If you happen to see it via cable on a television, check it out. Be warned, however, that you like most channels after the first 15 minutes.
