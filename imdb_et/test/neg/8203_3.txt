A group of seven people fears that they are the only survivors of the world-wide H-bomb explosion. They are not only afraid of radiation, but also of the slopes of the surrounding hill. One group is already contaminated, but strange does not threaten others. The survival of the friction of simply lay experts is a subset. Richard Denning plays the hero. Mike Connors is near the edge of a tough guy. Lori Nelson is a girl who is going to start a brave new world population. Not one of Roger Corman's best. This is a predictable black and white sci-fi.
