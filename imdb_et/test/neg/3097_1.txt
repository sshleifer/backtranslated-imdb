Take advantage of and stay away from this movie. Minus 50 billion out of ten. If you want hard boiled activity, don't rent it! If you want a good independent movie from elsewhere, I didn't think I could see Burt Reynolds in such a dirty movie. It has the slimmest line ever. Van Dam's chips should compete against this academy. <br /> <br /> Rob Lowe proves why he is not the world's hottest actor. Even Hasselhoff would have made him a better addict. I don't want to add any more facts about this factual movie, except to say that you are hiring something better by Hulk Hogan or Dolph Lundgreen. It should prove your point when you get your drift. <br /> <br />
