"Fool for Love" is one of many now forgotten films by Robert Altman, directed in the 1980s. This is just the adaptation of the Sam Shepard game, which is in Shepard's lead, just not very good. Altman made many non-very good films during his exciting career, and many times it was a mistake. But here I think the fault lies in writing a weak game in Shepard. Altman's direction is certain, the performances are o.k. considering what actors have to do, but this irrelevant scenario goes somewhere and takes time to get there. <br /> <br /> Shepard is Eddie, a stuntman with a love / hate relationship in May (Kim Basinger). Two struggle endlessly in the evening, spent in a dusty motel somewhere in the middle, while a mysterious person (Harry Dean Stanton), who can be both a figurative and a written father for both Eddie and Mayi, keeps quiet. Randy Quaid rounds up four people as a cast gentleman as a caller. <br /> <br /> The only dramatic hook on the entire plot is the recommendation that Eddie and May relationships are bleeding. But this hook seems to be a trick rather than something. The scenario does not examine their relationship in detail and does not use their relationship to study more universal topics. Shepard and Basigner create eccentric, clever characters who get upset in the first five minutes; Stanton and Quaid have little to do but to offer the reactions. <br /> <br /> The last half-hour of the movie is especially bad when the Eddie and Mayi attacks begin to play a monotonous, sleepy voice. <br /> <br /> Criticize it up with another Altman experiment that has gone back. <br /> <br /> Rating: C-
