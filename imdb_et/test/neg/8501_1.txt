How did this film get to the Berlin Film Festival? I understand that it came to the Panorama section, but still. <br /> <br /> This movie was: <br /> <br /> 1. No plot. 2. Terrible action. 3. Dirty video. 4. Some of the worst graffiti ever captured on video. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest players in the festival's acceptance is the existence of this old standby mode: homosexuality. That's right, the only thing that happens in this movie is that one graffi artist makes the other out and pulls him out. Then he feels it strangely and has a boring old "breaking" conversation that can be expected from his first break in high school (lines like "You kissed me for the first time, dude."). Oh, and by the way, it's not a crying game ... you can see a gay corner in the first ten minutes of the movie. In addition, it is usually only bad labels, bad suits "secret" policeman, some skateboarding and train driving. <br /> <br /> If any topic is interesting, I suggest you check out some of the graffiti videos made by some real graffiti artists on the web. There's a lot ... and they're much more fun than this mess.
