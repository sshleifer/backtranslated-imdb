I was waiting for this movie. I like travel thrillers. I like sex, drugs, youth, action and a great soundtrack. I was particularly interested in a movie trip across Europe to see if I know any of my travel points. <br /> <br /> From the first scene, this movie was invisible. What did Guy drive on the wrong side of the road? What could be a commercial blown-down commercially sloping slope? If they are such bad drivers, why would they take delivery? And it's just the first scene! Not even bad enough to be campy or silly. Just terrible! Terrible! Terrible! Waste of time. Go on something ... something else!
