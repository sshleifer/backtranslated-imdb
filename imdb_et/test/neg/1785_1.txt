Why do you ask if this man claims to have the truth behind the existence of the Almighty? Well his deductive logic, my friends, you see that I know that God exists, because Satan does, how else would my poor eyes set such a terrible movie? Yes, there is no doubt that on the cold Friday of 2006 Satan was on me and forced me to watch this movie. He what? You wonder; hell does little girls spit vomiting and climbs the ceilings, why does she waste her time watching her movie? My only conclusion to this question is that Satan believes that looking at camp fear is the worst form of mortal punishment, rather than pulling eyes or speaking in tongues, instead of sitting unnecessarily through one and a half hours of the most terrible filmmaking. Can this movie be as terrible as it says? Yes, my friend who watches this movie is equivalent to getting a bag of about fifty million times, maybe more. But maybe I'm too harsh, this movie has been around for a while, at first, for example, a corporation house with lots of topless girls; Now, I'm never a corporation I'm sure girls really do, but hey can always pray. Now, after five minutes of breasts and rear cheekbones, we have all of our girls' colleges introduced on campus. The girls themselves (about eight) are in an archaeological class where they discuss virgin sacrifices and ancient hills. A class professor (who is probably the only male of these girls) will carry on with Flash, a handful of his feminine students, a girlfriend, a distant lake in the mountains, their guests to find ancient Indian artifacts; Yes, the right professor, we know what angle your pitch is. Now, the place where the movie goes, the group of five, the four girls, one boy stops at the gas station to get in a certain direction, but look, look, the biker gang pulls and harasses the girls to end up alone and leave them alone and go their way. As they move, they reach a "camp" consisting of four logs and some trees, and then things start going terribly wrong. First, prof. and his girlfriend goes astray that the only time one of the girls takes on to find them is just some unknown power. The rest of the two girls continue to look for a lost girl, as cyclists, plus one drunken man, come to look for them, their plan, rape girls and do terrible things for them. Something goes on to the film about the druid, who needs four virgins to sacrifice to save the world from some water work, before two thousand; But they are grabbing this plan by Mr. Druid, one of the girls is already devirginized in front of us, so this plan goes away. Now that I said there would be spoilers, I'd go ahead and destroy the end of the movie, these four girls will be taken, stunned with green grass and then ready to sacrifice if one of them is killed by the other two cyclists and prof. come to save them; they stand on the right hand side, where not the leading biker says, "I think I can do it there!" just jump and break up. Prof. crashes a boy and comes down only when a rape-now-heroic cyclist leaves the 6'3 "giant druid. First he makes himself a pathetic attempt and pulls a knife, the knife reflects some lazy Golden stomach in the mouth and the flames of light at the end of the fire, after they wear the wounded with the help of an extraordinary custodian and wonder if everything is really gone, but there is still a bubble in the lake that shows it in the monster. This is a film and this is my review that unfortunately goes unread for most eyes. because it is only the fifth commentary on the film that has been conducted for fifteen years, Fortunately, Satan can only get some of us and not everyone. The judge would like to make one heartfelt apology to the poor girl in Circuit City. I borrow this movie: "I'm sorry Sheila, please don't hate for me to see you. "
