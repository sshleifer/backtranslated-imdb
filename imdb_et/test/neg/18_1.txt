Bloody Birthday opens the picture of Meadowvale General Hospital. There are three children born at exactly the same time throughout the shading. The caption tells us that it is now "Meadowvale, California June 1, 1980". Two teenage lovers, Duke Benson (Ben Marley) and Annie Smith (Erica Hope) are going to open the grave. They hear the noise and the Duke examines. Both Duke and Annie are killed. Sheriff Jim Brody (Bert Kramer) is confused and has only a childhood rope handle that Annie kept. Unfortunately, before Sheriff Brody can deal with this case, his youngest daughter Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) and her two friends, Curtis Taylor (Billy Jayne Billy Jacoby) and Steven Seton (Andy Freeman), murder her. Just as they finish the sheriff Brody, another young boy, Timmy Russel, comes up (K.C. Martel), three killers don't know how much he saw. Soon after the incident, Timmy Steven and Curtis play in spam. Curtis locks Timmy's old locker. Timmy can escape and tell his sister Joyce (Lori Lethin), but he doesn't believe him initially. These three children continue their murder. Their victim is their strict teacher Miss Davis (Susan Strasberg), a couple of love (John Avery and Sylvia Wright) in old and Debbie's older sister Beverly (Julie Brown). Joyce starts to question Debbie, Curtis and Steven, which makes him and Timma a evil trio target. Can they convince the authorities that these three innocent 10-year-olds are really useless killers? <br /> <br /> Ed Hunt, jointly written and directed by me, is intense against this film. I think it is terribly terrible and it doesn't have one pleasant aspect of a 83-minute ride. The wolf and Barry Pearson's manuscript do not give us any explanation for children's killer motives that transcend the sunshade that blocks Saturn, and therefore these three children have some incredible astrological reason. the whole Eclipse? If this is true, why are they waiting for their death game before their tenth birthday? I think it just strikes, right? For credit it is quite fast, but I still found it very boring and tedious. The film as a whole is very unthinkable and predictable, the children are discovered as killers within the first 10 minutes and as I mentioned aside next to the motif. Sometimes it is stupid. Check out the scene where Debbie stops at Steven, throwing him in a bowl of water! The death of the sheriff is put down by stepping down a few steps, rightly so, that the injuries caused by such an accident are not the same as your beaten dead bat baseball bat as it was, any competent doctor or pathologist would have noticed within 5 seconds. The whole movie doesn't have one drop of blood and all the flat killings are boring and unimaginable. Debbie loads 25c that the guys would fall through the hole when her sister Beverly slides. Only after a 5-minute sign is the early scene when Joyce walks from the kitchen to the living room and the boom mike is clearly visible at the top of the screen, not even a little bit about the whole fucking thing. Overall incompetence continues throughout the film. The whole production is boring and immediately forgotten. The actors are poor all over the world, these three kids are very annoying and nervous from the start and made even more cleaning of this movie session, especially Curtis's geeky in excess glasses. I just hate this movie so, just. I can't talk about this one good thing. Be sure to avoid one.
