I made a mistake when I looked at "Dark Star" (1974) late for one night. It was one of the most stupid movies I ever watched: <br /> <br /> 1. Bad operation. <br /> <br /> 2. Wrong writing. <br /> <br /> 3. A scientifically stupid plot. (Destruction of a whole planet, because its orbit is unstable or the road is getting worse: instead of one big, easy to avoid object, you have thousands of smaller but equally deadly and harder objects to follow.) <Br /> <br /> 4. Completely unrealistic characters. Painted beach ball like outer space? Writers must have made too many medications. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, most of the "Dark Star" players never did anything else. Of those who did something else, most did not act after Dark Star again. That's why Dark Star's act of restarting was a star of his actor career!
