Of course I saw it at the beginning of another lion's gate, so it was of course only the best parts and so it seemed intriguing. And that is, to the point. A young college student (Sarah) has found puzzles all over the place and becomes obsessed with answering them and inadvertently participating in some games. It is now quite intriguing, but unfortunately it all becomes quite confusing and becomes so complicated that the viewer (like me) is probably disappointed. The characters appear with little introduction and you are not sure who they are or why Sarah knows them or is with them. All this is related to the woman who tried to drown a little boy years ago and that was because it is "all part of the design". In reality, it's all part of a "very sketchy script" and once the movie is over, you will find yourself feeling that you have lost about an hour and a half of the life you want to use to make your time more productive. such as bathroom cleaning. 4 out of 10.
