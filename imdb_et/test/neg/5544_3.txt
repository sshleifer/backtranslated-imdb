Pumpkinhead was in itself a decent 80's fright. The classic is in no way but an enjoyable piece of fluff. So why do we now have the fourth film in this franchise outside of me. As in the previous aftermath, there is nothing here that really combines movies except the monster, the witch and Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen). This time we follow the weakness between Hatfields and McCoys. Part of the film is the romance of Rome and Juliet as a young McCoy boy and his Hatfield lover decide to be together. Soon they will be torn off and the boy's sister will be killed. The boy escapes from the forest and gets a witch to recycle Pumpkinhead for some revenge. Operation is at best satisfactory, in the worst case amateur. A typical demon does not even appear for almost forty minutes and when it compares it to the original design. In general, Blood Feud is unable to impress. It may be worth checking once, but definitely not a collector's supplement.
