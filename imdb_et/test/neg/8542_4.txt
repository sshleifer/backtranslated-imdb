Jess Franco makes films and has done a lot of them. Franco is responsible for some of the most shocking films in the history of cinema and God blesses her for that. Unfortunately, Kilominjaro diamonds are a truly terrible film that does not meet its usual standards. <br /> <br /> Application films must be judged by story, sex and gore. What else? This movie fails in most of these benchmarks. The plot is thin, placing the youngster in the jungle. We don't really know why he and his father were first there. As expected, his father is a "big white chief" and he becomes a goddess sitting on a naked tree. Add the fortune to hunters and precious stones and you will have the main rescue girl on the line of greedy intentions. Characters are stocks that do not give the procedure an incredible religion. <br /> <br /> Gore? None or at least very little. This movie is often referred to as the classic Italian cannibal films. Those who are looking for this type of gore have to travel in another way. By recording one cheap title, this movie has surprisingly little blood and courage. <br /> <br /> As I can best say, there is only Katja Bienert, Aliene Mess and Mari Carmen Neieto. around naked. In fact, "Lita" (Mari Carmen Neieto) makes the entire front heavy lift, while two jungle ladies are exposed. Yes, there are love scenes .... probably the most sterile Franco ever watched. Women are beautiful, but here is nothing that really makes this movie an erotic classic. <br /> <br /> This movie simply speaks of low budget outbreaks. Sets are ridiculous. Operation is terrible and editing is confusing. There is no real story that would hold it together, and not enough budget (or effort) for shock or titillate. I think Franco fans have waited more for the Captain of Exploitation.
