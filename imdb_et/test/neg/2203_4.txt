Compiled and released at a time when the internet was just becoming tremendous, it is a story. Hitchcock would have loved. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Hitchcock was not about to do this, and we will occasionally be a suspense, but mostly silly thriller that Bullock's intelligence keeps on (barely). <br /> <br /> It was released in 1995, but has already been dated and computer errors and inaccuracies must be seen as credible, and you don't even have to be a dot.com person to see them!
