The jealous husband keeps the car shop hostage while Williams loads the viewer with his worn Mork shtick at every step. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Payment channel grist. From time to time, a bad script with less than convincing Robin Williams, who speaks sluggishly, is a philandering Queens car dealer who has been hit by a hostage job crisis. The laughs do not exist, the message (s) or morals are all wrong and the filmmaker can never decide whether it is comedy or drama. It is pretty good for everyone who is pretty bad. If the movie gets so fast so old, you're smelly. Nothing else to say, maybe, to avoid at all costs. The mediocre movies in the textbook are such annoying and less pleasing as the upper bombs.
