This movie smells more than limburger cheese! If you find it on the garage sale, then SEE IT! I love Sandra Bullock and still hate this movie ... Though I am ashamed, I own a copy and the studio has changed the cover so that Sandra Bullock would be there at all. They play it "Sandra Bullock". She has only a small part of the whole movie and she does it best, but she is young and has not yet learned her talent. Well, everyone has to start somewhere ...
