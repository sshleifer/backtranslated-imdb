First, I'm a big Bronson fan, I've been since the late 70s. I watched every movie he'd made on the big screen after "Love and Bullet", ironically the beginning of his end, as a big name, a Hollywood blocking star. <br /> <br /> I hoped things would change for him, that he would make a really good movie in the 80s, but it never happened. And I don't know what he meant when he signed up for most of his latest films at the cheap studio Cannon and hacker register J. Lee Thompson. <br /> <br /> "Assasination" gave me some hopes when I saw Thompson led Peter Hunt, but those hopes quickly broke down. First of all, the film looks amazingly cheap, as it was done about 3 million, minus the Bronson inflated salary (I heard he demanded 5 million pictures, which is probably more than the budget of all the other Cannon films). The White House scenes were shot in West LA. I took the bus when they shot. A nice job of rebuilding a white house, but no one thought about putting palm trees on? Don't think. <br /> <br /> Secondly, supporting cast is really bad. Ireland died of cancer, and yet he is not bad, but the terrible Asian woman who played Bronson's sidekick was typical of Cannon's talent - not nonexistent. I would be really curious to learn how he played such a role. I can't imagine a worse actor for this part, plus he's 40 years younger than Bronson! The story is not so bad and it is something the bigger and better-budgeted studios did later (Eastwood's "Fire Line" and Costner's "bodyguard" movie), but the way it is staged here is really sad. I don't know if they can afford more than one or two shots per frame. None of them is the least credible. If the men of the secret service behave in such a film as the policemen who are the cornerstone, we should change the presidents (and out of life) every few months ...
