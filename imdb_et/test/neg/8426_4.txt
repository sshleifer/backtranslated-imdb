That's all I can really say about this movie. It is DBZ ... like the Might Tree and the World Stronger, it really ... does not fit the timeline of the show, although it is supposedly placed just before the TV series began. Activities are generally pretty nice. The plot has a nice enough base, with good background, which shows why these guys hate each other and all. Very good in general ... The problem is that there are many very strange things. I mean, really weird stuff. Like the strongest in the world, this is a really strange song that could only have been caused by drug-induced fog ... the fact that Gohan is a lot of drugs during the song is a nuisance. Creepy. Roisto is strange and quite comical ... the usual DBZ type - it seems like a Dragon Ball movie as a Dragon Ball Z movie. In general, it's fun, but ... just ... weird.
