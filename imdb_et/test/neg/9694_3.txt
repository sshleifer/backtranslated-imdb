Sorry about that. But if you have seen this "epic", you will certainly know the complete ignorance of the actual Bible text. Now, I'm not exactly the next line for holiness, but I know the basics. And the basics were that. God wanted to wipe everything out of the earth because he believed they had been spoiled for not coming back. He chose Noah, the harsh diamonds and his family, to be intact. Noah builds a ship, as God has given, to accommodate him, his family, and two of each being as he floods the rest of the planet. These are the basics. In this film, people like other people, such as footballers and pirates, migrate to the sea. But I thought EVERYONE was destroyed. I think NBC leaders have never been in church. Other inaccuracies have been spoken, but who is Joe's average, I have no idea what they are. Sorry. Back to the movie, it was wrong, as I said earlier, a working strain, but some effects were good, I give it. But as a whole, I've seen a better and more tasteful story made by Simpson's small scene. God is helping NBC leaders on the day of court. 3/10
