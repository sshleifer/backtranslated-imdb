Although it was designed to show some kickbox and sword games, Vampires: Turning (VTT) would have gone further. Since it doesn't even want to be a good vampire movie, VTT can't deliver any punch that it should have tried. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​an 800-year-old Danish vampire was interesting, but the story of the offspring who erroneously brought it (and now has to wipe it out) really reminds me of Gizmo and his gravity "Gremlins" and that's not good thing when it slides on the vampire. > <br /> Stephanie Chao is attractive and works as a very good vampire, but her lack of accents is a grid when you realize she is an 800-year-old vampire. In addition to talking to Connor, he is a "young soul", he doesn't bring much weight to the line you expect from the "old" soul. Attractive, but not plausible. <br /> <br /> Meredith Monroe was more credible in his role, but for "Dawson's Creek" he would think he would have more screen time. The question of whether Amanda gives up and "turns" is the most urgent reason to watch a movie and you will never get it. You get this temptation, but you will never get any development of the characters on this parcel of equipment. It's an inexpensive way for an audience to play. If you want something that is a good vampire movie, look for Lugos "Dracula" and if you want a sexy vampire movie, you will have dozens of Hammer gains much more power than this. Finally, if you want good or sexy, this is not the place. It's just forgotten.
