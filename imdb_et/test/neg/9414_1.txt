I had no great hopes for it. Before seeing it, I was shouting "stereotype". <br /> <br /> I mean ... come on! It is so stupid that the plot line is innocent android, which understands that the people who have created it are immoral, then everything is decided. <br /> <br /> I had to see it three times. The first two I slept because I was so incredible. It is very rare that the movies suffered me so much that I slept during them. The third time I forced myself to look at it just to warn people about it. <br /> <br /> I got a clear impression that the people responsible for this confusion have tried to take all the cool / clean things. from other scifi / action movies and put them together to make a movie video! They took an android / robot, a lot of activities, a thin story, stereotypical signs and a great fight at the end and threw it together. Unfortunately the film sucks. It is so wood that you could build out of this house, the story / plot is completely ridiculous, camera work and editing are terrible, the direction is non-existent and top down all, everything is so nice and ridiculous that it just irritates you from hell. <br /> <br /> I had the feeling that I could have spent some time looking at it doing something more creative, such as nailing or looking at grass.
