If you like a really shocking movie, that's for you. Action is the worst I've ever seen, and the story doesn't go anywhere. If you come into contact with this movie in your video store, you don't even have to borrow it. The front cover chick is not even in the movie. I just gave this movie 1/10 just because I couldn't vote for 0. Avoid it at all costs.
