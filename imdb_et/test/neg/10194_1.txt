This film was poorly prepared, poorly written and malfunctioning. All characters were two-dimensional. It was a real amateur test. The film was Christian propaganda. Christian characters are superior to you, and they are not skeptical or indecisive. The film was a real "skeptical" and I as a viewer that put us in a very uncomfortable situation. I complained to the theater management and got another movie freely. I remember another movie like "Rapture", starring Mimi Rogers, which was much better and more professional. I think I'm looking at "Rapture" again. If you visit "Unidentified" and don't like it, don't tell me I haven't warned you.
