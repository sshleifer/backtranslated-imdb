I rented this movie from my local library and thought it might be good if I liked this type of movie and guess who it was, but I was wrong. Acting beat, fighting scenes were just as bad and they got a couple of well-known people who weren't in the field, but didn't let anyone take the lead? I noticed that some people gave him 10. Why should you ever consider giving this horse a bunch of **** a 10. You can say it's worth 10 when its comedy is, but when you vote on a movie that shouldn't be be a comedy that can't be given to comedy 10. You have to evaluate it according to what it was supposed to be and not something the director did not intend to do. Maybe some of you voted for 10 because you thought it was funny if the movie was very high so people would go out and rent or buy because you think it's a good idea to mislead people. You play with the peoples time and money that you have no right to do. When the film is sucked, it gives a good rating if it was good, give it a good rating, but don't lie. I gave this movie 4 and I'm glad that I was free to check this book for free because this movie was sucked and really not worth a penny.
