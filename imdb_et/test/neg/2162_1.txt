This movie was given by my uncle who had received this DVD free of charge. It's easy to understand why he's so eager to get rid of it. Now I understand that this is a B-film and that it does not have the same budget as the larger films, but they would certainly have been able to make better use of their money than making that garbage. There are some relatively good performances, namely Jack, Beth and Hawks, but others are ridiculously bad (for example, the Assassin Droid). This film also contains the worst fight I've ever seen. The film had a number of nudity that seemed to be a porn film rather than a Sci-Fi movie at times. <br /> <br /> To sum up - a terrible movie
