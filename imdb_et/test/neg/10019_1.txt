It's really, without exaggeration, one of the worst ever made in Slasher's movies. I know it appeared in the 80s after the trend that started on "Friday 13.". "Prey" copies many of the above-mentioned films. Forest setting, killer, stupid teenagers, gore, etc. <br /> <br /> But Prey is as bad as you think. I didn't even remember it if it wasn't accidental. Well, killer is actually a human, so don't wait for supernatural killer Jason. The situation is rather boring and the lack of tension, gore, violence, etc.. It just doesn't work for slipping. <br /> <br /> Operation is just terrible. The result is terrible! Combine drilling tools that have the mood of the 80s?! I don't even mention the technical aspects of the film because I believe it seems to cost only $ 20. <br /> <br /> Please do not like anyone like a plague. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's something to say. God's gratitude seems to have disappeared on earth.
