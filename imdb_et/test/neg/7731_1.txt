I saw it in the movie theater when it first came out, I'm sorry to say, and that was one of the few movies I've ever wanted to walk around. I had no problems with the drug content and I saw how this warning story might have been powerful. The problem was that the filmmaker, working with James Woods and Sean Young, drew the two least-loved characters I've ever seen on film. I hated this pair and couldn't care less if they dropped inevitably to the bottom. There was no surprise in their film. The course of each event was so painfully obvious that I felt I could write the script myself; although I think I would have done a better job. Later I heard noisy stories of incidents between Sean Young and James Woods along some stalking events. It made me wonder whether terrible action was due to some bad feeling and dysfunction. Anyway, I refer to Boost as the worst film I've ever seen for money.
