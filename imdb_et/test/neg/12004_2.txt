Like a children's film, it's great. For the family, it just sucks. I was really hoping for something like Goonies, which is a great movie for all ages. This film was simply directed too much at children with silly script and characters that call each other little names like the boogie's soul. ??? However, Alan Cummings was a joy. And why do people compare Willy Wonka to this movie ... just because there's a theme similar to Willy Wonka's songs, Willy Wonka doesn't make this movie.
