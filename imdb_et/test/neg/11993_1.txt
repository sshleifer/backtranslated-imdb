I was one "selected" to see this movie in a sneak preview. <br /> <br /> First of all, you should know that this movie is based on a "far away" video game that is really a good game for this time (2004). secondly, you should know that this flick is a big uwe boll. this is a guy who takes video games (cave siege, bloodrayne, post, etc.) and makes them movies (VERY terrible.). <br /> <br /> I still remember when I saw a boll in the "King Swords: Dungeon Siege". there were so terrible mistakes in this movie (like 3 scenes that were playing at the same time, 2 days, and one at night .....) <br /> <br /> so I can come a long way. , really forget about it, a really cheap trick and a plastic helicopter are far from real action. If you expect a cool story, forget about it. br /> <br /> I had the chance to see this movie for free so don't make the mistake and pay for this trash.
