A friend warned me that it was the worst film he'd ever seen. I was curious because it had developed a little cult status. I like many wonderful indie cult movies so I gave her a picture. I have to agree with my friend. It's a steamy heap. I'm sorry for people who love this movie, but I can recommend much better things if you want to watch a twisted indie cult film. Try Peter Jackson's Dead Alive (aka Braindead), a cemetery man (aka Dellamorte Dellamore) or modern vampires.
