While I'm usually John Turturro as an actor and director working for a big fan, ILLUMINATA is a big disappointment. Although the film has nice moments, it is generally flat. Worst of all, the film is confusing. Where's the movie? In Italy or the Italian troupe in New York? Why barely make a historical film if he can't pass the device? If you want to see a well-made, inspiring historical film from the theater, look, see Tim Robbins' CRADLE WILL ROCK. This film has many pluses, including John Turturro's fine show.
