Shakalaka Boom Boom is a movie by Amadeus. I personally appreciate Amadeus as one of my favorites not only because it is music that is my favorite subject, but also because it tells us a real story about a musical genius who doesn't only remember the beautiful music he produced. during his lifetime, but because of his self-destructive character and his 35-year-old tragic death, he has practically failed during his lifetime, because some people, especially Italian composer Saliere, played politics. jealous of her. <br /> <br /> Personally, I was shocked to see Shakalaka ... because the director has always cut most of the scenes from Amadeus. I see the worst plagiarism in this movie and I'm a skeptic about which Bollywood keeps day after day. Film is a disaster, two movie musicians do not give you any sense of reality, film is a tasteless, pointless and comprehensive failure in every story. The only person who affects is Bobby Deol, who at least knows how to act. Otherwise, the entire cast will see amateurs. <br /> <br /> The irony is that while watching a movie, the first screen of the movie says that all the characters in this movie are fictitious and any similarity to someone is purely random, which is blatant wrong, because all the similarities are very clear and they are very clear. is very intended. I wish I could take Darshan and Co. not only for copyright infringement, but also for distorting beautiful works of art.
