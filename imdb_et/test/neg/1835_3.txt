The beginning of this movie was so good. Excitement, slashers, a secret society, and you really couldn't figure out who the bad guys were in the last quarter of the movie. <br /> <br /> But it contained so many old clichés from the oldest to the worst American movies / horror movies. Now, I love slasher / horror movies, but there are all old clichés that have long been lost in American cinema. For example, to study the cliché of the old "I hear the basement sound and I'm alone at home and the basement light doesn't work so I'm going down". <br /> <br /> Three examples of these clichés just pulled me infinite: <br /> <br /> 1) If Potente discovers that a secret society can be heard in a medical school that screams with living bodies, he continues to ask questions and says EVERYONE - very publicly. In essence, he says, "I found you out. Come kill me because I tell everyone your secret." And then he wonders why he finds all the blood in the bed is dirty and he's putting his roommate separated as a towel. <br /> <br /> 2) Even after one man with whom he met two weeks ago reaches the dissection table and discovers the secret society that lives people, he goes to a laboratory where all corpses are kept 2-3 times more than night to explore. <br /> <br /> 3) His roommate is killed. He kills the killer he knows, does not let him know to the university or the police, then leaves home to visit his parents. Then he returns to school, probably thinking that the man who was trying to kill him would miss himself and would not try to kill him, even though he knows his secret. He was, of course, wrong. <br /> <br /> Someone who was supposed to be so intelligent (he studied in Germany as the best school doctor) acted in horror like cliché bimbo films. <br /> <br /> These things just made a potentially good movie very depressing and wished me to end the game even earlier. Halfway through the movie, I ended up on his route and wanted him to reach the dissection table.
