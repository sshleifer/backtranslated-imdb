Moscow zero stole my money and I want it back! It's a horror movie, not a thriller, not a temporary, horror movie. Yes, this movie is horror. Scary bad. After losing many years of IMDb, I've actually moved to create an account, so I (like at least another reviewer here) can warn people. It pulls your grave or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you aren't smart enough to hit a fast back and forth button. Really, I would like to hear the director's voice on an "enhanced" DVD (there's another terrible idea) to see what the hell they're thinking. The producers had to assume that there was enough suckers for the name of Val Kilmer that the film would have even been broken at least in international distribution. on demand, which did not give subtitles to the Russian dialogue. Not that it is very important. Translate the Russian language audibly, translate it into your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it just adds insult to the injured. give it a lower rating and because it achieved one significant thing. It made almost totally underground film NOT familiar with claustrophobic. Now this is a dubious achievement. <br /> <br /> HERE IS YOUR SPOILER: And the end, holy mother (not intended) it's like they run out of money and just decided to stop filming. The "climax" of the film literally happens in seconds before the end, and it is solved by the easiest escape I've ever seen on film. Also, use your simple escape mechanism even when you look at it - the power button.
