They prove that police officers, if they do not find REAL criminals, always blame the parents and blame them for the sexual abuse of their children. These films always depict journalism as a bunch of animals and let parents get out of court to feed the hunger of the press to bring down sadness. Has anyone ever heard of the back door of these movies? Here you have a psychologist who tells them exactly what happened and where the body can be found, but the police are not told and no one takes his conclusions into account. <br /> <br /> Police are depicted as blocks that do not know what they are doing and are always out of the way, as Ed Asner, who arrives late in the case, believes in parents and solves the mystery. <br /> <br /> Even after the parents have been wiped out, do not spoil the cops of those fools who put them in prison, took their child and accused them of killing their child. <br /> <br /> It seemed like I saw this movie SIDE TIME.
