To describe the serious misconception of this movie, it must include some * spoilers *, so if you see it and expect to be surprised, don't read it! <br /> <br /> I liked everything about this movie except the plot; and in such a thriller as this plausible plot is important. It has worked well when a little slow motion, camera work, and Portland scenes are a subtle budget and a modest picture. The dialogue is very good. <br /> <br /> Mason is seriously relinquishing young people working in the telemarketing business selling insurance. Her high school friend Berkeley is her employer and takes care of her as a brother, despite the fact that Mason is probably mentally ill. Mason has nightmares that send him beating and beating his inhaler. His visions and nightmares suggest that he has had serious problems with his female female female in the past, and the film seems to suggest she may be a female serum respondent. She meets a perky, pretty girl, Amber, and she sketches her from her laptop. She loves her and depicts her so she can paint her portrait. He sees him more and starts to awaken from his retreat, becoming almost half human. Then something goes wrong. Amber finds sketchbooks with drawings by other girls and she starts to wonder. He's scared and pulls away. We don't know if his sudden friction pushes him over the edge. His behavior becomes more uncertain. <br /> <br /> This is a revelation. To explain how this movie is terribly wrong, I have to explain what happens. * Another spoiler warning! * To make this plot work, we have believed that Amber, a truly outgoing, pretty young girl, is going to a seriously emotionally disturbed young man who has at least the beginning of his friendship and can only speak one thing or not at all. He is farther away from the joke, he appears on the edge of the whole catatonic. Yes, I know girls can be attracted by all kinds of strange, but usually Charles Manson type or punk rockers, boys with some kind of bad mania energy. Mason is practically a zombie, he's hardly there at all. Every perky young man would cross the street to avoid him. It's not just plausible that this girl will be tempted by her. Moreover, Berkeley is not an unbelievable reason why this crazy Mason cannot afford. But wait, there's a revelation. Amber does not show up for Berkeley's Christmas dinner, where Mason is waiting for her and Berkeley, her old friend, has to tell her that Amber and all her former girlfriends, those she's pulled into her many sketchbooks, don't all exist! He and all others are just figures of their twisted imagination: he dreamed them. This explains why normal amber goes to Mason, he is just his imagination. It could have been the final appearance of the movie with proper preparation and setup, but unfortunately this is not the case. Then Mason runs back to his apartment and finds Amber there ... he's mad, he's killing him. But now we understand that Amber was actually real, not Mason's imaginary girlfriend. Finally, after being provided with evidence that Amber actually exists and that Mason killed him, Berkeley must admit that he was wrong to misunderstand Mason. This would work if Mason had been in the middle from the beginning, but since we always suspected the audience that he was completely corrupted and maybe a killer of women, it is no surprise to us. We suspected what he was together and did not understand why Berkeley didn't see it. But then we have to wonder again: if he was real, why would Amber be attracted to catatonic Mason? <br /> <br /> To stop worse, we can never figure out if all of Mason's girlfriends in sketchbooks were real or Amber was first real? And if others were real, would he kill? What did he do to the bodies? <br /> <br /> The problem is that the filmmakers just didn't know what to do with the material. Perhaps it could have been to stretch it out and talk about a plausible temporary story, but this film is not so.
