Anyone who pays to see Troma movies knows and appreciates what they get. Having said that, I didn't think it would be possible to make the film bad and still convincing. I found myself to see how much worse it could get before the end. First of all, this is an Indonesian action film with an American protagonist who looks and acts like a "taxi" son of Christopher Lloyd and Rambo. He puts posters on Sly's "Cobra" all over the place, and even Jakarta has a custom built burn range (with his biggest enemy-based cut-off), even though he has just arrived at the CIA. There are many activities that involve playing weapons (the arrows do not flash on these M-16, only sound effects), motorcycles (which break through the walls), karate (where no one makes physical contact) and even some sex (where everyone is the actor) ugly). The main project of such an epic should be at least reasonably credible, but not here. This includes the world's most dangerous drug cartel to find a "drug detection device". Why do they need it? It never appeared, why not kill drugs for sniffing dogs? It makes no sense, but it is taken seriously. The actors are commendable because they really thought this film would make them all famous and tried to "act". Best Line? "Now dance on your grave so you dirty whore!" Best Scene? Rambo jumps on a flying helicopter, pulls the machine out of the baddie, lets go, falls, lets the helicopter fall, the helicopter blows up, cuts the man thrown with water. F ** King's Genius! If you can't evaluate the trash, don't look at it. If you can, it's fantastic. One last thing I mentioned was led by three Punjab brothers?
