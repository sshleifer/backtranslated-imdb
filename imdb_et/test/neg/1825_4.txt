I only looked at it basically because it was supposed to have the references of the third Reich. It turned out that it was a pretty meaningless and predictable film that seemed to feminists or something else. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something about waiting for the whole movie to see attractive female wife breasts. The last thing you want is "tastefully" made sex music that has annoying camera angles that don't show anything. Also his busty friend didn't get him out, but we saw a lot of men and nut hair and boys whose shirts were. Finally, the heroine is magically very scalpel pusher and witchcraft (who turns out to be clever enough) and she just fights with her (uh huh), while her men's love interest is tied and waiting to save. The more fun part was when he chose the chair and "rocked" this guy and he breaks over him. Now it would be about as much as he could lift the board, not to mention that it would smash against anyone who has enough power to break it! It seems ridiculous, it basically brushes it against it and breaks down. If you intend to make such "rake shift" garbage (which is already dead) then you must make it at least half-believable. <br /> <br /> However, there was one good bit. A bad boy got his girlfriend better by teaching him a lesson about such trampoline and sleeping. This is not exactly what feminists would like. <br /> <br /> Really stupid really. Not that American slasher-valves are generally much better, but you have to think about why they were bothered. It didn't bring anything new to the genre. <br /> <br /> 5/10
