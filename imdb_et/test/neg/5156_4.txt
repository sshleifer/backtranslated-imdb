This film contains roaches as super meat eaters killers. It may be the first movie where roaches were the main killers, though not the first movie where roaches are killers. "Damnation Alley" was the scene of the killer cockroaches and "Creepshow" was the story that had them. There they are a star. Not as good as it might have been, they don't have to kill all of them. However, I may be mistaken for this because I haven't seen it for quite some time. Roaches has killed the killer and this very strange research triangle is in the city to explore them. Yeah, he's pretty strange, because at one point he has a hand in a killer box of roaches and he's like "They bite my hand" and he says it almost in an ecstasy state. Close to this end is also one super big shine, as in many insect films. Not a big movie, but it's worth watching at night if you never forget your mind forever.
