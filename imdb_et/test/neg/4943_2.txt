I am very disappointed. First, the German sync is bad. Perhaps the original version (with subtitles) would have been better, but the whole movie looks like the director saw Luna Papa and Black Cat White Cat and tried to produce something in this style. But it failed in every aspect. This is a strange incredible story and a very childish gag. No atmosphere, no life. Especially primitive sex humor. I voted for 2 because one is the worst and the second is for Sybilla, she's really cute. Sorry - I like "Eastern" movies, but it's really superfluous.
