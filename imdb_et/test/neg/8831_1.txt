I would like to say very clearly that I am not at all religious. I'm an atheist, but I saw that Richard Dorkins was in conflict again and again. I would also like to know that I am not a person who always claims anything against philosophy, but I feel that in comparing science and religion we have to be philosophical and be prepared to suspect the belief in mainstream science. I don't know if Richard Dorkins will ever spend time to reflect on philosophical belief, anyone who thinks that science and religion is long enough and difficult to understand that science is indeed religion itself. Yes, there is a significant difference between keeping scientific beliefs compared to other religions, but its roots are in certain human instincts of faith. <br /> <br /> In this series, Richard insists that science methods are the only right way of thinking and that it makes sense to believe something only if its evidence is strong enough. When you dig deep enough to see how science functions realize that it is as irrational as religion, and that it ultimately falls into faith, faith in evidence, faith in our peace of mind, faith in our senses, but more than anything else to believe in our instinct to follow recurrences. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to explain, but think about how the laws of physics were decided because they were and still are the most common patterns of repetition we know. I think people have an instinct that makes them believe that the longer something remains in a certain state or location, the more we just think that it is UNDERSTANDING that it is more likely that it will. For example, we do not believe that gravity will work in the opposite direction tomorrow, so I mean, the thing will be pushed away if it should attract it. But the only reason we expect this unexpected change is that we've known for so long that it's always aware. But this does not mean that he cannot do the exact opposite tomorrow or even now. No matter how long something can stay in a certain condition or change, there is no rational reason to make assumptions about it, but we make out the instinct. I ask you to consider what is a long and short time? There is no such thing, I do not know exactly how long it took those supposed wise men to decide that everything has to be done from material, Sound, Light, etc., but lets give them what they consider to be edge-to-do! Let's say much longer than it was really 12.00 billion years! Is it a long time? 99999999999999999 years is 12.00 billion years seems incredibly short in time. We know that there may be a lot of changes in the so-called science laws in the next trillion years. It is a comparison of everything, only when we compare things, we can say that it is long or short. It is just as big and small, wide and thin, heavy and light, strong and weak, and others. <br /> <br /> I doubt that any scientist could tell me why they think trusting this instinct makes sense. I certainly do not understand why it should be, but that does not mean that we as humanity should necessarily stop using it. With this in mind, the most dynamic commentary made by Richard Dorkins when he said that religion was irrational, "the thinking process" he said. If what we have in this instinct that I have described, and the instinct that we all have, is not faith, then I don't know what hell it is. At other times when he is hypocritical, he says that religions are bronze, "bronze myths". I would like to emphasize that no matter how many scientific methods have changed over the years due to experience, experiments and evaluations, pure scientific rules are aging and older all the time! They can even be described as the sacred Bible of science. He went on to see how he is ill with different religions who are stubborn, "I'm right, he's wrong," but looking back at how rude he was for the different interviewees, he seems to be as stubborn. To be fair to him, he does not try to bombard at least religious communities. I appreciate his hatred for certain religious beliefs that cause war, but I do not respect his transgression in his convictions. <br /> <br /> I'm worried that Richard has the right to believe when it's his way. I am also scientifically minded, but I do not believe that he has the right to go to religious leaders who have unfriendly arguments, trying to force his opinion on them and practically describe them as stupid. Despite her education, experience, and discovery, she seems to have no wisdom to ask her own faith system correctly. I have read what he says in defense of this argument that open-minded atheists, like my self-esteem, say what he claims to me is that he is completely deficient. <br /> <br /> Finally, the title of the documentary, All the roots of evil. It says that religion is the root of all evil, it is not true. There are evil causes that have nothing to do with religion. <br /> <br /> The entire series of documentaries was frustrating, narrow, hypocritical and flat garbage.
