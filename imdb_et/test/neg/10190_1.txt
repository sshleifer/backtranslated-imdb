I thought I could see a UFO movie. Instead, I saw a movie that tried to make an audience (myself) to receive Christ in my life or risk going to hell. The whole UFO thing was one big red herring !!! It was rather pathetic to act on it. In fact, it seemed that some people in the Evangelical Church would come together and decided that they wanted to make a movie. All the characters spoke as if they were talking to other church members in the church. It was not a real-life dialogue at all. I wish I had read some comments before I saw this movie so I didn't waste my money. On the other hand, if you are to a great extent the whole scene of the church and want to see how your views (no matter how you limit it) to other people, then look at it at all.
