Well, the film was not terrible, but the creator of the screen game didn't do a good job even in creating the nature of the Hungarian. This film was a little lower than average and didn't tell the story correctly to one of the most interesting people ever born. I recommend reading the book "one particular" from a real unger. They left out a large part of their lives. They also sometimes did not understand the real career he was. The real facts of his life were sometimes uneven. And finally, they didn't really show the real personality he had. So don't look at the movie; Read the book. By the way, I am not just a little evil who feels you have to stay in a 100% real story, but they didn't even get closer !!!
