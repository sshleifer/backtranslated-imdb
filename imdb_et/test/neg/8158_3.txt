I was looking forward to watching the film's style of exploitation, but unfortunately it turned out to be a badly-made little budget flick that just doesn't do it. The story is a very beautiful woman named Teri Marshall (Heather Thomas), a boy Rick (Jeffrey Combs), who works for a secret agency and has invented a motorcycle that is bulletproof and fires lasers and rockets and has a helmet that also fires the laser. The president of Bosarian (Martin Landau) has made a $ 5 million deal to sell it and sends two employees to kill Rick and Teri and collect a bike. Rolf (Dar Robinson) and his partner Hanna (Dawn Wildsmith) are able to kill Rick, but Teri survives. At home, he discovers a video tape Rick left to describe his invention, which helps Ter go further. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Teri drives several agents and gets stuck and tortured, but doesn't talk about where the motorcycle is needed, but he gets help from a federal agent called Waters (Martine Beswick), where they end up using a motorcycle. Apart from the quick shower scene, there is no nudity and the usual titration that viewers are used to seeing Ray in the movie. I don't think anyone was waiting for Thomas naked, but he didn't wear one sexy outfit. Not that it stopped me in vague jeans and admired her in almost perfect shape, but Ray drew it in that case. Like all his films, it's fun to watch and many of the familiar faces have roles like Robert Quarry, Huntz Hall, Troy Donahue, Tim Conway Jr, Michael Reagan and Russ Tamblyn. Stuntman Dar Robinson died shortly after he did, and this is his last ability to act and the film is dedicated to him. You have to think about why Landau would waste her time on such a junk, but I was interested in casting rarities with less romantic roles. Is Thomas good in this movie? Who cares! I think he showed that he could have become a popular "B" movie when he wanted to, but it never happened. Ray wastes everyone's time with this effort, although it is fun to look at the cast, but he left out the elements that make him a pleasant filmmaker.
