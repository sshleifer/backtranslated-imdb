I was all ready to hate it, but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerable - although the MTV-style (captured with DV to launch) is quite prominent! I liked the scary style of the script itself, as well as its central idea that a female vampire would double as a contract killer. As far as lies are concerned, Eileen Daly (the most well-known "star" of their terrible "redemption" intros ") has the existence of an undeniable screen - and, despite her age, is quite sensual; but Christopher Adamson's dentist annoyance. David Warbeck has a short role as a doctor (called "Horror-Movie Man!") Who carries an autopsy of one vampire victim; the film seems to have taken quite a long time when Warbeck died in 1997! There is a lot of nudity and violence, but unfortunately this is not the point (especially since its sub-platform, which includes the secret society of invading vampires), is hardly developed); the film is too long for its purpose and eventually slips into tedium in the last half hour.
