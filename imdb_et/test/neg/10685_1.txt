This terrible movie was constantly being tempted by me. <br /> <br /> The main activity of the movie is nothing special. It seems that in the far mountain region of northern China there is a tribe of worshipers, where leaders and decision-makers are more women than men. I think it is enough for some men to make a "Succubare" horror movie ... Anyway, the Chinese people sometimes go to the village, take the local girls, seduce them and then give up. Unfortunately for men, women had placed the snake that was obtained from the snake's poison, which would make them terribly dead within 100 days - their stomachs seemed like the living worms and snakes of a pregnant woman - if they didn't return. <br /> <br /> Forget the US video cover. It has nothing to do with vampires, though there is one intuitive bleeding. The title itself is only slightly relevant: "Succubare" is a Latin verb that means "lie underneath", and this is the word Succubus, a female demon who attracts people to sleep. In fact, these are men who are seducers here. <br /> <br /> But this is not the main activity of this ridiculous movie that is so reluctant. This is a small side event. I forget the slaughter of the bull and the meat industry. Participants seem very experienced as being an unpleasant obligation that they actually do in real life; and I'm sure they will really eat the animal later ... even though I would mind it was my "entertainment". <br /> <br /> What I wish I could forget (or neglected by HAD) is numerous, totally alien to the frames of an unknown person who occasionally interrupts the story by eating live animals. She starts the movie by removing her living snake with her teeth. During the film, she feeds on a mistake, a lizard, a toad (I had to leave the room after that) and a whole mouse (I stopped here to watch and lost my appetite for days). Let me emphasize that it was completely unexpected and had nothing to do with the film ... if this is not a cynical reference to love, as depicted in the film: a blind, selfish and predatory survival mechanism that tears the helpless ... but then again, I am probably just rational to get my disdain out.
