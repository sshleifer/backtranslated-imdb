I think that saying this movie is too much that this movie is not bad. Twists are not a movie problem. The story is pretty smart and could have been very cool when filming. The main problems that everyone complains about the twist of the movie is that the film isn't exciting enough for people to watch it. The film is poorly captured (at least compared to its genre brother Lock, Stock). Worse: The characters are (albeit often well) just flat. The characters do not have enough time to introduce them well enough to allow the viewer to take part in one, not to mention understanding them. Oh, and the locations are just terrible: locations - person (I didn't take credit for your name) - get more work (maybe still photography or interior design)
