Now, TV shows (at least in England) are cramped with home improvement, bargain hunting, household and culinary exhibitions in the afternoon, with the possibility that any terrestrial broadcaster will be able to slow such a complete ambiguity slowly in the afternoon with little time on the screen. But in the eighties, the BBC did just that and thought what I was looking at. And this is a testimony to the overwhelming astonishment of this Hungarian-American co-production, which I still remember for over twenty years. First, the opening title will appear briefly if it is lost, it will disappear for at least half an hour. (Imagine that the American army has been re-edited so that Feivel wouldn't be seen anywhere, and you appreciate how confused it is.) There is an extremely bizarre animation where one character gets its exactly waxed mustache that is full and stretched. A scary sound effect that causes him to boss-eyed. Probably fun when you're stoned, but for a child, quite disturbing. Speaking that the infamous "hippo" scene is represented in an abstract way - clouds in dusky hippos have been hit by lightning - but it is still unpleasant. In fact, this film is quite cold and all-encompassing, a sad situation, hardly seen by a strange-looking design, all the muddy colors, weak lines, swollen forms, and uniquely European darkness resembling Jan Svankmajer, not only so convincing. Then we can all beat Osmonds! It is not as terrifying a film as a deeply misleading, not so much a fantasy magic, but rather a bad trip.
