I like Kevin Bacon and Cathy Moriarty, and I love Mary Stuart Masterson, but the film wasn't good at all. There was no pleasant character in the picture and the plot was almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> ms. Masterson is a great actor, but he just doesn't pull a "tough girl". (She had similar problems on her second day of Christmas.) Maybe she should avoid these signs, especially those who have an unpleasant female child playing. <br /> <br /> Evan Rachel Wood was unimpressive. His character was brat, simple and simple, and no young actor could give Harriet any positive feelings. <br /> <br /> For the sake of complete disclosure, I was not even able to view this image. Forty-five minutes of my time is enough to waste.
