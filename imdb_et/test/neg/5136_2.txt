This film has good intentions, at least in the message "don't be afraid, no matter how harsh it is. Fear kills you in the end" This is a good message, but the container is so wrong that the message is confusing due to bad behavior, lack of credibility, lack of knowledge, dialogue that transmitted as if it were read, stereotypes instead of breathing, living people. <br /> <br /> It abuses such effects as slowing down to compensate for the lack of complete credibility in the actor and thus in the absence of emotional power ... <br /> <br /> This suicidal part still reminds me of a low budget movie from From the 90s, when lesbians seemed (at least on celluloid) alive to have a good, happy life full of incapacity and a tendency to catch up with the general dramas often associated with separation, death or prison. <br /> <br /> If it were focused on the benefits of living life as we know it (and not how others think we should live it), it would be less dramatic, more inspiring. But that does not mean that it focuses on pain, loss, and leaves the message simply a theoretical ideal. <br /> <br /> I don't see how this movie can be an inspiration for someone to come out or go beyond fear and rejection. <br /> <br /> If you are really looking for a good movie about going beyond fear and the courage to live what you feel, go back to the amazing "Desert Hearts" (even better: read the novel!)
