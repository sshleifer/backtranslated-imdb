Amando DeOssorio had never created a lack of budget to talk about one thing. His "Blind Dead" series was a great start, but he had really ridiculous moments like the pictures of a small model boat in the water tank "The Ghost Galleon". "The Sea Serpent" hits the bottom and takes with him some remarkable actors, talking about a stupid monster of socks, which brings google terror to some water tanks and miniature aquariums. <br /> <br /> The vague opening sequence sets the stage ahead and shows an interrupted military mission where American pilots for some unknown reason fall somewhere near the Spanish coast with an atomic atomic bomb (film frame). The military commander orders this from an office with a prominent American flag and a portrait that looks like Ronald Reagan, one of the few things that makes this film eighty. The other two are funly inappropriate subtitles that announce "1.985" and the hairstyle of Sheena Easton dated by Tyria Power, which would have been really cool with some ripped neon sweats. <br /> <br /> The monster monsters that you will ever see will rise from the depths disturbed by the explosion caused by the bomb. We find out that the attacking atom bomb has killed many local fish. Unfortunately, it is not our cast, it does not affect Sea Serpent, which falls on the Spanish coast for some miniature chaos. <br /> <br /> Now that I say the monster is unreal, I won't overdo it. It's not just "sort of" fake. I'm sure the filmmakers did the best for the ten dollars they seem to have separated, but it seems to be mostly made of Crayola markers, ping pong and old socks. Not only is it the music of the evil that accompanies it everywhere, the music that sounds as much as the "Jaws" theme, it is a miracle that no one could get. <br /> <br /> With Tyria Power, Timothy Bottoms and Ray Milland are hidden and the dialogue would have been more unpleasant. Through a whole range of plots, our leading actors are thrown together ... well, I'm not sure what the purpose is. Bottoms and Power has proved that the snake is real to save his butts (he is accused of a snake-induced shipwreck, he is locked into a bonus after viewing). None of them are important, because at the end of the movie nothing has been solved. Nobody admits that the snake is real, and it's not even dead. In addition, Power and Bottoms are still lying on the law. <br /> <br /> As it seems, no one knows, but our heroes know that the snake exists (despite numerous disappearances, trash bins and crushed railway bridges) and they start an expanded non-adventure to track down the monster again and again ... not to kill it because they know they are not suitable. Their big plan is to use burns to scare it. Although their scheme is botched, the snake causes a large explosion in the water after it attacks the bridge (don't ask), and the giant sea snake is so scared that it floats. The critical viewer does not know why the snake had not been intimidated in the movie before it caused a few major explosions after falling on the dock. But there is no difference. It swims away and our heroes are sure it will be lost forever. End. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine the horror that the stars felt when they saw the finished movie they were working on. The lamebrain script and a few dull reactions could not prepare them to mix the screen time with stapled sock-cam stop motion. At least supportive characters were having fun screaming and pretending that the giant snake's head swallows. I'm not sure what's going on with this movie; The monster is inexpensive, but there are some rather complicated miniature kits so no one spent time doing them, let alone stop-motion animation. It is seemingly played directly, though perhaps the sense of humor of this film is above my head. After all, the movie is nothing but a simple target for drunk commenting. See this party for the best results.
