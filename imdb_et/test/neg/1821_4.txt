Alan Rickman & Emma Thompson give good performances in this detective blow with South / New Orleans accents. It's worth seeing their scenes - and Rickman's scene with Hal Holbrook. These three actors influence us for entertainment, no matter what the film looks like. The film's graph shows potential, but after watching the movie, you get the impression that it's not as well drawn as possible. The fact that it is a rather uninteresting sub-block and mostly uninteresting robbers actually talk about things. The film is a worthwhile view - more than entertainment from Rickman, Thompson and Holbrook.
