Move over Manos. Back to Boogens. It doesn't take Baby Genius to know that Malibu Beach Vampires (MBV's rest of this tome) is now and always (if no one makes a sequel to Zarkorr Invader) the worst film ever. The only horror in this matter is to look at it. I don't know if it was an attempt to meet a babes with a movie. If that was the case, the babes are not babes like this is not a movie. It's a dreck. Wait. I miss the word dreck, calling it. Ulli Lommel (Boogey Man's Fame) would call it "uber dreck" or Schei√üe. It should be used to torture prisoners. If you find it on the shelf in a video store, press it quietly and notify the authorities.
