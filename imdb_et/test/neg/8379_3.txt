Two of the most remarkable topics I do not play are: It won the Academy Award in 1944 and was led by Crane Wilbur, the leader of the silent era. The short description of this mill is irrelevant, the dialogue has no spark, while the actor is no better and no worse than what is found in most of the war-related 1940s Hollywood films (in other words, it is terrible). Of course, there are moments when "I'm not playing" is funny - Janis Paige's totally artificial look and line breaks are valuable, but one laughs in the picture, not that.
