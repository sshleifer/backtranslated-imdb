Throughout his career, Hitchcock made great films; it wasn't one of them. <br /> <br /> The man knows too much, his daughter has been kidnapped to secure his silence, and everything is solved with the solution of fire and roof drama. <br /> Anyone who has seen Fritz Lang's films from the 1930s - M remember - knows how far this city description of crime and conscience does not correspond to the time that had already been made in this genre. There's a whole lot of amateur air about a great deal of production and behavior that undermines any threat, darkness, and misery that Hitchcock might have wanted to instill. <br /> <br /> What you should look at, however, is the sequence associated with shooting at Albert Hall. If it begins, it is like a blood transfusion given to the film. The camera is lively, cuts are interesting, and the way everything combines with the climax is masterful. Here you will see the future captain: Hitchcock organizes effortlessly with all the resources with an impressive and memorable effect: when the scream comes, you will feel good and hear.
