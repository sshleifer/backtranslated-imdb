Don't waste your money or time. Terrible movie. Bad action, plot all over the place. Really, very bad action. Man, this movie is just bad. I closed it out in 7 minutes. The script is bad, management is bad, it seems to me that the high school group got together for their drama class project. Yes, it's so bad. Actor is not convincing at all, remember that I only saw it for 7 minutes. How this movie came to DVD is beyond me. <br /> <br /> It should have remained in the editing room. I saw the cover and thought it was pretty cool, it won't do the next time: _)
