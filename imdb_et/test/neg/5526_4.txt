Well now this strange film. It was listed as a comedy, but I couldn't find anything. In fact, I'm trying to say something positive about this movie. Oh, here I go. Alex Ferns is not in a bad position in the lead and I did not choose to end the change, but besides that, it is not a big two-dimensional sign and it is not funny enough to be comedy or serious or dark enough to be a form of a decent drama. I really would avoid watching this movie again and I think it won't do anything that would be useful for one of the work class characters it is trying to portray. I found it difficult for some characters to understand and was not given enough information about the motive Jimmy to believe his motives. Best to avoid.
