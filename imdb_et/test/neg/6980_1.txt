I gave this film a chance just because he had very good reviews. After seeing the trailer, I thought - what a unique film full of clich√©s. But I decided to do it because trailers often do not really make a movie. What a waste of time ... The film is worst than a trailer and after watching it, I didn't remember any line that made me laugh. The more fun parts of the movie were CSI parodies, but it's a real pass. I couldn't associate with any character or hope they were together because I found them completely stupid. The plot is extremely predictable and unclear. Stylish comedy for people who are still in high school or feel it mentally.
