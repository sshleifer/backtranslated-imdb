Concorde: Airport'79, is now the last high-drama high-camp airport series, at first glance TV guide or DVD cover, which you just think the movie you are watching is as exciting as the previous airport thought again! What you treated for 2 hours and 3 minutes inadvertently laughs at the worst scripts of cheerfulness, even written by Eric Roth, who brought the world "Forrest Gump!" well one thing sure the script is not worth Oskar, it is Razzie worth! In the '79 leaders of Universal, did it right, marketing it as "comedy" after Charo! the film has an impressive election list.
