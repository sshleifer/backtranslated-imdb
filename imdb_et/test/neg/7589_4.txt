Or battle is a fun story of two fancy cities and their arms race. It is also a false allegory of the Cold War and weapons in general. Yes, it is a children's book, but like so many of Theodor Seuss Geissel's works, he hits moral people over the head. <br /> <br /> And this morality is exactly? Of course, it is praiseworthy to encourage us to focus more on what unites us than what shares us. Encouraging international cooperation is even good. However, the Warsaw Pact for equalizing the differences between the states and NATO for the difference in the chance of winning is simply wrong. Obviously, many of the countries of the Warsaw Pact enjoyed alternating time or lack of bread, would have been happy to eat it laterally if it were available. At a less literal level, and regardless of your political inclination, Soviet socialism versus Western (especially Anglo-American) democracy is not just a matter of preference and ordinary. <br /> <br /> To make the nuclear weapons even clearer, they have not been developed during the Cold War with the Soviet Union, but with the powers of the axis during the hot war. There is no doubt that Germany developed nuclear power during the war. Should the US refrain from nuclear weapons research by entrusting its (less than inevitable) victory to conventional war? When the weapons were developed, they were used against an enemy who attacked us at Pearl Harbor. What does the nation do when the pedigree is out of the bottle? What's more, there are 20-20 in retrospect, which means that there was no way to ensure that the other half of the crazy dictator did not start with the development of nuclear weapons. The second Gulf War has shown incredible difficulties in identifying and neutralizing credible threats. <br /> <br /> In any case, the cartoon is little more than a simplified propaganda that examines to a certain extent the nuances of nuclear ethical issues. armament, and instead children are intimidated by weapons technology.
