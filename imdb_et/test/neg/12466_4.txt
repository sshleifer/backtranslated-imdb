Movie Title - Hold <br /> <br /> Date Review - 5/26/02 <br /> <br /> Movie Year - 2001 <br /> <br /> Stars - Dominique Swain, Brad Renfro, Bijou Phillips ( hardly), Melanie Griffith (barely) <br /> <br /> NeCRo rating - 4 skulls out of 10. <br /> <br /> Spoilers may be included. <br /> <br /> Plot <br /> <br /> Dominique Swain wants to be in the group and thus surrenders and joins his true friends. .... many disturbing rich people are told. I think I got what I wanted Dominique was ok, but the man, the rest except Brad Renfro was bad or at least not interesting or pleasant. I know some might say that others were good because they made me hate .... trust me .... I like the unlikely letter, but this group is unlikely because they can't convincingly be bad people. <br /> <br /> It shows that the only others I have received were hardly such and that is Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips, but little time they were. Melanie perhaps spoke 2 lines, but at least Bijou had a good character, though small. <br /> <br /> Violence and Gore <br /> <br /> My mind was constantly attacked by terrible dialogue and very annoying signs. , it's violent enough! ok was one of the bludgeoning with the stone that was ok. <br /> <br /> R & D Nudity <br /> <br /> Hahaha, they couldn't even add some nudity to help spice up this movie because no one would want to wear it. When they begin to reveal themselves, they should do it in a movie where they are remembered as their character and not "oh hey I heard he was naked in this area." <br /> <br /> General movie view (overview) <br /> <br /> ok ok I know I'm proud to be the person who can appeal to most, if not almost, all films, or at least find it good. Well this movie is one of the few that I really bothered to find. The problem with this movie is that it is so damn annoying. I already have deep hatred for the stupid attitude of people and it doesn't help. All this movie is really, there are just a lot of rich people who are sitting depressed and stupid. I can't stress enough the stress factor. This movie tries to try again the tried and true "group" line that can usually be done with very little difficulty. <br /> <br /> Why don't I have a picture of a movie or box on the cover? Well I felt that this film didn't deserve this honor, so I decided to put a picture of why I rented it, and that is nothing other than Dominique Swain. Yes, I was also Lolitas by him and he thought he was so good that I had decided on it ever since. At least I keep my promises and yes I have seen most of his films, some of which are hard to find. He himself is a big actor and I would defend him actively, but the man chooses films with his own letters. This movie and smokers are both on the same boat, but at least smokers had a cool idea. and even some real good scenes. <br /> <br /> The dvd box also tries to think that this movie also has stars, placing the names of Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips on the front of the box. If there is one thing P **** S won't let me do, this is the movie that sticks the star names in the box so you think "it's ____ I don't know how good is what I saw ___ in this movie and I thought he was great! "just to make the big names in the movie together maybe 10 minutes between the 2nd Bijou was actually a part that meant halfway. Melanie, on the other hand, is only 2 lines .... Allowed me to dislike Melanie so much, but that is ethical and not star behavior. <br /> <br /> All of this confusion must go to Brad Renfro to turn to ok with Dominique. Brad can be a very confusing child in real life, but at least he can act. So the only reason why this film is a skull is that I got what I basically wanted, Dominique Swain and Brad Renfro. I was also delighted to see that the undervalued actor Bijou Phillips made me even more. So even though I was annoyed, I still came out with some positive results, although it was quite difficult this time. <br /> <br /> I suggest you only see if you have seen Lolita and how well Dominique is, or if you are a Brad or Bijou fan. Uber Melanie fans are seriously pushed. Also, if you're like a fan of memorable movies, don't think it's a blame for you to feel guilty, for buying or renting money. <br /> <br /> Some movies are "so bad they're good", as they say. What they forgot to add was "so bad they're good (go up)." <br /> <br /> NeCRo
