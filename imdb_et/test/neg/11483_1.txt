I don't know why all the previous comments are for approval of this movie. It is, well, not far from ... SUCKIEST MOVIE, WHAT IS LATELY, full of clich√©s, bad behavior, really not ... very bad action and silly plot ... If I had seen it in the cinema I would be out in the first 20 minutes stepped in. I hate someone, I make him watch this movie ... it's so bad. A girl with an imaginary boyfriend / friend who gives up the relationship because her imagination is jealous .... but I think she thinks ... she takes her parents who have some mental problems ... plus a person who should think that a laugh of laughter, a thing that should make you laugh, is a serious companion to the room and just makes me sorry for it ... and the whole movie
