I'm a guy who loves hoods from New Jack City for Baby Boy Killa Season, from class b to hollywood. but this movie was something else. I am not a hate and this movie was pleasantly enjoyable. but some bits were just weird. it didn't work well compared to Silkk The Shockers' performance at Hot Boyz (pretty good) and Ice-T in the new Jack and SVU (big). a scene where the corrupt (Ice-T) kills the desire to be a Jamaican guy, he says something and lights up burning both Ice-T and the other guy, it kills Jamaica, but Ice-T is intact, very similar to Ice's movie Urban Menace (which stands for both actors) was Snoops' character supernatural, but after that nothing has been said to be corrupt like a demon. When MJ (Silkk) first grabs, he struggles, but after that he fights normally and bounces off-thigh blood. and when MJ recognizes the killing of the police officer, the policeman beat his friend Brie, Benny has not been introduced to this film and the scene is not in the movie. it weighs on the fact that the corrupt wants to kill the MJ, but still does u scratch. Wen Jody writes a letter to Miss Jones explaining what happened to them. the film showed the ghetto's horror and poverty, which breaks the broad way of life of the Latin and black words, although the film was re-used thousands of times. and the scene where Miles kills his Latino brother, turning his bike at full speed (not wearing a helmet) and running into my Latino brothers car, killing him. The film was similar to Urban Menace and half of the participants were in both films and production teams. it was OK. but i come from poverty, i love hoodies, but if you don't love em like i dont do it. the only thing that will save me from walking has reminded me of the first movie I made for $ 100, and my love for the genre. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel Purez
