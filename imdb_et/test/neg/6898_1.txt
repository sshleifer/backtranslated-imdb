BARNYARD SUCK! I saw this movie last week and it's terrible. What bulls have udders? My 2-year-old asked me if all the cows have the udders and try to explain to him that it's not just true and seeing the movie mixes him more! <br /> <br /> In addition, the violent topic was frightened by my 2 year old. They made coyotes ferocious and this has forced their daughter to fear the coyote. I know coyotes aren't real and are natural predators. Mother and son sitting in front of us shouted, "Kill her, kill her, yes" in a certain scene where it's good and evil to say <br /> <br /> This is a lion's king rip and they should end up with big name bonds to use flat film. Steve Oederek, who has also made Thumb movies like Thumb Wars, Thumbelina and many others, is so bad! <br /> <br /> When a good movie by Steve Oederek appears in my life, I roll naked and swallow my diarrhea and post it on Youtube.com ... Help Said!
