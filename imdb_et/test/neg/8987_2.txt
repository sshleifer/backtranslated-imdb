First, let me say that I have no idea who is Nora Roberts. So the book can be great, but there's no movie. <br /> <br /> I've lived all my life in the NC Peidmon area. I've never heard southern accents as ridiculous as in this movie. I've lived in two small NC cities and Charlotte and Raleigh. Sometimes you meet people with strong southern heights, but I've never met in a city where everyone is talking like a bad imitation of the wind. <br /> <br /> In response to Gore_Won from the Atheist community. Your comments show more about your twisted psyche than about the movie. If we would like to stretch our imagination and pretend that there is something real in this film - which is not there - then it is true that such bad people as Tory's father always find justification for their actions. The author chose religion for Tory's supernatural abilities. Your assumption that the "true nature of the gospels" directs a man to beat his daughter is the most perverse and misleading interpretation I've ever heard. Before you begin taking the gospels, you should first read them. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. Dialogue is flat, unnatural and incredible most of the time. Above all, the many things that Kade Tory has said are inappropriate and do not correspond to the mood, context, or way they have said. <br /> <br /> The "exciting twist" at the end of the movie is flat, predictable and devoid of credibility. Some have also argued that Jacqueline Bisset is doing a wonderful job in this film, but the truth is that the bitter mother's character is also hidden, predictable, and one-dimensional. Is that Bisset's fault? I do not know. <br /> <br /> If you have a choice between viewing this movie and the twenty-year-old repetition of the Muppet exhibition, I recommend the Muppet Show.
