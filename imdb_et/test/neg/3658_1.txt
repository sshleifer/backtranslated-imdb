This "movie" gives me nightmares, I wake up to sweating, shouting "I didn't make this movie, please don't blame me!" I honestly think it would have been more fun to look at a fat guy who eats pork fat in his mother's basement for an hour or two hours to watch this mess. I understand that the money was tight, but the devil they thought the hell did not make sense, plot or effort. This film needs a warning: "Please do not fund the Drama Department for the love of God as a local JC." According to another note, these are the least pleasing characters I've ever seen, and I've seen movies with Hitler. Finally, take my advice the next time you even think about renting it, just a few hundred Adives and sleep.
