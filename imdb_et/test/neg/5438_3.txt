"Congo" is based on Michael Crichton's best-selling novel, which I think was missing Crichton's usual charm, smart characters and punch. Well, sorry, but the same goes for the movie. <br /> <br /> There is a plot here: <br /> <br /> Greed is bad, this simple story of morality warns. Megalomaniacal C.E.O. (Joe Don Baker) sends his son to a dangerous African Congo to find a sufficiently large and clean source of diamonds to act as a powerful laser transmitter (or is it a laser weapon?). In the event of a loss of contact with his son and team, his former CIA operative and computer-freak, his girlfriend (Laura Linney) will be sent. In his quest, he is accompanied by a gee quiz and some eccentric characters (including mercenary (Ernie Hudson), speaking gorilla (Dylan Walsh)) and nut Indiana-Jones who are looking for King Solomon's mines (Tim Curry) After some narrow escapes -Air rockets and some African wild animals, they all discover that often what we want most is the source of our decline. <br /> <br /> Participants in this movie were not talented, Dylan Walsh acts like a pathetic crybaby, especially at the end, Ernie Hudson is not convincing (is it not surprising that he was watching television shows?) and Laura Linney is nothing special. to safely say that the only talented actors in this film were very small: Joe Don Baker and Tim Curry, an always enjoyable actor (although sometimes life was always intimidated by his "Rocky Horror Picture" days). <br /> <br /> This film also had some other problems, including a terrible direction, a cheese dialogue, and a fair-clean boring plot that was totally ashamed of the Crichton novel. <br /> <br /> Even Stan Winston's creature effects could not save this movie from disaster. I'm very disappointed in this movie; There wasn't even a campy quality to redeem itself. It was just terrible, cheesy, boring and ridiculous and turns out to be one of the worst Crichton movies. <br /> <br /> 2/5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
