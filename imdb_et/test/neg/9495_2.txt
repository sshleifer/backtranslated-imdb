I really don't know much about Marade de Sade, not reading his book, but I never imagined him under the name of a flaming queen. Carson Kressley Queer Eye Straight Guy or Willi and Grace Jack could have easily matched the role given to us by Nick Mancuso. <br /> <br /> The film itself was fairly thin and seemed to be a parody - or an excuse to show you in Paris for a few times when men and women have dinner in the salon. What? They can't afford space? I found it cute that Madame (Irina Malysheva) felt she was doing her patriotic duty, taking care of the soldier's needs. <br /> <br /> The film was just an excuse to show you many breasts - and I mean a lot! Gimli fans (John Rhys-Davies) could be interested in his role as an inspector in Marais.
