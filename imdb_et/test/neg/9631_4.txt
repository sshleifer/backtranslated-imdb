By 1971, it was increasingly evident that Hammer film studios were on the way out. RIPPER HANDS is a case where even the idea smells like despair - in the spirit of Jack The Ripper is your daughter!

Did it give the film a delicate title? <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are unimpressive, and cinematography gives the whole movie to cheap TVM, but you know that you will not see the classic Hammer horror as soon as the title begins, because the music is ridiculously inappropriate. I think the composer tried to make the subject strange and touching, but the music resembles something from an unpleasant romantic movie. I give most credit because they take their roles seriously, far from a serious movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't enjoy much of this movie and it reminded me immediately of Phantom's Raspberry Blower from the City of London from the two Ronnies I smiled in weeks before I saw it
