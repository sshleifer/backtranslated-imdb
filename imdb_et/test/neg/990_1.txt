This is probably the worst film I've ever seen, it was terribly done, it didn't flow, it was very dirty because many people didn't understand the movie at all. I had to watch this movie several times before I realized what was happening, OK, as this boy stole someone's car and puts him out of the police, for whatever reason, the police let him down and he must confront his parents who sent him to live with his uncle in the desert, he meets a girl who loves climbing on climbing and gets into the sport and has to ask her uncle to let her start a climbing competition and yes as I said a terrible movie.
