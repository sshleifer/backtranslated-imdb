Let's be honest, really terrible movie, no ... I mean a "really" terrible movie that is a rare, strange and beautiful thing. I admire that there is a special place in my heart for films like Plan 9 From Space Space, semi-box, species, etc. And while I give this movie 1, I invite someone who really enjoys a bad movie to have a (bad film) to find a friend, a snack, something to drink and make a special event that deserves it: Aussie Park Boyz. <br /> <br /> The first moments of the first-ever running eye-catching performance when trying to insert the intensity directly into a movie without looking at the camera (a slice of smooth picture from straight-through images) - take your heart out of Rudolph Valentino) we are non-film conclusions. <br /> <br /> To sum up the movie, the poor man's warriors down, complete - and this description alone should be enough, but then the miracle "spaghetti eat scene", "we" you have your tickets, they will not leave the city now the "scene", "it's the Asian! and more. The only really reluctant part is the free filmed rape. Outside of this, I dare you to watch this movie. And I dare to find evidence of action or lines or direction or any other boring and redundant item so-called critics say the film has to be considered good. <br /> <br /> If this film does not match the uncontrolled laughter before its end, I can only roll my eyes from threatening side to side and shout: "Your dog! ! "
