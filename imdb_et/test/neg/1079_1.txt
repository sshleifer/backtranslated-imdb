I have to admit that I was against the film from the beginning, but I tried my hardest to be impartial, I really did, but the idea of ​​restoring a complicated, witty, fun and peculiar British classic must be suspicious. at the beginning. <br /> <br /> People in my house looked at it so I swallowed my pride and told myself about professional movies (I've studied them at Uni). <br /> <br /> For such a movie, it is expected that the movie started with a tracking that was not bad. Indeed, many activity sequences are reliable and alone raise the mark. <br /> <br /> However, the characterization was debilitating, the set could be very easily connected to any American chocolate block that you might have been overlooking and had no character at all. <br /> <br /> It seems that the original movie failed with failed initial robbery, the US version makes a predictable thing and introduces an emotional factor to Donald's death. The nature of Sutherland. This allows our US relatives a lot of opportunities for cytophantic, fatty eye retaliation, striving for "evil-doers", who this milk is supposed to be excessively predictable. It is never as obvious as the scenes that characterize Charlize Theron (oh pretty! Oh so beautiful! Look at her beautiful, wounded Bambi eyes, all!), Which were profoundly nauseous. Especially his entrance scene was like Resident Evil or Tomb Raider, which were both a) more fun as well as b) they had a better start because they couldn't interfere with the game, as they might have been in a British cinema that was already full. sparks, the people you really know and the moments of inspiration. But I'll land that involving a pretty girl in her interest seems to be the toughest maneuver I've ever seen and the cynical Hollywood intimidation-lust for what it is. <br /> <br /> If you like one of these actors and you agree with some of the comments above, DO NOT ATTENTION THIS FILE! If I had the opportunity to watch 'Fight Club' or 'American History X' after I saw Ed Norton in it, I would have refused. Similarly, Jason Statham is with Lock Lock (and I think the Transporter is fine if you like this thing). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all the kits are designed in the most transparent way you can, 'Oh! She's smart! ',' Coo! He's cool! ',' Hey! What a tough guy! '. Then there is a "funny PC guy" who has a "comic relief" over his forehead, but whose humor can be predicted two minutes in advance. To be honest, if you have seen one or two of these movies, you can confuse two of Jerry Bruckheimer's stable clone. Not that Jerry is terribly terrible, but he just uses clichés too, as everyone knows (or should). <br /> <br /> This is where I have to get clean. I couldn't do it to the end, so I couldn't even tell if the brilliant end of Michael Caine's version did it, but I'm sorry it's just one of those very rare movies when I am. d saw it in the cinema, I would have walked out and staged a small protest outside. It's not just that it's one of the identical numbers on Ocean 14 or something (Ocean's Eleven was good, but don't worry about the rest!) With such a movie glitz, glamor, fake bastard and pantomime heroes, nothing at all could recognize the original certificate. <br /> <br /> So if you expect "Italian WORK" and not "OCEAN 14", though poorly written with less reliable, false and characters, some unpleasant elements and writing a cardboard cutout script, DON'T SEE! I do not mind that people love somewhat meaningless fun, but it is a criminal hatchet work that does not deserve in any way under the title of the classic. Seriously, show some pride! I felt thoroughly justified in my outrageous and bad reaction when I first heard the movie. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> P.S. Some action sequences are not bad at all, so add extra "1" to the label if you like this.
