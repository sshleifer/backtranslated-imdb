Celebrity did something strange. It was not only the music that was originally created on the screen (most of them based on Broadway musicals), but it created a television series and Broadway music. Let me fix this sentence. Celebrity is not musical. Music has a story to convey or recognize characters. The song of this music is never used; in fact, it cannot be used at all. People just sing to match the plot. And this is not the type of music I know. <br /> <br /> The so-called celebrity fan is with the attacking people (who are all one time the last time I saw it in [Gosford Park]) it was a catastrophic result) who listened to and entered the New York School of Performing Arts. All of these are for different reasons, ie. Acting, singing, etc. A quotation-unmodified drama occurs when these middle-aged people pretend to be teenagers, through four years. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that high school should be optional. After all, it's a free college, and they can't let everyone in. So how is it that some people who are really bad are in college? Obviously, drama can occur between all these different people. And why has a person been caught up to the end of the film, for some reason at all, except to make us feel uncomfortable? There are many unpleasant situations that these untalented people get into, but you can't feel them bad because you don't know who they are! These relationships arise between people whose names you don't know. And these characters understand their own things during the film, but you don't understand it because you don't know what they were in the first place. <br /> <br /> As for singing, it jumps randomly (and should be humorous?) and do nothing. When the song is sung, it is played in the middle of the street and before you can say that Ferris Bueller is in the middle of everyone's street, dancing wildly and beating. The song itself is good, but the whole scene, like the whole movie, is not necessary. Celebrity is at least an unpleasant film. I'd say more, but most of the movie is luckily out of my head. Just don't see it. You earn for yourself. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Rated for R language.
