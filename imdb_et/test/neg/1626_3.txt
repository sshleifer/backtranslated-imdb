This film has some of the worst production values ​​and editing I've ever seen. There are a number of cases where participants stop trying to remember their lines, the actors who walk in front of the actors, and one point where the film slips around seven frames. Not to mention a hero who strikes the chest, but he starts limping! And what is a secret passage that is well lit and open open. Typical. <br /> <br /> The plot is non-existent, with nothing to do with a primitive nuclear bomb and going to the ends of the Earth and a war of some cave war. Ator pulls the stapler's movie from the very best moment. The dialogue is stupid, containing such gems as "It is all and nothing." and "I know it here." <br /> <br /> Film is a mess, a confusing mess. Ator is a happy hero, sword fighting is absurd and plots are moving slowly. All in all, this is a film that must be avoided.
