Final Fantasy: The children of the Advent are and remain a classic example of a style that has gone wrong. Instead of relying on memorable characters and the pleasant mythology of the original game, Square Enix has ripped off the frivolous assembly of meaningless battle scenes. Yes, I said "incomprehensible". Did you know that Tifa knows dazzlingly the fast Kung Fu technique that magically causes the camera to shift its angle every second? This cloud can freely stop yourself for a minute, while despising your 2-ton sword? English dub is mediocre. Although not very bad, it is far from being well produced. Quality is comparable to the average anime dub. <br /> <br /> Here's what I would like to say to the fucking FFVII fans who can't catch this movie: Advent Children's Best Fan Service That You Were Waiting for Square Enix, But Even Trashy CG Flick Like Galleries: Rion had a better story. Because of this movie and its pointless absence, you torture you well in advance. The novelty of the days is numbered. <br /> <br /> Movies like the Advent Children ask me if Square Enix recognizes the potential of its franchises. After all (and not offense) it is a Japanese company. Japanese developers can offer fun games, but most of their offers are disappointing. However, they are completely psychic when it comes to production quality. Advent Children has some of the most breathtaking shapes in CG history, but it does not save the twisted plot and carton characters. Bending the story to accommodate his resurrection was a big mistake. Cloud in a feminine Caucasian leader.
