I wrote an essay in 1981, which I graduated from a gymnasium called "The Last American Virgin". I also had a friend named Nancy who was a prostitute of this movie. apparently his daughter got her essay in the evening when she slept her house. A year later I wake up one morning and see the advertisement of this movie. I was 18 years old and based on my life experiences. the film is a bit different from my essay, but it is definitely taken from it. I had no evidence of this, except my English teacher, Mr.Versace, who gave me A for my essay. Let her go and never did it. I thought it was going around. action against persons involved in this film. I just needed it out of my chest because I never talked to anyone except my closest friend and they agreed to keep it secret. That same year it came out that I saw the nancy in the market. ask me if i have good stories or scripts. I think this is what Hollywood is all about, getting stories about where you can.it it was interesting to see parts of my life on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Ghost Writer!
