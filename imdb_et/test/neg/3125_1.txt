This movie is so unrealistic. Such French films are just a waste of time. Why watch this movie? Even, I didn't know if. What? Is the well-known sex scene of half-brothers-brothers? Although the sex scene is so real and clear, but the underlying story is so unrealistic. What is its use? Can you easily find in life, half of the brothers do such things? <br /> <br /> Did I learn about this movie? Yes: some people are just so fond of wasting time on such movies, such stories, such a nonsense. But for those who like nihilism, lack of life or just life without hope, you are .. you have to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Only one that deserves respect: CATHERINE DENEUVE. She is such an amazingly beautiful woman.
