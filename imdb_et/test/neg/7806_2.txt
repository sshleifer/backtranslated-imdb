This movie is the worst I've seen for a long time. Terence Stamp's talent is completely wasted and almost the only thing I enjoyed was listening to my favorite song when BNL opened credit for "If I Had Million Dollars". <br /> <br /> Ashton Kutcher plays the main character, a nice boy who gets his house sitting on his boss. Next lies. Blah blah blah. If you have time to kill and have nothing better to do, it's a movie for you. Otherwise, look for something else. <br /> <br /> There are not necessarily any redeeming moments, but it's nice to see Molly Shannon and Jeffrey Tambor on the screen. They are always happy to watch, although this film managed to weaken such bright spots.
