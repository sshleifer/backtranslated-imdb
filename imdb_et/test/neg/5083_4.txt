This is a prize that made me lose all of Hugg's respects. <br /> <br /> If such a "distinguish" panel does not see Battlestar Galactica obviously speaking, what is worth their prize? Answer: Not much. <br /> <br /> Award-winning exhibitions should be examples of creativity and excellence, neither of which is in BG, in this episode, or in any other I've seen. <Br /> <br /> Taking pictures in drab is not "artistic", it's just cheap. Camera shake is not "creative" because it is vomiting and lazy as it is possible. <br /> <br /> All BGs have shown that the most award-winning "academies" are really, and how easy it is to buy prizes for a lot of PR money.
