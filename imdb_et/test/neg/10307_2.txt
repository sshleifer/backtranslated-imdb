I love this example. Last year I watched every episode. I bought a DVD. And I set to watch tonight and I see for some reason that you have come out of this great show. And you have taken what made this work and destroyed it. You took one of the best aspects of the show, which were 4 friends. Sam, Sully, Lizzy and Piper. I also love other characters, but they are good in small pieces like Derek, Darcy and even Sully. It is like an exhibition lost part of its family and everyone else is trying hard to fill. This is an overdose. While things are funny in small barrels when you have been in contact with it all the time, it is funny to annoy. I was looking forward to returning to this exhibition. So please bring back the charm. Even if you couldn't match Piper to the display, bring back at least Lizzy. But I loved these girls. They brought fun. The exhibition was about how Sam was trying to live his business and also deal with his personal life and friends. It was a charm. And this big dog does it too. <br /> <br /> I hope the network (FOX) forced the writers to do this and the writers did not show it. I'll give the show a few more episodes before I give up, but tonight the episodes were bad. I made a big presentation tonight and I had people over and I felt stupid because no one laughed except 2-3 times. I apologized for them and told me I didn't know what happened. And for about 10 minutes from the episode I realized that they were not going to show Piper or Lizzy and that it was no longer a television comedy.
