As a fan of Henriksen (I liked the "Millennium" series) and of course Lorenzo "Renegade" Lamas, I was expecting at least SOMETHING for this movie. Unfortunately, the plot is predictable, the action is bad, and most of the computational graphics used for the stunts don't work. Sometimes it even seems that they have taken some shots from the Microsoft Flight Simulator. <br /> <br /> Cinematography also sucks. Unwanted funky at the beginning of camera work only reduces (from cheesecake dialogue) and gives the movie a cheap, made video. It works in hiphop movies and in Jet Li movies, but it seems inappropriate in this flick. <br /> <br /> I would have liked this movie 10 years ago. I was then 11 years old.
