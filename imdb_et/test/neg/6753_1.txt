This so-called movie is terrible! Participants cannot act. No plot. I believe they have to start from scratch and film again. I hope they will be able to fix the mistakes of this movie. I'd like to see a trailer after they shot again. Maybe there's hope. I don't want to hurt feelings, but I think high school kids can do a better job. The wardrobe could have been much better. Sorry, but it just didn't do it for me. I usually enjoy the trailers of this site, but ... it doesn't find entertainment. I hope they will criticize well because I believe they will get much more from this movie.
