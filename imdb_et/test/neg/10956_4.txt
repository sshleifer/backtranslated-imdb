This is basically a bad b-film. In fact, it's much better quality than many b-movies. It had a consistent script, a decent direction, cinematography, and I've seen worse action. Zombies were great, clearly they were Romero zombies and were really an interesting zombie story. Obviously, the Oscar's material, and not your zombie movies or b-movies, you probably don't enjoy, but if you like this movie. is pretty good, although they never clearly explained how to shoot himself and bite the zombie. But if he has more than one line of dialogue where his bad behavior is really obvious. <br /> <br /> It was a good ending, at least I thought. Romero should be lured if he ever sees it.
