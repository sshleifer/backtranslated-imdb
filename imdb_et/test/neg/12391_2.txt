It seems at least vague that this film gave inspiration to "Sopranos" as its main line-up is a man hit by Martin Blank (John Cusack) who has so many questions about the past and his profession that he heals in trying to solve it all. In the end, everyone will reach the beginning of their 10-year high school meeting. The problem was that by the time Blank was reunited, I had abandoned the care. Frankly, I found this movie from the beginning to the end. He had the potential. Under the leadership of Cusack and Dan Aykroyd, there was a fairly good performance, who played Grocer, his rival striker, with Minnie Driver, Deb, Blank's high school sweetheart, who stood upright and limited to Alan Arkin's role as Dr. Oatman, Blank's psychologist. This rather talented cast never seemed to come together. Drama lacked intensity and comedy lacked real humor. What I thought was most likely to be a comedy story was Grocer's suggestion of striking a male alliance, but apart from being a bit of a joke, it was never developed. As for romance, we wondered why Deb would even have thought that man would let that life back. <br /> <br /> There were a handful of hips out there, but nothing struck me and kept me and I spent most of the film questioning if it ever hit. It was never - at least for me. 2/10
