this exhibition is pretty nice and fun to watch, this great Disney channel shows and sometimes fun. This exhibition has changed. In the first season, it was more about science and animals, everything that has gone through the season and the third season. It is more about his life and acquaintance. Since then, this gay boy (Ben) has been sucking this show. Writers took a very good show and turned it into a crazy teen comedy. Disney turned worse. I can no longer watch the latest episodes, they are all garbage.
