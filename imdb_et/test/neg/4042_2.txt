Words cannot be expressed as a bad film. <br /> <br /> There is no graph, the actor is terrible, basically the whole movie is fun. <br /> <br /> With a run time of 97 minutes, it's about 96 minutes too long. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was a short sketch in comedy exhibition, but the premise is too weak to work so much time without boredom. <br /> <br /> Avoid this, get out of a good movie!
