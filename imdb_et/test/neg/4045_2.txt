If you want to see how to destroy a movie, look at it very carefully. In fact, it is so bad that people should only buy it for that reason. It should be noted in particular that most scenes look like they knocked in about 5 minutes. Realism escapes from this film at every level. The overall impression is that someone got below the average script, wannabe participants, the middle director, and some budget. With this formula, it just had to be doomed. <br /> <br /> I rented it once and I swear I was watching it. If you are humanitarian, buy this terrible, terrible movie and burn it to UNWATCHED as a world. It has no noticeable plot, bad behavior and then a little bit of a miserable woman to really hit the whole thing. I would recommend drying this color before it fools! Seriously. The color would be better. I would like to give this negative 10 stars.
