OK, so it's about 30 minutes long gore without any kind of story. No dialogue, no subtitles, no real characters. You see three people in the movie (which are alive) and two are just a few reasons there. The main boy does not know emotions and simply distorts the corpses for no apparent reason. It's the whole movie. I love to see very gory movies, especially since America's real gore just isn't very common in today's movies. So yes, the gore effect was pretty cool. But it's not just annoying. Why does everyone think this is so disturbing? There are no signs, there are only 3 living people and 3 dead bodies. No one has a personality or a back story. You see that three bodies are hacked and you can't really identify it if you just don't recognize yourself with death and how it happens very well (despite the fact that the man loses his job and goes to jail very soon thereafter). the viewer must take care and take care that they have to identify with the victim. For example, for a good horror movie, you should take care of the main character. Here it is just a man and a dead body. It's as deep as just one rainwater. They never give you any reason to take care of the movie. All this is a guy who hacks some of the bodies, then he has sex with the body. Now that the sexy scene is strange here, she wears gloves but doesn't use a condom. So he was not interested in trying less strange STDs to stay away from sex with the body, but as long as his hands are not confused, there is no problem, now it is logical. I don't like the movie very much, I liked it was very gentle, but when it ends, there is no reason to look at it again, no reason to care, and it's not just a very convincing film. I say if you find it under $ 10, you can get it, but if it is more than that, it's not worth it.
