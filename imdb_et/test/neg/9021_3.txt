What distinguishes some of the Lone Star movies (and many others in the early thirties and in the adventure movie) was their lack, which we understand as a story. To be sure they had a good and a bad one (any western element), the boy meets the girl and some stock characters like the old warrior and his beautiful daughter or big daughter, and sometimes the evil banker or other businessman, the way the game was played often different from the movie. <br /> <br /> The Lawless Frontier includes Earl Dwire's Pandro Zant, (not) as (some of the inexplicable reason), half-American, representing the Mexican language, which speaks fluently. His greatest Mexican woman seemed to be his outrageous mariachi dress. The only plot seems to be that he wants to steal Ruby, "Old Dusty" grandson (Gabby Hayes). When he meets for the first time, Dwire gives him a long-lasting look that puts him in a big league with sexual predators. You think that since the opening stage shows the killing of Zanti from John (Wayne) from Tobin's father's camera, it plays the greater part in the film. This is not. Too much rides between heroes and villains back and forth. <br /> <br /> However, we get a lot of good tricks from Yakima Canutt, including pulling Ruby into his horse as he rides, jumping in "renegades" and tapping them out of the horses, the horse jumps off the shore of the lake and even slips down " Lucky Texan's (1934) lysis sequence, although this time Mighty Yak uses a bark instead of a surfing log, and its inclusion is illogical this time as they are in the desert. <br /> <br /> The highest point is clearly John Wayne's well-photographed and methodologically well-photographed walk through the desert, stumbling upon Zanth with those fantastic Red Rock Canyon basalt fish hidden behind countless series, west coasts and science fiction. No final weapon in the duel at fifty steps, when the hero runs the bar from the wooden steps to conquer the movie to receive and kiss the hero! When John Wayne finally catches him, Zanti drinks poisoned water from the waterbath and dies. After too many chasing sequences, Zantai's gang is finally caught in the Dusty's cabin, a one-by-one rotating cabinet that probably leads to a canyon that is now dynamically blocked. No sunset or kiss a girl: The last blow is Ruby, now pr. John Tobin, by phone from now on to Sheriff John Tobin, "What would Sheriff Tobin have at dinner?" The film also has poor lighting and editing at the beginning, the pace is slow, some sheriff parts cause it to be dragged and the horse ride fills the movie. So, despite the different and unusual elements, it's one of the weakest Lone Stars.
