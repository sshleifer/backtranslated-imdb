I saw this movie at the 2005 Edinburgh International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This movie was compared to the EIFF program by Sideways, which I liked - so I was looking forward to this movie. I also liked the garden country, the Napoleon dynamite, and so on. So I've had some recent experience with some weird American indy movies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found that Puffy Tool does not compare any of these films. <br /> <br /> I sat for 35 minutes, waiting for something amusing, witty, incomprehensible or even lightly interesting. It wasn't - and the shaking video camera made me sick - so I left. <br /> <br /> This is just another movie I ever went out of (the first was Showgirls), which is a little disappointing. I would probably have lasted this duration if it hadn't been a nasty effect of a strange picture - but in the first 35 minutes I didn't get the impression that I was missing something. <br /> <br /> Fraud.
