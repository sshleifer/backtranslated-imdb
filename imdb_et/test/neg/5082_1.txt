To be honest, I am surprised that this film is getting pretty good. I am absolutely honest and say that the only reason I even went through it is because of Ryan Phillippe and not for reasons that are particularly related to his ability as an actor, although I think he has proved himself to be a better actor in recent years his first major roles in the late 1990s. <br /> <br /> As for action / mid-term reviews, this film fails in almost every respect. I will show that acting is OK, but the script is totally terrible and with little sense what the filmmakers are trying to hide, adding absurd references to the chaos theory, as if it would convince someone that the movie is actually smart - but again, based on some estimates. let yourself be deceived: the script is boring, the derived confusion and no other element of the movie fixes it. Wesley Snipes has probably never had a less interesting role in the movie, and Statham is a dull actor. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
