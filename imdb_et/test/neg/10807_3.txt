Now I looked at it when it first appeared in VHS, and all my friends, and I thought it was a pretty good movie, but then again we were teenagers. But to be honest, not so good afterwards. A sort of hair metal, Dokken's version of the Carnival of the Souls. But a bad movie doesn't exactly mean it's invisible; nevertheless, it does not seem to have the charm that is usually contained in the usual Mst3k feed. But if it was a cable and I was bored and drinking beer - I'd look at it again. But then again, I've looked at Howling VII about five times, so maybe you shouldn't listen to me. <br /> <br /> Anyone else thinks it's sad that the director allegedly made his own comment on Film? And why did he urge the cap to use so much?
