This is more than just a Bond customization: it's normal hanging! With medium-sized drawings that Ian Fleming would not have approved, this film falls into the worst 007 movie. Elder (even haggard) Connery is trying to restore her in the last 12 years. The result is a classic hero with no humor, sticky version. Give me Roger Moore every day!
