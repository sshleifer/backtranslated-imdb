Geologist realizes that a big earthquake is coming, but nobody listens. Worse still, his father's right to predict the 1923 Tokyo disaster and has been called his worthy successor. Of course it will be big and Tokyo will be knocked on the apartment. <br /> <br /> A poorly dubbed Japanese film that is a pure soap opera in the first half. In the second half of the earthquake, the city of the model destroys its escape drama. There are some nice moments, but the film destroys them either by undermining miniature activities or by unrealistic people. Hokey and not very good that you have an end you don't believe ...
