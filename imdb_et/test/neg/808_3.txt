As a South African resident in South Africa after 32 years in the UK, I am sorry to say that this film is a great disappointment. The three main problems I had were: a) why Swank and Ejiofor - America and Nigeria - were playing. This country breaks off its talent and does not need import ... b) Gillian Slovo has been trading for years for years. He is a very mediocre writer, and even his novel does not stand up to Mr Hooper's smooth direction ... and (c) Hilary Swank again, as a great actor as the Million Dollar Baby (but it is also Eastwood), dressed in a contemporary New York style, while moving freely around Karoo poverty. Where was the reward and sensitivity that the client and director needed? Yes, the movie is finally moving - how would it be? - But the overall mood conclusion is one huge backlog. The heart is in the right place but needs a pace maker.
