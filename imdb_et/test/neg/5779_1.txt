You saw it yesterday in Sneak's preview and you have to say it was terrible. After the credit, I thought, "Hey, this pain is probably pretty good." It didn't change at all. <br /> <br /> Lame's predictable worshipers, terribly drawn characters (maybe with the exception of the little Ms. Lara's) and the end could see a 10-minute movie. And worst of all, it used a badly sensitive topic (people with disabilities) to low levels and mostly delicious jokes without ever touching anything beyond the surface of the problem. The person with the disability most familiar with the film is the one who simply kicks it. What message is that? And the film has no idea that it ends, it is basically the following: "I love you, it doesn't matter if you acted punctured." <br /> <br /> In summary: An amazing amount that has to be terribly boring to register terribly.
