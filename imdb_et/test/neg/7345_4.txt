The story will soon be lacking in the faithful business priest Daniel Clemens (Christian Slater), who will look closely at the case of suspicion of another priest. The priest denies that he is guilty, but at the same time he is not in a position to discuss this matter for reasons of confidentiality. Enter Daniel Clemens, who starts playing the police ... <br /> <br /> Although the plot is not ridiculous, everything is different. Let's start from the visual side, cinematography is boring, it looks more like a TV series than a movie. The corners of the camera are boring; There are no interesting close-ups that reveal details. And the transitions of the scene, well, there is not much to say about them, they are not smooth at all, it seems that there is no connection between the scenes as the actual plot. Okay, they used the transition between the two scenes of music, but there are no interesting visual transitions in the film, the dissolution of times was used, there was no visual link between the scenes. <br /> <br /> A boring visual part can be forgiven if the film offers something else. Unfortunately, the movie only offers forced wood and clumsy dialogue without punching. In addition, the film suffers from sound problems, the volume is reduced several times in the film, as if the microphones were too far away. <br /> <br /> I didn't predict a movie solution. This may be because the film did not give me a chance or it could be thanks to a presentation that was so boring that I never tried to figure it out. <br /> <br /> Put two plus two together and this equals B movie, where B stands for boredom.
