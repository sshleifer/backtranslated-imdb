I just can't get these comments! I can't think they're written with a sort of LOG fan who would worship something they ever do, no doubt whether it's really good. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of the program, but I thought this movie was a futile project. I can forgive a ridiculous plot when I came out of the cinema when I laughed more than twice. At one point I thought it might just be me before I realized that I didn't laugh at the other audience. <br /> <br /> I did not expect a large part of the plot (very few television comedies are facing over 90 minutes), but I thought a couple of classical LOG dialogues or visual jokes (like at the beginning of each program) would be a bit of a movie. After 5 minutes of the 17th century plot I was begging for it to end (a little I know it will continue for the rest of the movie). It just wasn't funny. <br /> <br /> I was just massively disappointed and I don't see history being too kind to it, even if some deadly fan writes enthusiastic comments.
