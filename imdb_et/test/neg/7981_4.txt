I was recently at this stage. And on the last day of the race, I was glad to see that it was playing on TV. I stuck in the tape the way it was late at night, and I looked at it the next day. I have to say I was very disappointed. The participants in the film did little in the script. This is understandable because the migration process is likely to be different, but it was disruptive. A lot of the original scripts were also changed for the movie to make it look better, but I'm not sure if it helped the movie at all. I gave it 4 stars only because I feel the script and writing is much better than what this film represents.
