It would be like an editor and scriptwriter with only 40 minutes of actual working time. It should be a remake of a Chinese film that is obviously much better than the trash. It is clear that some meaningless Hollywood suit or writer decided that this film would be my a man, a man against a human being, rather than having to play the story for the first time in the 40-minute characters. At this point in the film, the characters are not just ordinary people and not even their own personalities. That makes little sense. It is quite clear why this film flop. It's not at all credible and it's too bad - it started with a promise. Don't be fooled.
