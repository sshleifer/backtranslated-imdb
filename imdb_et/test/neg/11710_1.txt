This film makes the facts of Anne and Mary life something that cannot be recognized. That Mary Boleyn, who was actually a rather dim and silly creature, to do and make her a "good" sister, is just silly. This is Anne, who was actually a much more interesting character, so she is often told about her life, not Mary. <br /> <br /> In response to a previous review, I can't see how Anne's life was so "criminal" ... it's Henry, who was a real criminal. No matter what Anne's motives for winning the king and covering her affection to become a crown and husband, it must be taken into account when these real events took place. Anne was a relatively innocent figure compared to most of her owners. Most modern historians discriminate or have lost most of the myths and libel about this film, and I have never heard anyone who believes in rumors when he's tall with his brother. This film is so sensational and wrong that it is crazy to think that someone without knowing its history could walk away, believing that this film is a "fact". <br /> <br /> I couldn't even get into the strange filming of the movie, but I'm pretty sure the cameras didn't find it in the 16th century, so I don't understand why Anne and Mary are talking through one movie ... is really a bad plot and it is jarring and annoying, to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> For thousands of days, Anne is not accurate, but is more fun and at least closer to telling one of the most intriguing women. Don't even think about renting it. It's two hours you never get back!
