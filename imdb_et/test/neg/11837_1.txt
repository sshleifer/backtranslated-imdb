I understand that Roger Corman loves to do cheap things, but it's just sad. I bought this flick from my local video store in the dollar trash not six months after I watched the original Carnosaur. I was blown away; It was the same fucking movie, but some of Corbin Bernese! It reminded me of all the 80's ninja movies that took the old Kung Fu films and stapled the white ninjas running with a finger covering with the word "ninja" on the headline (if you haven't seen them, see "Ninja Terminator", "The Thundering Ninja, Black Dragon and Ninja Warriors. Thanks to Roger Corman; you just made me waste a dollar.
