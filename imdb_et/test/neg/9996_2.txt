It is one cruel, inert, important in itself. If the only thing that suddenly gives life to life is hanging, you know that it is a botched. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Truman Capotet as a narcissistic, religious, self-conscious, cartoon, insect caricature. Why he never explained this way and we get a little background information. The script focuses on Capote's In In Cold Blood and his affirmation of the injured brothers who murdered four families. The acclaimed writer "To Kill A Mockingbird," Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), accompanies Capoten in her initial investigation into crimes, and her presence immediately refers to a more interesting topic for biopsy. Unfortunately, Lee has quickly left aside Capote's endless scenes that put his painful existence. Watching her is like seeing Dr. Smith in "Lost in Space" complaining about her "gentle back" to anyone listening for two hours. However, the difference is that Smith was fun to see if Capote was not. The film's valuable self-importance kills this, as is the reluctance of director Bennett Miller to add some shade. Like a piano of fear, the film has one note that does not offer contrast, emotional color, or intimate drama. If Capote was really irritating, why make him a movie and wait for viewers to watch it? Although supportive roles have been well done (Chris Cooper is his usual self-evident self), they serve so little dramatic purpose, because ultimately it is all about Capote (!), Director Bennett and screenwriter Dan Futterman are not emotionally aware of their target group because they were Capote's "legend" cultural bag is clearly overrated. Their product is a dead-born Oscar feed ... and this is more evidence that one big genre picture is more of a "truth" than a dozen piles, as it is.
