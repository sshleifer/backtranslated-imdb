The trip here is to look for God, a great boy in the sky, a big cheese with a beard. Cunningly concealed as the supreme thirst for knowledge. The takeover of Leonard Nimoy on the board is himself Shat, Captain Tiberius William Shatner Kirk. In an attempt to mix a series of fun bright aspects with sci-fi histrionics (really a? Klingon dialogue consultant?), On Shatner and his co-authors have achieved only a parody of an almost embarrassing parody. Where's the danger? where are the brothers in the spirit of the gun,? in fact, where is our poorly secured team? Star Trek's humor is a great thing when it comes to the right places and is done with a straight lace that fits the way Frontier ends. There are some light moments, but they do not compensate for the lack of serious moments. Although we really need another Spock revelation,? really? <br /> <br /> Some nice outfits and little deliberate trek moments aside, The Final Frontier is just a bad movie experience. 3/10
