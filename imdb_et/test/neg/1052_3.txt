Physical evidence is one of the films you want, but it really should be much better than actually. It has been developed as a continuation of Glenn Close and Robert Loggia Jagged Edge, which gives the impression that everyone involved did it only when they were expecting something to come better. The assumption is perfectly functional, it is mostly technically effective, how amazingly even the musical score of Henry Mancin is, but you cannot feel that things would have been better if one of the leaders had turned out to be a killer (as was originally announced in the case). Because his little-known, personally catastrophic Heat (1986) was launched, Reynolds has all the awesome screen villain. As it is, there are few surprises and feelings that filming movies is numbered, because it creates the head of the interna- tion because it rebels less than a big will-do? Reynolds is good for driving through charisma, which is clearly a stellar vehicle. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Theresa Russell. An impressive and fearless actress, Nic Roegi's films, allowing her to get into the darker side of human nature, are trapped in a part that requires quality rather than depth, and is not a pot. He does not spin his lines or strike at other actors, but it is all that can be said about his amazingly stylish and often amateur performance that makes the film badly down. In addition to Ned Beatty's prosecutor, supportive casting in Boston just adds a bit of a surreal presence, where everyone seems to have a hidden Canadian accent, and the streets bear amazing resemblance to Toronto and Montreal. Michael Crichton, who at Westworld, Comas, and the first big train robbery, showed that he knew how to listen to the audience at the edge of his seats, seems to be dealing with the activity in a purely insecure way - indeed, one of the short chases does not even fit and seems almost arbitrarily collapsed. The climax has no elegance and is completely at risk or dangerous, and many scenes are played much less than they are worth. Not surprisingly, Crichton has not been since the 13th Warrior also has unauthorized recharges since. <br /> <br /> It's traceable enough in the 80's TV movie, even if it never promises to open it. Is this a good reason to see that it is an individual taste.
