Wait until you look at it .... I mean even after reading this review. No other film until the date has breastfeeded more than one. One thing I do not understand is that if you hang on an English-speaking flick, why add your creativity? For the amount spent on making this film, the producers would have had to consider "Cellular" purchase rights, which are duplicated as a price, and released the film. They could get some profit in this way. If it were possible to rate this movie with 0, I would have done it and the most pathetic performances come from Tanushree Datt and the girl who played sidekick Aftab. I don't know if my problem is that I've seen Cellular much earlier than this movie ..... but it can't be a reason to support this movie ... I could work for hours, but I don't have time to talk about the nonsense of the movie about what I don't want to remember about these terrible scenes from the movie ..... <br /> <br /> please stay away from this flick.
