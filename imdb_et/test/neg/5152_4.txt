The bride's story is fun and interesting and, according to the filmmaker's credit, she depicts depicting the rural areas of Minnesota with the same respect that is usually reserved for coastal areas. Yet it is strange to find an independent film, one's brain brain, that is as ambitious and clich√©-driven as the Commission's Hollywood potboiler. <br /> <br /> The portrait of rural people is meant I don't think these symbols like me - I have had a little meal in the small towns' eateries, but never heard about the benefits of different 19th century English novels. It can be assumed that the writer / director Semans no longer has the experience of rural culture as Coen's brothers and much less satire.
