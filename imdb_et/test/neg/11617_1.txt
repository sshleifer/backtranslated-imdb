Wow! I'm really sorry for seeing this picture ... Funny, I just accepted it for my wife, who suffered from torture for about half an hour before retiring when I stayed in front of the television, but only masochistic in me and me because I wanted to know whether this movie was so bad in its entirety, or if there were some redeemable aspects that could alleviate the feeling that I had this status called two girls and a guy ... <br /> <br /> All in this picture is wrong, totally wrong ... from the original, absurd assumption that two women are stupid enough to stay with their common boy, until terrible, but merciful, Finally, not forgetting the terrible action of three participants ... Do not believe in rumors, junkie behavior is bad and I can't see how Graham is under the name of the film industry ... <br /> <br /> I don't know why, after manufacturers have saved some bucks for only three players and the only one they hired to write a person script instead of putting the monkey on their own *** ... <br /> <br /> At least I felt a bit good when I destroyed the DVD and threw it into the trash ... Anyway, I liked it somehow (and just a little bit) brunette actress Natasha nothing but it wasn't enough to win a face-off (face alteration) with an incredibly stupid and crazy assumption so two girls and a boy are going down .. <br /> <br /> Stay away from it ****!
