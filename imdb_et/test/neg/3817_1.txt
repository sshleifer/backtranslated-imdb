Whether it's just me or all the "horror movies" have become something other than titties, slapstick and over the top chorus that can't be killed. this movie didn't make sense. what happened to the days when a man got away from the killer like a hostel. and at least makes the killer more realistic. Victor Crowley was the worst killer I've ever seen. he reminded me of a demon that weaves between the quasimodo and the skin surface. it was more than that when the winner was under fire, no one had to stop working. and the end was the biggest disappointment to remember the entire soprano final. I had to agree with me when he blurred ... WHAT F F! if I could give the film a negative result, I would have taken care of it.
