This exhibition, Paranormal State, has a "Blairwitch Project" for it. As well, you look at a documentary that is actually just a scripted movie that is made to look and feel like a documentary. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with the exhibition is to "go" outside the advisors Warren, who were famous for "investigating" Amityville's murders, which were completely fraudulent, just based on a police report of family deaths! (as the oldest daughter is actually all about the thing, so it can even help some deaths!) Then it's the way they constantly jump for the demons for everything. Not to mention when a dirty group speaks in which cases they take. They don't want to help those who need it the most, they just want strange things that give them the greatest press and attention. <br /> <br /> They are complete scams, simple and simple.
