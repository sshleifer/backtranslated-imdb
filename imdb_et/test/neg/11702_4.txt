This is another film I left on Italian television as a child: a remarkable quintet of stars of aging, most of which never had a fear film in their lives (Fred Astaire, Melvyn Douglas, Douglas Fairbanks Jr, John Houseman and Patricia Neal) long-term hidden crime that returns to them again. This is a ghostly ring for the girl they all loved (Alice Krige), but for whom they were forced after an unhappy incident when she lowered her ego! Fairbanks, who was responsible for the act, has two sons (Craig Wasson) and Krige is also giving them revenge. Soon one of the latter died, Fairbanks himself and even Douglas and Houseman. Consequently, the rest of Wasson and Astaire decide to meet a crime where they also have to fight a couple of indigenous trampolines, which in some way make Krige's offer! I was looking forward to seeing these veterans on their last legs (Douglas died before the film was even premiere, although by that time he had already played another role, while it proved Astaire's own failed swan song), but GHOST STORY went through many mood changes - while maintaining slow paced and becoming more favorable to be something other than a failed curio. Sexual words (including Wassoni's full-length nudity!) And the terrible makeup effects were further aggravated by the waters and destroyed the old-fashioned elegance inherent in Jack Cardiff's (second notable long-term) cinematography.
