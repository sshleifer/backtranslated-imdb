It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen! An international - Australian-pretended British, Stage-American and English-speaking character with an unknown "European" accent is cast. What satisfying efforts for this rapping team are completely damaged by the plot and the special failure script. The budgetary costs of this film were so short and the value of the total production was so small that it would not have any problem with winning a cinematic competition. Over the past twenty years we have seen extraordinary (though not necessarily "high") quality horror films and stalk'n slash thrillers that have not been made at all. The latest examples include a badly made but completely frightening "Blair Witch Project" and, of course, the last one - a small budget winner, SAW, with virtually unknown leaders (Gary Elwes is just someone you can't even remember) even before). DARKHUNTERS is shocking to find a well-known character designer, Dominique Pinon, and Hollywood is Jeff Fahey, who lives to save the movie. It is embarrassing to see that once a beautiful leading man (Fahey) is a funny make-up, giving the peculiarities of bad lines. I would have appreciated this movie out of 10 out of 10 that would have been possible!
