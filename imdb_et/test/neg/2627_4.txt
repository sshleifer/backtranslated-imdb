It was a very good show. I liked real-time construction and setbacks, seeing again the old miners' meeting and reminding my prisoners of fear at Changi POW Camp. The main problem with writing an exhibition is that Changi's life scenes are more like camps than a place to be. I'm old enough to remember movies about men who were released from Changi and other Japanese military camps. No actor can lose enough weight to be similar to their men. They made the Belsen Jews sumo wrestlers. I've met several Chang veterans over the years. Many will never ride in a Japanese car, let alone its own. Physical and spiritual torture for the men who suffered was too terrible to even speak. What percentage remained? John Doyle can write comedy for "Roy and HG" (I hate it too), but it's a serious sugar-coated history that would never be allowed. I'm happy that the satirists are writing "Brian's life" and amuseing the crucifixion, because it is probably comedy, even if some find it bad. "Changi" is written as a real event image and can be considered a real record by younger people. High performances of fine pain cannot redeem this light scenario.
