To enjoy the "imaginary portrait of Fur-Diane Arbus," Stephen Shainberg needs a viewer to stop the reality and knowledge of an American photographer, Diane Arbus. Paradoxically, this is the use of Diane Arbus's name and knowledge in his life and work, which makes this film a great failure. <br /> <br /> The early appearance of beautiful WASPish and glamorous Nicole Kidman as anti-glamorous Jew, Diane Arbus, is that Shainberg did not get Arbus or his work (unpleasant realism) and seems to have only superficially attracted Arbus to his circus photos. Next is a kind of beautiful and trivial beauty and a biopsy of beast fantasy with Robert Downey JR as Kidman's hairy fancy love interest. But the main mistake of this film is not the banality of this story, but the director's misogeological attitude that Diane Arbus, one of the world's single and most original female photographers, was unable to shape his ideas. When his previous film "Secretary" was a female Masochism study, his ongoing female as a submissive film completely violates this film - and in real life, the number of outsiders in the hidden world often flies because of Diane Arbus' courage, endurance and fearlessness. <br /> <br /> Imagine an imaginary biopsy in pop star Madonna's life with Guy Richie on her Svengal, her career-backed man and you can feel how seriously a flawed and imaginary film is: it can only work if You don't have any substance information, or just choose to ignore all the facts. <br /> <br /> This is a disgrace, because if you remove all references to Diane Arbus, this movie may have independently set an interesting study of fetishism and a good companion to the check. 4/10
