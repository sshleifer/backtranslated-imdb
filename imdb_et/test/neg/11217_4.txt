This is the first porn I've ever tried. This requires a different approach than usual because allegory does not pay for the dissection. "I'm American. I'm a proud virgin." "We are Europeans. We are cultured and sexually abusive." "It's nice if we all screw each other up." Much to talk about! Well, there really is something about your average 60s topless volleyball. And the "class" delightful patina provides at least pure and detailed compositions. But what the hell is that to say porn? OK, then: the only scene that I really (rhetorically) went to was the first time Brigitte Maier came in. Trying to loosen a nice race and age while letting two men close together; one black boy carries a premature editorial coitus interruptus. And with multiple shots or not, one of the perhaps inexplicable-on-IMDb act looks like it was partially simulated with a surgical hose. But I stayed awake and it was eight in the morning ... but what does the last shot mean?
