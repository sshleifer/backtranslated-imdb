<br /> <br /> This movie doesn't really have anything. With the admirer playing Phillip Seymour Hoffman complained about his constipation and other toilet humor in the 2.5 hour movie, you know they didn't make cuts at all and left the mess in the true sense. It is a waste of good talent and complete torment. Terrible! <br /> <br />
