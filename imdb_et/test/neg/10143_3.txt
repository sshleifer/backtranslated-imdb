Does anyone think that "Reba" is basically a "Roseanne" ripoff? Just look at the characters from these two families: Connors (Roseanne) and Harts (Reba); Elder blonde bitch (Becky Connor and Cheyenne Hart) married to moor (Mark Healy and Van Montgomery), sarcastic brunette younger daughter (Darlene Connor and Kyra Hart), little brother (DJ Connor and Jake Hart), and exotic relative ( Jackie Connor and Barbara-Jean Booker Hart). And then, of course, the biggest similarity is Reba Hart and Roseanne Connor. "Reba" tried to copy the mother of the sarcastic and tough-love style, giving her the same loving qualities as Roseanne. Or maybe they * made love too, because Reba Hart seems to be in a mix of diversity and intimidation (so Van's line with her husband Cheyenne "I'm not afraid of you, I'm afraid of your mother!") And sweet and caring with a slight transition. Roseanne managed, at least, to be overwhelmed that she was kind because she was always meaningful and sarcastic and when she tried to open it she was hard. Because Reba's character is inconsistent, it is hard to believe. <br /> <br /> But even if the characters "Roseanne" are not completely canceled, nothing would be an example of a plot parameter. Writers try to show the substance, but they can't really make fun of jokes long enough to give them any effect. And it would be better to believe that jokes are horns; it would be like they were written by a twelve-year-old who thinks the joke is fun. Sometimes they come up with something that is funny (I don't pretend I didn't laugh at some episodes). These gems are too little and far away to make "Reba" witty. In general, "Reba" is a very mediocre exhibit with obvious "Roseanne", right-wing plots and sub-sub-parma humor and (and let's be honest) terrible actors. The exhibition can actually be a little better if they replace all the actors, especially Reba himself, who is the quality of community theater as prime-time sitcom quality. <br /> <br /> I give it to 3 out of 10 to be honest with the good jokes that do.
