This movie is a terrible attempt at fraud. Its events for the parody of various sports films have been baked and are not at all funny. <br /> <br /> Even things that should be funny - like an Indian female kicker who always wear her uniform is not very funny. Also, the fact that the football team is studying and receiving good grades, which makes the coach crazy, did not laugh. <br /> <br /> The plot of a traditional loser gets another chance by losing the loser high school football. the team really had the potential to attack. This is a classic sports theme. But, unfortunately, the manual was too weak to pull it out. And this casting is no exception. <br /> <br /> Bikinis and underwear are free for women, so it's not bad in this regard. <br /> <br /> Animal House or Talladega Nights, it's not.
