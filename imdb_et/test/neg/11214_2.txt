This review includes SPOILER --- <br /> <br /> Film is an American ninja who has been mysteriously trained in martial arts. He falls to the daughter of the colonel and at the end of the film turns to the hottest caf√© on the post "Hero of the People". This movie is extremely cheesy and very badly researched. This is good for people who don't care about land development or reality. Good for children under 14 years. Military errors in this movie are comic. I remember that during my three-year army, we had no obligation for private people to greet or call the NCO "Sir", this film takes place in different places. Colonial hair is too long on the ears. The master Sergist's mustache was for a long time against a military protocol. The post was the only officer on the post. No other officer had walked around the post. You had an idiotic ninja that branded a sword with m-16 against soldiers, rather badly done. <br /> <br /> People filmed it. Michael Dudikoff is not really so bad an actor that he just has bad scripts. Ninjas were more fun than dangerous. Avoid this movie
