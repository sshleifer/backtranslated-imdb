Here is another great love for film critics. The problem is that it is not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The film's premise is simple. After a decade, nine convicts flee from the prison and talk to those in treasure. fantasy and melancholy. <br /> <br /> Both sides just don't mix. Individual scenes work very well (boys who fall with friends who have a new Filipino bride are having fun. If a later scene with a big guy working in a restaurant pulls their hearts.) Br /> <br /> The film also lacks all the settings. One scene shows boys who are in dire need of changing the abandoned vending machine to buy a snack. The next scene has a whole team sitting in the restaurant. Where did they get dresses and wigs? (The team includes both a big man and a dwarf) How did they get all the clothes and money to buy food? And the most puzzling thing is why are they pulled? They are probably boys and face to face, that witnesses are more memorable than a big boy and a dwarf who eats a woman dressed? I mention a big guy and a dwarf, because in addition to the old guy, it seems that everyone else is mixing. (In fact, they are wearing white combinations during most of the film). The film has very little character in the first half and as a result there is no emotional punch on the other side. As we often try to find out who are their individual payout scenarios. film. It is also amazingly slow, making a boring movie. 9 The souls are a great disappointment, the reviews hasten a great movie, and it's somewhere, lucky to find it.
