I didn't see this movie when it originally came out, but there have been a few songs that share the title and the term is used from time to time, and I thought there should be something for the flick so I dug it up and gave an overview. Now I would like the approximate hour and forty-five minutes back from my life (it seemed much longer). There was nothing particularly bad about the film, the actor was good, the trees on the big parcels, of course there were not many holes where there would be holes. There wasn't much in the movie. There was chemistry between the two, but there was nothing convincing about their relationship; Nothing interesting about their story. Ultimately, when he tries to drive a train to catch his fleeing romance, my wife didn't want to catch her. We honestly thought they were better with each other and when they came back together, we really don't care. So, what this love story says, if even a 25-year-old cute romantic way, like my wife, had no emotional investment in the relationship. I should have left it in the "missed" category. <br /> <br /> Logan Lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html
