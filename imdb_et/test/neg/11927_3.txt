The MTV sci-fi animated series "Flon Flux" highlights Charlize Theron, who plays the character of the title, a fighter for freedom, fighting with the oppression of the city of Bregna for 400,000 years in the future. For his last mission, he has been sent to the city to kill Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), but he discovers the secrets along the way. <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux is a good premise, mediocre performance. An interesting story, but the film was a bit boring. Many people say it is one of the worst films of the year and it is not at all true. This can be a disappointing movie, but it is the best movie. I've never seen a movie comic so I can't compare the two. This is probably better because they have the opportunity to explain the story more. The film is not that confusing, but it is easy to get lost if you are not familiar with the material. Action was fine, something special. Charlize Theron gives a good result and seems to be dedicated to the film. The rest of the cast will also perform well, including Jonny Lee Miller, Frances McDormand and Marton Csokas. There are more than a couple of interesting characters in the movie, including Sithandra, Aeon's friend. <br /> <br /> The problem with Aeon Flux is that he takes himself too seriously. It carries the same serious tone throughout the film and becomes a bit tiring. There is no humor and the film gets a little boring at times. This is the same problem as Elektra. As the film is so serious, the dialogue seems to be tough and serious scenes are forced. Active scenes are pretty good, but that's not what the film really does, so don't just wait for an action movie. The end result is not clean, but it is still a nice ending and better than the other thrillers that came out last year (hide and search). Costumes are a bit strange but still look nice and interesting. Visuals are also well done, so the film looks at least nice. So the film can be a style. It is interesting to watch, but your attention may not be long. Finally, this is not the best movie, but it can be a decent rental. Rating 4/10
