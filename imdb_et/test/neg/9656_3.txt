I see what this movie was going to do. Unfortunately, this thing has never come to an end. The "Reality Crime" aspect works well and the shots are the first. In fact, quite a few scenes are incredibly memorable. It is noteworthy that the detective silhouette speaks to the beaten woman, the scene of the garbage detective, and the father who binds flies. Sometimes there are too many dialogs too many. Instead of showing the viewer, the writer treats it too much as a book. But the real problem is editing. The story doesn't flow. It does not outweigh the sum of the parts. Finally, you are confused about what is happening. Those who like such a detective film want to follow while cutting the puzzle that leaders are doing. Such bad editing makes it difficult or even almost impossible to do.
