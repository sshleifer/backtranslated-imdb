The film opens with a cult leader who catches the resurrected dead member with his followers who sing for the rebirth as the sun in the desert. Reanhauer (Bill Roy) faithfully believes in his power and works so well that he falls into a heart attack. Cannot keep him alive, all involved, doctors and nurses, are attacked with the demonic spirit of Reanhauer, who invades his sister Sherri's curvy body (.. -chested-chested Jill Jacobson), who directs everyone as a means of revenge. Forced against him, without remembering to cause such damage, Sherri's host body murders selected victims. Fortunately, Sherri's co-professor, sister Tara (Marilyn Joi), a blinded patient, Marcus Washington (Prentiss Molden), a pretty important footballer, is a pretty flourishing romance whose mother was a voodoo practitioner. Through Mars' knowledge that came from her mother, Tara explains her possession and how to save Sherri before she murders everyone unknowingly. Meanwhile, Sherri's lover, Dr. Peter Desmond (Geoffrey Land) for his present condition and well-being. <br /> <br /> Well, this was my first Al-Adamson movie and I have to agree with my detractors that it's just Movie alone that it seems to hold them with clips and Elmer's glue. The animation with which we see how the spirit controls the Sherri is terrible and rather ridiculous. A little soft core nonsense as a filler, some demonic possession is thrown into the mix (Sherri speaks with another voice as he is), naughty nursing behavior. -spirited) and little violence / gore. The film is essentially in tiny rooms with a boring dialogue. Sexual situations are not such that the hard core and Al often shoot them without exposing them to much. The film seems embarrassingly cheap and there is no excitement, though the cooling score (.. which sounds like Dark Shadows) helps a bit. Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass (.. as Sister Beth, who seems to be a nymphomania when she even screws a nutshell patient, always complaining about illnesses that she does not have, with enough chest to proclaim neanderthal to her) bad eyesight and the story of Adamson, though is weak, is somewhat coherent (.. it seems that he rarely manages movies). In general, the movie looks like it costs $ 5 and Adamson just can't overcome the budget constraints (.. or I think it would create an unpleasant atmosphere, because sometimes there are narrative and annoying scenes that make the story a little). John F Goff has the role of a hospital psychiatrist who wants to put Sherri in, without believing that he was in possession, he stays over Peter constantly. I looked at the invaluable "lost" version, which I think it is a real version of sister Sherri's viewing.
