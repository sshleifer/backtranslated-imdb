It was one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen. I am at the end of the 40s and watched it with my son (early 20s) and son (17). The landscape was beautiful, but the story was bust. We looked around for an hour and turned it off. I spent more time on my iPhone during the hour we watched it as actually watching the movie. I gave her 3 because I enjoyed the landscape and cinematography; Otherwise I would have given him 1. I am sure there are people who are really "art" who find my review terribly, but we have every right to our opinions, right? I couldn't figure out if it was to be a "chick flick" that focused on the mother, or if it was supposed to be a movie for boys, focusing on battle and adventure. In my opinion, this was not the case either.
