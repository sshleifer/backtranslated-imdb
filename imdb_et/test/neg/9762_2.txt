I've always wanted to see the movie because I loved the novel, but was warned because I heard the film was smelly. It is. Fowles wrote the script and I can follow it well despite the fact that I read the novel thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is filling - beating, beating, and completely inappropriate - breaking all attempts in the movie into a mystery or mood. I suspect that the director has to blame a lot, because even Michael Caine is terrible in this and he did a great job a few years earlier in ALFIE. <br /> <br /> The book is not well translated. I would like to see someone repeat it.
