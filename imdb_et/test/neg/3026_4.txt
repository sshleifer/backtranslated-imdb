Directed by E. Elias Merhige "Born" is an experiment that has some interesting ideas that can't be done successfully. The film is a 76-minute, very slow, pollingly effective and irritating experience that tries to present an intriguing philosophy of creating Earth and human nature. <br /> <br /> It opens up with a god presented as a psychopathic man with a chair who tears up his tummy. Mother, nature, blood, blood and human waste. He continues to impregnate the dead god with semen. Later he gives birth to the Son of the Earth. A slower who is constantly abused by a group of cannibalistic people whom I believe represent humanity. <br /> <br /> "Born" takes a twisted and disturbing look at the beginning of life. Demonstrate self-destructive nature, violence, lust and greed that have become a trademark for humanity. The film's problem comes from two points. One is that the movie is too slow at the show. What we get is good for thirty minutes to show how the Earth Son is constantly shaking the ground on the ground, while humanity has broken it and tortured it. Such a tasteless extension can be boring quite quickly and there is no impact image that gives the viewer a sense of shock. <br /> <br /> Another point is the visual appearance and sound of "Beggoten". Terrible, inverted, black and white low-frame cinematography fascinates the plot's distracting factor, but such innovations often only work in a short time. Then the effect will gradually be lost, as the audience gets used to its appearance. The sound is under the same problems. It is a constant recurring and similar sounds become so irritating that I had the requirement to turn off the volume. "Started" will lose soon after its start. He's trying to be original and creative, but he can't expand to the ideas that the vague plot suggests, but repeats the same scene over and over again. . Even if the plot is trying to move forward, the visual and the sound remain everywhere. Showing the same action in a slightly different way, just with a slightly different sound. The trick cannot make a movie alone. It also needs the pace and diversity that Merhige seems to have forgotten.
