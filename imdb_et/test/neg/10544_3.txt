The poisonous avenger, the supernaturally deformed super-human size and strength creature is back in the stage that usually gets everything wrong. Toxie goes to Japan to find her father at the suggestion of her psychiatrist, accompanied by an evil corporation who just wants the avenger to go to Tromaville in her absence. With new entrants to Toxie and his girlfriend, who have a different name in this sense, a lot less grim, much more comical tone and a plot line that can't hold the original candle. Even with a completely uncut version, only when you buy a Tox Box DVD kit is the only thing that goes for it. And if it happens to be forgotten at any other version, get any pleasure from it. The first one is a low-budget classic, but it's not just that. <br /> <br /> My Class: D + <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Erika Schickel has a very fast trick; Phoebe Legere goes topless; one wild goose gets completely naked; and some extras in the bathroom scene show different amounts of skin. <br /> <br /> Uncategorized Uncategorized DVD Extras by Director Tox Box: Director Lloyd Kaufman Intro and Comment; Another commentary by director Lloyd Kaufman, editors of Troma Gabriel Friedman and Brian McNulty; Toxie on Japanese TV; Interview with Michael Gingold, editor of Fangoria; Interview with Mike Mayo; the same fucking radius that is on EVERY Troma DVD; Lisa Gaye clip; "Toxie 15 Years Later"; 2 PSAs; Troma intelligence test; Troma Studio Building Tour; Lloyd Kaufman's autobiography ad; Stills Gallery; Theater trailer; and trailers: "toxic avenger", "toxic avenger 3", "def by temptation", "Nuke class class", "sgt.
