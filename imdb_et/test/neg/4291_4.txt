First, I must emphasize that Wendell Corey's role was extraordinary. Usually, Corey remained a supportive role, but here she helps to wear this very limp movie. Without him and the character he played, the film would have been much worse - hardly worth 2 or 3. So why did I hate the rest of the movie? Well, one of my pets is when the characters "live too stupid". You cannot rely on the basic plot points to assume that your main characters are completely stupid (unless of course brain damage). But that's exactly what happens in this movie. Wendell Corey is a crazy guy who has killed three innocent people and they know his next target is Joseph Cotten's wife. What are they doing then? Yes, they really offer inadequate police protection and a plan that doesn't make sense at all (there are no such far-fetched shotguns and shotguns that they probably won't stop this crazy). And if it's not bad enough, a marked woman runs inexplicably away from her hideout and walks directly to a possible place in WORST where she could be! Does anyone who is stupid?!?! Arrrggghhhh --- I hate movies with such fools. In fact, I found myself rooting for Corey because I felt the idiots deserve to die for their behavior! In addition to these clichés, there were also a few players. Of course, if you see that your husband shot MIGHT, someone can weaken, but in real life it is rare - people rarely worsen if there is no medical reason. So, combining it with the above-mentioned character problems is a real nightmare for people looking for realism - something Film Noir's movies must have. <br /> <br /> All these serious problems are even more acute as Wendell Corey's character is amazingly well written and designed. It was his chance to shine as an actor - too bad that the rest of the film was so weak that the idea of ​​Corey and the main pieces had sunk. This is one movie that could really use remake - but this time without meaningless signs.
