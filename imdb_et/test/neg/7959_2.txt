I'm a big fan of Deepa Mehta's work, especially Fire and Earth 1947. Unfortunately, this film does not contain _all_, which is necessary for a good movie. <br /> <br /> The film attempts to show the widows the difficult situation at the beginning of the 20th century in India and the new wave of rehabilitation at the same time. The child is shown as a widow of a central character, although from a Indian perspective it is too banal, but it would still be a very powerful film. Unfortunately! the film lacked both the sensitivity of fire and the intensity of emotions in 1947 on Earth. <br /> <br /> Even assuming the story has been given, though there are hundreds of things I would have liked to do, well, making a movie is particularly regrettable. Everything is said. Everything is shown directly. Absence of sensitive default sentences. Absolutely no lack of things. I just couldn't believe it was Deepa Mehta's movie. <br /> <br /> There were some very common Hindi movie characters - like an old widow with his own interests, or a father with double standards. highest quality. Can't write a script without these old-style Indian movie characters? Many people appreciated Deep for making a film and proving a point against Hindu fundamentalists. Well, I agree that he took a bold step, but shouldn't he worry about the quality of the film or is it in itself a controversial goal? It is obvious that when you start a story like in the water, you will feel the sorrow of the widows. And the film had nothing more than that! So when is Deepa's contribution to the film? <br /> <br /> Talk to an actor, etc. - pathetic !!! Lisa Ray has a beautiful face, a very beautiful face - but that's where it ends. He can't talk about prices; she can't emulate. John Abraham is no better. Most widows seem unnatural. Salvation Grace is Seema Biswas and a young girl. They are fabulous. <br /> <br /> And this was a time film, but Hindi dialogues take a lot of time. Even there, the pronunciation is as unnatural as it gets. No rustic accents !!! There are no local slangs. Nothing. The only thing that was right was probably the shooting areas. I thought the vidhwa ashram set was quite real. The overall blue tint of the entire film is also suitable. <br /> <br /> But not everyone and everyone is watching this movie. You don't get anything. The story or direction does not contain anything. If you have to look at it, look at this little girl's behavior.
