What a waste of great talents. It is a disgrace because Catherine Deneuve, Mathieu Amalric, Emmanuelle Devos, Chiara Mastroian and Melvil Poupaud (not to mention the less well-known America) have many actions to destroy talent. Arnaud Desplech's film was a terrible disappointment. After enjoying my "kings and queen" and this movie, I left me totally bored and deceived until I really left before the end of the movie. The film went around its center line (involving Catherine Deneuve's disease) to evade the peripheral line and supportive nature of each screen. The film gave us too little character development to understand why different characters didn't like each other so much (it was a story about family function), so the lack of a single narrative became even more critical. Finally, the soundtrack (which varied from hip hop to Bachin Mendelhson's Midsummer's Day) was at odds with the emotional temperature of the film and further concealed the emotions the viewer should have felt at that time. Photography (the director often started with scenes that had a mostly dark screen, where our only vision is through a small opening, changing the feeling that we look at the look that then expands) was also abusive and incomprehensible.
