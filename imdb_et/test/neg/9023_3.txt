While most of Wayne's B efforts are fun to entertain, this movie is so sloppy editable and written that it is dude. The first ten minutes alone show Wayne and bandits at night, where there is obviously a movie recorded during the day. Dwire plays half-white, half an Apache bandit with a heavy Mexican accent, and he doesn't seem to be pulling the nation off! I'll give it 3.
