I heard this movie was bad? They even warned me that it was terrible, but for some reason (probably Katie Holmes) I still looked at it when it came to national television. Watching Kevin Williamson's movies means torture! His scenarios are not funny, certainly not scary and not least creative. Teaching Mrs Tingle breathes the same irritating atmosphere as her meaningless series "Dawson's Creek", and it is probably meant for the same target group. Before the start of the credit, 5 people wanted to hug and they said they were terribly `I love you. It doesn't improve because the soundtrack is full of annoying pop / rock and the story is very thin. Three students on the verge of graduation will be cheated by the evil teacher at school. Every high school has such a teacher, you know? They're trying to convince Mrs Tingle that it wasn't their intention to deceive the skin, but this experiment is terrible. Typical high school humor has disappeared completely from me, overdose of sentiments is pathetic and acting (except Helen Mirren) is terrible. Am I sure Katie Holmes can work? has it proved his role as a "gift"? but he must quickly stop accepting the role of frumpy girls. As mentioned earlier, the only positive comment goes to Helen Mirren as a brilliant brilliant casting. It's like Kathleen Turner's "Serious Mother"! This role is great for her and you can't imagine someone else playing her. Moreover, this is a avoidable teen crap.
