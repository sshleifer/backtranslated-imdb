If I think Bollywood. I think lite is a good musical dance with excellent equipment for men and women. And memorable stories. Fear, Thrillers, Mystery, and Excitement, however, do not come to mind. And this is my western eye like abstract comedy. I think it would have been a better film, shorter even if the writer and director had made a definite choice. Have you gone directly to Thriller-Horror, Comedy-Mystery, Supernatural-Exciting or Musical-Romance instead of mixing them all. <br /> <br /> I have to say more than once when I thought the director must have seen "I know what you did last summer" and tried to give him a Bollywood twist. My first film was bride and prejudice. What I thought was working well. <br /> <br /> It seemed that the Western target group would consider the direct cheese festival. <br /> <br /> The actor was up, sometimes it seemed that they wanted to deliberately want a thriller of western thrillers, but when they saw them try dramatic crying, screaming or fear it seemed inappropriate. <br /> <br /> The observer was wondering when one of the actors would start with the camera. More than a few times, when the audience was to be scared, we could only overshadow the absurdity. <br /> <br /> I watch a lot of foreign movies, and although I don't know the price, I have to say that they did the job badly. Sometimes a white letter was difficult to read compared to a bright background. <br /> <br /> The trench was at least particularly amusing for me because she came with her mood with music. It was probably a surprising twist that seemed like a police officer. <br /> <br /> The lead pairs were pretty / pretty enough and the musical numbers made my rent worth. I would recommend it to someone as a music comedy, but I'd tell them they just move the rest of the movie, because it wasn't worth the reading effort. If you have decided to read a complete Hindi flick with subtitles, check out the top-notch romantic drama "Namasteay, London". <br /> <br /> But I wasn't scary ... if it's really what they think is terrible in India. 1 out of 10 for what it is trained. Of the 10 out of 10, there is an inadvertent speed and the ability to laugh a lot and this is a musical / dance number. Enjoy :)
