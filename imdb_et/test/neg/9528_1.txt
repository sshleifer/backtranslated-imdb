Lois Weber's film "Hypocrites" was and still is a very bold and bold film. I liked it and I was very impressed with the filming and the story. The priest sees the hypocrisy of people in his church and tries to show them the "naked" truth. People have been terrified of discovering the naked shape that represents the truth after it has not led them and the few who did it on their way. People do not want to face the truth that they are doing something wrong, but it shows them that they are putting things in front of God, going to beach nights, acting inappropriately, their materialistic ways, and other things in which the people of our world do it is not morally right. Finally, if he has no followers, he must enter the gates of heaven alone. This film seems to me to be very brave because it shows a naked woman, especially considering the period of making this film. The images and symbols depicted in this film were unbelievable. The way they went naked and symbolized a naked woman shows a lot of creativity and art. Showing people different sins when they walked along the way and refused along the way, each had different excuses, setbacks and / or higher priorities, was a great opportunity to represent the people of today. This film does a great job of getting a moral message to your audience. Lois Weber has a tremendous opportunity to capture the attention of his viewers with his creativity, symbolism, visuals and hearing. Even the piano music in the whole movie is very beautiful and fits the whole subject.
