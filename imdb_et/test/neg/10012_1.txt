This movie is absolutely terrible and terrible. It's not a small budget, it's not a budget movie that turns Ed Wood's movies into art. Action is abysmal, but kits and props are worse than I've ever seen. A conventional subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants, Woddy Strode has one month and fighting scenes are shot in unused gravel. Because of the 80's Italian video, you expect sadism. No talents were used to make this movie. And, for the sake of female love, there may be a great price - an Italian flavor. Even in the 80s Italian films, this movie is pretty terrible, but I think it came out when there were not so many movies available on video or the viewers were not really attentive. This jam does not have any entertaining value and is not even funny, just boring and very cheap. It's actually offensive to a stupid audience. I just don't know how the ground like an actor like Woody Strode got into such a turkey?
