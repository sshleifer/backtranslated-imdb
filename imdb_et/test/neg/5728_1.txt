I watched this movie or part of it in the hope that it would be fun to laugh, how bad it was, but soon it turned out that it was just silly. Because one of you is the worst acts ever! The leader of "actress" Birgitte Nielsen is terrible, intrusive and hardly attractive. And he certainly doesn't look like a female warrior who could easily defeat the kings of some veteran warriors, but he does it. And with a feminist attitude, it is normal hypocrisy. Because one of his family was killed by women, he joins some warrior school or something so he can learn how to fight with men. He then joined the fat servant and his child's king, whose city was destroyed by Gedren. These two characters are just fools and destroy the little atmosphere that the film managed to create. After that, I could no longer have the painful action of Nielsen and the foolish clich√©s and the lack of real action. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger as Kalidor was the only part of this movie that really made it remote. <br /> <br /> I liked Conan's movie, but it's a crap!
