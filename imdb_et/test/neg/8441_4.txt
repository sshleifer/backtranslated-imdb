Piranha begins as expected, stupid white people discover new lands and exploit them. I thought for a while that it could be a cannibal movie. It starts like many others, showing something that touches the untouched Amazon rainforests. I know it might be Florida. At this point, you think that animal distortion or natives will appear. Instead, you get William Smith who played L.A. He plays Caribe, a recognized hunter, whom I would describe as Jack Palance Light. He's in higher growth, but not quite good at Jack Palance. As for the natives, you really can't get that much. Where is Piranha? Should I even ask this question? Caribe now cools people, I think. He doesn't catch anyone until the end of the movie, but looks at them. Caribe rides a motorcycle with one tourist over dramatic Smokey and Bandit. The motorcycle challenge happens for no reason other than the operational phase. I can't tell you how many times I have seen a tourist challenge to a stranger in a motorcycle race. Never. Do they live, do they die? Do you care? Does anyone want to ride motorcycles? Caution: This film has a very dry look. My advice is to rent a Jack Palance classic class like Craze.
