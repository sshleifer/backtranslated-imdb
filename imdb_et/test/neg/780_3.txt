Oddly enough, I have very little to say about the box, so it's pretty short. I have never read Richard Matheson's short story "Button, Button" from which the film is based, but given what I saw in this "customization", such a legendary author's work could not be much similar. "The Box" is a family that discovers a strange contradiction on its doorstep with a button. Frank Langella appears and explains how, by pushing the button, they are given one million dollars - the only "catch" is that he kills someone, somewhere ...? SPOILER? They push it? This whole concept was intriguing in itself, but somehow they managed to extend the film to some of the complicated Stargate knocking until it pulled out until a pretty good finish with a pretty deep message. While I try to be as "fair" as possible, I still have to say that it wasn't my cup and it missed me seriously. I think it's the same director as "Donnie Darko", which I remember when I saw it years ago. "The Box" would have worked well as a short film, but since it was so lifeless, I can't recommend it.
