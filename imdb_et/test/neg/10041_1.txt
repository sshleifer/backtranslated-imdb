BELL WITCH HAUNTING (aka THE HAUNT) is an American horror film allegedly based on actual events that occurred between 1817 and 1821. <br /> <br /> It must not be confused with BELLY WITCH: MOVIE, a movie starring Betsy Palmer, on the same events. But I can say I wish I had seen the second movie instead of what I saw! I enjoyed Betsy Palmer's cooling on Friday the 13th. So I believe that, even on a bad day, he would draw a better result than someone who participated in the travesty known as THE HAUNT. <br /> <br /> My title is not painful to look at because my content is disturbing. It's painful to look, because it's just boring. <br /> <br /> Reading this movie's positive comments can only recognize three ways. The first option - these authors participated in the production in some way. The second option - authors who were not directly involved, received positive comments after the production stopped. The ultimate opportunity - none of these authors have seen enough fear films and are therefore inexperienced with the concepts used by successful experiments. <br /> <br /> The plot is set in Robertson County, Tennessee. James Johnston arrives with two journalists who want to hear Bell Witch's story. The story is about several setbacks. A series of supernatural events take place at the home of John Bell and his family. Soon it turns out that everything is a spirit. <br /> <br /> On the surface, the plot seems to be a normal poltergeist thing, although it is based on real events. <br /> <br /> Where to Fulfill The Stylish Concept Is Concerned, Almost everything that may go wrong will go wrong. And then some! <br /> <br /> First, acting. Operation is almost equally terrible across the board. This factor damages production most, damaging the viewer's potential faith or credibility of interests. The voice of a dear mind sounds like a teenage girl who experiences a teenager rather than a powerful demonic force that expresses malicious intent. I almost laughed when I heard some of his lines. Unfortunately, this voice began to irritate very quickly! I have not been alive in the 1800s, but I find it incredibly difficult to believe that every young woman who is alive at that time would speak in a way like this "ghost"! <br /> <br /> Second, direction. The direction is random and very uneven. Some scenes show promise, but the potential is clearly captured by an inexperienced driver. The camera does not do anything with sound or lighting to add intensity to a scary scene. The atmosphere is equally flat. The enchanting spirit is supposedly behind supernatural events. But the effects are so incredibly inaccurate that someone who has seen the right horror film would not buy them. I'll give you one example. In one scene, the spirit attacks someone. See the scene yourself. It's almost funny - almost. <br /> <br /> Third, the script. While it may happen that the events shown are faithful to real events, one cannot deny that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring. Scenes that are as short as two minutes will feel much longer thanks to poor dialogue - a dialogue that does not give symbols or a story deeper. This movie is too much of a conversation to further develop the story. Although this style was also the case in British films of the 1960s and 1970s British horror, it cannot be denied that dialogue exchanges were always interesting in more professional earlier works. For example, Peter Cushing could read the phone book and still pay attention to the viewers. The same cannot be said of the HAUNT participants. <br /> <br /> Finally, humor. The poorly controlled humor of this film is torturing. The obese boy is the butt of many jokes. One particularly horrible scene sees this boy going outside. This scene should never be added - but it is and contains sound effects if you don't understand what it does! <br /> <br /> The only positive point about a movie is location and costumes. The decision to photograph near the original location contributed to authenticity. Costumes were also well chosen. <br /> <br /> In general, HAUNT is a terrible movie. It's not even "so bad it's a good" league. It's just boring. I recommend everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like a plague. Don't even barely see it for free! <br /> <br /> I've never seen another movie about Bell Witch. But it can't be worse than HAUNT. Could it? I'll give this second movie a chance if I can suppress it. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I would recommend all the people here to check out some terrible movies about ghosts and ghosts. HELL HOUSE, CHANGELING, RINGU, GRUDGE (Japanese Original) and ONE MISSED CALL (Japanese Original) LEGENDS are good places to start.
