I have to present this comment with a kind of entrance: I just think I have a soft spot for the original 60s - 70s TV series. I think the local filmmakers flew as much as casting out of this outflow: in the anticipated transformation, the audience would look for a hip joint, a sporty Linci (Clarence Williams III) or a cool, with Michael Cole's reflections. and so on. Instead, we get Giovanni Ribis's poor little white rich boy who comes just as pathetic as he does in all his roles (in the office where I worked, am entertaining myself once with a fake movie poster, choosing various actors as office staff members, I think I chose the president of the company dorky as a son?). The Danes are not like the new Julie, but no character can do much if the story just sits in the habit. So it's pretty forgotten. What did I say?
