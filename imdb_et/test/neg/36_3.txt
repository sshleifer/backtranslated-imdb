This movie, which I rented under the title "Black Voodoo" should be avoided. I was expecting a blaxploitation / horror flick; but what I got was very boring, standard "ghost extracts". In this case, the ghost was the leader of the religious cult leader who tried to reject the treatment, but who was ignored and died in the operation. The result: his spirit carries the sister Sherry and forces her to do the acts of murder. The only voodoo connection was one of three black characters, in this case a blinded ex-footballer who has been practicing a voodoo. The film is very slow and very boring. There is a very common ending that offers excitement followed by a terrible stupid end (warning: SPOILER) <br /> <br /> where a woman can protect himself from murder charges by saying he was in possession. This movie is slow and bad non-funny, just amazing. Avoid it at all costs.
