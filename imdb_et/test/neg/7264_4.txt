I've never been a big fan of Almodovar, but I have always found something to enjoy in my movies. Unfortunately, I had trouble enjoying Broken Embraces when I usually think I would. <br /> <br /> I think Broken Embraces' biggest failure is their lack of symbols and depth. The film is essentially a love story that is tragic, and what wants to involve the viewer in their stories. I found this problem from the beginning. <br /> <br /> In the home screen, our "hero" is the director / screenwriter, Mateo, with a very attractive young woman with sex she just met. His representative comes the way the woman leaves ridiculously. <br /> <br /> In the home screen, our "hero" is the director / screenwriter, Mateo, with a very attractive young woman with sex she just met. His agent comes in and rolls his eyes as a woman laughs ridiculously. Mateo strikes something she needs to enjoy life because she is the only thing she has left. Being in a dark tragic car accident that also killed his "true" love of Lena, played by Penelope Cruz, the viewer can buy into that concept, except the rest of the movie really shows why Lena was her life's love or some other. depth of his character or some other. <br /> <br /> Cruz is playing with Lena's lover, Ernesto Martel. From the very beginning, their union is rather pathetic, as Martel binds jealousy to Lena and Lena avoiding insecurity when she is herself, with her parent Martel. To move on, Martel finances the film for Mateo so that she can hold the star of the movie, Lena. Of course, Lena and Mateo fall in love with no back attack. And in the Almodovar world it is so easy. Mateo has sexual intercourse with a sexual young woman, now loves Mateo Lenas, later found out she had a son with her agent after her love affair. His son answers this information laugh and "Oh, well." Again, there is no depth, no understanding of any of these characters, it all happens. From the beginning to the end of the film, Mateo didn't get the depth of emotion. She's flat and doesn't act differently from the scene. <br /> <br /> One scene I enjoyed was the film producer Martel, who watches Mateo's documentary on her son's video. Martel has a great moment when she looks obsessively that reading her lips confirms her worst fears. Lena later faces Martel as she looks at the film material and talks about her part loudly, which corresponds to the footage of her lips. Some pretty great moments. Rather, it is natural, but still really exciting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the movie was quite boring for me. I could not take care of these symbols or their situations so that the part of Almodovar cannot compensate for this lack of depth. I think if you are a fan of your work, you enjoy this movie, but if you are like me, you will miss it, you will find it missing.
