What in the world! This gambling cinema would have been suitable for the Lifetime Network. Michael Imperoli is a good actor, but I think his depiction as "Stu" was little. The assemblies were intolerable and too much. Supporting cast, where are you? Anyone who did this should be partly guilty. Cinema was useless. A gambling story with the school afterwards. Such stories should be left to the world of Oliver Stone. However, it sucks the ass, but at least it would be nice to watch. It was a test that lost its wheels before the race began. Remembered 1982 Indy 500 Mario Andretti.
