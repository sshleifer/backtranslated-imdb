I don't care what someone else says, this film is the worst trash in the film. What was John Landis thinking? <br /> <br /> I know it's based on a series of children's books, but instead! Even the kids hate this movie. It is pointless and boring. Tom Arnold proves once again that his only talent is wasting production money. <br /> <br /> I think the only reason why Stupidid hasn't appeared in 100 of the slowest movies is that only 20 people do it. admit it while watching the garbage. At least Hobgoblins did it for MST3K.
