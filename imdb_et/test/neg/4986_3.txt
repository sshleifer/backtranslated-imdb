I didn't like Underdog! I mean, it was really unnecessary and needs a lot of face lifting, and then it might have been satisfactory, but most of it didn't like it. of those films that wanted parents (who grew up watching the comic) to come up with the kids to see it, I am not one of them so that the film didn't like me the least. does not believe Jason Lee was the right voice for Underdog because he made him sound and have a really unpleasant sound. Then it was really predictable that makes you feel tired and crazy. Humor was really what made me crazy, that it was just uncomfortable and somehow one thing that bothered me was most of the way that almost all of Underdog's mouth was sarcastic or rude. Operation was satisfactory, but needed some improvement. everything means that it can be liked, unlike me. 3.4 stars out of 10
