Poor basketball movie. A terrible trainer with a deplorable background arrives at a small Indiana high school basketball team in the 1950s and guides boys to victory, "breaking them first and then building them." <br /> <br /> Not a bad theme. Photography OK. But the plot is completely predictable. There are no real sub-plots. Nothing added to make the movie more exciting. You know what happens from the beginning. Suitable for the fourth grader.
