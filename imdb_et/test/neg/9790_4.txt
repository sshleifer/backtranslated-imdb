This is one odd film. It seems to be aimed at a younger audience, but full of sexual innovation. The whole premise is rather absurd, not just the idea that some dead children fell to some criminals, but the same ones said that kids who take the harsh parents' boys are a bit far removed, but then again the older ones mostly lack the authority to hold the children in row. <br /> <br /> The cast is good, but Meg Foster plays a very chubby mafia-type leader with beautiful AJ Damato as the leader of the bullies. Aerky Egan and Rebecca Herbst are well-cast among young lovers, although Leigh Allyn Baker has been greatly wasted by this comic strip artist. <br /> <br /> In general, film is unusual, but I think it is not enough to make up for poor quality and worship. The terrain is all pretty boring and "special effects" are quite inconvenient. Sit it out unless your mood is.
