Lovely music. Beautiful photography, some scenes are breathtaking and influential. But the dramatic tension disappears in such a poorly editable movie that it's hard to know what's going on. Sometimes the dialogue is incomprehensible. Then there is Richard Gere. He should be a factory worker who gets into trouble and gets a job at the farm. In the hot sun we see dozens of sweaty and dirty farms. Then we see Gere looking just like he was wrong with Calvin Klein's advertisement. Sam Shepard, another glamor boy, should be sick. But he looks good. Nice to try, but it just doesn't work. Brook Adams tries hard, but he disappears off the road. The real star is the girl.
