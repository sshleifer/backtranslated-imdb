Although I have seen and enjoyed similar films that were silent films about the Russian Revolution, such as POTEMKIN and TEN DAYS WHERE THE WORLD'S TURNED, I didn't feel that much. This was mainly due to the irritating and "artistic" way the director chose the film. While POTEMKIN played its editing style, this film used similar methods much less finely - in some places, editing seemed very nervous and amateurish. Plus, and it was really annoying, the use of zombies at the beginning of the movie and at the end of the movie was up. With the "zombies" in mind, to illustrate just how the peasants of the Ukrainians were depressed and oppressed, people are in many scenes like dummies. And they stand like that, for a long time without moving, while "evil" capitalists and mass exploiters are walking. Give a break! This movie is a wonderful example of content style - and it's just a movie for those who enjoy or can forget the redundant direction. <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie's DVD is somewhat better than leaving a comment. This makes the movie more traceable and provides some interesting knowledge.
