A ruthless assassin has been hired to remove a person at the top of the United States government. Constantly changing his identity and location, he is known only as Jackal. All this hit man is a secret. Knowing Jackal's presence but uncertain about his goal, the FBI Deputy Director stands out as the biggest challenge for his career. To track down this cold blood killer, he and his co-authors, the Russian intelligence officer, use the help of an imprisoned Irish terrorist. These improbable allies are entering the global race against the clock to stop the mysterious mercenary before he can complete his task. If you are looking for a stop like Die Hard, The Jack is not your movie. This is a slow spy thriller with lots of cool gadgets and weapons. Richard Gere does a good job against terrorists, who helps the FBI for a deeper reason than just freedom. And Willis does a good job as Jack. OK movie, but nothing else.
