You feel you have experienced a hell vacation after you sat down and watched this terrible television movie. This film is the practice of over-acting (very bad functioning) for situations that are more than what they are. I will not give up the plot, but if you understand why the people in this movie live from a local man in the film, you will be required to spend two hours of your life. The only plus is to see Marcia Brady running around in bikini!
