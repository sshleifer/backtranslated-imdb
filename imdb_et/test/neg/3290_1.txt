How is the day and age that people are still stupid to think that some other stupid thing is wise? Maybe foolish people like looking at things that make them smart. For example, "War at home". "Cuss is even sad as those who watch it." There are no jokes but half-jokes and light gags that barely justify a little inner smile. Action is your typical, unpleasant, idiotic, standard sitcom-flailing-limb type. And why oh, why did this arrest replace the arrested development? Well, you have to hand it over to Fox. They know they have foolish exhibitions to attract all stupid viewers. You see, the reason Arrested Development was not so popular because it was so smart. It was so wise that it made stupid people feel bad about themselves. And of course, when a stupid person meets an intelligent person, one hates the intelligent person. Most of the time. Do it, or try a smart person. If you like this exhibition and you are one of the stupid people, I can't really understand what must be like the minds of open eyes and open minds. I can not understand what it has to be, to be pointless, laughing drones, affected by every little thing. In principle, parrots are laughing with laughter. Trained, obedient, meaningless parrots. Maybe I shouldn't offend the parrot with you. You know who you are. (If I see this as a bastar *, it's because I'm so annoyed that AD is canceled.)
