The initial title always struck me with some over-depression on some of the gun control saddles. Still; their presence on the screen was at least highlighted by a top-level participant to support Yul Brynner. Most of them were the stars of a separate film. <br /> <br /> However; this first sequel was a pale imitation, the group of which mostly consists of B and C lists, which were more average than excellent. It was a similar structure. Brynner's "Chris" had to refresh another team of saddle-catchers to deal with the problems of peasants in Mexico. Another tyrant gave them grief. <br /> <br /> Due to the originality and freshness of the first movie that has been spent now, this remake had little to offer. The budget was probably very limited. This is reflected not only in casting but also in the script below, which was borrowed from a much earlier classic. It was also shorter than half an hour than John Sturges' original. Yet, we were still in distress and moral, which at times changed the first few. However, there was no proper action, action or location to balance things. Filming was less expansive. It was unable to convey extensive sweeping of landscapes, which was a large part of the original. <br /> <br /> Generally; it just lacked imagination. The first film was hit and this pedestrian sequel was obviously assembled as quickly and cheaply as possible to cynically finance its own success. And it shows. There's a lot of "done on TV". <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
