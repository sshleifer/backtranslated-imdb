This movie is terrible. Not only is this story unbelievable, the situations where the characters are themselves are so stupid until it is shocking. I'm sad that Broadway's The Secret Garden Daisy Eagan decided it would be a career step. The idea is interesting, two young girls arrive very quickly. But gender hasn't even awakened. The film is silly, the story is stupid, the performances are stupid and the whole concept interesting. I'm sure all 14-year-old girls will make boys after the first period and try to put their panties under the toilet. Better luck next time guys. My scale * T scale *
