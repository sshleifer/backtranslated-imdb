STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> David (Johnathon Schaech) and Tish (Lori Heuring) a couple in Budapest for business and luxury stay. One evening, they meet an attractive woman at a nightclub and call her back to the place where they reach the three. Everything is fine until David gets some negatives in the post and he and Tish are finally blackmailed. But when some of the people involved in the fraud have been murdered, things get in and they are forced to enter pornography and hardcore bondage to follow a woman who can win everything. <br /> <br /> When the original film dealt with the concept of a snuff movie, it is dealt with directly on the DVD again and again !!!!!!!!! It plays like a porn movie, a cheap piece of piece with lots of hot T / A operations. If this seems like a good movie for your idea, you probably like it, but probably you would be more than a video store at home. <br /> <br /> It tries to copy the original to the dark and voyeuristic feel of the film, but even though it does a good job, it still can't do the original. It has an apathetic story that has a vicious narrative flow. Compared to Cage, Schaech is sometimes so clean. <br /> <br /> Better than I thought it would be, I think, and better than your average one of those direct DVD tracks that seem to have come out a lot these days, but really, have we not seen enough? **
