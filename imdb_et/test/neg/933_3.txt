You paused a couple of times so that they had difficulty with the straight line of all the details (although this is hardly a work of Hitchcock proportions, where there are no details through the whole story), and besides, it was not just an "appealing" piece. ("mgconlan-1") and quite a lot of its details can be accepted. <br /> <br /> It's not so terrible in a movie category that it's exciting to be "good", but I'd like to be back on tape again (instead of seeing it when it is broadcast) so I can quickly Go ahead and see the parts I miss the first time. <br /> <br /> Give him "3 *" because of the attractiveness of the four primary characters.
