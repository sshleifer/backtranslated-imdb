View 1 of 2/25/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-George P. Cosmatos): Predictable Action Pillow, where any frequent filmmaker can guess what follows. Charlie Sheen is the president's good old boy who just doesn't like the rest of the president's staff. Of course he is involved in a situation where he is framed over and over again and he has one friend of the White House who is playing with Sutherland, who of course does not stay that long. His second friend is a reporter who has played Linda Hamilton (who has very little to do or say in this meaningless role), and of course her biggest and best friend is President (Sam Waterston), who remains to all people. otherwise he will be killed around him. Strong, but ineffective, meaningless triplet despite the talents and burdens (pretty much wasted.)
