I haven't seen many movies worse. Story, Dialogues, Actress: This is horror! The story just jumps from a to b c without logical steps. Every time you think you've taken something, but not: it was as it was meant. And why on earth is the character that Jenny Garth doesn't love in such love (who actually plays Cinderella Man Russel Crow)? Well, it's not Spielberg, of course ... I have to write ten lines. This movie is not enough inspiring to write 10 lines! This is a romantic feeling for a good movie with a lush story, so when you do it, you have a ball.
