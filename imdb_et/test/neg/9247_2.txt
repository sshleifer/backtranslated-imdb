I can only name a few movies I've seen, which was bad. This movie is terrible: the dialogue is clever and cliché, ”the actor's poor mostly with a few exceptions, cinematography is nothing to rejoice, and the plot is silly (a fatty woman occupies a suburb because her daughter didn't make a football team). It's so bad, it's funny to look at. If you can keep it alive, I'd recommend it as a comedy. What is a serious movie, then I'm afraid I have to evaluate it 2. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie if you are a serious film fan and you are looking for an interesting and challenging story or good action. There is nothing to be found. <br /> <br /> Edit: Hmmm ... I think a group of people who work for a lifetime must have written some counterfeit comments and voted all negative. Don't believe them. It's really a funny movie.
