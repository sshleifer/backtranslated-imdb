The film, which surrounded the whole of the stars of the film, was a pleasure for me. I had been expecting a much better film taking into account the involvement of Murphy, De Niro and Russo talents, but I found the film fell on the face. The comedy lines were superfluous and the great performances of the stars, especially De Niro and Russo, couldn't save it! <br /> <br /> ** Off *****
