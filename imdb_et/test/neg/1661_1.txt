I understand that the budget for this movie was low, but it's really a terrible movie. The script is just terrible and it was a free part. The effects are not bad, but this movie plays like a regular R-rated movie with flat fears and cut off violence, no gore-fest that was deliberately made for the video. Who were these guys funny? As it would have appeared in theaters. <br /> <br /> Operation is terrible. Editing, another free aspect of the film, goes beyond the amateur and the plot, as I said earlier, leaves little to be desired. There is nothing original in the film. Gore fans, avoid it. For filmmakers: Try the original next time or stop making movies together. You're not good at that. People hate trashy rehash, especially with such a low caliber. AVOID! It's not even worth it.
