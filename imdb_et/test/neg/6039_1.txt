There can be no worse criticism of the film than BORING. <br /> <br /> Some "bad" movies are fun, some "fun" movies are really bad, but to be BORING means no one can ever buy a DVD to watch it over and over again. <br /> <br /> This seemed to be a movie that used Antartic's drama teaching, they were too busy to ride around to stay warm instead. Leading actor, he said, is almost whispered, husky-style voice, fucking, it seemed he was going to seduce someone, and he didn't care about who. <br /> <br /> Film can't make money if it's boring, I hope it will die quickly, once again, death.
