"Nicodemus" is almost a copy of "Red" in the sense of odd behavior, but this episode focuses on other people in Clark Kent's unpredictable life. If a poisonous flower finds it to Smallville, Jonathan Kent is the first one to carry it out. The flower causes people to reverse their behavior, and if it affects Jonathan, it will become a short rough and violent, but Clark will prevent him from doing anything until his father finally goes out. okay. so far, it's okay. next is Lana. The episode was good until then, because the flower causes him to try to attract Clark. at the last moment he refuses to do so, but the damage has already been done. this episode gives the wrong impression and is not suitable for people under 20 years of age because it is adult content. The first part was good, the last part (focusing on the effect of the flower on Petele) was good, but in the middle of everything about Lana's substitute personality was not, and it destroyed what might have been a great episode. I'll give this episode two.
