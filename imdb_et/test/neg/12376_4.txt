I saw this movie when I was about 12 when she came out. I recall that the most frightening scene was a big bird eating men who fell out of the air. Fear. Fear. <br /> <br /> Like a young boy who goes Saturday to these cheerful B-films, I was still tired of the formula of monster-type films that usually contained a hero, a beautiful woman who could be a professor's daughter and a happy resolution, when the monster finally died. I didn't care about the romantic corner as a 12-year and predictable plot. I love them now for involuntary humor. <br /> <br /> But about a year later I saw Psycho when he came out, and I loved the star, Janet Leigh, pulling out at the beginning of the movie. . I sat down and noticed at that moment. Because scriptwriters create a story, make it as scary as possible, not a well-worn formula. There are no rules.
