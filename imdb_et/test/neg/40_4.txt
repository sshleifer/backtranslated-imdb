I bought it in VHS "Terror Hospital", and when I got home I checked IMDb and I was like OMG this legendary "Nurse Sherri" !!! So here's another one from Al Adamson who, after the days of "Drakula Castle Blood", had clearly learned some small amount of film. If this earlier effort is more or less completely a sclerotic one-off, it will be somewhat confused by adding a particular variety element and surprise in the midst of incompetence. Of course, half of this movie is a blind op-soccer player who hits the wind with his stacked sister, but at any moment we could cut off a satanic handyman's chief or sister Sherri, who runs a farmer who carries a fire or a bit of abstract abstraction of a student-film so that go with a pulsating effect in the possession of the scene, or most freely half-topless a bit ever or God knows what else (i forget to be honest). Like dick-ass pieces, sh * t go, this one goes to the cutting edge. Congratulations, Al.
