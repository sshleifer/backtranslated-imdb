I just stopped watching this movie and I'm disappointed to say I didn't enjoy it a little. It's so slow Slow and uninteresting. This boy from Harry Potter plays a shy teenager with a rude mother and then one day tells the rude mother to find a job for the child so that they can accommodate an old man who probably has no place to live with his family and therefore goes to work with an old lady. And this old woman, who lives alone, teaches her about girls, car and life! I didn't get how an 18-year-old man enjoys spending time with a terrible lady in the 80s. Sorry if my comments on this movie have disturbed people who might have enjoyed it, I could be wrong because I am not British and may not understand social and family structure and lifestyle. The film is mostly made for the British audience.
