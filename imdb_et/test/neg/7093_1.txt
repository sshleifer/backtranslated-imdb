The moral of this exhibition is that bad eating habits give people bad hair, bad taste clothes, bad posture, bad jobs, and on and on. They are obviously unhappy and relaxed. However, when they learn to eat broccoli, they are rich, successful and attractive. TLC should disgrace the obvious exploitation of older fears and guilt. If nutrition is really so important, they should be able to work out the fair and true methods of the exhibition. If they really believed in their computer models, I would like to see that they do a double-blind test, finding some 40-year-olds, explaining what their eating and training habits are like children, and the age of children. photos. Then compare the actual things. Hey, it sounds like Mythbusters! Discovery Channel - are you listening? <br /> <br /> TLC must stand for tabloids and minuses.
