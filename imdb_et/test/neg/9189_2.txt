First, I'm not a firefighter, but I'm in some para-fire extinguishing unit (guys calling when an earthquake strikes and real firefighters need more people for SAR) so I had some training and simulation but I don't have any real experience. <br /> <br /> But there are some points, one of which is absolutely incredible. I understand that they have removed the mouth / nose pieces of the masks and that there is not enough smoke because the public does not see anything else. But some things defy logic: <br /> <br /> - There is no second mask attached to the oxygen. How the hell do you want to save people through smoke without it? <br /> <br /> - Stealing people. No, that's not the case. I screamed when someone grabbed the rope around me and hung me from the building. If I could scream, it is and does not go behind the air, because the rope squeezes my lungs. The second time they leave Jack is better, but still weird. <br /> <br /> - "Goal High". No, you're not bloody. You always fight as low as possible with fire. You don't want to fight with the flame, you want to extinguish the fire and it is under flames. <br /> <br /> - No discipline. They run like a chicken. And they scream all the time instead of the radio and keep the discipline. <br /> <br /> - No tactics. Why don't they work in at least two teams? You can still divorce, but it takes a lot more than everyone just suffers when looking for victims. <br /> <br /> - Do they really enter the buildings without water? I Europe, firefighters would never enter a burning house. <br /> <br /> Firefighters on the roof. WTF they think they do there without safety features or water? - explosive rooms. Wood and brick do not explode suddenly. Better points are actually parts of the fire that are not extinguished by marriage and film. It's a lot of kitsch, but that's fine. I'll give him that point.
