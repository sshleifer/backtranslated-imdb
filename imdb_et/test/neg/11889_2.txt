Because this film has such a low IMDb rating, it is not surprising. In our Enron era, do we really need more reminders of America's obsession with greed? The subject is so politically loaded that many viewers not only receive such movies for entertainment, but can hardly react with hidden rage. It was all I can do to sit quietly with this corporate corruption cinematic memo, without taking out a DVD and crushing a thousand pieces. <br /> <br /> What really is such films, including "Purpose" is their pretense that there is a meaningful message behind the glitter that makes the film worthwhile. "Purpose" I couldn't find such a meaningful message. What I found was a story that idolized the materialistic traps of capitalist power and wealth. The two main characters that are nausea in their nausea are doing very little work. Instead, they play golf, they pull their coolness, they sounded "hip" directly to MTV culture: "rock my world" and "Now get to partying, this is an order". John is secret, important in itself, low and smirks. Robert, who carries funky little glasses, is even worse. <br /> <br /> The film includes two young geekists in garages who look and sound like "Antitrust" (2001). Stereotypes are played by all they are worth, and this movie also features stylish-looking computer equipment and Barbie doll chicks in handy cases where our prospective billionaires need to relax after being heavy. And the time-bound pictures and dialogue that such a story needs, can you imagine how this movie will be in fifteen years? <br /> <br /> The best thing I can do about this wasteful cinematic pulp is to say that San Francisco has some nice aerial views. The film would have been much more enjoyable, much more entertaining if they were these unpleasant characters and ran into this repulsive story and just flown us into this small plane for the duration of the movie.
