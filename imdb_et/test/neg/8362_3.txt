Congratulations to Christina Ricci for making this movie and for putting her mojo behind this important topic and trying to make a great movie. Ricci is my favorite actor: he is so talented, so natural, his reactions are perfect, and so is the energy he constantly emits, which testifies to the often used term "star". <br /> <br /> The film cannot describe many different reasons, but perhaps the most important thing is that the story seems to be an unchanging screen, making it an urgent story ... more about it later. At first glance, it is great, but think about it, Jessica Lang as a Jewish mother is too Protestant and not quite right, Ann Hetch is not close to showing a psychiatrist's compassion and dedication to the book, and when making a movie justify saying that she is not Anne Heche and Jessica Lange? But the real problems are in the film's structure: first of all, in generating the total sympathy of Elizabeth Wurtzle's character and, secondly, saying something important about the overly ordinary and terrible situation that this poor girl finds. br /> <br /> Lucky, unfortunately, Lucky has not come to a rebound structure, because it is mostly more affected by the teenager than most, but not as devastating as he gets off the book. This is a big problem. This story had to be told from the beginning to the end and from the therapist. He is only eight or nine when his depression begins with devastating social factors, both society and home, and is a crucial point not only in recognizing his true compassion but also in the gravity of his case. He is such a talented and so vulnerable and impatient spirit so early that his heart cannot help him, but because of his victimization. It will miss the movie. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, one has to keep in mind what the movie is trying to say: it is one of the seriously injured girl's biopsies, but it's also a film of a national who can't act together; it is very clear in the book, but not interesting in a movie where Harvard has even more than an average college inspector. Finally, the film fails to convince each of the messages convincingly and it is too bad. Is Prozac a good thing or is it a bad thing or a mixed blessing or seeming need in a country where so many people can't work without a chemical skeleton? These are harsh and complicated concepts to work with, and writing doesn't really try to involve any of them more or less. The Challenger disaster is an interesting picture that symbolizes dysfunctional America, but it has no effect on what it requires, as it is an inadequate development of cross-section and controlled topics. <br /> <br /> Ricci's performance is dense and cordial and one of his best careers. <br /> <br /> Michele Williams is also great in her role.
