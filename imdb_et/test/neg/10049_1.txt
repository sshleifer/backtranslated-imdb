What if someone had made a movie that was completely missing from the plot? <br /> <br /> Well, I think it's probably a bit like that. I don't think I've ever seen a move that was so stable that its slide is harsh (at first) to the end. I just stayed in it because I thought it couldn't get worse. Well, until the end, "Necrophagus" / "Graveyard of Horror" proved to me wrong. <br /> <br /> Who would have suspected that the undead lizard-man of the undead film, the evil grave-robbing cultures, and the mad scientists who came without a noticeable reason could suck it? One might think that there would be at least a humorous value ... but not here.
