OK, I usually don't add comments on movies, but I finally watched a movie that was so full of Mr. * t and that was full of incompetence that I just had to warn people. The Blackwater Valley Exorc is loosely about the beating / peder / priest of the woman and the podunk of her family's horse fries, and for making a long story, the youngest daughter whom the priest had distorted, but who loved the mountainous shore, was the youngest. Together with the heroic god who shines a Mexican gardener who once participated in exorcism, the woman's beating / pederas / priest can save the day, but not before the overwhelming demon can jump over the whore the sheriff of the city made for her. All in all, this movie is the most useless (I can get a very descriptive part of this movie, but why do I waste this movie)? Anyone involved in making this film should be sterilized so that they cannot pollute the land with their useless spawning.
