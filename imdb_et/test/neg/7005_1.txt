I had heard of this movie through a friend, it had to be a thriller, but what I was looking at was not a "thriller". It was rather a weak test on one. Amber Smith was a bright spot that could give him too much credit. She was in bed with the actor Erika Michels. These two actors didn't seem to click on each other at all. Amber Smith was the exit of this gall, and it would certainly be on the camera. He didn't seem to be in these scenes at all. I was disappointed because my friend's friend, of course, was pumping this movie to be "big", but it was actually more like watching a pornstore in the shop.
