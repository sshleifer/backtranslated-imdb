The rupture of Roger Corman, which seems to be almost a zero budget. All the special effects were originally used in "Battle Beyond Stars", and I suspect that a fair amount of props, suits and kits were used from other sources. The story seems to have been written around these elements, so it's not really a movie as it is a recycling project. The third-rate "Star Wars" junk wasn't needed right now or now.
