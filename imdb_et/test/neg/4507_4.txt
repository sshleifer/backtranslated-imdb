This is a number one horror film starring Richard Crenna and Joanna Pettet's psychologist duo who buy and old mansions and invite a small team of friends and patients to help clean up the spot. To their knowledge, the mansion is a basement - a gate to hell. If you have the mood of a clich√© horror movie, look no further, but if you want something inventive, this little movie doesn't like you. <br /> <br /> OPTION: $ $ (Rather weak, although the scene in which the man cuts his hand to see - a rather frightening mind, fans of the death scenes of the inventors do not like it because every sign seems to be in some way under an electric shock.) <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $ (Nothing to talk about. Mary Louise Weller adds a good look but her character was underdeveloped). <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (Cloned, but worthless. It doesn't offer anything new to the genre) but Victor Buono - who is about as dangerous as the department store Santa - seems to have attracted a couple of viewers). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$ (The best performances are Crenna and Pett together with other actors just "ringing" their roles.) The script cannot work out any characters outside the character of Peter and seemed to have forgotten Mary Louise Weller (Animal House) who disappears for about twenty minutes and only restarts for electric shock, like everyone else in a boring way).
