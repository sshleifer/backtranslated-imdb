I'm not sure what the idea of ​​making this movie is. This seems to have been done by a historic society that is shown in the local Pistol Pete Museum. First of all, it seems that this may be the beginning of a Mad TV or SNL sketch. But then the joke is about you if you don't have a punchline and you realize that someone took it seriously. The story was not bad, but the involvement of SASS members seemed nice (it worked) to see me in the movie. I swear, the trailer listed every "characters of the dead cowboy" in the movie. The reason why the West is so much fun is the atmosphere and the characters it brings. I just felt like I was looking at the rean actors of the civil war, dressed as cowboys. Not even worth the digital video that it recorded.
