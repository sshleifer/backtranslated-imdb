Based on the comments made so far, it seems that everyone hates or loves this movie. I think it would be fair to say that although this is not a big movie, it has interesting moments. First, it was filmed at Colorado (was it Breckinridge or Telluride? I don't remember, but it's in credits). The location is absolutely stunning and remarkable. It's beautiful, even for me, who lived in Colorado for several years. <br /> <br /> Next, he has a Disney's strong character for actors. Harry Morgan has never been in a better shape than he's in a Disney movie. He is literally hysterical. Also remember the wonderful Mary Wickes? Although he has a "bit of a part" in this movie, he is very good, as always. If you don't know who he is, think of an animated version of Disney from Hunchback from Notre Dame (he was one of the gargoyle), and he was also the most interesting nun "sister law" as well as the best nun. in "Problems with Angels". He has always been a very characteristic actor and most character characters never get the recognition they deserve. <br /> <br /> In addition to the characteristic actors and all the stars, Disney's 1960s and 1970s may not be the biggest films, but if you really look at some of them from start to finish, NOTICE that every movie really has a funny or hysterical moment in it. The whole movie may not be funny, but always a comic pearl (at least 1 or 2) in every "live-action" movie Disney ever made, is it Harry Morgan in one of his tone sounds or Tim Conway slipping around, or Joe Flynn All of the film may not be good, but every Disney movie has always been hysterical in the time I've seen, and during that time Disney always managed to smile despite the movie's obscurity. /> <br /> Against these comments, I do not agree with the viewers who say that every Disney movie is terrible during this time, a statement that is not quite accurate. and forget about the shortcomings of weak spots. <br /> <br /> Some live-action Disney movies are real classic (Old Yeller, Bedknobs, and Broomsticks, Mary Poppins), but for those who don't, I can judge them for what they were - a good clean family fun at a time when the films had become vulgar, raw and offensive.
