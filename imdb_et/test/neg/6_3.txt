Tough to sell: British playwright Ronald Harwood adapts his autobiographical performance to a dramatic, worshiping film about the Shakespeare Theater troupe of World War II, relaxed with an obsolete, gentle but non-unreliable star. The actress's funny assistant works diligently to get her master to produce a "King Lear" (during an air strike), but both men lose their grip. Actress Donald Wolfit, whose wardrobe was Ronald Harwood, seems to have been recognized as a joyful shelter for landscaping. Unfortunately, Albert Finney (currently in his career, not all parents) seems to be too strong and quick to play the actor; Finney (and Oscar nominated candidate Peter Yates) is unable to change Siri's moods and unity, which is reasonable for us, so in one scenario he stops a train with an echo accompanying his voice. break down. With a human wreck that is in the midst of health and fitness, one would expect a special assistant to go a long way to protect his boss (and his future), but the servant Tom Courtenay prods and badgers and goads Finney wear not to rest. Courtenay, who played this part on stage (and had been nominated for the Oscar best actor by Finney), has been much better adapted to his role and finally his stroke and confusion in the only real sense of the film. These two, fortunately, do not try each other's heads, and the scriptwriter Harwood is careful not to get into the pattern of love-hate (which could be perceived in the first work of the film); but without the servant and the fame, there is no portrayal of the portrayal except for the deterioration of the narcissism, a hint of what was once. * 1/2 from ****
