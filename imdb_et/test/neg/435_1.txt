I just can't get it. Why call this sequel "American Werewolf" if he has no connection with it? The first movie was funny * and * was scary with special effects. (When the memory works, it will be created for * the special effects of the Oscar category *). "Paris" is not one of these things. Awful effect, and not much more. Don't look at this movie. Instead, rent the original werewolf in London. You're much happier.
