As with many offspring, it is not just the quality or impact of the original. The first belongs to the composition with other surprises. It just doesn't cut it. The first film had a magical "good time" feeling about what this film was totally missing. We got into all these signs in the age of innocence (minus Richard Dreyfuss). Now, a few years later, they have changed so much that they are very different people. Although this happens in real life, we don't expect it to happen to our favorite movie characters! The film doesn't have the humor that the original was, and we waited to laugh. What a little humor is in the dark. The first film also had what was probably the biggest soundtrack, though it's good, but not even close to the original. This film is so different from the original that it is not even a sequel. I gave him 4.
