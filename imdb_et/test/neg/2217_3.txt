Why is it impossible to write in French? Very kitchen! This central road trip is a despicable technical opportunity, which is still present in 1976. These great "Casimir" monsters are completely ridiculous! The film, however, serves as a "remake", such as "KING KONG" (the latter), which had a slightly more scenario. The professor has a similarity with Professor Calculus and is quite funny. David (the character) is inconsistent enough, but goes beyond (consumes) the good message from below "you unite and win you!" All in all, we'd say a movie made in the 40s. Now that I told everything (or almost) about the evil I was thinking about it, we can say that if we have a brain tired or something else to see, then the thing is quite fun. Hugh! That is my opinion! (French translation into "Reverso": apologize for any errors!)
