This performance has lived across the country with many different choices. I saw it first in the Provincetown production in the first summer when it was in the P-town (2001) - before it was strange, it was forbidden in the overwhelming gay resort (codes that resulted in its closure). I saw it later in Broadway, a long-standing production in New York. Strangely enough, P-city production was much better than in New York - fresher, more enjoyable, more vigorous and more fun - but it was only in 2001; later attempts to clone production ("Bare Naked Lads" in 2007) were definitely third rates. This filmed production includes the production of Los Angelos, and that is, like other comments, not the best. I'd appreciate it somewhere between the 2001 P-city's highest production and the third-class "Bare Naked Lads" P-city show last summer.
