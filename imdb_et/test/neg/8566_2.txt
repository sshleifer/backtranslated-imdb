The only good thing about this movie is its last twist. With a 97-minute movie, we can only record one idea that was in this movie, which I have to say, completely wasted! For more than 90 minutes, this film is just a collection of clichés, bad behaviors, foolish ideas and publicity, lack of temporary absence, stupid deaths, terrible special effects; is it all pathetic and unigiginal? until the last three minutes, where a good idea finally came! This is not an outstanding or extremely original idea, but at least was a "good" good idea, the only movie! I do not break it, but I have to say that the idea of ​​having a better plot, better FX and definitely better action, would become a good movie. If you watch this movie and you can hold it to the end, you know what it is?
