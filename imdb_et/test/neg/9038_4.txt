Although this movie is not really terrible, it is still a waste of time and paints an incredibly inaccurate and revealing picture of Beach Boys history. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie would make you think Mike Love was behind the brain band and Brian Wilson was just a pathetic psycho. In fact, no characters have evolved beyond the one-dimensional parody, but this is the TV movie you are expecting? The unpleasant smell of Mike Love is the whole turkey when he tries to re-write in the history of the band leader and the inhabitants. Yes, as if ... <br /> <br /> Music is great on the plus side. Unlike the previous Beach Boys bio-pic "Summer Dreams", this movie is actually the actual Beach Boys music, not anemic cover versions. It also has a surprising number of rare and rare -heard tracks associated with Beach Boys - Sunrays "I Live for the Sun" is just one example. <br /> <br /> This movie was originally shown in two parts on the American Network TV. The first part is the boss of the two and records the early days of the boys and rises up. By the time the two parts roll over, Brian Wilson's character has become just a comic, and the actor seems to laugh, but how can anyone take this mess seriously? If you're not a fan of Beach Boys, you probably won't come out of this movie, except for the extremely twisted and one-sided view of the band's history. But then again, why would you watch it if you were not a fan?
