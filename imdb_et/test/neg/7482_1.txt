Carson Daly must be the only late night chat that is not a comedian. What was NBC thinking! He's not funny! Writing is terrible! All sketches are painful to look at. The current new karaoke is not funny at all, especially since it tells you what they are singing before they sing! Escalator interviews are just foolish and, unfortunately, not funny at all. Everything she jokes about, especially during the monologue, is the smartest, the dumbest, not the funny jokes ever put on television! I mean, if he makes Jessica Simpson's joke, he will stop it "because he's stupid", which cancels all the fun that was already very low. Every 3-year-old could have come up with any joke and sketch that they show for this flat apology. Seriously, don't look at this example if you are not on the verge of suicide and want something to push over the edge.
