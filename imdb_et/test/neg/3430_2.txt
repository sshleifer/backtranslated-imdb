Other than John Krasinski, this movie was absolutely terrible. The love story of Lacey Chabert and Andrew Keegan was as cliché as possible, full of incredibly bad traits of how her parents never let them be together and super-hammy longing. No "emotion" had any depth or reality. Two accent characters (Dean Edwards as Rupert and who played it as a weapon expert) ... when they saw how bad the accents were, wouldn't they decide to let them down and write a few lines to avoid giving the audience a headache? Probably not. I don't even know where to start editing, especially with audio editing. If you obviously hate over duplication as much as I do, don't look at it. That said, Krasinski was great. From a bat I admit that I'm a big Office fan and that's why I rented it. But he is quite entertaining as a "crazy friend with a mad idea". She has a cliché role, but she can make it as fun as possible. The end was terrible. Just terrible look terrible. The idea that the robbery was terrified was potential, but Keegan slipped after the shot until Chabert's painting (which looks something like it is) is the most brilliant scene to his studio.
