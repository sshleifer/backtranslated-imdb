I was waiting for this flick. Being an old Robert E Howard fan, mostly Conan's views. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much and thought they couldn't confuse it too much ... Oh dear - how wrong I was ... <br /> <br /> The main mistake was pretty boring. It was supposed to pull together beautiful help against supernatural events, sword fighting, etc. <br /> <br /> You have some gore, but everything else was just less life. In the middle section, it seemed to cover 40 minutes in the mud in the forest, where there are slowly horse-drawn carriages and even slower dialogue and character formation! <br /> <br /> Plus = Costumes and Effects were Good, but Not Enough I think it would have been better to suppress the tone, raise the pace and go to the 12A rating. As a ten-year-old boy I could like this movie. Probably at the beginning of this age, I read Conan's stories with amusement. Maybe it says a lot about waiting for my movie? <br /> <br /> Or ....... Go to the "Art-House" tone, direction, etc. as a box office. <br /> <br /> Well ... Maybe the next Conan movie is worth it?
