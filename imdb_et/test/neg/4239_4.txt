First, a warning. "How to Marry a Millionaire" is preceded by a "Street Scene", probably a five-minute orchestra by Gershwin's full-bodied and ceremony "Street Scene". Sitting through it takes patience. If you have a DVD, you can be sure that you can go ahead. You're not leaving anything behind. <br /> <br /> The film itself is one of the 50th anniversary of Hollywood's frustrations, a movie supported by big star power, a rich-en-scene, and a perfect high concept failure seem unthinkable. The title alone is perfect. Generation after generation, however, is forced to ask itself - how is it so weak? The script is about the production of albatross neck, dead, fragrant things that stifle everything and everyone before they really live. There are no comic situations, but isolated moments that play a laugh. When real comedy is threatening to evolve, the film quickly moves to other less interesting things. Example - A scene where three leading ladies give a date to the same fancy restaurant. One of them, short-sighted, refuses to wear his glasses from scratch. One of the dates is married. A classic Hollywood carnival kit, definitely with an erroneous identity, an angry woman and probably someone's pie. Well, no. Instead, we reduced it between the three dates because the ladies respond "comedily" to the things the partners say. Hit the punchline and cut the next limp joke. If in doubt, go to Marilyn's wall. Where does Billy Wilder need her? <br /> <br /> The Three Stars is an almost perfect chart of the life cycle of the goddess of the classic Hollywood screen. It was one of Marilyn Monroe's films and the camera just eats her, although the script doesn't give her anything to do. He is so luminescent that he almost seems to have just hatched. In contrast, Lauren Bacall had been a big star of almost a decade and knows how to control the screen with Monroe. He gets the only thing that goes for the real role, and gives some good lines to the cynical spine - the right material, he could have brought that thing to life. He is a curious senior actor - when he is lying in his age in the film and claims to be forty, it is not instantly ridiculous - and much less innate than his co-stars, giving him convincing power. Betty Grable was by no means an eternal one and she had her eight years of good characters putting her until the end of her Hollywood career. Sometimes it is desperate air, there is nothing but a toothpaste smile on the screen and some comic magazines that can't play their real age, but cheat someone on this new generation of sharper actors, relying on the same old schtick he had throughout his career Served (for Marilyn suspects, when you see two films in this movie side by side, Monroe's nuance and - yes - intelligence helps to sharpen the relief). He is also a man of dead wood with dead wood (although all men - even big William Powell - are guilty of lazy performances); he can't hit them with any comic sparks. It is better to give your role to the under-utilized Monroe, who can be funny all by himself and left Grable with the recurring routine of Mr. Magoo. <br /> <br /> The film is so enjoyable as possible to be put down on a lively Hollywood production that makes even a twin game enjoyable, as seen in the "Silver Moon Light". But somewhere that is buried under butterflies jokes and professionalism, there is a sharp, cynical comedy about marriage that Bacall could have been singing - and new generations of filmmakers sit together with "How to Marry a Millionaire" waiting for this movie to be disappointed again.
