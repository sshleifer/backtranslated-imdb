I do not understand why this film was so highly appreciated by critics - I have seen dozens of documentaries (on television) about the wine world, which were much better than (if) you look at, please think of two very mondovino annoying aspects: first, filming is just terrible and terrible and disturbing: it seemed to me that the man behind the camera was just receiving the material and playing with it: it zooms in (for some other purpose than pressing a button) on / off) - I almost stopped watching it! secondly, the interviewer (in the opinion of the director) is not really relevant: he looks and asks questions like a boyfriend, not like a journalist, even if the general idea and topics were interesting, too bad a conclusion: an overestimated documentary, maybe only guys who don't know something about wine => don't recommend at all (2/10)
