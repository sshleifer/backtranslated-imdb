The director infuses this film with the wrong depth, repeating the disc on the entire film. One picture in each movie is 3 times longer than it should be. You can easily cut out 1.5 hours of this embarrassingly long 2.5-hour movie without removing it: one word from dialogue, one picture, one event or a bit of movement. <br /> <br /> It was one free movie I've ever seen. Other reviewers have called it pretentious, which is an underestimation. L'Humanite is a pseudo-intellectual trash bin created for anti-Hollywood so that Cannes judges can confirm their independence from the Oscar. <br /> <br /> The IMDb Reviewer says: "Unlike Hollywood movies - which usually force the audience to overflow - it forces the audience to slow down and look at some of the smallest and most common features of life." You should be catatonic to look at some of these pictures so long and move as slowly as these characters are. It is not a real life if you are not heavily treated. <br /> <br /> Finally, I felt that Schott√©'s portrayal was the sad blast of Peter Sellers' masterful "Chauncy Gardner". He uses the same facial expressions and positions. She even fences! In many respects, there is a parallel between these two films. The main difference is that "Being there" moves along and does not depend on shock and tricks to create meaningful experience by questioning various things that we take for granted.
