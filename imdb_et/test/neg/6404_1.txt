This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I didn't go with great expectations, but as soon as it started, I thought it might be o-k. It wasn't. Jim Carrey seemed to try, but he spoke all his lines as if he were a stupid comic. Other participants seem to try their best, but there is wood. The plot has a good foundation, but melodramatic lines make it dull and kind of stupid. I laughed all over the movie and tired of it in five minutes. Most of the plot "spins" you see several miles away. It's not just worth it. I really wish I hadn't wasted my time with that.
