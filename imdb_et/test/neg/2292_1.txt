This flick is TERRIBLE! It stays nasty and makes you laugh, but it won't work terribly. The director obviously has no meaning, because the actors are like something I've never seen - the lack of talent and comedy. Even their attempt against English is really sad and in fact the strange Swedish accent, which speaks of inconsistent dialogue, is probably the most comical and enjoyable thing about this film. Even gore i terrible and convincing. If you crave comedy, I would advise you to turn to a classic ticket price, such as a series of evil dead or even when you need to. We all enjoy a bloody laugh, but it's ridiculous!
