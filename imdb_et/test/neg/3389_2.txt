I disagree with the previous reviewer: this movie is an amusing moment, but hardly a laughing government. (if you really don't think that the septic tank is fired and the heads exploding in the head are ridiculous) Actually, the only reasons I gave it instead of one, because a.) two actresses are good b.) the soundtrack is higher than the average of some light pop songs is thrown in contrast and c.) The monster truck is quite daunting. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, this film has some alternating, horrible or interesting ideas that are overwhelmed by unreliable crassness, crudity, and vileness. The former best friend's character is one of the most irritating I've ever seen and the little grace that the sweater player characterizes disappears at the end of another complicated twist, which makes little sense. <br /> <br /> The waste of a leading actress who shows some nervous charm and the aforementioned actor who is a joyful character ...
