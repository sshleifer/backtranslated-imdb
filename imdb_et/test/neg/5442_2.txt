A group of people go deep into the jungle for a variety of reasons, and finally there is a lost city (with probably King Solomon's diamonds) and a super-gorilla racing ... Now, you know you're in a tough actor like Linney and Curry in one movie ... gorilla and it's just the beginning. Okay, what else ...? <br /> <br /> For an action / adventure movie, the movie ... well, just in the absence. The first hour of the movie (!), What they are not even in the jungle, but trying to get there, after the subplot (something about the local military regime, whatever) and when they finally do ... it's not just fun anymore. <br /> <br /> The film's effects are only so and so (and very bad compared to the previous Jurassic Park movie). <br /> <br /> Now, end ... Dad didn't take care of his son's death, but just interested in diamonds? Uh-huh ... only in movies, only in movies. <br /> <br /> Totally wasting talent, adapting to Chricton (Jurassic Park, Twister, ER). 2/10.
