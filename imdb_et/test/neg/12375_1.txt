Giant Claw is in intense competition with films like "Robot Monster" and "Plan 9 From Space Space" for the worst films ever. Fone looking giant vulture attacks Lionel's trains in this totally unconscious film. The script is so bad that all the characters say to each other is ridiculous. No wonder this movie is in "This Came from Hollywood", where this pearl is ringed, with an endless needle, "Linden as a big battleship". The line appears in the film in a careless manner so that it can't be accessed. Of the other sci-fi films of the 1950s, The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms and Earth vs. The Flying Saucers have several pictures to enhance the sparse vulture attacks. At one point, a big vulture is responsible for some deaths, so the army puts the whole world under martial arts and no one can go out of their homes. Of course, the huge bull is mainly concerned with searching for the stars marked with this classic, Jeff Morrow & Mara Corday, no matter where they are. At the same time, the director is so lively that he doesn't even offer some honey shots with a real Maras dress and black heels to relieve this zero-star thriller tedium. This is the second time that confusion has been made. In "Tarantula", Mara Corday moves for the whole movie with a hot dress, but put on the pants, "The Giant Scorpion". The budget for this movie must have been no more than thirty or forty thousand dollars and I doubt if Morrow or Corday could get more than three thousand. It seems the whole thing was fired directly from someone's garage.
