I watched TV one day with a friend and we hit "Going Bananas" for the last twenty minutes. Believe me when I say that a movie's good rating is enough. The first scene I saw was a monkey, a boy, a fatty boy and a black man who looked like Dave Chappelle, who flew thousands of feet in the air in the crop. Although everyone else was festive about the trip, the monkey seemed to be in some way drugged, where he shouted something that resembled the English word faster. They then landed in a twenty-yard dock in Africa. After the heart seemed to say goodbye, where the monkey shouted (Hahahaha), the movie "villain" appeared. They broke the perfect ass in their old Cadillac when the evil monkey took the Air Jordan leap into a ship that sailed clean 40 meters away and put them into a beautiful car in a quiet ocean. After seeing the film, I have a new goal in life; find a dwarf who played the monkey and stabbed him with a fountain pen.
