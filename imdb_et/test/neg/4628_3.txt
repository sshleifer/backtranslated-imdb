I had a very hard time with this movie. If you really aren't very adulterous and want to hear people talking about their sexual exploitation, I don't see how you can enjoy that movie. Geez - Most of the main characters acted like looting and their astonishment with their many infidelity grew tiring. As the only element I appreciated this DISGUSTING scene, where one sign was urinating and the blood splashed everywhere because he took STD --- BIG SURPRISE! Hmm. <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie, look at the stage, the barbaric invasions. Despite the many unlikely nature of many characters, the sequel is very inclusive and more realistic - worth your time.
