Although I have recently read Mr Wells' World War II or "Time Device" or some of his works, I believe they were all set in London or at least in England. This Class B (C) movie is set in the eastern United States, as is Orson Welles' excellent radio setup 67 years ago. However, this film does not have the quality of the narrative style of the Mercury Playhouse program. Thomas Howell's emotion would not be acceptable in most of the college's drama clubs. I was embarrassed for her. Running on the grass on the hill that cried "My family, my family" was almost ridiculous, as was his reaction to his brother's death. The story of the three film versions I've seen was the worst for Gene Barry's 1950 version. For the first time I saw this "machine color" that dropped a sticky saliva, like a "stranger".
