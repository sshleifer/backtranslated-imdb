I don't know the real Cobb, but I have a clear impression that the goal of the filmmakers was to try to soften their looted edges and reputation, not to give us a real portrait of a man. In the film, in addition to some racist remarks, it has been shown that it is just another nervous, harsh old bear (he is so full of life!), Where is the golden heart (more or less). It is also the worst action I saw by T.Lone (he does not bring anything new or subtle to his stereotypical character). He just doesn't grind Cobb in a way that pulls me into the movie. Not one minute did not forget that it was on Tommy Lee Jones's screen pretending to be Ty Cobb. Robert Wuhl was also unable to impress. The "comedic" elements of this film were simply confusing and not sounding at all. It's a bloody waste of time
