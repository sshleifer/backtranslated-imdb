I'm honest - the collapsed purple plane that Snoop Dogg is in control is a fun visual gag. It would have been a good concept for a 30-second commercial or perhaps 3-minute music video. But manufacturers have dedicated an outdated concept to comedy to stretch 30 seconds of material per hour and half of the film, and the results are predictably flat. The remaining 89 minutes are full of racist and sexist humor, and jokes, insults, and ... worst - painfully failed. Thread strikes below the weight of his races. It is best to avoid if you are not drunk or stoned.
