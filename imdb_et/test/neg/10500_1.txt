Usually don't give me "1." movies Although I am a critic of HEARTLESS, I try to find something that makes the film valuable (ie traceable). The main thing I am looking for is a coherent line. If it is alone, I can watch it! Let me start by saying that it's not even worth the movie, it's rather a primary school project ... went terribly wrong! And I've seen every Sci-Fi movie ever made. <br /> <br /> How many times have I read professional critic comments saying it is like "It played like Made-for-TV ... (etc, etc.)" and I said "Oh come, I want them to think about real criticism. "It's worse ... much worse! This is really the worst "thing" I've seen that lasted the length of the movie (if I think it's a movie, it would be the worst movie of my new time) and I've seen every movie Uwe Boll! This movie makes Uwe Boll like Francis Ford Coppola! :) I look at Jaws the Revenge all day and see it one more time ... even 5 minutes ... was a good scene and it was END! ;-P OK enough to fuck Ron Hall's works, now for serious criticism. <br /> <br /> The script is poorly written, the dialog is in wooden form, the effect is cheesier when Power Rangers are showing, and even can't start with the screen zoom transitions (ugh). Someone actually looked at it, edited it and said, "Release it"? I'd rather have burned it than released it! At the end, I can say, "Thanks to the goodness of DVD and VHS players is Stop and Eject!" My advice ... don't rent it when you do, so you're glad you've stopped and come out! :)
