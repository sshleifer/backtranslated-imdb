BOX (2009) * Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella, James Rebhorn, Holmes Osborne, Sam Oz Stone, Celia Weston. Really disappointing adaptation of the legend Richard Matheson's sci-fi cooler "Button, Button" by Richard Kelly, a twilight wunderbuster filmmaker, who really pulls out a small, well-designed piece of grip "WTF'-a-thon!" A mysterious (and ridiculously abducted!) Man, Langella, is bidding for a million dollars for "fighting" couples Diaz and Marsden (both surprisingly with vanilla bliss as well!): A box with a red button that pushes, kills some stranger in the world (!) added, but is it really important here? What is the reason why Kelly makes so much wonders (ie, nose bleeds; watery transport systems? This is right? Anhydrous.Systems) in the name of God, if the tension has to be tightened as tightly as possible (options). If it sounds like a bad TWILIGHT ZONE episode, then you're half-right (the 80's TV restart really did make a good small screen customization; actually rented it instead!) One year's worst movies.
