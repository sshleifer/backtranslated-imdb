This story of the high classes in which their high-level evil has come and gone has been like the modern Mid-Sommer version of Joan Crawford's film, which he suffered in the mink. Here, people behave in a terribly civilized way in the face of accidents. A well-thought-out London lawyer (Tom Wilkinson) discovers that not only his wife interacts with the local gymnasium, but has also killed his caretaker's spouse in an accident. He throws up, but otherwise his stiff upper lip was barely able to. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Julian Fellowes, who won the Oscar for "Gosford Park" (this is his director's debut), from Nigel Balchin's novel, it's quite comical, although I'm not sure how much comedy is provided. It's like the return of British films of the '40s, where characters all acted like characters in books or playing, not like people in real life. But that's not all bad. Wilkinson is terrible, even if you never believe him as a person, while Emily Watson (the adulterous woman) and Rupert Everett (a very immoral high class totty) are both very good at covering the material cracks. Tony Pierce-Roberts's cinematography ensures that no matter how difficult the ear is, it is always good.
