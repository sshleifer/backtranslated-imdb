Opie, Tom Gilson, was my brother so I went to watch the movie and I didn't see it any more in those years. Sorry! it was bad. I have said I have to write 10 lines so I put a little trick. Tom and Tuesday Weld had to "introduce" this picture, and Tom was told that he would take the premiere on Tuesday, but Tom said he wouldn't go with Joan Collins and he did and because he was just welding on Tuesday. I found it very funny and still. The film, while the concept was funny, and its participants were impressive, but some how it just didn't come funny. Consistency was abstract, at best it was like I was watching two different films at the same time, each running for another. Sorry, Bob Gilson
