I think I should take something like this with a grain of salt. These laboratory films (and yes, they spend a lot of time in the lab) always fail in one dimension: there is a perception that the few people who are stupid have discovered at that time the secrets that are beyond anyone's understanding. Of course, they pay the price because they have the same shortcomings as experimenting with. Frankenstein did. There is always something they did not see. For young ladies, there are so many things from pure science to fashion to cover them terribly. The young woman really pulls and the doctor can't help but she could have been a bit discreet or even trying to hide what she did. Things go wrong and, because of this intellect, it gets tremendous power, including an understanding of how it arrived. Rock Hudson looks good here. However, he never does this role. It travels all over, with lots of clich√©s and stupidity that reduces the key issue. Once he has received revenge, it would be more appropriate for him to travel and let him look for him and destroy him in a great way.
