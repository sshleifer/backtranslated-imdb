Have you ever seen one of those examples that have become so popular that it can finally get off with all the coarse mess and repetitive side-by-side tricks that its creators can get? If you haven't done that, you've never seen Family Guy. <br /> <br /> The fans of the show think it makes sense, nervous and poignant. It's none of them, but it's boring, repetitive, offensive, and intrusive. <br /> <br /> The "humor" exhibition comes from two sources. <br /> <br /> 1) An irrelevant idiocy. The exhibition often has repercussions on things that have nothing to do with the plot and that are mostly simply absurd and meaningless. And then there are random movie references where the characters of the exhibition play from a popular movie to a scene without parodying it. . . or parody it at all (which is never !!!!!). <br /> <br /> 2) The same crap that is for every episode. One man has a sexual deviation from STD, AHA HA! Isn't that funny ?! Hey, you know what's even funny? Getting the same joke about one to fifteen times in one episode. And don't just say it several times in one episode, make sure you drag it out so that the whole scene is dedicated to just talking one joke. Now imagine that the same routine is used over and over again for virtually every line of characters. <br /> <br /> Competing "un-PC" humor is not as "un-PC" as you would believe, mostly they just say what morals are thinking about the latest newspaper titles, politicians, and casual celebrities. <br /> <br /> The series was moments, but now I think it's time to show off and do it. <br /> <br /> You know what's funny? I still like it more than the wind valley Nausica.
