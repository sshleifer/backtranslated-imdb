I actually belong to the demographic Zoey 101, which specifically seeks to target, so I see that as much as it tries to be relative to people of its age, the premise is just too ridiculous for the average person to associate. The exhibition revolves around the most affluent graduate school and the lovely, incredibly dark, attractive one-sided characters who live in it. As with children's networks, there are, of course, lots of skinny white children who naturally have a black black boy. <br /> <br /> The story lines all turn around Zoey and his circle of friends that stumble or tend to create a smaller dilemma, such as not wanting to take part in a gym class, as a result of which Zoey plans to save the day for all his friends. In general, the B-line, which revolves around one-sided hospitality, or places supportive characters in totally unrealistic situations, such as creating a dorm dormitory and no one noticing. These plots often play stereotypes, such as any character that draws a good grade in mathematics, by default the lack of social skills. Most episodes have a constant and over-exploited will - they do not want the Chase-Zoey dynamic. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, badges are all unbelievably unilateral; is Zoey, the perfect girl who is literally looking for everything, Chase, a loving, but loving best friend, Michael, a symbolic black boy (a ghost for Christopher Massey for some really funny one-liner management), Lola, theater chick ( which means that he dies in his hair and 75% of his dialogue is in his dreams of fame, despite the fact that he does nothing in the real theater), Logan, feminine daffodil, Dustin, spazzy little brother and quinn, science geek. Some of the words that I have spent on each of these characters combine each character completely. <br /> <br /> Zoey 101 can be fun from time to time, but serious shortcomings in the system of values ​​that it promotes are a big crowd. Zoey, created for a clear example and a quasi-feminist crusader, and who is on the surface depicted flawlessly, still manages significant mistakes. For example, when Lola was first introduced, she was thought to be a goth girl. Zoey tried to use it as an excuse to defeat his common room to be "freaky". <br /> <br /> As far as the actor is concerned, it is quite clear that Jamie Lynn Spears grounded her role because of her name, not because of her talent. Although he has definitely improved over time, it is clear that he is not born as an actor who greatly influences the quality of the exhibition, as most of the plot's lines rotate around his character. The strong mold is surprisingly good, especially considering the material they need to work with. They give quite a few good linings to the comic relief when the plot has not yet become uncertain. <br /> <br /> First of all, Zoey 101's college is wrong in life and no one should expect much of it in the past.
