I can't emphasize that enough to get this movie for kids. <br /> <br /> To do this, you also need to keep adults alive. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe I'm a little overpriced. This is not the worst children's film ... no, let me reformulate it. This is not the worst film made by dissilusioned adults who have attracted adults and somehow marketed to children (this would be "Jack", which I have thought to review / gut like fish). <br /> <br /> Adults do not learn anything surprising (well, if you need to proceed quickly before the final credit for the cosmetic phenomenon of interest). We usually do not reach for the adults we wanted to do as children because reality tends to get in the way. Well, I can tell you that (so four years in college, but I degressive). <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the devil's children will get out of this movie. It will probably only interfere with them (let's look at the moment Russ was with an eight-year trauma). There's a better movie, "Everything Delivery Service", which has the same message, but it's handled hard instead of drilling your head. And adults like it too! <br /> <br /> By the way, the MST3K's armored film is a moment when they think that this Bruce Willis movie is a sad little boy in it.
