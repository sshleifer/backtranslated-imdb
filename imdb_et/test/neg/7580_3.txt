I decided to watch this movie because it is labeled as "the most frightening movie ever" so I waited for it. Unfortunately, I found that there was no frightening moment in this film (and I'm the one who jumps very easily). The film was nothing more than a terrible clich√©, and every time there was a momentum, it was very obvious. The advantages of this movie would be music and an odd scene that really shot well (like the last scene when it opens the door, and you see Tune in the reflection and when he turns back to him, you see a ghost on his shoulders). In general, this film did not add any new J-Horror genre, and there was no creativity and intimidation everywhere.
