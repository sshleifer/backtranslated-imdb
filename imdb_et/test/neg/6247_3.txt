Hmmmmmmm - a massacre of cheerleader. Let me think - high school girls get sliced, except for cute life. I understood. Next movie. <br /> <br /> I was actually surprised that it was done in 2003. I thought they would stop making these films in the 80s. It was really making your mill's movie with teen eye candy, foolish cornea, even a male adult and hot teacher. It continues in the dark and stormy nights and the list of deserted cabin in the woods. We've all seen it. <br /> <br /> But it was some interesting plot twist that puts it above the normal slashes, so if you have some brain cells to fry and kill for 2 hours - you could get worse.
