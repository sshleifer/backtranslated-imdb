I've read many comments here about how this film sticks to the book. I don't think any of them would actually have read it. Edgar Rice wrote a dangerous African jungle and Apes were killers and hunters. We know a different way now and this film depicts Apes in a more modern view. I've never seen a Tarzan movie that would even go to Edgar's vision. Maybe one day Hollywood with confidence in talented and reputable authors talk about the story. So, if you've never read a book and enjoyed a good story about feelings and wild animals from a rabbit, maybe a good cry, look at the movie. I hope John Carter gets more respect from Mars than Tarzan. We miss, Edgar!
