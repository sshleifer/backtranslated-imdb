This movie was really stupid and I thought it wasn't so bad and I can tolerate a movie about people who eat people. Then the part where the boy has his skeleton hands ended, is a bad film cherry. I saw a screw in the plastic frame for goodness. The brother was still alive and moved when his hands were bare bones. The funny thing was that he could still move his hand, which was just wrong. Without muscles, you can't move your hands, but he did it. The brother should have died even before he moved his hands. The film wasn't great, but it was okay until the hand of the scene. I laughed so hard that I don't remember how it ended. It had something to do with foam or something.
