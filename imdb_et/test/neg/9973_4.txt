I was looking forward to watching this movie and was therefore extremely disappointed when I found it to be a complete and perfect garbage. The direction of Akerman is both hard and clich√© (how much more can you get than at night in Paris?). It seems that the male is completely chosen for their relocation into Egon Schiele's nervous self-portraits. However, the themes of jealousy and betrayal that should have been the primary focus of this type of film are left unexplored. There is a rotten melodrama that starts and lasts longer. The only advantage of such a movie is that it makes you realize how good Goddard and Truffaut really are.
