I waited a long time to finally see what I thought was a fun whirlwind and it was shocked to discover the dirty direction, the awkward dialogue, the weak pace, the unmotivated strokes and the general harshness that went through the film. Just not funny! Sets were cheap, usually the superb Donfeld costumes are tough and distracting. Even the title song is annoying. The characters in the entire children's book are not close to the couple's life, whose lives have been reversed when they lose their jobs. For a film that seems to be directed at the injustice of welfare and unemployment systems, filmmakers are not unfair, allowing Spaniards, blacks and gay stereotypes to play so cruelly. The look of the film is similar to any episode of Love American Style. It's not a compliment. Tacky's seventies fashion abundance is in this world of white-collar theft, which gives every situation only improbable air. Outside the clever initial idea and the two powerful stars in Jane Foundation and George Segal, this socially practiced exercise is forced and meant for minorities, especially gays. If you want a better capricious film, then you're better off with Hot Rock with George Segal and Robert Redford or Mis Up Doc with Ryan O'Neal and Barbra Streisand. Now it's funny!
