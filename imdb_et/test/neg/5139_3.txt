Suddenly, I ended up with AFI FEST 2006 interruptions, with about 30 people in a free 1000-seat auditorium. After seeing the lack of audience, the programmer of the festival began to comment: "At least some of the people attending the festival have a good taste of the film". Mr. Programmer, after watching this movie I have to answer "No, we don't, and do you!" This "back-woods" episode follows a young (not so) Wild Bill as he and his mysterious family run a dangerously illegal Canadian whiskey across the border during the American ban. The old-age laws (Kris Kristofferson and the company) need not only the money to save their dirty Vermont farm, but to introduce little to the virtues of Wild Bill's masculinity. <br /> <br /> Although this adventure story is nicely captured there are no such films that are "tense" and plausible. Kristofferson's weak power and dry monologue remind me of the dream I once had when Al Gore played the role of Willy Wonka. I just didn't care and if Wild Bills's mysterious grandmother appears in the air to give her advice she just didn't fit. Yes, I almost slept more than once. <br /> <br /> Gary Farmer does a good job, like Cameron Frye Ferris Bueller; Big Bill's brother, while teenagers Chris McDermott use these piercing blue eyes for their benefit. <br /> <br /> But the general assumption is that Jay Cravens Disappearances will play Block Buster near $ 2 Bin.
