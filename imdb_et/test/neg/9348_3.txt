Wow. The story was just incredible. I understand that this movie was supposed to be a comic genre. But even the mess should be at least some vague in terms. <br /> <br /> Water has become a very rare substance? <br /> <br /> Well, it is strange, given that hydrogenated oxygen (or oxidized hydrogen) is one of the greatest substances in the universe. And quite easy to do. Glompi summed up hydrogen and oxygen atoms and voil√†, water. <br /> <br /> Instead of pirates after that, it would be necessary to use dilithium crystals instead of water, or something like that. Water as a plot device was just stupid, stupid, stupid. <br /> <br /> "Comedy" seemed to be working and animated and forced. The comedy of "Red Dwarf" TV series was afflicted and forced and forced, but it was really fun. Instead, I felt I said, "Ha ha, it was just so funny, I forgot to laugh ..." <br /> <br /> Sigh ... all the money that put kits, costumes, actors. what is waste ... <br /> <br /> Instead of whipping and capturing and dying, my suggestions for improving it: 1) Use a credible plot device. 2) Get rid of "comedy". None of the actors had anything good about it. The film would work better as a "serious" activity. <br /> <br /> The obvious intention of the writers was to make silly comedy, but they didn't pull it out. It is unlikely that I will ever look at it again. That's too much of a hacker.
