I have to ask myself whether such films will support and criticize the people involved in their film? How can something so terrible score high? My parents went to see many more adult subjects when we were kids, something in R until we were old enough. I only remember two movies that told them yechi! when they got home. It and "Catch-22". The film is made up of protests by dirty doctors and workers in a dirty hospital, striking narratives, and a pack of townspeople who look like Norman Lear sitcom in the 1970s. The worst part is the "mystery of murder", the crazy old man who is doing the "work of God" by killing doctors and others. When he admits, Scott and his girlfriend show little emotion. They only care about getting out of it, where it is "safe and happy". A doctor who falls for a dead heart attack is fake as a man so he can get away. Oh, my, that's a fun movie. <br /> <br /> This movie didn't give me a thought, a ridicule, or any other sense of "It has to become better", but it never does. People don't know why it was a failure, no wonder. I don't know how IMDb has enough members who think this movie is good. YECH.
