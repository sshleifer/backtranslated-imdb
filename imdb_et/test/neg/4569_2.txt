I am not usually a fan of high school comedies, they depend heavily on humor for a bad taste and rarely miss the story and characters of clich√©s and even boring dialogue. But I have had some of the guilty pleasures, especially when I was still in high school. Seeing that oh-so recognizable teacher data gets their bouts, I was always happy and casual laughter can be so. These movies only work if at least one character is instantly pleasing, it wasn't "Cheats", especially the main character. Of course, the fact that the actor played was one of the most irritating, non-talented, noble children I've ever seen in comedy. <br /> <br /> Comedy is not a joke, it's hard to be funny: delivery must be just right or the material goes to waste. In this case, there were not many good things at first and the jokes that were semi-funny were professionally cast. <br /> <br /> This movie was 3 hours long, the director never heard about walking. Stay away from this one, there are many other nice teen comedies like 10 things I hate about you, who is your father and superbad.
