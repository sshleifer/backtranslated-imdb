This movie was probably one of the worst films I've seen for a long time. My friend grabbed this video rental store from the shelf and all but forced me to watch it, we both deeply regret it. Ehh ... Where to start? Writing, acting, quality? All this, suck. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst thing about writing a movie. The dialogue was worse than I thought it might be in the movies. Dirty dialogue like "how do you do?" ... "not so big, doc" (just after the exorcism of her daughter and then her wife's suicide attempt.) Of course she wasn't that big. points, funny. If not terribly written, planned and obvious. The overall drawing of the film, writing and the way it worked, HORRIBLE. It was like writers couldn't do anything better, then write a bunch of dirty dialogue and throw as many sex and nudity scenes as they accidentally got. The only almost good sex scene (between the preacher and the tattooed girl and the Peirced girl) was filmed in such a poor quality that it seemed to be a cheap porn rather than a feature film. Oh yes, and they haven't really done that. <br /> <br /> Actress? Terrible. x100. I think the only good actor was a short Spanish man who played Miguel, Del Zamorat. And his part was written terribly. Worst acting? Allegedly, Paul Kappellas, acting in combination with brilliant music, a gun and a half-naked blue-white girl running around in the woods, was sitting in a movie. He even spun his death scene, which should have been easy to reach. Although most of the others worked awfully, the lack of characters is also added to the overall level of film intake. There were just enough signs that almost half of the characters died, the same number of people got over at one point and then the other characters could not be counted on the one hand. Like ... 50 under your thumb. <br /> <br /> P.S. What is this at the height of the exorbit films that is happening everywhere?
