I came here to fight, because this movie was so well-beaten and so well-molded that I was twice angry with this de-evolution when I was in a lesser job. Without discovering too much of the plot, I can only say that some of my two VHS kits were irritating, joyous, but bizarre but plausible on plot development. The lead character was suitably naif, but also intelligent and very open. The events he is urgently forced to understand are the separation of his parents, the cultural shock when his Pakistani roots collide with the collapse of a full English society in the sixties, his father's dubious transformation into a Suburbian honored Buddha, and his cousin turning into a feminist soldier when his best friend turns suddenly in the 70s as an icon of growing punk movement. Among other things, I was so angry about the detailed work that each participant put in the first part of creating and creating their characters, but that the whole thing would become the second part of the very bad porn episodes, too much to justify plot development and too clear to even seem erotic. My biggest pet peeling is when the directors allow their private fetishes to mix the truth of their movie and that was the ultimate example for me. <br /> <br /> I felt a bit like I would have been called very clever, funny strangers, just to lock the doors and not be able to communicate with each other, and all of us are forced to watch the bad seventies sex-animation films instead. What an insult to the hard work of these amazing actors! Why not just make a cheesecake start? And why is a great leader who can actually act, and then cut him off when he builds great performance? I almost felt as if he had grown up from tired endless sex scenes, where all he did was descend on his pelvis as another breathable naked actress. <br /> <br /> The bottom line - the first part is a minor, part two is the perversion of the second-order soap opera. I know the book is quite explicit, but I felt that these fine actors had been used as life in reality because their characters were in the movie, and it made me quite angry and inconvenient. Only John Waters can pull down such a dubious humiliating actor and plot and see that it is artistic. My suggestion is to look only at the first part, throw another in proverbs and you will love the Buddha forever. Item A + F = 0
