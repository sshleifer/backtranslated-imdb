The words don't let me have this terrible twenty-hour life. The story has come to total disbelief. <br /> <br /> Actress is leading and so much ridiculously terrible. Vinnie Jones - both the wonderful Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, are unbearably terrible and incredible, like journalist Mike Sullivan. <br /> <br /> I can never see an honest movie. It just deserves to be that terrible continuity expires. After Jones gets huge beating, he appears without scratching. Her girlfriend suffers from her drink and she runs from a pub that is dry. This is quite terrible, making it worse than any talented actor.
