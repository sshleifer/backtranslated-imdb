If cellulose fabrication and Get shorty do not exist, it may be an OK movie. When I say this, I mean that nothing in this movie is when it is another terrible dialogue or a cliché full of scene. do not say more than I have when "Get shorty seems to be in this trash stage, all like Steven Tyler acting terribly and not necessary and like Christina Milian, man, can't get me started Just some of the coolest actors and actors like John Travolta and Uma Thurman seem like they are trying to kick off children and hips and have almost lost their reputation because of this movie and, frankly, I think the best actor is a stone playing alongside one of the least favorite music, Vince Vaughn. Cedric entertainer and Andre 3000 play another terrible double act as Cedric a nd Andre} and the only funny part of Cedric, Andrei and the rest of the band's activities is how the pants are kneeling so you can clearly see there boxers and the only reason why this is funny is that people actually do it. funny and unsuccessful, it has no new material, comedy or coolness, because it copies every other movie and finally the only reason you should see it if you want to compare how bad it is this brilliant predecessor Get shorty.Oh yes i forgot mention that there is a BIG cliché at the end.
