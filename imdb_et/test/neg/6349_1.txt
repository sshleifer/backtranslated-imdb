Last night I missed and decided to watch a movie called "out kold", which I had ever bought from many other cheap movie theaters. It seemed to me a good old action movie so I took out the chips and coke and was ready for a relaxing evening. Well, the pain started right from the start. The main character is the boxer who is the most beautiful man I've ever seen. A good person must of course be nice, but he's just a pussy! It doesn't fit with a boxer with 28 KO and starts working with pimp to earn extra money. Even nice guys can still be cool. Well, his first fight came when he worked with that pimp. Each punch was clearly left and it became even more troublesome because the sound effect was not synchronized with the sync. Then it's completely painless, and you have enough reasons to leave that movie what it is. I gave it to 1 because I've never seen such a bad movie.
