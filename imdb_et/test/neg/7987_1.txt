We see Thomas Edison, with a smile on his face, trying to live a 5-ton live creature. Finally, he was successful and so was the first animal snuff film that was cleverly achieved as an amazing achievement in technology. It is the worst scientific arrogance, the people. This is a court with a doctor who had removed the monkey to prove that he could keep his separated head alive for 22 minutes. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is an absurd excuse that the elephant was convicted "and sentenced to death and that it was a just and humane" fulfillment. I'll give you all the big collectives of Three Stooges all over your head. <br /> <br /> Go to the "Lawyer" (1993), a movie based on a real swine murder trial in Midwe France. /> <br /> What's next? We arrest the birds for stealing our blueberries? Arrest and Battery Arrest? Thomas Edison, I hope you have a big fat worm climbing through your eyelid. lol
