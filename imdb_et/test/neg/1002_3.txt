I pulled this movie early, much to my surprise, because I didn't want to look at it at all. Now I wish it wasn't. The intercourse begins well when death and death cause death and the question of whether the guilty witness recognizes or is discovered or (which can be done now, though not at the time of making old films)) Get there. The plot has been made earlier - which plot is not - but the inherent tensions along with additional complications and motivations due to the illegal love relationship create the first swallowing. Then the film abandons the amazing to begin the vague exhibits of two uneven, all-suffering love. The tracks of both plots - hit and running and unwarranted love - are simply not connected enough to each other and they contain the same signs that are not binding enough on them to justify the original story leaving the line. The plot should have chosen one plot or another. At the end of the movie, I found the idea in the middle of the second funeral: "Now, what is it about and hit it?" The filmmakers think the answer is obvious, but I think the film was drawn and executed.
