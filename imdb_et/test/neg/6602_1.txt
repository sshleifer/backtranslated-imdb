Usually, when a television biopsy appears to be fame, it is at least campy (ie Cybill Shepherd like Martha Stewart, Lauren BaCall as Doris Duke), this is the most terrifying, inexpensive and endless movie ever made. If VH-1 is going to make a TV movie, they will spend some more money on VO. Flex Alexander - though he's talented with Michael's voice - is not a big dancer, not like Michael, and doesn't even have his creativity. VH-1 would have done better work with the actual impersonator, so if Michael sees plastic surgery, he won't actually come out exactly. Why should we be surprised by the decrease in Michael's nose when it's just as big as the beginning of the movie? A woman playing with Elizabeth Taylor cannot do anything or see her as she does, and doesn't even start with a woman like Janet Jackson. A terrible script and a serious case of failure must keep VH-1 more movies. Flex Alexander would have done much better JERMAINE JACKSON than Michael. Costumes? Trashy ripoffs. Neverland? Distributed shots of news documents. Don't worry about it .... it's not far from worth it. One good piece of pain - an actor who depicts Joseph Jackson and MAYBE actor like Lisa Marie Presley, though she should have been more than a girl.
