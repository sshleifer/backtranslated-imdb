Who equated it with LOST ARK RAIDERS certainly knew what he was talking about. He could also compare it with some of the adventures of some of the cellulose heroes. "Kay Hoog" resembles more than just Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (Shadow, a reasonable mystery man and the first "Dark Knight") was also thought to be one of Kent Allard. If someone had taken the first name of Savage first, and besides Kent, then you would come to Clark Kent, funny, innit?) Like Indiana Jones, Hoog is not above the objects of ancient ancient civilization (although his thefts are often blatant and less "charming") as Jones). Unfortunately, this two-part is far from the later series (any time) in terms of overall quality. One of the first signs that something is wrong with cinematographic storytelling is a scene in which the horse's desperadones, which are literally breathing in their neck, just look at how Hoog escapes from his clutches with a hot air balloon. Why don't they barely shoot a balloon, there is only one of the many mysteries of filmmaking that interrupt these two films. <br /> <br /> The other side of this two-piece part is even worse than the first. In this case, this was one of the first series and as such it should be cut off a bit, but even the limits of tolerance exist. (At one point, the hero is not captured on the screen but in the story itself! Talk about the corner ...) Fritz Lang is one of the biggest filmmakers; unfortunately for those who admire most of what he did, SPIDER is a bitter pill that really swallows ...
