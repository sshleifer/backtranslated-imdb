Anupam Kher is a great actor, he made his debut at the age of 28, playing at SARAANSH at the age of 50. <br /> <br /> He is now directed by OJJ <br /> <br /> The film has a good plot, but it is regressive <br /> <br /> The theme is dead and Urmila's character looks too up when the stories of Anil-Mahima and Abhi- Tara are too steep and then forgotten. <br /> <br /> The film moves at a snail's pace and starts to drag, but there are several good scenes like the whole conflict between Anil-Farden and Abhishek, where Fardeen says to sell the house <br /> <br /> Abhishek is trying to get a crime and Anil shouts to him <br /> <br /> There are too many climates, even though <br /> <br /> Anupam shows that it is potential but in some way possible Music is fine <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor stands out as always Fardeen tries hard and is okay, but needs to improve Abhishek, it was a difficult pt, people realized that she can act Urmila is fine Mahima and Tara is wasted Waheeda is good
