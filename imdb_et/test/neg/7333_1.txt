The man wonders if his hunky companion is gay. In outdoor sales he finds a ray-gun called "Gaydar". You direct it to the man, pull the trigger and it tells you how they are. He's trying to do that, it works, and he's trying to find out if his colleague is gay ... <br /> <br /> A promising idea that has been destroyed by an unpleasant script (after a promising start) and terrible action. The entire cast text continually crosses its lines continuously. After a while it becomes annoying and embarrassing. The saving grace is that it is short, there is a scene that steals a cat (love him to fall from a kitty bed) and Charles Nelson Reilly is hysterical with his short bit. But none of this saves the movie. I can't recommend it at all.
