Fear and desire are interesting mainly for Kubrick's obsessive, who can pretend to be trapped in the trap of still-coming signs of greatness. Kubrick was right when he wanted to make sure that the movie wouldn't be seen or available on legitimate video. He thought it was embarrassing and amateur and he was right in his assessment. It's a weak and tedious movie - after 68 minutes it feels longer than "Barry Lyndon"! However, it is of historical interest and has real absorbing moments. It's a hard movie to find (there are only "unofficial" copies in circulation), though maybe it can change when Kubrick's property relinquishes relentlessly and is published on the video. Recommended only for Kubrick enthusiasts.
