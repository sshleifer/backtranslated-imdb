I've always been a Bottom fan, grabbing as many videos as I could find from the series in this country. Chemistry between Riki and Ade is always a genius, and the combination of smart writing and totally stupid humor seems to work unsuccessfully. So I sat down to watch this movie very keenly ... and finally I was completely disappointed. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 movie can best be described as lying and poorly directed (sorry, Ade!), but some great moments. Unfortunately, these ridiculous moments will tell you how less the brilliant film is. Dirty starts funny, but eventually it gets a bit boring, just perverted sex jokes to keep things humorous. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie ("green" scenes for those who've seen it) was ... maybe the worst end I've seen in the last ten years. Honestly. It was a joke that was repeated about thirty times, followed by a sudden ending that didn't make any sense (which didn't bother me) and wasn't funny (which did). <br /> <br /> All in all, I was very disappointed with this movie. I will stick to the few brilliant moments contained in it to keep the most pleasant memories I get ... but I have to warn you if you intend to pay your local importer for your NTSC conversion tape. It is much better to spend money.
