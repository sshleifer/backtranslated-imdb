I've been watching movies since I think in the last 10 years, and I have to say I never felt that the bad thing that I felt after watching this particularly big movie was bad, very bad. There were songs and songs there. Nobody should watch this movie. The director has shown that the Germans speak English, which is a debris. The Germans do not speak English. In one scene, there was a white girl who asked Himesh for an autograph. (Obv that he has to give him money) In promo they have been shown to prepare for a laughing rebellion. But I can say that there was only one scene where Himesh laughs for some reason because he thinks he is funny. Hansika is very good. he's like an angel. But too young just 16 years old. If you have a lot of time and do not know what to do, then you should watch this movie or otherwise waste your money
