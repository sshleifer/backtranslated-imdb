"Beautiful country" is a great disappointment. It doesn't come to my expectations. Bihn, a tall muscular man, is an American GI son and a Vietnamese woman during the Vietnam War. We were told that he was treated "less than dust" in Vietnam in the early 1990s, so he went to America to look for his American father. <br /> <br /> Is it like a broken heart? Maybe, but in this movie. I have a hard time connecting emotionally with Bihn because the film is full of clich√© and I just don't understand or believe her. Writing this movie is a complete failure. The plot is full of holes. It captures some of the events on the right footing, trying hard to interfere with the audience's emotions. We're not that stupid and it doesn't work that way. Let's see what the movie is trying to do. So, you don't know Bihn's boat trip (yes, he was in a boat!) Is heavy enough, let's be a storm at night and let the ship shake a little. Still not touched? Good! Take a little boy who suffers from heat, hunger, disease, adult violence in the boat, hopefully doing this trick to touch the audience. Still not touched? You're a heartless SOB, let's ... OK, I don't want to give a movie spoiler, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> The movie is really long and slow. It never tells us why Bihn did not go to find her mother and father until she started looking for her mother and father. What has she done 20 years before she went to Saigon to look for her mother? And guess what? He's lucky and everyone tells him where to find the person he's looking for and he finds someone without scratch. I think the Department of Homeland Security should hire those Vietnamese who helped Bihn. Beautiful country? What? Both Vietnam and America seem to be in Bihni's hell.
