Although it is better than most of the films made on television, "buried in life" is nothing more than a grappling story of a mill. There are so many holes in the plot that makes you wonder why the scriptwriters did not go through multiple rewriting. Finally, it is a nice twist, but it is hardly plausible. <br /> <br /> The action of Jennifer Jason Leigh is terrible, as always, but Tim Matheson shuffles it with a single liner that reminds Jack. Nicholson is "The Shining." Don't bother about that.
