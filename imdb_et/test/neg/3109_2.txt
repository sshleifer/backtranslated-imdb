To be honest, I really didn't have much expectations for this movie, but at the same time I was hopeful. The leadership of Albert Pyun - one of the best-known b-film authors - did not raise my hopes. I mean, how much does Albert Pyun tease it? Yeah, exactly ... but still the movie was promoted with proper pain. Rob Lowe, Burt Reynolds (pre-reborn stardom), Ice-T and Mario Van Peebles. <br /> <br /> It all goes to squat, because the film is so boring and moving so slowly that the energy just seemed to drain out of me, the longer it went. It takes over 90 minutes, but it tells a story that could have been said in 30 minutes. I don't know what Pyun was doing here. I mean, the film drips in an artistically similar style, but it's occasionally blurry and maybe I'm an idiot to wait more for Pyun this time. It seemed to him that he actually had a budget for the material and potentially a huge cast, but it was all wasted. Crazy Six is ​​not a lot of action, it's not really something. <br /> <br /> I think what's the saddest here is that I found the final credits to be the most fun part of the movie. The music score is actually half-decent with some smooth female songs, but the rest is full of waste and the less is better. Avoid.
