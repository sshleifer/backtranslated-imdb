Think of the extremely low rental version of "Heathers" and you have "Pep Squad". It will summarize it. However, I have to give credit when the credit is due. It's a pleasant visual for the film. I liked the cinema, I liked the natural color schemes, I liked the costume designs. But without good action, the film has no redemption value. I look at a film with little visual appeal, with good actors and a sharp dialogue (i.e., "Brothers McMullen" or any Edward Burns film). Actors either say their dialogue in monotone or shout it as they are in a bad soap opera. That's why I don't mind most of the main participants. Let us face the fact that most mainstream actors are the main reason. If they are not "big" actors, they are at least competent. People upset Leo DiCaprio, but when you saw the last movie where he talks about dialogue, how does he read it out of the page? It's a shame, because the director seems to know his things when it comes to misunderstanding (sp). However, I cannot fully praise Steve Balderson (Director). He wrote a manuscript containing some terrible dialogue. He may also be a bit racist because the film has a black principal living in the climax of African-American stereotypes.
