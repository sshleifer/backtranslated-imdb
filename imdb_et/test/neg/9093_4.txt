I really didn't get that movie. The plot is an old woman who tortures someone so long that she is deformed. He dies and he stays in the basement hungry. The months have to pass and the family is moving. The daughter is blind because the father caused the accident. Anyway, this is a guy in the basement who should have died for a long time for all rights. She eats a cat and is now supernatural. He now wants to eat people and have sex. And when the whore dies, the father is guilty. I don't always like movies where someone else is accused of killing, because you're always here with the typical lines "I didn't do it," "I'll never do that," blah blah blah. And the family story can be a lifetime film story.
