It was so bad that it couldn't even be seen. So I say a few phrases about what I saw, and it's up to you to decide. <br /> <br /> Captain Kirk, with a nail and a good bowel, climbs Yosemete El Capitan. Spock meets him halfway through a riding skateboarding float. Kirk falls. Spock flies down, catches him in advance before Kirk hits the head of the ground. Later, tonight, Spock, Kirk and McCoy will eat beans around the campfire. Spock likes beans. Then, Kirk and McCoy sing "Row Row Row Your Boat" and want Spock to join the trilateral harmony. Spock doesn't want to sing. And later that evening he would not agree. "But life is not just a dream, Captain". Should I go? Okay ... Renegade Vulcan, who's going to be a Spock brother, drives a rebellion on a sandy planet - taking hostages. The company's team lands on the planet, and Uhura, who pushes fifty-five and weighs two hundred odd pairs, attracts natives with bare feet. But they can't get a brother who claims he can find God. <br /> <br /> He robs the team and the company. They go to a planet where the great beard manifestation that claims to be God spits fire on Kirk, Spock and McCoy. Spock's sister, who understands that this is not God, but is in itself a form - or something - with a manifestation to destroy it and ... sparks fly. <br /> <br /> When things are too complicated to figure out which klingons are like Lorenzo Lamas ... <br /> <br /> Three Amigos - Kirk, Spock and McCoy - Return to Yosemite to i (I mentioned that Kirk wore a GO CLIMB A ROCK T-shirt?). Spock plays some funky Vulcan guitar, they sing "Row Row Row Your Boat", this time all three by unifying credit rolls.
