This series takes a classical story and changes its garbage. Robin is somehow mystified by the elk-man of the forest and has been subjected to all kinds of druidism and direct satanic episodes. The story is more about avoiding evil sheriff than helping the poor. It's hardly traceable. At the end of Group 2, they kill Robin and replace him with another actor to type all the ridiculousness. For some people, this exhibition may be like a fantasy show, but it is not a Robin Hood show. If you want Robin to fight King Richards for Prince John and Sheriff and if you want Robin to be poor and oppressive, check out the classic series or the latest BBC.
