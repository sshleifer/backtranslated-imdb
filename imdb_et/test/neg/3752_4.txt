This 1950s winger is so bad that it is unintentionally funny. Tom Conway depicts Dr. Gerard, a scientist who makes voodoo indigenous monsters. His poor woman, played by Mary Ellen Kay, is captive in her wacko hubby who doesn't have time but threatens to kill her when she leaves. Along Marla is a murderer of English who has already killed a man in the jungle to find treasure. His idiot boy, Lance Fuller, is on the safari. They hire "Touch" as a guide to Connor (later renamed Mike Connors, Mannix). English is a terrible actor, but hey, nobody else was in the Academy's award-winning performances. "Tap" (I apologize, I can't even name the name without breaking, I mean what ...) gave the bunch a decent performance, and it says a lot. The monster is only brief and the end is the least predictable. I would say that this movie belongs to the movie "It's so bad, it's almost good". It's good in the rain at night if there is nothing else on the pipe.
