I went to see this movie mostly because it seemed so good in trailers. Robin Williams and Barry Levinson should be equal. Instead, he will simply continue to paint Williams' bad films. What's wrong with the movie? What's more, the ensemble's team is doing a good job around Robin, and as usual, Christopher Walken is fantastic. That said, this movie was not just good. I only recommend to see if you want to see what would happen if Jon Stewart ran for president and won. Saying he is not a spoiler because it was a trailer. The concept and idea are really amusing, but that's all. Most of Robin's jokes are reused from his old comedy bits and very few laugh out loud and most of them are just stupid. Like most breastfeeding comedies, all the funny bits are put into the trailer. Really no surprises, just come on! Some of the movies are read by Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn! People were expecting it to be Robin's smile. Instead, it's more Flubber.
