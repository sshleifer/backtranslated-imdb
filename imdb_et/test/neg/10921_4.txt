Although Charlie Chaplin did some very short comedies at the end of the 1910s, others do not. Like his new job and Shanghaied, and I also want The Floorwalker in this category. <br /> <br /> Charlie mistakenly goes to the department store trademark manager (and vice versa). This driver is trying to steal cash at the cashier and run for it, and Charlie is just an honest consumer, but accused of some missing items that other consumers are stealing. <br /> <br /> Laughs at it except for the last few minutes or some great scenes on the escalator. The rest, quite disappointing. <br /> <br /> 4/10
