I and my brother are very big Asian film fans, so when I found this movie in the store, I bought it on a DVD because it sounded very promising and I couldn't wait to watch it. So I watched this movie with my brother and I have to say that at first it was very promising. Both of us really loved this brutal ball in the first scene of the scene. But I think it was all. There are interesting struggles, but this is not an action film, as it claims. Instead, this love movie ... in the clich√© of love that played extremely, even Shakespeare vomit its title. I apologize for your language. By the way: the characters are taken from the street and given 100? playing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I and my brother looked at it until we thought it could only get better. But hell, he never did it. This movie challenged the No. 1 in my and my brothers' worst films, followed only by the "Fantasy Missionary Force" - it doesn't look like that either.
