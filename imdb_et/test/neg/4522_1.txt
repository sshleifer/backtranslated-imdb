Get Smart should be called Get Stupid. The whole movie does not have one funny line or wilt. This movie is so bad that it changes Austin Power's movies from Shakespeare. A few more of these films and Steve Carell can say goodbye to his career. What is Anne Hathaway, what does she do in this movie? He is a good actor but is just terrible. <br /> <br /> Writing is pathetic. There is no one funny, smart or nervous line. There is no good visual disorder. <br /> <br /> Management is terrible. Comedy is based on timing. Someone should tell the director. Every line that should be funny (and not) is supplied with absolutely the worst comic timing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 0 stars
