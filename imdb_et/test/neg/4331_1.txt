A shameful waste of my time as a viewer. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Please don't rent it if you regret it! Guaranteed! I don't know how Kathleen Turner got into that! She is a legitimate actor and people may be attracted to her because of this movie. But it's really better to act like this title never did! It shouldn't have existed!
