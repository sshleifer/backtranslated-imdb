Someone called this movie a "fabell-horror" movie, and I think it's pretty good. This is at least a concept. A group of teenagers, all with their own vice, are struggling with a twisted side brush. He decides to teach teenagers a lesson by making them part of the exhibition. The cool idea, but could have been better. The fate of some teenagers moves too clearly on your face, while other characters could have developed more. The end was also serious. No resolution or big twist or anything. <br /> <br /> But if you have a low budget horror movie, it's pretty fun to watch. If you are a cheese gate, you have to laugh at it. I think one of its mistakes is ... that he takes himself too seriously. This is a stupid film, and if it were a little more self-conscious, I think it would have been better. But at least there are enough clean carnival themes and b-movie monster makeup to keep you looking.
