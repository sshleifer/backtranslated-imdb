The ten steps are basically good enough to be scary for a short time, but filling is just terrible. Dialogue is terrible, and action is so regularly recognized in Ireland's short films. Really very embarrassing bad. The girl must go down from the basement 10 to change the blown fuse. She's calling her father who offers entertainment at dinner. The mother, the "actor", who has very questionable acting skills, answers the phone and, in a loud voice, she says she is not calling when her father tries to impress her boss. An actor who plays as a superior wife emulates very poor mother actions when she tells them that their house is haunted. The rest of the movie is made up of a father who dances down the stairs of his phone. Ten steps are implemented by the technique of camera movement, lighting and music stock, which could be expected below the average horror film. Poor.
