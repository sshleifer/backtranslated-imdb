What I came after watching the film was guilty of conscience. The film has a rather intriguing plot line and a prerequisite, but unfortunately it is a movie that cannot be bombarded with pornography. If you are planning to look at it and have a moral problem with worsening marriage, you will make a big mistake. This is not a type of movie that has a symbolic gender scene that you can skip from a DVD player. At the beginning of the film, Baldwin's character has a video of sexual exploitation without knowing his partner. This tape and other similar tapes continue to appear throughout the unpredictable times of the film. The film seems to be trying to express an opinion on the dignity of women. Ironically, they made several women into prostitutes. I gave it to only 1 instead of 1, because if they had better operated Baldwin's promise, it would have been an interesting film.
