I rented this movie, hoping it would offer some good entertainment and some cool poker knowledge or stories. What I got was watching a documentary on the lives of the average boys who have been really good on the maps. Do I want to see romance with my friends? NO Do I want to see everything in this man's life except poker? NO. Well what you get with this movie. The actor is good with such a low budget. The film never tries to break the mold or do anything original. It just sleeps walking through the script. The end is disappointing and never sees Hungary's mind deeply. Instead, it focuses on what was already evident. He was a drug card whose average life expectancy was not different from that of all other middle strains in Vegas. The film focuses on aspects of his life that were extraordinary to the UN rather than extraordinary. The entire movie scenes make up to 4 minutes of material. Hungary's achievements in winning the WSOP three times seem to be after life. A 10-year-old could better manage this movie. Or perhaps this script was the beginning of the movie's joke rate from the start. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie in Rounders. This is at least a style.
