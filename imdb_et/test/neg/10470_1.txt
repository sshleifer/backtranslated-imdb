Bone Eater is located in the small town of Alabama, where real estate developer Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) is financing the construction of a huge resort. One evening, three of his staff are digging by Riley (Timothy Starks), Hansen (Adrian Alvarado) and Miller (Paul Rae), who discover in the desert when they discover what looks like a tomahawk ax, and unfortunately for them, an ancient American demon bone eater comes and kills they. The local sheriff, Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner), will soon breathe with Krantz when his resort will stop building, and Sheriff Evans will also have to deal with a bone eater demon because he kills everyone he hits ... <br /> <br /> you know I'm a big fan of fear and sci-fi genre, I don't think my opinion is worth more than anyone else (unlike many of IMDb ...) but please believe me when i say that Bone Eater is the worst Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' I've ever seen, and it is at odds with some strong competition. As a fear and sci-fi fan, there are two names that accompany the movie when he casts my backbone down, how bad it is, these names are Jesus, "I have no talents" Franco, who had nothing to do with Bone Eater & Jim Wynorski led the Bone Eater's absolute disaster. In fact, Bone Eater is so bad Wynorski hid under the pseudonym Bob Robertson when the director is as bad as Wynorski hiding under the pseudonym that you know the film must be bad. Where do I even start? Bone Eater is just the worst film I saw this year and is so bad that it is wrong, the story is terrible, the script is sloppy (at one point Sheriff Evans tells Kia to meet in the hospital, but when they meet later, and says, "What are you doing here?", Sheriff Evans says at one point that we are in the twentieth century and that the ancient American natives are meaningless, although in fact we are in the twenty-first century. they kill them, but since he killed all three of them, how did someone else know that it should be passed on to the legend? a little embarrassing. The characters are terrible clich√©s, the small town of Sheriff who saves the day, accompanied by his daughter, who adds some personal motivation and like for Indians, the old wise man, the young hot head who hates the "white man" and the young woman who is the voice of the two who have names like Storm Cloud & Black Hawk The movie is as boring as hell, nothing happens, the story is terrible, it is full of holes in the plot and loses any logic, the kits are terrible, no horror or no idea, no skipping or mystery & Bone Eater is just such a movie that makes you lose to live. <br /> <br /> Bone Eater has some of the worst CGI computer effects I've seen for a while. there is only a selection of bones that have magically clustered on a motorcycle that jumped a big difference with a terrible CGI truck that crashed across the edge of the rock to bones the eater on one side. When a bone-eater needs to accelerate, it causes a large horse to form sand and dust, and drives it! Basically, this is actually a pretty clean idea, but it looks terrible and the scenes even have radio-eat music. At the end, there is one pointless sheriff when sheriff Evans cuts his hand (why?) And this bleeding, but besides, there is no drop of blood inside if a bone eater kills someone they usually just disappear from the dust cloud, boring. A pleasantly silly climate show between Sheriff Evans and a bone-eater must be considered credibly, Sheriff Evans goes to the horse-racing with a tribal war color on his face, while the bone-eater also travels with his own dust horse and has a kind of flexing race that is just bad for it properly described. <br /> <br /> Bone Eater has been filmed in a very blissful, forgotten and steady way about $ 700,000 of the estimated budget. Most of the film takes place in bright sunlight and when you watch it on a decent TV, the wilderness is pretty nice on time. There are several veteran "known" actors who slither here, Boxleitner plays exactly the same role as the much-themed "Creature Feature" Snakehead Terror (2004). he can pay while ex Star Trek man Walter Koenig must be very desperate to accept it. <br /> <br /> Bone Eater is a truly terrifying Creature Feature, where you can't really say much more than to manage it well. The worst movie ever to appear on a Sci-Fi channel and what says nothing?
