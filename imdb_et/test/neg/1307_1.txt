I usually like these fools / brain activities, but it was just too stupid. There were too many clich√©s and the plot didn't really make sense. There were many open ends and the end was extremely poor and steep. We didn't even see if the big master plan worked. We just saw that the main character is his farther away, the professor (who died because of stupidity) (see below). <br /> <br /> One scene disturbed me in particular. Why did the professor have only about 5 minutes of oxygen when he went over the dam manually? And if they had only an oxygen tank containing 5 minutes of oxygen, why didn't he bring them two or three? Then he would have survived? it was a bloody stupid. The film is pretty full of such stupid things. I can't recommend it at all.
