Found this movie for one dollar ($ 1.00) and the movie was a waste of time. Reb Brown, (Mark Hardin), played a military advisor in South America and was successful in hit by a rebel soldier who was operating in a dense jungle. But Mark joins the opposite side after some terrible torture or women and men. In one scene, when Mark has drinks at the hotel bar, his eyes look at the sexy long legs Sandra Spencer (Shannon Tweed), "Dead Sexy", 01. Mark and Sandral have extreme hats to each other and even passionate love for some very hard rocks without would have time for bed amenities. It's a terrible movie and it's not worth the time to watch IT.
