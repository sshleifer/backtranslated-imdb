This film, although well-photographed and well-behaved, was terrible. I felt like I was looking at a car accident - sure I look, but I really wanted to turn my head. The plot leaves little to be desired, was very separate and the end was debilitating. Although it matched the film's tone, I hoped to improve this movie. I still do not understand what references to rabies and a child are at the beginning of the film by the fox. Fifteen minutes of land that didn't really do much. It's really sad to see a movie that has fine actors and a beautiful set that wastes such a terrible, terrible story. There is not much more to say about this movie. Save yourself time and see c-span. It's more exaggerating.
