I wanted to like this movie. I really, really. I was so excited when I saw a preview that frightened me of fear. But when I saw the real movie, I was disappointed. Actors are stylish and comedy tests are inevitably in place and forced. And I'm sorry, but the guy on the back of the plate is not funny or scary, it's just stupid. I grew up on the Bell Witch legend, so I know a lot about it. There are many facts in the film, but this film should have been much better. For example, the entire birthday scene lasts about fifteen minutes, adds nothing to the plot or story, and should have been on the floor of the cutting room. A heavier supplier could have made a decent movie out of this mess. <br /> <br /> Please understand that I am not in any way, form or form involved with another Bell Witch movie, and I am not trying to "attack" this IMDb list. I'm just saying this as it is.
