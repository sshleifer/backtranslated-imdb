It is quite rare that this film is so useless that I promised to use negative results with IMDb. In fact, I think back to this film and I can't really think of a movie that was so little. Action: Your right of birth. Direction: No. Plot: No. This movie does not give it anything if you take it as a serious movie, it is often the case with movies of this genre, but most of these movies can be viewed as they are comedy and you can laugh when pathetic characters and situations are and almost get your time worth. This film is so empty that it doesn't even fit this purpose. I have to give it -1/10, three points lower than any other film I've ever rated. I really feel that the staff involved in this movie should pay me for 83 minutes what I look at. I don't really have words to describe how bad it is. No one should ever look at it for any reason.
