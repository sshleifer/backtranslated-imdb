I bought a part of this movie e-bay from a lot about twenty fears, all about one dollar. Looking at it, my first impression was that it was probably in the late 1980s. Later I started thinking - Linkin Park posters on the wall and everything else suggesting I made a newer film. Realizing that the flick became an unbearable torment. The last 3 minutes were the longest in the history of the film - the film simply refused to stop. Is there a genre like "children's horror"? In this case, this movie is definitely. If there are parents who are perverted enough to introduce their offspring to horror, I suggest that it be perfect for children aged 6-8. The only thing I really liked was Greg Cipes, who was too good an actor for such a nostalgic retro-bottom.
