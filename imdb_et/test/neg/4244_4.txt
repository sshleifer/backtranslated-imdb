In the 1950s and 60s, in the 70s and even in the 80s, war films were produced in the former Yugoslavia, worshiping the heroism of the partisans? civilians who turned out to be fighting against invading German troops. Hajrudin Krvavac, who is generally known only in Eastern Europe, led quite a few of these "partisan" stories; unfortunately, only some of them were exported to Europe and the United States. The "Eagle Battle" is a rare, low-budget look at the formation and exploitation of partisan forces. <br /> <br /> Marshal Tito states that partisans must be created against the German luftwaffe. in the sky over Yugoslavia. The group of former pilots is joining forces with two small biplanes and begins the abduction of enemy bases and convoys; For several months, a series of pilots and planes will be added, which will eventually form a large air force. Maybe it's history or maybe it's fable? Whatever it is, it is not sure that it is convincing, but a large number of actors trying to do it. <br /> <br /> The film opens up against the fired partisans with a German shooter. The nuts and bolts of the plot come together almost immediately, and for a short time, the audience is dealing with a series of rather patriotic scenes. Then the action begins, and this title quickly changes to another low budget adventure. All the characters are familiar clichés: Major Dragan (well-known Bekim Fehmiu) is our typical patriotic, heroic leading man. He explodes machine-powered aircraft and even has an airy duel Klauberg (Radko Polic), a completely predictable and bright tip with an equally predictable result. Other partisans are familiar: Ljubisa Samardzic ("Neretva Battle") is Zare, hotshot playboy; Bata Zivojinovic ("Põrgu River") is a Voss, a veteran flyer who comes out of wood now when his country needs him; and Rados Bajic ("The Day That Shook the World") is Dalibor, a young messenger who moves through the ranks, eventually becoming an experienced fighter. The characters and their stories are familiar to all war fans, and Krvavac is not trying to build on these stereotypes. Cast works a fair job and, despite a two-dimensional script, each player is interesting and fun to watch. Especially Bajic has some great moments? when he takes his first plane as a creator, and later when he is forced to land after the pilot's killing. The plot has only a series of air strikes against Germans and subsequent countermeasures. </p> <p> </p> <p> Krvavac competes with activity sequences competently with actual material and miniature effects. Unfortunately, the miniatures are so cheap and wrong that transitions between actual air photography and toy airplanes are dirty and ridiculous. Some staging and bombing scenes are shockingly real, while large scale dog competitions with performance indicators are simply pathetic. Occasionally, "machine gun" smokers are so large that smoke creates the entire plane of the model. Worse still, editors often place fighters' shots in real material. Although aircraft are usually in the right perspective, they surround the annoying glow that prevents reality tests. All of these activities are set on an incredibly familiar and annoying score for Bojan Adamic. <br /> <br /> "The Eagle Battle" also suffers from a very poorly modified English version. No 28 minutes first of all? Cutting a movie from just 130 minutes to just 102. The missing segments were carelessly cut off and the cutting seems very sloppy. The music marks are sharply interrupted and the scenes are subtracted before they are resolved. In the last third of the film, the story breaks down, and only a few essential actions can try to save it from a complete misunderstanding. Then there is duplication? all the scenes around the partisans are dubbed in English (rather badly), but in German, there are several long scenes in favor of subtitles. The film might have been much more meaningful if the German sequences were cut out instead of the important scenes around the partisans. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Krvavac works quite well on outdoor material. There is never a moment when the audience feels on the stage. In particular, the German Luftwaffe foundations are expansive, with thousands of Messerschmitt fighters and leather flying jackets. The landscape is fresh and green, and Krvavac is not afraid to shoot scenes at an extremely wide angle, or just by far just to convey the scope of the battle or the long track. Particularly the German ambush of the party unit stands out, as is the sequence in which Zare and Dalibor escape from the enemy base. <br /> <br /> Since this is a home video, "Eagles Battle" is just one of many stories about the Yugoslav partisan movement. Nothing changes this from other crops, and the terrible special effects and drastic editing make it acceptable below. Try to avoid this if you can't find a full-length copy.
