A bunch of nursing pupils get together in their spare time to grab each other with electrical cables and die. Then they rest for a period of brain death and then start CPR and heart massage and bring each other back. The fact that Julia Roberts was in this movie should say all this. FLATLINERS is like a GHOST group. Everyone wants to see their dead relatives and visit their old dead friends, so what better way to do this than the number of medical students kill you in five minutes and then bring you back to life. The rest of the film has predictable communication problems, as well as predictable "GEE MAYBE IF we keep every other killing, one of those days ONE ON US DEAD?" D'OH !!! This movie should have been called BRAIN DEAD. The fact that the characters were portrayed as medical scientists made me wonder whether they had gone to a foreign correspondent school to get their degree. The only thing that had to laugh at this movie was that they didn't stay in the fingers of the fingers to "die". This movie would have been an excellent triple comedy STOOGES comedy.
