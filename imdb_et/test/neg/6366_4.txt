Tom has started to taste delicious Jerry sandwiches when a huge predator falls down and flies with his snack. Not at all satisfied when his similar stole immediately stolen from his nose, Tom leaves in surveillance, deciding to restore his mousel morsel. <br /> <br /> As far as I love Tom and Jerry, I have to say it's a little smelly: the story is pretty everyday; it leads to a poorly designed peripheral character with no charm; and it slips the old "dress comic book up as a woman to death." In my opinion, "Flirty Birdy" contestants are "Fraidy Cat" and "Mouse in Manhattan" to become the title of the weakest Tom and Jerry capers.
