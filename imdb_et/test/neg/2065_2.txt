I was extra with this movie, but I wish I wasn't garbage. the worst thing about this movie is music, but the exemplary, script, editing, management and story are terrible. The main reason this is bad is that the budget is so small and the only way to make a good movie with a low budget is a good script. the script, which should have been before the movie, is not funny, I never laughed. what makes me laugh is how the makers think the most important thing was to make a film that cares about whether its all the garbage is. the film needed a budget of about one million pounds and a better writer. The only reason why I didn't give one of the ten films was because I felt sorry for someone who loses a hundred grandfathers, doing it when you go and see it just to make sure you're drunk at that time. ha ha
