I haven't seen this movie for years, the last time I was really drunk after a 5 pint tenant in my local Witherspoon, but even though it was quite terrible. this movie is quite terrible compared to other critters, the first two were pretty good, 3 was pretty crap, but the miles were better. The story goes 53 years after the criticism 3, Charlie was the bounty hunter of the previous films, discovered by a space-based team for a space miner, people and board. If there are the last galaxy eggs left on the galaxy that Charlie has brought out of the ground, we have critters on the spacecraft, which shows an obvious "stranger" hanging and a lot of terrible FX, and you did a lot of this movie briefly. the only good thing is when we re-introduce (or believe in) UG who is now a villain and wants to keep culprits instead of destroying them
