So pathetic is not even funny. From the first scene of the movie I knew I was in a bad time. Thank you, I saw this movie only on TV. The story was terrible, not to mention exemplary. It was terrible. In this move, a very unreal and unusual thing happened, for example. The woman sticks under the door with a whip and whispers the guy a little and he just tells the keys. I like GET REAL. The creators trying to make a futuristic city deepened my film. In fact, the only good thing about this film has been the struggle that was in itself flat. All I asked myself when I was watching the movie was "when it goes out!"
