This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. Even the fact that he was hangover didn't help. The plot is void if it exists. A relatively large number of beautiful girls can't help. I think seeing the episode of the temptation island with the sound turned on would give the same kind of experience. DO NOT see this valve
