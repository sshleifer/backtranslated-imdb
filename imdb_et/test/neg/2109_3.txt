The film begins in Mexico, where the girl is cursed, she spits the snake through a green jelo and her friend is trying to pick up those madness. He does nothing but does a terrible language that does nothing, so they decide to cross the border to get on the train to make his way to L.A to see his uncle lift up the curse. Comic fun. This movie is the same snakes over and over again! It's a garden of snakes and pythons that never bite. They all change the sound of rattlesnakes, which makes no sense. The whole movie has some funny features, some weak effects, but the most important thing is the endless end that will leave you with a pleasant WHAM BAM, HECK JUST HAPPENED !!!!! The whole movie is about 1, but the end is 10, so my crazy math will be at all 3. If the blocker has nothing else you want, grab it for frantic entertainment!
