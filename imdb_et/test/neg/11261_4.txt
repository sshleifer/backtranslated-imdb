I've read all of Dave Robicheaux's novels and found that James Lee Burke is my favorite contemporary fiction writer. I've also visited New Iberia and much of Acadiana to see more of these books. Needless to say, I assumed I saw "Electric fog", especially since I thought Tommy Lee Jones would be great than Robicheaux. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed. The story was very dirty; the interaction with the "Confederate Ghosts" was low and lost the influence and nobility it added to the book; and Tommy Lee Jones was funny, inexpressible and difficult to understand as DR. The best way to describe this forgotten movie is to add your "ditto" to a previous user comment that this movie was like one of those old TV movies. I thought Jill St John or Cameron Mitchell would show up at any time. <br /> <br /> Location settings were accurate and photography was occasionally captured by the nature of the steamy bay, the smell of joints and the eerie. Southern Louisiana Cemeteries. Too bad a story divorced and Tommy Lee's sub-parameter disturbed the region's unique mood and spice. <br /> <br /> Next to the final remark: In the novels, Dave Robicheaux's nickname is "Streak" because of the silver-gray hair resolution on one side. (Just like Sopranos Paulie Walnuts would only appear if they only saw him on the profile.) Tommy Lee had no such line on this film, probably because editors are James Lee Burke's fans and they sprinkled the band after he knows the bad imitation of Dave Robicheaux by Mr Jones. <br /> <br /> Final Comment: Although I find that Alec Baldwin is pompous and unpleasant in most roles, he was much better at Robicheaux "Prisoners of Heaven" than Tommy Lee was "Electric mist." more exciting, equally credible performances and a more expressive atmosphere than this new film. <br /> <br /> "Electric mist" is good to see if someone feels "veging out" there is nothing better on the TV. But then there are infomercials.
