Surprisingly, Kieslowski is this film because of my disappointment, which is sometimes a weird and sometimes clich√© script that sometimes seems to be a bad watch. There's one little boy. She lives with her relatives, but she is lonely and every night she watches a woman who lives over her building. Feels! she wants her. He is one of the youngsters who is not good at communicating with the opposite sex. But she likes this woman when she comes to her house, Tomek gets pain. Then we understand that Kieslowski tells us about an isolated young boy who needs a woman to flirt or who loves a mature woman. He does nothing else because he may know that it is his salvation. One day he stops this woman, maybe he seems to be a shy boy, but he proves he is not so he explains almost everything to him. He reads and refuses him. Everything is as realistic as other Kieslowski films, no problem. The problems start when Tomek visits him, a young boy who falls in love with a mature woman (but not covered by love) becomes a story of a lonely young shopper who falls in love with a mature woman, at first she refuses, but after a short time she starts to change her mind. This U-Turn makes the movie cliche first. Tomek's personality is strange? or the result of bad observation? I am disappointed with this character, this is my opinion and I will try to say why. When she goes to her house, Magda treats her very kindly. He asks what do you want from me? Kiss Me? to love me? to go with me? Here I remember people who say he is femme fatale. Look? Returning to the scene, Tomek rejects all the suggestions. Why? Because he's shy? I don't believe it, but his communication is blunt, OK. Apart from the feet scene at home, some events make the film out of this goal. I think the purpose of the film is (it should have been a story) to show us that there are people who suffer from absence and save this situation is not easy for men because of lack of communication and special failure. I mean, this movie says at this point? It's blurry and frustrating. It can be seen that he is not a hunger for love or for a woman or a sex. Then what? And the suicide attempt scene supports this weakness. Because he touches his feet, he wants to kill himself! By the way, as I mentioned earlier, some say Magda is a femme fatale. Not at all. He's trying to make Tomek happy. Does he avoid contact with him? No. Does he offend him? No. Does he entertain him? No. And does he deceive him? No. She has problems with her (former) lover so she is not O.K. But he doesn't take revenge on Tomek. He's not an angel but a femme fatale.
