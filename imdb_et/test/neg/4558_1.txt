I'm scared of the number of people who consider this movie decent ... much less! Do most people even have basic standards for watching a movie? I just don't know anymore. <br /> <br /> This "commercial product" really does not deserve to be named. Giving Dean Cain a talent is a serious injustice for anyone with talent. I've had a lot of respect for Lori Petty, but most of it has gone through the pipes. At least his role was very small. Maybe he had an invoice that was desperately needed for a reward. <br /> <br /> The ignorance I saw while watching Firetrap was amazing. Let me start by getting it off my chest: if you can't show the fire realistically, don't show it at all. Okay?!! It is embarrassing for everyone involved to show flat effects that do not even come close to simulating the actual incinerator. <br /> <br /> Some interesting tidbits: 1. The farmhouse opens the door to a large storage room and finds the whole room in flames. What is he doing? He's trying to put out his fire with his bones. 2. The same caretaker (who knows that there is a fire in the building) comes later on to the door marked "DANGEROUS MATERIALS". His brilliant mind tells him that opening this door would be great. Big mistake! 3. The woman gives a fantastically generous $ 100,000 donation to the tomb, but ... she carries the fur for a career event they hold! (Do people who care about animals do not fall into such a thing?) 4. Many people in the film are forced into the array with a massive terrace, which even the electromagnetic impulse (!!) could not penetrate. Yet they have a spacious air fan that leads directly to the back of something that anyone could look at. It certainly seems like a loss of security. <br /> <br /> I could go ahead, but I've grown tired of this flat movie. Our "hero", whom we should rejoice, is a criminal in the career, trying to kill some police officers early. What a swelling man! If the public wants to rub their mind, they have more power. I just wish I could delete it from memory. 1/10
