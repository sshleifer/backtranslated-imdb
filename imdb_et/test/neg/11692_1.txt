Oh, how terrible this movie is! I don't know if it's a horror movie or a drama, a story, and both genres aren't very well created! The story doesn't move, it's slow, boring and sleepy from start to finish. This movie pulls me very much! But I really liked the camera, it is authentic, fresh and clear, the actor is great, the little boy was a great performer of this movie, but it hasn't jumped from my seat. But this movie puts me on a pillow, puts it in bed and sleeps up to the credit roll ... <br /> <br /> boring! Don't look! I'll tell you, this movie was so good! <br /> <br /> 1/10
