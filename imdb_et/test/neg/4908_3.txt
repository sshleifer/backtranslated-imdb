[Warning contains spoiler] <br /> <br /> I did not feel any compassion for any character, including the main one who gets his girlfriend v.quickly's death (but it's OK when he attacks a former prostitute from the casino where he works) . The main character is depicted as a wonderful intelligent writer who pulls into the network of fraud while his monologue is written. I can not say that I buy a book, maybe it would be better to have a voice (which slightly cuts to tell a little bit of a movie that you could not understand through your book) had 52 different individuals represent the card generated by each card, but I land. Ultimately, there was a twist where the main character was created close to him, but because I didn't want his character so much according to this point (I found that this movie was not able to please anyone, all the characters are one-dimensional zombies) that I really didn't care about and was glad the movie was over. <br /> <br /> Plus points: English actress from ER who makes a sore South African accent Minus points: irritating film
