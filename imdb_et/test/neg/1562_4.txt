Plot: There are four people in the elevator. One of them is a businessman, annoying who is aggressive and complains about everything and everyone and is a walked sample of distilled stress and hostility. Then she is a colleague, a woman who is much more pleasant in nature. Teenage Rebel, who just broke a coke in the machine and just had a presence, manages a businessman mad and an older man who just stole 100,000DM makes up the rest ... <br /> <br /> The movie is all about how they can cope with their problem when the time goes on and without success in the outdoor environment when the lights go out and when the cables start to click one after another ... And yet, it's not too exciting. Characters are stereotypes. The story is stupid and unlikely (how could so many things go so wrong in one elevator?). You don't like the characters very much, you just hate them. And all the twists of the plot don't help with excitement, they are just foolish excuses to fill in a few minutes with the dialogue, because the screenwriters are left out of inspiration and ink out of a full-length film placed in the elevator. <br /> <br /> We just hope that "Phone Cabinet" is a better job ...
