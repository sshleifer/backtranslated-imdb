First of all I would like to say that I didn't get the edition I thought I had chosen the Italian version of the R2 version, but what really arrived was the release of Britain from 1998 - claiming it was a special edition - I didn't know it was UK DVD edition - but the allowed biod wasn't really on the disc - just a couple of trailers. Anyway - just like myself in the movie - as I recovered from "Night TRain Murders", my second genital mutilation thriller appears this month - this time (in Italian), British married schoolgirls and teacher Fabio Test - (unlucky) married, but nailing one of his students - becomes the main suspect. Joachim Fuchsberger is a case detective. Sorry to say I was less than entranced. It was traceable, but it was more than equally impossible, and besides the above-mentioned grueling character, the "surprise" killing of Cristina Galbo, which is actually "violated" with the cover of the DVD, says Grrrrrr !!!! and the surprise debt that made the "victims" into a new light - I thought it was very routine. However, it does not allow me to "follow" two. Karin (Hannibal Brooks) Baal and Camille (I spit my grave) Keaton.
