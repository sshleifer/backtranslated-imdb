I was told by a friend of the film who saw it this weekend. He told me it was so bad that I had to see it! So I went to the auction site and bought the movie. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It makes you laugh if it really doesn't. Terrible action and terrible story. In addition, he sees something like Michael Jackson? <br /> <br /> I still recommend buying this movie for fun. Van Peebles is a joke in this movie. <br /> <br /> Robots can't bluff ... PSYCHE! <br /> <br /> I have to say that the special effects are really amazing ... PSYCHE! The DVDs were probably even when this movie came out, but if I had my way, it would be a release of VHS for people, it's bad!
