Take your camcorder, turn off all the lights in your house, and movie makers moving around with flashlights for an hour and a half and you have a basic idea of ​​how this movie looks. Such a movie is very irritating. To be fair, there are scenes of daylight at the beginning and end of the movie. I like scary movies and creature functions, but it just didn't do anything for me. Very sorry. I really tried it. There doesn't seem to be a lot of land there if we have to look out of it. Did not learn any characters too much, so it does not matter if we lose one or two along the way. This is not the worst film in the world. "Open Water" holds this title right now.
