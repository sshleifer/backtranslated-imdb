Have I seen a worse movie? No, I can't say that. It was pathetic. If the director is still alive: 1. He shouldn't be. 2. He should be ashamed. 3. God, how would I like to take my 2 completely wasted time with my $ $. <br /> <br /> To give you some "movie" references: <br /> 1. (I'm a man) and I'd give myself a cardboard when I open my urethra before I look at it again ( seriously). <br /> <br /> 2. It has some well-known names (Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio). They don't help and their career in the cinema after that "movie" is officially over. <br /> <br /> 3. Dialogue is the worst I've ever heard. "I want to ejaculate your bosons." Which writer is on this film? Did he still use phonics and get his letters confused to make these terrible sentences? Or did he try to kill the director by the few people who saw it? <br /> <br /> 4. Look back at this "movie". Because I PROMISE you that you don't want to look at it. <br /> <br /> 5. This "movie" would make Helen Keller up and walk out of the theater. <br /> <br /> 6. The movie set looks like an adult-sized McDonald playground. I was just waiting for this so-called "Dracula" to fall into the ball chamber at some point. <br /> <br /> 7. I also like to have headphones with wires that go into their mouths in the year 3000. There is no Bluetooth, no wireless headset, the brain is not placed in chips, but they use headphones borrowed from a telemarketing agency in 1983 (Nice job). reading it.) <br /> <br /> 8. I do not know who was responsible for the special effects, but I could have done better with my VHS camera without battery in my backyard. <br /> <br /> 9. I was a Catholic before this "movie". But after seeing it, I know that there is no God, because if it were, he wouldn't let that movie. I'm an atheist now. <br /> <br /> 10. I'm honest, I can't talk to the end. The last time I tried to explain it, I fell into the coma. <br /> <br /> The people who are bored, but curious (or brave), but many laughing at you, understand that you can get out of this movie, DON'T HERE. It has literally destroyed my life. PREVENT ALL EXPENSES! <br /> <br /> Comment to the director: I hate you. You've ruined my life. After watching it, I feel empty. My wife and children have abandoned me and hated me because I could not see it or move hard. I lost my job, my dignity and above all my pride. I will never give you forgiveness in this life or in the next (which does not look good on my new beliefs).
