If you loved the 60-year version of The Time Machine, don't waste your time; like last year's "Apostles Planet", it is "redesigned" and not better. And like "Planet ...", his leading actor is disgracefully unsuccessful and leading; Guy Pearce, an excellent range, is wrong for this role, giving a one-off result that invokes zero compassion; he is so moist and serious and has no (supposedly) amazing things he sees that you don't believe for a moment that he is experiencing them. Worse still, whose idea was to resemble David Spade and Calista Flockhart's love child? Nice actress, here she is sick, which is, believe it or not, great attention. Frankly, the man looks seriously ill and is taken brutally. He shares absolutely no chemistry with the people on the screen, as a direct result of a result that is not in sync with anyone else. Unfortunately, even if it is the right person to lead, this movie is probably not loaded with such a totally inert director - the whole scene is not going anywhere and is poorly realized - and a scenario that is completely worse, scattered and sometimes inconsistent - at any time you do not care about this movie, because the only thing that is NOT a way to develop character! In the original, you need to know Eloid, so you knew about them and knew your fear for Morelock; here, when the film highlights several times, they are nothing but sheep and act accordingly. If you are not a member of PETA, scared sheep are ALL entertainment! <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba makes her film debut as well as she can, but like everyone else in this mess, especially Jeremy Irons (if she's the leader of Morelocks who looks like "The Mummy Returns"), why then HE looks like Edgar Winter's long lost brother?) Is completely destroyed. The money that was spent on endless "special" effects that put $ 70 million spent on the film was also wasted; they are equally weak, obvious and convincing. And then the look of the film is poorly captured, its artistic direction and sets are just "there" and its costumes are typical of the design. There is no original idea or idea on the screen or screen. It's not even fun the most! (Filmmakers now use the popular Orlando Jones as a "comic", but, as usual, Jones is irritating and just HOW his electricity-driven character lives in a world that seems to be without electricity?) <br /> <br /> inanimate, boring, sterile and confusing thing: were they ever REMAKE "Apeside Planet" ??? (At least one who had some good performances)! <br /> <br /> SPOILER! * The ultimate insult (after the head-shaking terrible, not to mention comfortable, ending)? Not only do they have BARELY features with changing clothing numbers, but they also have an anachronistic, horrible glass-n-chrome hole machine! (When the "Sopranos" had a time machine, this is exactly what it would look like.) Pathetic ...
