* Spoilers - sorry! * The first word you liked while watching a movie is “Gremlins”. This is the only movie I've seen in four movies, but I enjoyed it. It wasn't too difficult because I hadn't seen the last two, but I thought it was a pretty good movie. <br /> <br /> Critters starts with a man, his son and a daughter who stay on holiday (although it turns out they arrive at home - what I have no idea what went on in hell)) Girl meets boy (Leo DiCaprio plays) and they go to the nearby forest in the horse. They meet the strange one who tells them they are cautious and things are bright. He seems a bit psychotic and when I was in that situation, I wouldn't want to talk to him. Critters steals a girl and a boy driving a car and arrives at their apartment. They hide in the basement and kill it lazy. Then they kill the fat woman and the father of the girl. They are considered taller and taller in the apartment until they hide in the attic. Critters eat stuff in the kitchen (gremlins kitchen scenes spoiled ???!) And I don't remember (not a good thing) but I'm sure they will have to go back. Anyway, they can get out and save. The psychotic boy comes back and before he kills the last two criters he is told he can't, because they are at risk and he sends them home. lazy boy died because there were quite a few annoying signs that I would personally kill. This is an exciting and exciting movie to watch. But if you are looking for a better version of this genre, I recommend gremlins for movies. Sorry!
