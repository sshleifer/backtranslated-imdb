Frederick Forsyth's books are always so complexly drawn, twisted and usually surprising. There was nothing like this adaptation. <br /> <br /> So much of what was great in the book (Monk's history and betrayal agents, a plot that influenced the outcome of the Russian election) was completely accommodated. Instead, it is a brand new plot of biological weapons that were quite large. <br /> <br /> Forsyth's main characters always acted in the shadows, forever, just at the hands of antagonists. The joy of his books has always been the mechanism for fulfilling these tasks. This film was premature to the armed forces and motorists. <br /> <br /> The Swayze monk could also have hung around his neck with the sign "I am SECRET AGENT" for all the attention he himself called on the film. And with all this attention, the time it took for the rogues to follow him was surprising. <br /> <br /> This film was powered by energy, so I'll give it "1" instead of "3". It was also good to see some of the sub-executives, such as Patrick Bergin, Ben Cross, Michael York and Barry Morse. <br /> <br /> I hope that someday someone will justify the customization of Forsyth's movie as "Day of the Jackal" did.
