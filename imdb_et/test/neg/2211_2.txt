The collapse opens up at the scene of scientists preparing a major test of a missile system designed to deviate asteroids if they were on the ground during a collision. Nathan (Vincent Gale) mentions some doubts about him, but the test seems to be unobtrusive. Then the asteroid breaks down and the biggest piece is pushed into the direct collision track with the ground. Fortunately, the big stone jumps from the outer surface of the ground and ricochet into space. Unfortunately, it is only enough to change the orbit of the earth and the planet is moving closer to the sun. <br /> <br /> Although all this is over their heads, Los Angeles policeman Tom (Casper Van Dien) and Mick (Greg Anderson) are in the game. They should gather evidence against a suspected drug dealer, but the deal they look at is quickly divided into a shooting game. Later, Tom takes a few minutes to interview the local television register, who is also his friend Carly (Stefanie von Pfetten). <br /> <br /> In the middle hospital where Mick is being treated for minor injury, Tom has a short conversation with his former girlfriend Bonnie (Venus Terzo), a sister. He tells him he's worried that their 17-year-old daughter, Kimberly (Amanda Crew), is looking for a man named CJ (Ryan McDonell). When Tom explains to Bonnie that he discovered, CJ has a criminal record, he's a little worried. <br /> <br /> But it's not long before everyone has anything else to worry about. The temperature is rising rapidly all over the world. Carly is one of the first non-scientists to learn what's really going on. Nathan, his brother, calls on him to say he can have the chance to survive. Carly calls Tom; he will of course contact Bonnie. <br /> <br /> In a relatively short order, the dirty group is on the road. Before they can achieve their ultimate goal, they have to go through the looters' tapes, deal with catastrophic water shortages and be able to drive at high enough temperatures to kill. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Dien is a good looking guy and I enjoyed him at Starship Troopers. This may be because it is good in good scenes. It may also be because he didn't talk much about this movie. At Meltdown, he has unfortunately provided enough rows in situations that are dramatic enough to show his average ability to act. Amanda Crew is also fine and Ryan McDonell is not bad either. Vincent Gale and Stefanie von Pfetten are both relatively good, but Venus Terzo is unfortunately parallel to Van Dien. <br /> <br /> What actually makes or breaks a movie is the story and script. Although the story here is okay and actually has a real potential, the script is just terrible. The scientific part of the scientific literature does not exist, starting with an asteroid, which pushes the earth out of orbit and increases with the idea that "the gravitational balance of the solar system" can pull the earth back to its normal orbit over time ". "If LA temperature rises to 120 degrees, cars start to cope. <br /> <br /> You know what's worse than bad science? Bad continuity. Okay, really hot. Why are people in the movie not only long sleeves but also jackets Why people are dragging 11 bottles of water instead of home taps Why are the streets completely empty, but the motorways are full? And why are unexploded highways full? It's almost superfluous to say that kits, costumes and production values ​​were good, especially when it only forces me to say that there were no changes, mostly combine it with mediocre action, a terrible script, low end special effects, totally irrational plots and bad changes, and what do you have? The film is even smaller than the sum of its remarkable part. say I can't recommend Meltdown: annihilating days for anyone. <br /> <br /> POLITICAL REMARKS: Here it is mentioned that Congress finally cut wallets loose enough to fund the tests that start filming. Although the tests conducted here were completely irresponsible (targeting an asteroid doll and the unknown large rocks are far from irresponsible and approaching crazy), the fact is that such scenarios are a very serious threat to the planet. Unfortunately, we've watched almost all nearby asteroids that could worry some day in some orbit; and our ability to encounter something in a collision course with us is at best limited. <br /> <br /> If we discover that we are going to hit, we literally have no system to solve it. We cannot bring the nuclear rockets that we can launch; the space shuttle is absolutely impossible to go beyond the orbit of the earth and, if so, we could not run them sufficiently or launch them quickly enough. I am not great if the government does something within its constitutional powers, but I think that defending the planet from fires from our space can be interpreted as state protection, isn't it? Family Suitability: Collapse: Destruction Days are rated as "Violence". Frankly, I found nothing other than a fairly typical T-rated video game. If your teenagers want to see Meltdon and you can't talk about it, R-rating shouldn't convince you. However, it is not a good idea to leave young children in the room with their older siblings. Although the shootings are not essentially too graphic, some dead bodies are.
