Martin Campbell, Director, is responsible for this terrible flick. After seeing some of his credit in later years, it must be one of his first productions. He had more than a decent job, but he had no idea what he was doing. There were scenes that didn't make any sense at all. Where was his head ............... he was a drug? I was looking forward to this movie because of Oldman and Bacon. Maybe this short shooting scheme and Campbell just had to "beat". I can't imagine the story that Campbell drew was even the story the writer wrote. Oldman & Bacon, with the rest of the pain, must slip into their chairs while they go to screen. As one poster pointed out, Karen Young made a pretty good stand with Bacon. He really "let go". It's unfortunate that I have to fill more space to stay within IMDb's necessary guidelines because I don't have anything to say about this non-tracking movie. Criticizing the frightening flick does not have to be forced to be a "windbreaker" and I want IMDb to change the number of words to criticize.
