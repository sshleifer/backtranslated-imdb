I just looked at Loneome Dove, return to Loneome Dove, Laredo Streets and Dead Man's Walk. Everything is great. This unfortunate junk was made inexpensively and malfunctioning. Despite the fact that Caption Call plays every time each of them quickly won. In Dead Man's Walk, boys are incredibly younger versions of experienced Texas riders. In Comanche Moon, they are just a few chubby redheads. I had to stop viewing. This is an unfortunate end to an otherwise big franchise.
