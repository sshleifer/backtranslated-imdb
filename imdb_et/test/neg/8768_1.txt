The other reviewer was absolutely right about that. Writing was terrible, the behavior was terrible, the subject was terrible. The actors saw that they didn't really stay in the movie, as they were almost *. There were some unique camera effects, but they weren't quite bold (or what was the story), and they were not produced very well. <br /> <br /> I think they were trying to get back to the success of other eschatologically influenced films (Omega Code, Left Behind) (can I say?). And yes, it makes the Christians embarrassing in producing such films. I don't recommend this movie to anyone, especially to a non-Christian.
