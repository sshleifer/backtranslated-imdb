First, Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst leader, Plan 9 From Space Space will not tolerate. Coleman Francis deserves this title. I'll show you B, Glen or Glenda. <br /> <br /> The first part of the movie consists of surprisingly thought-out cross-sectional research, especially since it was made in 1953. The last 15 minutes of the movie are also not bad as well. <br /> <br /> This doesn't mean the film has no problems. Bela Lugosi was a completely stranger, intonating, odd line. Poor Bela even seemed to be not sure what was going on from time to time. The action was decisive for the wood, though not worse than the universal B film. The long dreams that make up the movie in the middle were completely odd; more than a vaguely threatening stag movie as a dream. Alan / Ann's story, the assumed original focus of the film is about quality. <br /> <br /> No, Ed Wood Jr. not the worst director ever. He was able to make a serious social statement at least in part of this film. When Coleman Francis tried to do this at night on the Mundo Fine train (aka Red Zone Cuba), it just ended with chaos. Glen or Glenda is at least traceable without Robot support.
