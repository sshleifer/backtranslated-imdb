If you mean seeing this movie, my advice is not. <br /> <br /> For me, the film was not able to judge this level on every level and it was a reminder of how terrible the British (and Irish) are. the movies are. Forgettable tripe is the best I can say. If it had been on TV, I'd do something interesting after five minutes. I saw this movie with a group of friends and read the press previews to be critical and hopefully go for a fun 90 minutes. But oh dear ..... <br /> <br /> Like comedy, it wasn't funny if the thriller was a stupid story sloppy and lazy. Like a love story totally unbelievable. Most as "surprisingly smelly" he had both style and charm. Gambon and Caine did what they had to do to play their money ... Gambon and Caine. Is it just me, but after playing East Gangsters and boys, Michael Caine won't leave you cold? <br /> <br /> In fairness, some of my friends thought it was "ok", but when you go, I have some drinks (or sprays) on my advice and keep your critical faculties safe at home. <br /> <br />
