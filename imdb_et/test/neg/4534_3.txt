This movie had some funny moments. Louie, the main character, was well cast with some other decent support. The picture that opened the film shone, but the direction and story went down. After the end of the twist (also interesting and funny) I want this film to have a better direction and a more advanced story. Without giving a plot, the whole idea is better! I just wish it was better in the short film. The opportunity was there, but it just didn't deliver the goods.
