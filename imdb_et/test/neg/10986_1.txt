This is the worst movie I've seen at loooong time. It reminded me of Cirque du Soleil's exhibition, which I saw in Vega six years ago - without athletes. For this, I mean a couple of striking, artistic, images that appear randomly, without any permanent framework. The fake sepia toned film is really sticky. This device is almost never legitimate and certainly not _Tuvu_. Apologies to Abe Lincoln: You can fool for a while.
