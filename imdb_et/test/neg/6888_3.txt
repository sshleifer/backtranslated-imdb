I checked this video, waiting for it. You like it. I like foreign movies, I like fine cinema, I know that critics liked this movie (including my favorite Roger Ebert), and I don't mind "slow" movies. Well, it's beautiful. That's the best thing I say about it. The plot is very thin, the shots are very long, the eyes are very meaningful, the actors are very sincere and it looks like a very long film. I slept halfway, though I woke up, the tape was re-recorded, I tried again. It was a trial, but I did it to the end. I didn't like it better.
