Yes, it was a terrible movie, but at the beginning of the movie there was a song I think called "I got Woody" or something like that. I would like it to exist if it exists. I saw this song on MST 3K and, as terribly as it was, it was moments and this song was one of them. <br /> <br /> If you like bikini, it's a movie for you, but if you don't, don't worry. It was a great material for MST 3K, but I have to admit it. I really love to know where I can get a copy of the soundtrack. Not only this song, but a couple more really funny and classical when I'm concerned.
