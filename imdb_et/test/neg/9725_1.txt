From the beginning of this movie, when it was "The Lost Boys" hanging from the opening order, for bad wire work and even worse dialogue, this movie has slipped at a snail's pace. Some of my co-workers suggested that the "pact" is highly recommended, and I am deeply convinced that I am playing practical jokes. At least I hope it was intention and their taste is not so bad! This film was not much longer than one and a half hours, but it felt much longer. The story was so simple that it could have taken about 15 minutes. They could have completed at least the rest of the movie with some entertaining magic or fighting scenes, but someone decided (or director, but I don't know if someone really "staged" this movie) that it would be filled with some badly executed "artistic" camera images and "boys" swimming and barless scenes. About half of this movie I thought I might have fun in my head against the wall and part of it would get rid of this terrible dirt I had to watch. . So I need my head against the wall and I enjoyed it more than the movie! I looked at it until the bitter end, hoping it would give me more pleasure. No, my efforts were rewarded "How do I get you bleeding!" I vomited, and then I just felt embarrassed about the screen writer and the injury for the poor actor who had to give this generation. Action was not as bad as other viewers thought, but even the most talented work could not save this job and work on my nerves! I give the films a chance, even bad ones, because they usually offer some pleasure and it wasn't really the worst movie I've ever seen. After it was over, I felt that I was watching the movie "Stealth" again and WOW was so much better this time! Oh yeah Case, don't worry about this movie, really, don't. Check out some "Charmed" episodes and see "The Lost Boys" after a fair amount of alcohol and you are a much better person. If you fall into the same trap I did, and look at the "Agreement", be sure to keep all the sharp objects far away, far away from you, thank you for that.
