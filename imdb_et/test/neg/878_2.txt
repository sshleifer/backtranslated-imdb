This is one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Casting: Richard Gere is just too old for more romantic leadership. Diane looks a bit enthusiastically pleasant and annoyed as usual, but romance doesn't seem to be convincing. Supporting is not too memorable. <br /> <br /> Story: The medical drama she has to deal with is not convincing and not interesting. The story is weak - it's not enough to make a movie. There is nothing new to say here or to say a new way. <br /> <br /> The setting is small and the native house is inconvenient. <br /> <br /> NOT to be a great memorable one.
