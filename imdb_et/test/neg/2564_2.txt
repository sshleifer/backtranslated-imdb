Okay, some other people have commented that this is not friction, so I don't have to repeat it (though I just did). It's not exactly down, it's actually sometimes nice to see an actor trying something else. But unfortunately this is not one of these cases. <br /> <br /> Now, story: none. This film has almost no style, such as "Showgirls". Of course, they throw a couple of environmentalists, not even an environmentalist, anything else, tidbits here and there to please Seagal (be it he). It doesn't make a story, not even close. Finally ... Even among us who really liked this movie ... end, you have to admit that it was a little much or a lot of stupid. <br /> <br /> Now, what I understand is that it was a direct-video movie (at least in the countries), but that's even too good for it. This garbage should be only cable, TBS or Starz (late night).
