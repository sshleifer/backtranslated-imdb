Well, here we have a zombie movie that maybe not even a lot of zombie movie. The whole movie is set in the near future with a zombie effort, but the film is not very little with this concept. Instead, this zombie hunter is trying to get back and get his money back from other prize hunters. What is the money anyway when almost the whole world is gone to hell and cities are mostly abandoned. And why pay people money for killing zombies. As if people wouldn't kill this dangerous threatening monster if they didn't pay. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the song "Fast and Undead" is far from narrow. Of course, it is not the most logical and interesting moments, letters or dialogue. <br /> <br /> However, this is not a terrible film. It is certainly not as bad as some people are trying to believe you. It looks pretty good or rather said the film doesn't have at least a cheap picture. Its effects can be a bit overestimated, but they are still pretty good, as are make-up effects. <br /> <br /> There was still no movie I was hoping for. The title may indicate that the film is in the wild, in the west, in the days of cowboys, but its title is just misleading; I fell for it, waiting for this film to be a combination of Western and Gori-horror-flick. <br /> <br /> For fans of Zombie movies, this movie is mostly disappointing. Of course, it adds something new to the genre, but it doesn't have enough genre to read. <br /> <br /> Not completely tricky, but also far from the recommended one. <br /> <br /> 4/10
