Well, I got and saw this movie based on a pretty high score (7.1) and some good reviews. Typically, IMDb is a good result when it comes to scoring, although in that case I was very deceived. <br /> <br /> Film is a contemporary detective story where Vinnie Jones is a researcher journalist who investigates the death of a construction worker. It mixes Dickens' novel (called The Riddle, which is in the 18th or 19th century), which also deals with the story of the murder. Both tracks are connected to the unpublished manuscript detection. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting? It could have been, but this movie is terribly unsuccessful in many areas: 1) acting. Mediocre at best, but it's traceable. It is no worse than your average UK sitcom, although it is a little better for the movie. Especially over 7 points. 2) Music. The music used is just terrible, it disturbs and it is annoying. Especially the pub music and music that plays in the journalist's apartment. 3) Story. It's a big joke. There are primitive plots everywhere and even the obligatory love story is so unrealistic that it is almost funny. Besides, without getting into any details, I can definitely say that the end is absurd and one of the worst parts of action and storyline. 4) Camera operation. Occasionally, camera positions and views are disturbed and in no way do "stories". <br /> <br /> I am a bit of a fan of the movie and watch an average of 1-2 movies a day, but it's just the worst movie I've seen in a month. Don't waste your money or time on this garbage.
