The film begins in 1872 with a violent, bloody fight between Dracula (Christopher Lee) and van Helsing (Peter Cushing). Dracula is absorbed and dissolves into dust - van Helsing also dies. Someone collects Dracula ashes and buries them under church. Cut to 1972 - where the film breaks down. <br /> <br /> We have instantly hit the head with loud, bad 70s music, HORRIBLE fashion and silly dialogue. When that was done, Hammer lost money and decided to try something. Bringing Dracula into the 1970s was not a good idea. Fashion, music and dialogue make the movie terrible. We introduce the annoying children of the 20s who decide they have a black mass to "strangle". Of course, they are in the church (now abandoned) and of course Dracula revives. It's good if the van Helsing's descendant is about ... but Dracula goes after revenge on his brother (Stephanie Beacham). On the screen, the movie shoots the much needed energy. Opening and closing battles are the highlight of the film (although the end has been violated by playing 70's music). Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame) is also the main driver of the children - a truly stupid name from the 1940s. The film also features queen Caroline Munro. The film is well targeted and pretty well done, but the plot is stupid, the constant impediment to fashion, dialogue and music of the 1970s is really irritating and I was basically bored. - It was one of the worst Dracula films - it was a follow-up (Dracula's satirical ritual) was the worst - and the last Hammer Dracula movie. It gets 2 - just for Cushing and Lee.
