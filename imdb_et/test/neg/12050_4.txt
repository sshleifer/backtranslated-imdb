I was excited about the fresh (pun intended) summary of this movie and look forward to seeing it. The first few pictures show some of the signs and main locations where the stories take place; horticultural products. The movie is fantastic. Colorful yet simple. Magical, but genuine. Unfortunately, it only takes a few minutes to run the movie. We quickly realize that it is a manipulative and noisy story that illustrates a number of jaded people who have been "victimized" by their roadside, and that it is a happy ending where jaded people understand their way and accept these people. <br /> <br /> Characters, especially prejudices, are very "comic" in nature. The story mainly focuses on two refugee families. One of them is headed by a single mother, Diveen Henry, who played fun. I'm sad to say that any emotion you might have felt about his struggles was disturbed by what was remarkably bad. <br /> <br /> Another story is much more interesting and focuses on Dad and his two kids. Everything is intimidated by their journey to this country through containers where the wife and mother died, but this is the most spouse. Benedict Wong is desperate here. At first, his emotions are very weak, but when the story evolves, he delicately makes us aware of the inner struggle of his character. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is very boring. There were so many possibilities with this film. There are several signs to follow, many of which may be potential, but none have been realized. Even worse, despite the fact that the film is not very Hollywood, some of the main plot yarns are solved in the Hollywood b-class. Example: <br /> <br /> Character A likes character B Note B rejects its progress No problem! Let's character C to declare our love for character A, so we all have a happy ending. Yawn. <br /> <br /> I really liked the Asian family plot thread. It was well done. Unfortunately, the whole distribution company, its social aspect, has a great deal of pain in the dynamics, all used. <br /> <br /> What you have left is a movie with very little value.
