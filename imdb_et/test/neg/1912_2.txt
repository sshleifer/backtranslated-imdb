It can always be said whether I enjoy the movie, how many times I cross my legs, change positions, generate light sounds, etc. etc. Less = better. During this film I moved so many times that I managed to knock my giant popcorn cab of my friends and get a huge thigh strengthening workout. Daughter Never Cries â€œgave her talents a certain promise, played badly in the poorly written section. Frustrating fact number one. Second Number: Chris Klein was in it. Frustrating number three: Chris Klein had lines. Fourth Number: Chris Klein played the Validator. Woah. Dummies from rich families unite! Worse still, he is trying to actually act, but he only succeeds in making the Cecille B. DeMille's ever-more independent version of the Cecille B. Go back to your American pies. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible in almost every way, except for the lightly pleasing power of Josh Hartnet, such as LeeLee's rigid boy Jasper. Fortunately, he avoids trying too many "moments", unlike any other characters. Of course, this is why it is much better than the rest, and it really shows here somewhat. If you like Josh or think of a child, he is your man. <br /> <br /> Hartnett is a sharp actress, but the rest no longer needs sheep. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (for this terrible movie, Hartnetti) <br /> <br />
