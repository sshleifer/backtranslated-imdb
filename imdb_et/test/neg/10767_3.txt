I have read every Baroness Orczy Scarlet Pimpernel's book. Reading this, I've seen 3 pimpernel movies. I favored Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews very much. It goes to violence and action, from time to time completely violating the spirit of the book. I'm not expecting movies to go straight to the ground, I gave up this idealistic time, but if the book's excellent film has already been done, don't do it with television that includes great actors and nice costumes, but hardly a good script. With the 80s versions ... Raining
