George & Mildred - The film lacks the talents of its TV writer John Mortimer, who bring forth a quarter and a thrust close to the George class war with Fourmiles. <br /> <br /> The plot is cut from the usual spin-off tab - a person / a mistaken identity - and as little tension as laughs. Manufacturers would have had to take a page from Rising Damp (also in 1980), which was bought on the big screen after the end of the TV series, and kept a lot of story in a familiar environment. <br /> <br /> Yootha Joyce died in 1980, but he should not be remembered because of this harassing work that is burdened by his illness. Mildred lacks the sharpness of his TV incarnation; cutting off and wilting largely deprive Georges of libido. George's sputtering disbelief disappears into more expansive sets. This does not mean that they are screaming. The budget for these films seems to be scantily small; The restaurant they go to is a clearly new semi-star house with some Christmas lights that adorn the exterior. <br /> <br /> The 70s British comedy fans or those who want to accompany their old youth. this movie can't add anything to the experience and they should just stick to the first four TV series on DVD.
