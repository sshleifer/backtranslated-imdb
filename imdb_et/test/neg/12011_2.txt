"The problem child" was a good movie, but does it really deserve a sequel? I don't think it would be. The only redeeming asset of the original film was Gilbert Gottfried, and he wasn't even good at this stage. <br /> <br /> I can't really put my finger on why this movie was bad. For beginners, it wasn't funny. Even when I saw it at the age of nine, I had no sympathy with Junior (Michael Oliver). His character came to me as a tiny, dignified and perhaps the most important, rebellious clue. He showed hate for every woman whose father Ben (John Ritter) dated only for their hate. Also, children with divorced parents (who nowadays account for more than half of their children in the United States) are not sent a good message when one woman, Ben, decides to (almost) marry a South Aristocrat who is cruel and hates children. As it is. <br /> <br /> And as cool as I thought it would have been to see the original SNL companion Laraine Newman back on the big screen, she couldn't even record that movie. I also found it strange that he was the white southern part of Lawanda. It sounds more like an African-American woman. But of course it has nothing to do with the fact that I didn't like this movie. hate. John Ritter's character was supposed to be a good parent who desperately tried to teach his child inevitably without being in line with an authoritative parent. Instead, he came out not only as a strange parent, but also as he wanted to find a woman within a few days, no matter how well he knew her. Did I mention that it sends a bad message to the children of the divorced parents? <br /> <br /> In short, the rest of the things that went wrong with this movie included Amy Yasbeck's unnecessary and inexplicable return to a completely different character, this young girl who was even more unattractive to Junior, demanded a complete lavatory and even more frightening obsolete homophobic humor (involving dog catchers). The film was just a mess, and it really doesn't deserve a DVD if it isn't already given. It should just turn VHS along with all the other bad, forgotten 90's comedies.
