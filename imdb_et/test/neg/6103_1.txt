<br /> <br /> This movie is best enjoyed by a large audience where you can be fried. <br /> <br /> Very often, KADOSH characters are far from watching. Very intense unhappy face, very meaningful, very serious. At these moments, there is very serious sounding music just to double that viewer understands that the scene being viewed is not fun and games. looks. We know that women in KADOSH have two responsibilities. One of them is raising as many men as possible for their spouses. The second is to stay in work to free your men from working. What do these men do in their spare time? They pray. And we learn that at home they pray loudly, "I give you thanks for not being a woman." And they pray in their places of worship to thank the male genital organs. <br /> <br /> Along with praying, there are many terrible, bowing, and endless goblins and back and fourth round bodies. and the mixing of all is a lot of intricate and odd (or simple, but the same odd) ritual activities. <br /> <br /> The inexperienced comedy choir comes from sex. Hot and afflicted men who are actively replacing body fluids with their husband in bed, trying to keep their beanie from falling on their scalp, are unforgettable! <br /> <br /> Each sex scene is funny, but it's eye-catching when the husband rubs his face against the feet of his beautiful wife (YaÃ«l Abecassis). Oh yeah, we finally reach the land of sensuality ... but NO! Feet rubbing before something happens and the husband begins to swallow his autistic head and body until the scene ends. <br /> <br /> There are three attractive women in the neighborhood, but KADOSH does not contain any nudity. Technically, the director has some interesting shapes and pleasing light and colors. <br /> <br /> For a more reliable, educational and entertaining treatment that keeps the dignity of a dignified woman in a world where respect is measured by the speed at which a person can mention the phrase of ancient literature, I suggest YENTL. <br /> <br />
