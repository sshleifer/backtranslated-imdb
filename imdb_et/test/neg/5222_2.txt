OK, I'm 26, so I've been through the 80s heroes of the heroes and Chuck Norris with Seagal, Van Damme and the rest of the men were my childhood heroes who fought against the bad guys. Only round;) I saw a few days ago on this television ad on the film - Chuck Norris threw some fireballs at his fingers. WHOA! "It's a must-see crappy movie!", I said. And really it was. Only much worse. It is very difficult to see all the films that are filled with some religious thought, ridiculous zombie-like monsters, serving Satan, the whole idea of ​​a plot in a forgotten community that represents all of mankind - this is a Christian fundamentalist load of wet dreams. <br /> <br /> I am not against Christianity, even in films, but it has no taste, it has almost nothing that connects common sense, c'mon, Chuck Norris, who plays ANGEL, whose job is to take care of a small town, where does Satan live?!?! The whole plot is so damn straight and boring, not mentioning this stupidity (yes, it's no longer stupid, we're talking about stupidity like ... like a slowed kid's joke) makes a totally terrible movie that's done as much as older people are devoted to the Catholic Church because young viewers are laughing in almost every scene. Technically, this is wrong, fx is worse than what you have seen in the early 90s in the TV series, the plot seems very stupid, the actors could easily change the cardboard stand without mentioning the music that I've heard from the childish piano. I've seen many movies, even the worst (from the IMDb sub-list) like "Space Mutiny" or "Manos - the hands of destiny", but believe me that nothing is ridiculous, terrible, terribly worked on almost a movie that brings some pupils' prank movies rather than my usual production. Avoid it. Avoid at any cost. There's nothing to laugh at. Chuck Norris has officially finished her film career.
