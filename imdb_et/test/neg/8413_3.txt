For a movie that received so much recognition and appreciation for the spinoff "Rosemarys Baby", there is one big mistake. It starts with the fact that Andrew / Adrian, regardless of his name, is so confused that he doesn't know who he is, and he goes out with his mother and soon he will be stolen by a strange lady who takes care of him as he was his mother. Action is terrible when Andrew grows up in his twenties and faces terribly faces with his sunken face, an endless smile and the dukes of dangerous clothes look like drunk as Satan's son. Actually, all that he does is drink and drop sloppy all over himself when he tries his past and his mother's last memory that drives him on the bus. He finds a friend who seems to be an angel, but he kills fast and is electrified in a mountainous scene where he looks more like a Christmas tree. Andrew goes together and the cult with the first part of the members tries to see if he is actually the Son of Satan. His silly suicide fails from the test and rises with a fairy-tale change and jumps on the nightclub and dances like cracking on cracking !!! This scene is memorable and worth a look. The end is terrible and somewhat predictable, considering how stupid he is in the movie. Don't look at this in the trash or you'll lose the first part of your respect.
