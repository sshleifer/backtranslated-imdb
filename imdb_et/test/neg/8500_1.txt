I do not understand people who rated it at the age of 5. I think it's a terrible movie from every perspective. Plots, Drama, Art, Dialogue, Music! I don't mind a small budget. Traveling, I thought it was pointless ... three two boys were kissing in bed. terrible, just terrible. I love indie movies, don't forget it's slow. However, this film deceived me from any perspective. Even Graffito, not artistic. <br /> <br /> I was wondering what people would like it to be. I'm a woman in my 30s. Is it for teenagers who are lonely in life, or I just can't get it? So what did I get? Time to waste! Please go to some others.
