It is one of those wonderful martial arts films that begins with two gang members in the park; and when the thing goes wrong and the battle begins, it turns out that they all know karate and kung fu! Cynthia Rothrock is increasingly cynical, dead, good policeman, this time in Los Angeles. He and his police partners are trying to break the counterfeit ring, and when that plot line is exhausted, the story just turns into something else, and Cynthia becomes a personal bodyguard for a wealthy, beautiful master. Within the film's obviously lower budget, there are some helicopter activities, some high-speed vessels, some cars, a robbery, where Cynthia wins all in the western bar, some pool scenes with bimba tang bikinis and a surprisingly good chase of a horse. About a dozen and a half policemen grabbed. Lots of plot revolutions happen that just doesn't make sense; don't worry about them. (And currency counterfeiting is federal crime, so when hell is FBI? I think they were too busy.) Fighting choreography was often done by Cynthia Rothrock's associate Richard Taylor, whose stylish and clever presence in the camera would have honestly said it's a better movie . He also carried Cynthia as a better actor when they appeared together and, frankly, he could use it; he seems tired and bored, and does his best when he acts in GUARDIAN ANGEL when he is playing against a pet dog to whom he brings bitter drunken monologues. The dog almost makes him out! She also wears the most divine clothes that any leading lady has ever wore in a movie: loose, bag-foot jeans with pale acid-washed areas are the most shocking. Other participants are all over the map. You get a picture of many of the smaller characters that are thrown in this way: "Hey, I and some other guys I know are in the movie. You want to be in it? Then there are slimming professionals: the most fun is Lydie Denier, the stunning French model and the veteran "Red Shoe Diaries", "Baywatch", "Melrose Place" and many other variations in a sexy French bomb; here he plays a psychopathic killer as if in the BAISEZ-MOI or the "Alias" episode and not in such a direct cable trash. There is also a long, dark and beautiful Daniel McVicar, who is now regularly "The Bold and the Beautiful", John O'Leary, who has played a dignified old man in dozens of films and sitcom episodes and is doing it again here and Aharon Ipale, Arabic character actress actress who is best known as "Pharaoh Seti" THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS. For these professionals, GUARDIAN ANGEL must be their more ridiculous entry. I gave this film a better rating than it probably deserves because my daughters, who are enthusiastic martial arts students, want to see a woman who strikes the ass and has big scenes for change. They are still too young to take care of what is a low-quality picture, and just liked Cynthia because he did his rotating leg, a big blow, a struggling thing. If you like such a flick, you probably enjoy it at this level.
