Beaverview Cheerleading Camp has a good two-show Lucky Ducks cheerleading team with the "hard" bad girl's cheerleading team "The Demons" to win the terrible Falcon team, which always seems to win in the camp. This is a typical clich√© 80s teen (flat) sex comedy that you think wins? But what the film has no originality is more than that it's bloody terrible. Oh and unpleasantly bad dance numbers and mandatory Japanese businessmen who want to buy a camp (provided that the men's cheerleader, Tommy Hamilton, will of course stay in the camp). Just terrible, forgotten and unfortunately this surprising lack of nudity. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: HBO Comedy <br /> <br /> My degree: F (yes, I really gave them)
