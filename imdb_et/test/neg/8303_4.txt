True Gothic Horror Trash Classic! <br /> <br /> It's actually a terrible movie. Best thing: Rosalba Neri's nude nipples. Strongly absorbent material. <br /> <br /> Surely Rosalba Neri is a fine lady. Never heard of her before that flick, but she's a fucking good looking lady. But frankly, it was his nipples that did it for me, just on the last scene before the movie came to an end, all naked and erected ... Total dreams, man. Okay, sorry, get out of here ... <br /> <br /> Basically I got what I was waiting for LADY FRANKENSTEIN: this is a buggy and terrible flick for a big fool, ugly look at the Frankenstein monster and a couple of naked tits. And there is a castle. So I wasn't really disappointed or anything. It pulled too much in some places (the first creature resurrection was at the age where father Frankenstein just experimented, spoke, tried something else). However, for the original Frankenstein, there was one fun and imperfect respect: instead of throwing a little girl into the lake, Mongoloid Franky got up the naked chick and threw him on the river. I was laughing. <br /> <br /> Some of my friends drove this flick a bit too much. Could I have been waiting a little too much. But the nipples set by Rosalba were worth it ... (Aw crap, I really have to stop mentioning my nipples). I think I'll stop commenting on this user now.
