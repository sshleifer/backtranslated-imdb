In this silly symphony, the country mouse visits the city with its cousin. Most of the short are two mice studying the dining table. Animation is good if this short suffers with a sense of humor. Maybe I've just seen this "dinner table" in too many Tom and Jerry shorts. Although it came first, I just couldn't find it nice.
