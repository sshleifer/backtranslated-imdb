Unlike one of the reviewers below, I do not believe that a big and sparkling career should be ahead of this uneven and annoying navel observer director. If it is good to see that the British director is trying to leave the boundaries of the convention, AKA's only requirement for innovative fame is to rely on the novelty of the triple screen. At first, you think it might be an interesting device, but its only real contribution to the film is testing your vision and patience. Watching the same character from two different perspectives in a two-dimensional film does not make it more revealing or complex. If you forget a triple screen (which is given is very difficult to do), then you will have to deal with accidentally fun scripts. Audience beats chiche after chiche on the British class system. The film has the political and emotional complexity of the episode of the upper and lower floors. In conclusion: Emperor's new clothes. And quite poor equipment.
