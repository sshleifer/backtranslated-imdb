This peculiar and observable film is the story of a dentist who starts his mission or crusade to fight at the back of Patagonia and beyondides. Fergus, a major figure from New Jersey in Northern Ireland, sees his Crusade as a mission of mass importance and approaches it with all the enthusiasm, vitality, discipline and details that a trained dentist could expect. What adds fun, because his big plans break apart and gradually fall into pieces because he goes to a disaster criminally behind the Patagonia with a custom motorcycle or his mobile dental unit. We will never be able to meet our wife or a rich philanthropist who sponsors a malicious mission, but we will get a clear view of Lewis. The fans of his work are not disappointed with his highly credible activities as a disappointed dentist accused of an innocent but sexy 18-year-old female leader who labeled * ahem * for driving. /> This movie is not for everyone and I understand why it was not suitable for suits. It's a small budget, sometimes a charming, always disarming, lightly entertaining and instantly forgotten movie that shows low expectations and almost succeeds.
