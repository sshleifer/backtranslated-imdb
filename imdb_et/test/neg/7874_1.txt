Ugh. Stephen Baldwin. I've never noticed until I got a DVD home and saw the name credit. Double ugh. What's worse, is it a low budget, a frantic, wandering, wannabe shoot'em, NAME. I mean, where did they find this ban? Take a bike in LA City Dump, hoping to get into the movie? The whole plot is ridiculous to the ridiculous assumption. Baldwin is as persuasive as the American gothic, sans pitchfork poster boy. His entire acting repertoire looks like he needs potty and then looks like he found. <br /> <br /> So there is this nation: a bad script, bad action by non-named actors, a low budget setting, and a hero who is as convincing as a girl's spy, who is looking for a hero for a cookie client. It's too late for me to get my money back to the DVD, but you can save yourself - if you are not one of those who want to look at dogs laughing ... frankly, it's too boring to be funny.
