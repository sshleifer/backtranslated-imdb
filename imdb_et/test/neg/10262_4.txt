I saw it last night and was the fan of the first demon, and I hoped that the aftermath would have the same predecessor's fun and spooky spirit. That's not so, unfortunately. The structure is similar to the first, where the horde of demons eating meat fades into reality when he was released from a horror film that is played ... This is pretty much the development of the plot. It worked nicely in the first part because it was ghoulish make-up FX, fast paced and unpredictable. The sequel does not cut it. The first problem seems to be that there are too many signs we don't really or otherwise care about. If they were annoying or idiots, there would be at least some satisfaction if they were inevitably polished / demonized / eaten in life ... but these people are just waiting to be killed. In addition to the fact that most of the characters are in different parts of the apartment building (and out of it), they constantly cut between them, pulling me out of the story. There are some fun pictures that are fun with the FX and campines in the trash. Like a continuous flowing blood in the blood that eats one storey after another, as if it were a strange acid ... The first demon that has a dirty birthday girl leads to the destruction of her whole party and the horrible demon generation who travels along her way to a tenant who is pregnant with a child . However, this sequence is a ridiculous-looking rubber daemon baby doll that breaks the human baby's chest, constantly flying over that space to its planned victim. I got a couple of pictures of this scene, but I don't think it was Bava's intention. The scene would probably have worked better if they just held the child's demon to attack a woman, but hey ... Other little things, like the most zeal of most characters, and bad duplication won't help. All in all, I was able to see an unrated version of the DVD and can't imagine that I should sit all the time, which was only available through the R version, because make-up FX and gore were the only thing I got out of it. Also noteworthy is the early role played by Argento's future hottie daughter, Asian Asia. In fact, he probably gives the best cast of the cast and he's hardly on the screen. Argento / Bava fans could watch it to see it, but apparently they look at their watch as I did. Gore fans can beat some fxs, but they laugh at their stools most sparsely on the evil child's doll because of Little Selwyn's Dead / Alive. You could make it worse, but it certainly doesn't match the original.
