It's hard to imagine anyone who makes a Tom Cruise movie is good; really hard but it makes him good. Very good. In fact he makes him look like Sir John Gielgud, who celebrates a very good day of action and is very brave. <br /> <br /> The whole ensemble was trying to get higher than failed and failed. The mistake was, in part, to be honest that the plot was so much like the original HG Wells as well as the dead bodies of human casualties with living predecessors: both were bloody and violated the remains of a more attractive predecessor. But to describe such a plot as it is a little sacred, tell Colander "My, this kitchen tool is a significant number of holes" unless they are holes in your bag; in this case, this film will approve you. <br /> <br /> The second part of the mistake was that they were demotivated, handling, DVD players who knew well, one assumes that it was their exhibition that would finish the $ 5 DVD shelf. And it's overrated. <br /> <br /> So should you watch it? Why, yes, of course, you should. You are a miserable sinner and you deserve a punishment.
