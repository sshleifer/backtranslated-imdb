Hey, what a great idea to open a movie - show someone's home video. Drama schools must be full of idiots! there they have taken drama studies, hoping to get the next big thing in Hollywood when all you have to do is send a home theater to the studio. Hi, I think I'll send a video of my wedding and call it MORE MORE USE or send your honeymoon tape and call it Higher SEX EIN. Oh wait, I'm not married and I've never had a honeymoon! Don't worry that I'll send a video to someone who's gonna be a wedding / honeymoon <br /> <br /> !!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> <br /> Do you think an opening like SHARK HUNTER could only improve? As shocking as it may seem, the film is the best targeted, best-written and best-performing part of the film, unfortunately it is all downhill when the family goes into the sea (in reality a fog-hidden pool) in three. The footstep where mother and father eat CGI fin and their son Spencer swears revenge fin. Until now, the French are using underwater research to study oil. The only thing is - And it's so obvious that you can't notice it - it's not filmed underwater !!! the director has not attempted to use even a convincing imaging method through the fish tank. The underwater research base blows shark (perhaps employed by Greenpeace?), Who kills everyone inside and Spencer now grown man hired a shark that killed his parents and a bunch of Frenchmen. What else will happen? No idea that I decided to look at something else <br /> <br /> No hard feelings when a cast and a team reads it and I hope Matt Codd becomes a big fish in Hollywood. You think you know the sharks Matt? You haven't seen anything yet
