I don't know why it has received proper comments because it could be the weakest horror comedy I've ever seen. Englund is just in a suitcase and his performance is just as necessary as most flat experiments joke (and frightens). The direction is terrible and the behavior is worse. Every year, manufacturers seem to be trying to make another Evil Dead, but these weak unoriginal attempts simply enter into the memory of a real horror classic. <br /> <br /> Does his filmmakers say: "This is not a remake but its 80's backlash (which I think is the same unigiginal - Hatchet) or people trying to connect it with the horror of others is still misleading and a habit to compensate for the lack of fear, horror, comedy or even a decent movie for this matter. <br /> <br /> OUT OF ALL COSTS !!!
