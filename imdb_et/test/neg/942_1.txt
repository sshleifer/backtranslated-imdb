I see absolutely nothing funny - even far from funny --- in this stupid movie. Unrealistic, foolish, ridiculous idea - just ridiculous. It is hard to believe that the main character that seems so intelligent, intelligent and imaginative is not accepted by any college. It is even more difficult to believe that no one has closed this place. Participants depicted symbols directly from Characterville. We've seen a lot of time in many movies. There is nothing new here. I found it on late night television and because there was really something else, I watched the dull, stupid movie. What is all the waste. Maybe, if you are a teenager, it can be fun. Movies are made for immature minds so teenagers do it. The rest, somehow.
