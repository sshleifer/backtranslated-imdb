I don't understand why everyone loves this movie so much. True, it has good intentions and meaning, but such a poor script cannot be compensated. Woody Allen is a brilliant filmmaker, but I'm afraid it's just one garbage. This is extremely predictable and the subject is too visible. I'm a big fan of Woody Allan and I love most of my work, but I can't recommend it.
