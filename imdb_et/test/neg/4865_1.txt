I still don't know why I've been sitting all over this thing. It only had about 3 minutes of real entertainment, the rest was just a clean hole. Action is not so great and the action scenes are so fun that they are not even funny. I wish I could say something good about this movie, but I can't imagine anything right now. It probably was something that some people can enjoy, but ending it must be an eternal idea. What type of person would receive a small toy remote-controlled helicopter burning a machine gun to kill the president? This idea could never have been done first, not to mention that someone is clever enough to try it out, I think the writer must be obsessed with the scene of a dead pool toy, but tried to really try it out.
