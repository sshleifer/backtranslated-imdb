Cave's virtual carbon copy, with fewer budget effects and a slightly different plot. I knew that the film went downhill when I saw the fake campfire luminaires, which are clearly reflected near the face of an actor. The contradictions between the characters and the sub-blocks seemed to have any purpose and did not add anything to the film except for the less silence. The action was not as bad as a typical B-film, and their fear was somewhat plausible, but as professional, they seem too psychologically unstable in their profession. Generally it is not worth renting $ 4.50.
