Like Tinto Brass ("Caligula"), the authors of this film can't tell what is special and erotic. There is no building up, but throw naked women on the screen; no, it doesn't work that way. If the close-ups of the female genitals are not your thing, be prepared to look at the screen far from many points (often done). The mentality of the movie "All Women are Heartbeat Whores" is offensive and the "story" is absurd and boring (escape is the most boring part!). But halfway through is a random scene that pops up somewhere and includes one (female) prisoner and one (male) guard from a naked wrestling game that he wins with a few judo moves. Although the choreography of the fight is bad, the whole scene is undeniably memorable. In fact, this scene and nice cinematography are the only two reasons why I do this instead of * 4 of the movie.
