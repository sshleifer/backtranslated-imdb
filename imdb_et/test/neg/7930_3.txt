This is another pseudo-intellectual "let's see the Nazis see a real bad" movie. The Nazis were undoubtedly pretty bad, most of them already know. But this does not necessarily do good for every movie. The presentation of the "Wannsee Conference" discovery channel would have been more interesting. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy falls between two categories: documentary and drama. It doesn't cut it as a documentary, the movie is too "staged" and the presentation is too "normal". It doesn't cut this drama, the characters are too low and conflicts are too easy to solve. <br /> <br /> Another thing is a sign: "One of the greatest crimes against humanity was committed in the Hour." As the film shows the Wannsee conference, the meeting had nothing to do with reaching a consensus on the final solution. it was to change all the important stakeholders already in the plan. There were no decisions or plans at the Wannsee conference. There were only threats and coercion (some need less than others). <br /> <br /> Finally: One thing the film shows (though not in an exceptional way), a person tends to turn to culture and aesthetics in an attempt to hide for himself the fact that he is making horrible atrocities, as seen in most of the "leading" leaders and politicians.
