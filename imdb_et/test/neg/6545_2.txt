The only interesting part of this movie was jazz and reggae in New Orleans. He tries to be one of those films that has two struggles that the heroine must overcome, one from the past and one from the present, which he does not convincingly. Action is bad and the direction is even worse. I'm not surprised that it went straight to the video. The end result of this film does not leave anyone alone or satisfied, including the participants themselves.
