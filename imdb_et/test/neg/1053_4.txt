Most of Lorne Michaels' films seem to be unsuccessful because they are, in essence, just the extended versions of the sketches that barely managed to laugh at people in five minutes. "Tommy Boy" is a characteristic of "SNL" - a great fat lovable (in their opinion) who knows nothing. <br /> <br /> David Spade will become an overwhelming eternal role. He is involved in a tedious overweight slave and they suffer from an unfortunate accident when traveling to a traveling country to save dad's business. <br /> <br /> The plot for beginners is really wrong. The whole premise - the father dies and the rich stupid son has to keep the family together - it can be traced from almost any desired movie. Like any SNL-style movie, it's a simple motivation - empty, low; just the reason to see a fat guy and a thin boy is "funny" together. <br /> <br /> The biggest "impact" of the movie is the 1987 "Comedy, Trains and Cars" comedy. This film is great because the plot is not hidden and recycled. This is basic, yes - the boy who drives the Thanksgiving home is stuck. But that's real, fucking. This makes the whole difference. The characters are real, situations are much more real. "Tommy Boy" is a pure blow and its ridiculous situations undermine the signs - we don't know them and we don't care about what's happening on the screen. "PTA" walked cautiously between embarrassing and highly believable and interconnected capabilities - "Tommy Boy" is simply absurd, with jokes like simple deer headlamps that become unhappy, turning into dead deer, which really isn't dead, wakes and destroys your car. <br /> <br /> The whole broken car thing is stolen completely from "PTA" and it's terrible how many things in this movie actually resemble Steve Martin / John Candy. <br /> <br /> Farley is just too unpleasant to find it nice - I've never enjoyed watching it in movies and it hasn't changed my way of thinking. Spade is very little to do, acting as the film's most ungrateful character. <br /> <br /> Dan Aykroyd is wasted as Evil Baddie, who plans to destroy Daddy's business. The end is a joke and not a "har-har funny" way. What's more, "Oh, are they serious?!" Some people dig it, it's cool. But I just can't get into it or evaluate all the things he "lends" - not just reading "PT & A" - without any credit.
