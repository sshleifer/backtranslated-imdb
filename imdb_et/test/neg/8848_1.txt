Don't look at this movie. In most cases, such as Ju-On and The Grudge, the Japanese film is endlessly better than the American remake. But this movie was terrible. Ghosts, such as a trick or tear, dressed as ghost and blur of leaves, trying to intimidate in the absence of good makeup or special effects, and acting is just terrible. The story itself is inconsistent and confusing, not everything is explained, leaving the film worse. Don't waste your time with this movie, it's not worth it and I'm sure there are more fun things like drying the color.
