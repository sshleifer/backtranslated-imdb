So I rented this movie, hoping I learned about the beginning of independence from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Belgium. I was glad to have access to figures related to this history, mainly Lumumba and Mobutu. I wanted to see how the new Congolese government tried to bring together different groups against the colonial rule, their political motives, the reasons why Belgium decided to give the DRC its independence, and how the United States and the former USSR were involved. Unfortunately, all my questions went largely unanswered. I believe that this film was made by people who saw the story of the freedom fight of the DRC along a story full of stories and emotions and decided to use it. Then they began to try all the dramatic points of the story, filled them briefly with the dialogue, went into the set and shot. I may be wrong, but if it is all saddle, then the makers just have to become too hard to get everything in and get through all the details to create a comprehensive history. Regardless of the reason, it is a fact that the film may be a timetable for the sentences and the facts printed on the screen. The film passes through every major event and tells the viewer that this is the main idea of ​​what is happening, completely smoothing out the actual details to encourage the passing of big things. For example, there is a scene where Lumumba has been holding an increasingly riotous army controlled by Mobutu. In a situation, soldiers have three possible perspectives: one who deepens Lumumba, one that undermines Lumumba, and one who stands in the middle, understands and executes commands. As a result, there are three soldiers in the scene who speak lines that show their views. Then, in order to avoid dealing with the real tensions that these opposing positions bring, the scriptwriters simply wrote some random shots, more army boys appeared, and they just stop all. This is the extent of the film's reflection. Most of the time, every character just says its basic motives, other characters react to theirs and that's the way it is. There is little to say through the actions; even those they say are a direct point of pain. It is hard to believe that the people represented acted like this. Even in the trend of this trend, things like political tensions between factions are simply reduced to factual recognition - we will never know what these factions are, what they are fighting, their power, basically anything but the ones they exist. These characters are also one-dimensional and flat; unfortunately I do not know if Lumumba was actually a freedom fighter committed to the ideals of Congolese unity, but after an hour after that I certainly didn't believe it. The Democratic Republic of Congo, like many developing countries, has a difficult and important history, especially during and after independence. However, talking about their history is not helpful unless the complexity of situations is recognized. Lumumba does not pay enough attention to these details and says little to the viewer, except for the most common outlines.
