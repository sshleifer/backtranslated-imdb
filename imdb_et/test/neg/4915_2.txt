What movie is this? Terrible movie with the old boring mind infidelity that has already been achieved in the "Bhatti camp". Movie star EMRAAN HASHMI, UDITA GOSWAMI AND DINO MOREA. "No Base" in the movie. It just goes like that ... Dino Udita is married and lives in a rich mansion. But Dino does not like Udita's heart if she only wants her wealth. He loves someone else (Tara Sharma). So he bribed Emran so he would have a thing with Udita so he could try and finally share it with Udita. But Emra falls in love with Uditas and vice versa. Finally, when Udita is imprisoned for killing Emhan, Dino deliberately tries to save her by showing her false love. Udita, on the other hand, does not understand it and feels she really loved her. So he lends all his wealth to Dino. Finally, Dino comes out of the police station and goes with Tara with all the wealth. What a Fraud! The songs are good and the only ones in the movie. Now Individual Ratings: (5 out of 5) Emran: * * Udita: * 1/2 Dino: * 1/2 General Action: * 1/2 Direction: * * Story: * Music: * * * 1/2 Final Rating: * 1/2 Poor performances and poor casting ....... Music: Good ... I appreciate the movie: 1.5 / 10 (don't waste your time !!!!)
