I have not seen other Antonion movies and people who saw it with me that they share his works and shapes. Perhaps, if I had seen other things with him, I would have enjoyed it, knowing what to expect. <br /> <br /> For so many reasons, I saw it because of an almost complete failure. Firstly, the film introduces interesting, deep questions about social relationships, feelings, the nature of reality and fiction, but it is very often done in the most vague ways that make characters speak as if they were making calls, ramping and declaring dialogues rather than dialogues. Scientists seem to be so worried that we will not get the point they prefer to speak, rather than showing. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film has no rhythm, especially in the first half. It's not just slow. Some slow movies have been made with great tempo and rhythm (El Sur of Victor Erice or Scorsese innocence, which I like), but in order to be successful, it is necessary to find such characters or the story so we move we can adapt to it. This is not the case with the clouds, where the first episode seems to be endlessly dragging, and the relationship between "reality" and "fiction" of John Malkovich is sometimes liquid, others suddenly, others interfering.
