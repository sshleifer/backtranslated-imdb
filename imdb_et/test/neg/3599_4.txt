Ewww! Disney's sequel that is garbage! Who would have thought of that? In fact, there are many decisions based on these comments and they are not wrong. I had actually seen this terrible movie according to the originality of my original. And there's Disney's whole "cash" mentality. Scratch out all the old spam success and people go for it. Don't you think they are cynical? Ask yourself this, then .... How many Disney movies are offspring? And then .... How many of these lakes will follow up? Significantly lower number. <br /> <br /> Kronk's new Groove is just one example of this. The plot is ridiculously simplified and pulled out. What was even more annoying was the increase in the number of "out-of-the-way" objects and scenes - for example, the old people who were at home and God banned the Aztec version of the young scouts! Worse still, Kronk's opposing Chippamunk leader has a totally amazing overall English accent without reason. Pressure that was intensely nervous after a very short time. <br /> <br /> There are a few good things to do. The animation is very nice and the talent of the voices fits well with the inadequate dialogue they have given - especially in the leading role of Warburton. But there is really nothing to suggest. Of course, little children may like it, but there are few ways to entertain the mother and father when they are embarrassed by this original concept. <br /> <br /> Avoid the monster and the eagerness you use to avoid packing people eating lions.
