Ugh. Yes, it's just like McMartin's confusion or terrible arrests in Wenatchee, Washington. In the film, the mother aggressively asks her little boy again and again until she finally tells her what she wants to hear. Forensic experts and "therapists" repeat the pattern. The interview itself is a sexually horrible, relentless repetitive attack in its own way. <br /> <br /> Mobility practitioners throw a doctor out of the physical evidence of abuse, perhaps justifying the film's perspective: four-year-olds never do such things. Well, they want every adult they know to ask. The way in which this piece of discredited interrogation methods is accepted makes it a disappointment for anyone who knows what it needs to blame in real life. <br /> <br /> (They also add a special arrest case at the end to "prove" their case - there is no parallel in this real life with this fictitious incident. You can't say more without changing the spoiler here, but you know it when you see.) <br /> <br /> Yes, children are abused, sometimes by paid care providers. But to watch the film, which confirms ridiculous, hysterical accusations against so many completely innocent people, to look at countless children and the creations of the trials that destroyed the life of the accused - I didn't think I was the end. It is just too sad, and it is even more so by the seeming assertion of the writing team about the malicious, paranoid, obsessive, obsession we started - what do we call it? Poison campfire? <br /> <br /> Someone I know has never been accused of child abuse, thank heaven, but my 12-year-old grandmother was accused of witchcraft and killed for it. A mob that is full of what they think is holy is as dangerous as three hundred years ago. Such a sensational generation - "These accusations of satanic abuse are cutting across the country, there must be something!" "So tell the jury!" - Just eggs them. <br /> <br /> And who thought kids under ten, some of them under five, is a good idea? It's traumatic to see how they transmit their rows; How much more traumatic was the behavior of these parts? The commitment of the imaginants to the fight against child abuse is obviously not self-applicable. And what were the parents of child care institutions thinking? "Melinda" (which is not credited, at least in the A&E network version 2005, but I think it was Cassy Friel) and "Teddy" (Brian Bonsall) were terrible. Professionals or not, but they were too young to come across this material, much less to pay for it. Despite the ruthless exploitation of these real children, "Do you know that a muffinman" is an emmy application for leadership that simply shows how things were back in 1989.
