I really wanted to love this movie and not just cause Aaron Eckhart, but I thought the assumption would be cool because I enjoy movies and shows that turn the chefs. The cinematic art was good, but besides the chefs, everything else was just a clich√©. Oh and Little Miss Sunshine was very irritating in this movie, although Abigail Breslin seems to be irritating in every sense because she plays a lot of roles where she is crazy. It has some decent food lights, but food didn't play a big part in the movie when I thought it was a big disappointment for me. This film had some good potential, the majority was great, but they had very little work. I like a good light hearted romantic comedy, but it was just happier. And for longer than it should be, it felt longer than it was. It's not a terrible movie, you just don't miss anything when you don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 10
