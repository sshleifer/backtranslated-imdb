Have you ever visited Youtube? Well, the sure question is YES. Do you see ICarly and Nickelodeon beaches? There is no definite answer. Many people think that ICarly is a boring and idiotic program, and others think it's the best program on Earth. I've seen many comments put on ICarly's head and some gave him a rose bouquet. I think Icarly is for kids, but the show is just terrible. <br /> <br /> If you didn't read the last review, here are the reasons 1-8: # 1: steroids # 2: goofed-drama # 3: Everything is stupid (like Taco truck) # 4: Carly thinks she is great but she thinks # 5: Anyone who is drinking is silly # 6: Sam is small but strong? # 7: No Real Businesses # 8: Average Teachers Just look at the web to understand what I mean. # 10: The online store also leaks personal information. # 11: Almost every famous thing is offended. Icarly insults Japan, Solitare, Mercades-Benz and Pac-Man to name a few. # 12: There are too many recurring jokes (Sami obsession with flesh, Freddy's computer, Gibby pulls out his shirt, etc.) # 13: Video games are based on breastfeeding. # 14: Fred has no masculinity. Why? It becomes unoriginal. # 15: The exhibition is aimed at a female audience. I also hate exhibitions for men, so I prefer Icarly for both sexes. # 16: The words "nub" and "no chiz". # 17: Overuse of laughing rails. <br /> <br /> Part 3 begins in the spring! Just in time for spring!
