I don't know where most of you were, but where I watched a movie where we didn't have people who were singing, as some have said they have experienced, we had people laughing, mostly on a campy plot, in terrible dance series and Brosnani-like singing. The only people in the audience who seemed to be fascinated by the film were the people of the seventies who were some of the ways to live the songs with the past. I was in the seventies DJ and even went to the ABBA concert at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton on September 79, so I appreciated them and I'm doing it now. But this film should have been the same as their marriages and ended in divorce. The sequences were so poorly staged, duplication and editing absolutely terrible, and it must be Meryl's worst production. I can't believe that the Academy Award Winner would be so small to make that garbage. So save your money, wait for it to come out on the DVD, and maybe spend your money on something better than a cat litter.
