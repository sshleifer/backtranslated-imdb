I had to watch it on my Canadian cinema course and I was told that it was considered "the best Canadian film". If I watched it, I really disagreed, because I've seen much better. I understand that there were Canadian themes and messages, but the fact that the characters and the plot were so loosely connected to me (as a viewer) didn't really care what the film was trying to tell me. The plot was too dry. The characters did not have many positive personality traits, but this is an emphasis on messages, not on the observers. This movie shows a little about Quebec's history. Not a very interesting movie; it certainly does not deserve such a high base.
