the guys were the most attractive things in the whole movie. the girls were flat and pathetic, I mean, how can they own their own clothing line, dolls, movies, studios and not the smell of this bomb? in order to get some kind of responsibility that I do not really see in terms of punishment ..., they are sent to Paris, far from home, to live in a so-called strict grandfather with important status with Paris. I can't really remember what he was, so who really cares? no detail helps, girls are sent to paris to learn something .. so what exactly do they learn when they meet two French boys and can manipulate a man who should watch them so they can meet their boys? a typical pre-te film with all the pre-eminent ones who want to get lost and can afford a trip to Paris or a distant country away from their parents? I dont really like olsens anyway, they can never really shake the picture of michelle, plenary ... if you can't see then you were happy from the start. (F F-)
