I still find it hard to believe that Dean Koontz's novel, which is obviously overshadowed, has become such an extreme stool. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that it's nasty. Boos to all who participated. Shame on you! <br /> <br /> P.S. The fact that the after-effects have appeared simply shows how little taste and consideration lies in Silver Screen Land.
