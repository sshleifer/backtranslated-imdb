The title leads viewers to believe that this is a fun movie to watch and probably much better than being watched, but that's not good at all. One 15-minute sequence in which Jack Black plays one of his songs nicely and acidifies when he hits through the woods doesn't record that movie at all. Every actor in this movie has done better things except the main girls I couldn't think of for one movie I saw them before. I hate bash movies, but I also hate being able to find something decent in movies. The film is sad, not very funny, and it had this ability with its awesome pain. If it were repetitive and overwritten, it could be fantastic. If you want to see a good movie with stones, look at your grandmother's boy or half-baked or confused and confused, but that's not a visible film at all.
