I rarely interrupt the movie in the first 10 minutes, but I did that. What turned me off was so obvious that the sole purpose of this film was to expose as much B-actresses as possible and nothing else matters. <br /> <br /> Don't do me wrong; I like beautiful actors and sexual scenes, and sex-promotion movies have a range of benefits, but this director does nothing right. gal and OF COURSE are all this supposedly witty betrayal between them) talking about the first corpse. The camera is placed between them for each line (there is more than one screen width between them!) And you finally wonder if you are at sea or in a helpless dialogue. <br /> <br /> Well! has got better in the first 10 minutes, but I don't know. I disagreed with the mammal's contribution and found something better to do.
