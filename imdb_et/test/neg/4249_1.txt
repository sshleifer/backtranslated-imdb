I didn't like watching DS9 compared to other Star Treks, even with Enterprise, but I didn't like Babylon 5 and now I know why. They are the same exhibition. I just read the old news that Paramount stole the idea of ​​the creator of Babylon 5, but they decided not to sue for what I don't know or care about, but seeing the Star Trek series is based on another, even nerdier display. just to reveal a lot, now I condemn anyone who even talks about the series DS9. Original, TNG and Voyager are my favorites in this order. Before I realized why everyone thinks DS9 is great and I didn't do it, but I know I know. This is also because the captain has a real anger problem and I hate people who act coolly but worship, not from there; and it seems to be for every episode.
