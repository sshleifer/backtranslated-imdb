The only thing that makes this one traceable is Corey's release as a lunatic killer. The most unattractive story of retaliation and divorce remains. During the radio scenes I felt that Cotten pressed sweet potatoes, not a means of communication. Another interesting thing is that Alan Hale ("Gilligan Island" jumper) is not yet so greasy and he can still fall under his waist. Besides that there is not much to recommend here.
