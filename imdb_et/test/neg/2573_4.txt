Since I'm not a big Steven Seagal fan, I thought it was a pretty good movie. It is obvious that his fans are very pleased with the drama that has no overall number of martial arts and powerful force. Gailard Sartain plays independently the leader of the patriots of the military who is facing the ATF. weapons violations. He gives up his intention to release a deadly virus. Seagal is a former CIA agent who turned to a public physician who is pushing himself to find an antidote to a deadly mistake that is impossible in a small town. Her grandfather's indigenous herbal remedies help to save the story. <br /> <br /> Significant appearances by L.Q. Jones, Camilla Belle and Silas Weir Mitchell. My personal favorite in this movie is Whitney Yellow Robe. He is stunning and seems to be more challenging to play. <br /> <br /> Despite the far-fetched end, it was a decent film that could have used much more action.
