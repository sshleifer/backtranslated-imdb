I love comedies and I love independent movies, but it was too slow and humor was extremely regional. I think it would have been better for the main characters to be pleasing, but they were just typical gen-x slacker types, like people who have had difficulties in high schools for forty years ... I understand that high praise is young indie filmmaker, if it deserves it, but it is an extremely average film.
