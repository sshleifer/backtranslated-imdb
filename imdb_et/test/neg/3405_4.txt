I'm very into Waverly Hills and I was watching the Death Tunnel movie for the first time. Then I heard that the documentary was coming and excited to think that because it was a documentary, it would be more serious and would have no terrible special effects. so documentary should be. Waverly Hills doesn't need the help that goofy affects just as it is. Tours are $ 20.00 per person and $ 100.00 per 8-hour stay per person for a minimum 10-year group overnight during the investigation. Awesome Place for Ghost Hunter!
