A long time ago, in the early 1980s, the late night TV show "Friday" came to ABC, trying to steal NBC light from the "Saturday Night Live" list. It was not, but he introduced some contradictory sketches and semi-talented "comics" to the world. For example, Mark Blankenfield. <br /> <br /> What's on the roundabout, "Jekyll and Hyde ... together again". What is reluctant in all its nature. <br /> <br /> Blankenfield is about as fine as a bomb full of rubber pads that go after communion. And the same tasty. It's just the nature of his drug-prescribed drugs, which he played badly on a "Friday" show that stretches to length. And if you didn't like him, why are you reading this review? <br /> <br /> Every time more than one or two writers write a movie, it is a bad sign. When you go with funny jokes that can throw you away from all the improvisation stages of the western hemisphere and replace gags with gross output, things can get worse. <br /> <br /> The story of Robert Louis Stevenson? As good as the idea of ​​making a sitcom out of the store's "Usher House Fall". wasted waste, wasted movies, missed opportunities. <br /> <br /> It is no wonder that at the beginning they showed author Stevenson in their grave. What more remarkable would they be to review what they could give themselves? <br /> <br /> No letters. No, not even to Armstrong, who should have known it better. <br /> <br /> Hyde about it.
