This exhibition makes me (and many others) hate my life. Let's face it, Zoey's perfect; she is beautiful, beautiful, everyone goes to her to get advice, she is popular, she goes to amazing room with amazing rooms. The reasons I gave this exhibition are 3: 1. Action is terrible.Sometimes I just want to hurt people who put these uninvited actors (especially Victoria justice) on television. 2. Characters are incredible and unsuitable. You have your typical popular girl. Peppy, low, stupid, stereotypical girl, depicted by a terrible actor. Then you have a typical jockey man who is somewhat normal and really nice. Then there is a stereotypical smart girl who is a freak and probably doesn't fit her perfect friends. Then the rich was a real boy who would be happy in the mirror all day. Then he wants to be an actor played by another smelly actress. And the last common nerve boy. 3. The plot is boring and flat. 4. I hate these badges being corrupted. Can't they just be normal! 5. Everything is perfect for them and we all remember how much our life smells.
