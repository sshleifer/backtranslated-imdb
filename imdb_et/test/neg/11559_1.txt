After watching this movie, I could not notice the parallels between this and the second movie "America 3000". Both were very bad in the mid-1980s after the cellulose apocalypse accidents. Obviously, both films have found fake kits, wood-working and stupid monsters. The only difference between the two is that the leading affliction here (played by Angelika Jager) is very thick. Avoid this if you look at the MST3K version. Joel and the robots saved this turkey hardly.
