Okay, I agree with all of Barney's enemies on this site. I think Barney and his friends are all stupid and unpleasant and the performances are very silly and unreal. <br /> <br /> But the thing that most pointed to me is how Barney introduced his gays, lesbians and bisexuals to show when talking about same-sex parents and relatives. This would not be such a big problem if the creators of this exhibition did not use so many homosexual stereotypes. I mean, not all gay men wear mascara and love the purple and pink colors, and not all lesbians are ugly and men who look at their abdomen. The bisexual wife thinks it is terrible for a children's program. If it were South Park, I wouldn't want to think about it because South Park is for people who can differentiate fantasy from reality. Many people who look at Barney are small children or people with disabilities who cannot usually distinguish fantasy from reality. <br /> <br /> And now, when I think about it, Barney is like the ugly gay stereotype itself. Let's see that he doesn't have a girlfriend, he's pinkish-colored and wears clothes with the litter (yes, that's true). If you claim to have the rights of homosexual and bisexual individuals, stop blaspheming them for those who do not know better. When Barney went to the black face while eating fried chicken and watermelon, the exhibition is pulled out of the air before you know it. <br /> <br /> I'll give it a negative five. Don't show your children this hateful crap. There are children's exhibitions that are so less offensive.
