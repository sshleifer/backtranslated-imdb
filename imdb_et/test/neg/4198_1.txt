I rented Dark Harvest (first) because it looked like cheesy monster-on-box-type excitement. Peace fears also mean me out. The title of the movie was effective, but what followed was pretty flat (flat, bad lighting, acting, editing, direction ...). Recently I noticed that DH 2: Mais had a pretty extensive advertising campaign. I thought maybe the first one was a bit of a success, so they brought it a little ante, probably giving a bigger budget fear and fx killer scarecrows. Well, there is no peacock in the video ... No problem. Problems begin in DH 2 with a title sequence that looks like an unfinished concept. As for real photography ... every time the sun is shining, you should put all these white whites, confirming that you are looking at some ultra-low budget mini-DV project that some Midwesterners filmed for their people. Operation didn't work at all. The Shining twin girls' cheap burst was under the standards of filmmaker student students. Editing was very amateur and lazy. The sound was dirty and messy. (For example, every time an editor cuts a new image, here's the sound editing perspective.). Just like someone collecting their friends and family (actors), took the camera out for three days with the camera, put it on for a consecutive light (no joke - that's what they actually did), burned out some tapes, shut up video clips on their computer, cut (very) untreated version thrown into the music, by any imaginative work or mixing, burned it directly on the DVD and threw it on the shelf of the video shop. Any spooky fan of this type of direct video work should be offended because it is a trivial skill or style. Just because a person owns a video camera and is able to take a little picture of the tape does not mean that it should be public. If I could give it an estimate lower than one, I would be.
