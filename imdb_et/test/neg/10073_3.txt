How sad is it when a movie that is as wonderful as "Jurassic Park" slowly pulls its franchise into a hackney and mediocre area. The latest sequel, Jurassic Park III, has not signaled characters, story, or pretty much a script, but relies on a non-stop-dinosaur that is neither exciting nor very interesting to watch. Dinosaurs seemed incredibly counterfeit compared to 1993 technology, after seven years of CGI advancement, it only gives more feeling that the film was pumped out for summer only by its name. The introduction of Pterodactyl is not a great movie. <br /> <br /> Go to Shrek again. <br /> <br />
