they should watch terrorists watch this video as a torture, not just for a disturbing final scene where the tying and beating of a woman with a mental problem is probably the source of comedy. about half an hour of this would be convincing even for a more static fundamentalist to bounce rather than sit for another minute of this disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. I rented it because my friend said it was fun, but found that he was talking about a blower who made comments rather than the film itself. I think if you find the unlimited arrogance funny, you like it. Obviously, it goes on and on the chicks he "banged" is the most tasteful example when the driver is on the screen. <br /> <br /> In fact, CJ Stacy was the only good part of this movie - his charisma shines like a diamond in this terrifying chorus. This is probably the only film he has made for IMDb, I hope he's involved in theater or indie because I think he has the talent and natural beauty that really is for any production.
