This movie wasn't the best ... but it had good actors. Isiaia Washington was pretty good when the homeless man, Guy Torrey, was good as his disabled brother, Ice-T was humorous and surprisingly as a landlord ... actor Tami Roman was good as a film judge. I didn't even know that it was her and I'm a serious Real World fan. He was completely plausible. Hopefully this film will not hinder the development of these actors. I know Isiaia has left this film far behind the success of Gray anatomy, Ice-T with her regular role in NYPD Special Unitis and Tami Roman has repeatedly played a role in Sex Love and Secrets (UPN's new soap opera). I want the other participants the same, because one bad film does not do a bad actor.
