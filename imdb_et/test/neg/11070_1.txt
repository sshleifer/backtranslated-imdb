If I could give this apology to the film 0 or the negative rating I would like. I was stupid enough to pick it in a DVD store, read the gap and think it sounds pretty good, I spend 10 pounds and buy it. everything I had at the end was Â£ 10. Absolutely terrible, I don't even know where to start. I have no idea why anyone has given it more than 2 letters because I can't say anything about it. The plot is basically 7 people who go to the unexplored cave, one of them being a reporter. no one else knows they are there. When they enter the cave, they can't get out and they can kill the monster one by one. There is no reason for the reporter. One character has some previous demons where his former girlfriend 2 years ago cave a cave ... it doesn't seem to be of any importance or reason, but I think the garbage is a characteristic building? Anyway, the monster turns out to be a man who erred in the cave as a normal little child and lived there for his entire life. It does not cause him to be supernatural for any reason, is able to glow, see in the dark, take a ball, breathe underwater, be in two places at once and is crazy (able to move boulders, carry dead weight, etc.). <br /> <br /> The end scene has two women who are alive, they wake up naked, just cover a little carpet or something. They then find a picture of the children. The monster then breaks into the door, wrapping a carpet with some kind of skull over the head (says the comment of the directors that it was a crow's skull, so that it would be the biggest crow I have seen in my life) and quite literally "Raahhh "like a baby in Halloween. I looked at it with my boyfriend and at that point he literally laughed. Then the boy sees himself as a child, and he has the backdrop that he is sitting under a tree, where his face is all burnt and then risen and deceived. This is the extent of the backlog, why it distorts people and leaves you with a bit of a fraud story. The monster is killing one woman and brutally abducting you by cutting credit. I know the rape scene is shocking, but the woman just made me sick and most affected me in the film. She could have killed her and cut her into pieces and ate her and it would have been less terrible than rape. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that have not been answered at the end. Besides all the scenes where the minutes were only in black and nothing else was annoying and constant nausea in the corners of the camera where all this was upside down, and you didn't see what was happening to me in so many wounds at one point I almost turned it off. Absolutely terrible movie. You may also get the money you are going to spend on it and shoot it, it would be a better spending of money, like a smart person who posted me, if you have watched it, you can't watch it. that.
