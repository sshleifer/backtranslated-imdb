We've all seen bad movies, well this cake. I've seen a junior movie box that many times looks at my many trips to the local video store horror section, and I was a little interested, it seems to pay tribute to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so I thought I'd get it. Error! Junior sucks hard, long and dedicated. In other words, it's really bad. Although it has won its award for the most creative use of the bikini head. AVOID !!
