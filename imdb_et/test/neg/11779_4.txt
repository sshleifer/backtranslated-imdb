This movie, which I just discovered in a video store, has probably been sitting for a few years without a distributor. It's easy to understand why. The story of two friends living in New York looking for a ball from high school, who now lives among homeless people in Coney Island, is a very good movie blink, but ultimately it is weighted with Stan and Daniel. Richie, not their homeless friend. Cryer is traditionally very good and has a nice look at Coney Island's haunting images. But the writer Cryer and director Richard Schenkman are too busy to deal with Stan and Daniel's rather uninteresting lives, rather than focusing on Richie. In a music shop where Richie's employee has split, one backlash is showing and really shows the viewer where the film would have gone. But finally, not much. Two many challenged scenes, for example, inside a skateboard building. Rating of 4 out of 10.
