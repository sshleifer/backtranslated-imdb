Based on Stephen King's novel, NEEDFUL THINGS provides intrigue and erosion to keep you on your seat. The mysterious man (Max von Sydow) comes to town and will soon be able to talk to the citizens. Could it be that the devil himself has put a shop in the small town of Maine as an antique seller? von Sydow is masterful and dynamic in the role that displays the screen. Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedelia are also starring. Harris is stable and Bedelia deserves your attention. Also J.T. Walsh and Amanda Plummer. Not the best, nor the worst customization of King's horror on the screen.
