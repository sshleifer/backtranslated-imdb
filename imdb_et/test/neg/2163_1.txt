The Cyber ​​Zone, because this DVD was sold in Oz, is about the worst B-Class junk I've seen. Apart from the singer's body, showing that he knew how bad the film is, the other parties are about real real aspirations (Swanson and Quarry) or the absurd imitations of classical film scenes. Mathius Hues is the most ham-fisted image of death since Jim Carrey's mask. Anything that does not have a real paragraph to suggest that the experiment is ransacked by genre, period, or common veins is just annoying. Don't even try to join the dots. This is Blade Runner, which is limited due to a very limited budget, without any content, actors or landscapes. "You get what you pay for" is never obvious. Reusing limited sets is repeatedly irritating without the need to pay attention to the binding and special effects that would have hit the floor of Dr Who's cutting room in 1976. A helicopter explosion is worth showing your point. Of course, there are masochists who start to drift, but if you look at the film's contribution, make sure you get more than your pay rate. At $ 2, this makes DVD a cheap and interesting beer cover.
