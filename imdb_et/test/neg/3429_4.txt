This second World War II film, placed in Borneo, is trying to do so much work on so many levels, it is a shame that all of them will fail. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte is an escaping American who witnesses his comrades in Japan. He travels deep into the jungle of Borneo. Cue Nigel Havers, who finds the Nolte tribe. Nolte, now looking at Robert Plant, has become a new king of his tribe. He won a bloody battle with a steadfast soldier and he had a talkable tattoo on his chest (dragon). Now, before you go out and get a painful tattoo and a one-way ticket to Borneo, things don't go well in Nolteland. Havers wants the tribe to help fight against Japan who are invading the island. He teaches the use of machine guns to indigenous people and begins a lot of o shooting. As the tribe becomes more successful, they oppose a new Japanese team who are not similar to others. This team is capable of losing the villages they conquer to keep their power up (talk about their sushi) and move faster than the tribe through the jungle. Since we know the end result of the war, we finally know the triumph of the tribe, but with serious accidents. Here spoilers come: Havers are injured and have returned to "civilization". He gives the kingdom a place and Nolte is caught. Havers then goes through Nolte's release and the final credit role. <br /> <br /> Milius' direction is certainly enough, but the scenario is quite vague in its motivation. It offers story ideas, then abandons them to get the next story idea. Nolte is terrible when a soldier turned to the king, desperately struggling with the spirit of Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz. He talks about freedom and the beauty of the jungle and the wealth of his people, and you do not believe in one second what he says. He is often inadvertently funny, especially his initial mistake in the jungle, and he spends the rest of the movie that sounds like a hippie. Nigel Havers spends the film watching Nolte as he was Raquel Welch. The vague homosexual undercurrent between the two goes beyond friendship, not at all, and he thinks of an oral relationship that was supposed to tell the natives. <br /> <br /> Havers often stands around and has an internal conflict that contradicts the genius of the tribe but catches Nolte's attention. His fellow straight British soldiers go faster than the local Biten landing party in Tahiti, but all I have seen about Borneo is that it is very damp and has green green. away from Nolte's location, is totally unjustified. There's no point in why Havers does this, except to keep the movie going. I was angry when Havers and Nolte accidentally arrived at the same ship that goes to the Philippines, the ship is going to run and Havers is on hold to release freshly crushed Nolte. Not to say goodbye to kiss, but Havers says goodbye to the king, explaining the title. <br /> <br /> If you fought against the war and the enemy squadron eaten by your allies, wouldn't it be bad for you? This elite Japanese group has not been shown enough, although their eating habits are so terrible that I will immediately become a conscientious objection. A similar ghostly enemy was treated much better in the "13th War". <br /> <br /> Other interesting ideas are abandoned. But the fact that modern technology brings about so many setbacks to death? Why did King Nolte give the British people too much hesitation in using their subjects? Why can't Hollywood find a decent actress playing General Douglas MacArthuri? <br /> <br /> Ultimately, "King's Soul Compensation" is hopeless, not endorsed by a strong cord, and trying to do too many things without thinking and exploring its potential. I can't recommend it. <br /> <br /> This movie is rated (PG13) for strong physical violence, strong weapon violence, some fears, some embarrassment, some sexual references, and adult situations.
