I had great hopes for it until they changed the name "The Shepherd: Border Patrol, the name of a flat film that was just wrong with" Shepherd. "It is busy with numbers that hints at the hat in many classic Van Damme films. is a fun activity that reminded me of a hard target and a universal soldier, but it is disgraceful and intense. There is one big line about "p * ss drunk and rabbit wearing" and some OK scenes that are just that cheap. The times when dialogue does not fit with the mouths of the characters and the stuntmen fall within the dead seconds before they are even shot. The final fight is one of the best Van Damme battles, unless the director tries to get too little to John Woo and can't get in. Bring the setbacks that no one really cares about, but goes the way that van Damme's whole point is not good, not bad, but an average overall activity.
