I think I understand why critics give this film five stars, it's not fantastic, but I think it's worth watching from director Shawn Levy (tenth, cheaper at the night of the museum). Basically, 14-year-old Jason Shepherd (Malcolm Middle Frankie Munizis) often lies to his parents and teachers, and his teacher warns him that if he does not do his creative writing, he will not be able to complete the semester and repeat the class in the summer. So he finishes his job, but the Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti), who hit him at school, managed to leave his paper in the Big Fat Liar car. He discovers from the trailer that Marty stole his paper and makes it a big movie, so he and his best friend, Kaylee (He's Man Amanda Bynes), have the mission to prove that Jason is ever telling the truth. Of course Marty is too disgusting and funny to give a phone call to Jason's father Harry (Michael Bryan French) and burns "Big Fat Liar" paper. Now, Jason and Kaylee have decided to make Marty's life as hell as he agrees to call Jason's father. They put a blue color in their pool and orange hair dyes in their shampoo and many more naughty knees that create Marty's career. There is an obvious point when Jason looks like he wants to give up, but don't worry, all the characters who despise Marty's help in the final operation, and Jason's parents, he finally wants to prove his truthfulness and the boy does it he offers a great style. Amanda Detmer also plays as Monty Kirkham, Lee Majors as Vince, Donald Adeosun Faison Frank Jackson, Sandra Oh as Mr Phyllis Caldwell, Russell Hornsby as Marcus Duncan, Christine Tucci as Carol Shepherd and American Pie's John Cho as Dustin 'Dusty' Wong. Muniz is pleasant, Byrnes proves a very surprisingly talented support, and although he wastes his time and talent a little, Giamatti is very disgusting. It's a children's film, so if it looks bright, cheesy or predictable, then keep that in mind and try to enjoy the shows and hits. Okay!
