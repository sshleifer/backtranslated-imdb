If at all possible, try watching all five universal "moms" movies, not just for the film's continuity, but also for its obvious lack. Of course, it is clear that Boris Karloff's classic "The Mummy" should not really call the same breath as the so-called "descendants" that all come from camp or culture. <br /> <br /> This time it turned out that Princess Ananka's mummified remnants have arrived in the United States. And again, if your eyes cheat on you, Kumm had no mummy "Mummy in the grave" for the second time, but is alive and looking for his lost love for Princess Ananka's rhetorical nine-tale page. cooked during the full moon cycle. To complete mythology, Kharis needs a caregiver, brutally executed by John Carradine as Yousef Bey, charged with the Arkan high priest George Zucco Andoheb. <br /> <br /> Kharis and Ananka will return to their final holiday spot in the Egyptian mountains. But as we have seen before, giving up the high priest is a definite contribution to failure, the Carradine's character falling into the reincarnation of Ananka, Amina Monsour (Ramsay Ames). It's shocking to see that Yousef Bey and PO's tie over with a proud Amina. <br /> <br /> Riddle this - in both "Tomb" and "Curse", Lon Chaney represents a mummy with a sliding right hand that is helplessly folded. When he experiences a muted Amina, he rises up in both hands without any problems; as soon as he puts his right hand back, it will return again. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is the most remarkable - the monster gets the girl! But this is a short-term victory, because the mommy and her robbed bride went to the grave, filled with the ancient Egyptian curse - "Those who defy the will of these ancient gods are cruel and violent death."
