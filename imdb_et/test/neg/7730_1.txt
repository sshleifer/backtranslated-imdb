This movie is at times with Oscar and Moment by Moment as one of the unintentionally funny movies of all time. <br /> <br /> It's great to rent a very big laugh. <br /> <br /> The story is absolutely ridiculous. Nothing in life would happen as it is so incredible. the way James Woods tries to tear a heavy hit when they give the assumed two-bit hustler work 3000 miles from LA, which is a joke. Sean Young is so incredibly bad as: "I love you forever, no matter what, woman," you will ever see. it was not so funny that you threw away how sweet the young sweet is trying to bring you out. And how bad acts like you will ever see. <br /> <br /> James Wood moves across the movie and is so extreme funny and is five, so it's up, it's not just believed, Woods seems like a Saturday night cocaine parody. But looking at Woods' lutes, the rental price is worth it. <br /> <br /> I love Woods telling a man who wants to give him more "lud" that he doesn't do it anymore, just before Woods just made three huge coke lines. <br /> <br /> It's some very funny things. <br /> <br /> The end is so comical but parallel to the rest of the movie.
