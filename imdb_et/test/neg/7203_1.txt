I rented the impression of this movie that it was "Scarecrow 3: Dark Harvest," I thought it was a sequel to the Scarecrow Slayer series (the second very ridiculous and all together scary movie series). However, I was not disappointed. It was just as terrible, if not worse than I expected. I laughed throughout the movie. The bad behavior, poor shooting and cutting of each movie and the terrible special effect make this movie a rental value. <br /> <br /> Special features include a pathetic view of cast and team six-month filming. <br /> <br /> Favorite line, "The sins of my forefathers! They have fallen to this point!"
