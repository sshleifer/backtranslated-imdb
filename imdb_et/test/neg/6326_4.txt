I have to comment on this movie because I gave it 4 ratings and I think it's pretty high for a soft film. The real plot is a kind of hokey (who would expect otherwise), but Hafron is so incredibly funny, and he gives everything with a kyborgish voice so it's easy for him. Whoever wrote the script was definitely worth it! I have to laugh ten times loud and this is not the reason why someone would get this movie. The only soft film I saw with other values ​​than beautiful women (and believe me, Emmanuelle has fallen dead gorgeous ... just look at the cover!) <br /> <br /> Any movie that can attract me Considering how bad the plot was, and how bad it is, the film is also entertaining, so it gets at least four in my book. I mean, don't look at it before Stop! Or does my mother shoot?
