Breaking Dawn begins at California College when Professor Simon (co-producer Joe Morton) tells his students that they have to conduct an intensive six-week mental patient study in a national hospital as an important part of their education, fail and never become qualified doctors. A bright, young, attractive and intelligent student named Eve (Kelly Overton) is particularly hard to learn. His name is Don Wake (James Haven) and has been convicted of being a killer, found alongside a blood-borne female body (Diane Verona) and his young daughter (Jenette McCurdy). On the first day, Don doesn't even have much less with Eve to talk to him, but as a soldier, he has continued to try to figure out Eve. Finally, Don begins to speak, but what he says is intimidating Eve, he says that someone is following him and mentions Malachay. Then Eve starts seeing her in the dark every time, because Don asks the theories of conspiracy and odd statements. Eve slowly begins to lose her mind as the line between fantasy and reality becomes more and more blurred. Is there more than the alleged crap that Don speaks of after the psychiatric patient's crazy attacks ...? <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Mark Edwin Robinson I have nothing but negative feelings about Breaking Dawn. Now, as we all want good twist, it ends, which fails us, surprises us, works well with the rest of the movie and stays in our memory like The Sixth Sense (1999) & Fight Club's cool twist-ends (1999) a good example and, to a lesser extent, the end of films like Scream (1996), where killer identity is a nice surprise and it is not obvious. Then, of course, there are movies whose ends break everything that has gone before and like, take, oh I don't know I say Breaking Dawn, because I've never seen such a terrible end of the movie. Breaking Dawn begins as a thriller of decent psychological horror, which will happen to Eve with terrible things, it is not the most imaginative film imaginative, but it is of interest, it is never the most absorbing film, but it is also more than observable and it is not such a bad film before the end of the twist, but I have to mention it because everything else up to that point (which was OK to be fair about it) suddenly becomes irrelevant. I am sure there are people who think they have this confusing confusion from the end that has come to the last detail, all I can say is that nobody can explain this to me satisfactorily and so far as I am worried, it makes little sense and never. Breaking Dawn is a mess and it is a waste of time looking at the end of the history of the film story, it's as simple and direct as it is. <br /> <br /> Director Robinson is not in favor of a mess that could have been a decent thriller, maybe he thought that what he had shot OK or maybe it was destroyed in the edit room, but I imagine it was more likely to be a garbage script if he tried to tie all the absurds together within a few minutes and give us all the happier final shots. He builds tension well in the first 80 minutes, but it's all over at the end. <br /> <br /> Technically breakable Dawn is good and is generally well done. The action is pretty good, Overton is beautiful and easy on the eyes and puts on decent performance. Was it just me or a man who played Doni looking like John Morghen, an Italian sleaze classics like Cannibal Apocalypse (1980), The Dead City of Life (1980), on the edge of a house park (1980), Cannibal Ferox (1981) , Stagefright (1987) and Church (1989)? OK, maybe it was just me ... <br /> <br /> Dawn's interruption is garbage, I hated it in the last few minutes. Don't do me wrong, it wasn't exactly that excited about that, but it was OK. Definitely one I'm worried about, though it seems to be a fair share of positive comments on IMDb ...
