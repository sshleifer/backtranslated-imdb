There are many so-called anti-war / anti-govt. Political films that begin now as mea culpa and end with "our poor boys get hell there, so that the world can compassion with the world, it's not their fault" - such things. I was in half that it would be the second in this style, even if it had dealt with another topic / aspect of the same subject. I almost didn't go and didn't see it; that's why i almost didn't write this review. What did we get here? Egypt receives a secret torture center with orders from the US, but it is another Egyptian who has to torture, not an American: "Behold, our Americans are clean," and the Egyptians are bad anyway to let them harm themselves. Oh, and we had to have the American conscience good: they really do have a lot of Americans, but here the term was wrong. Yes, we all know that it is called extraordinary rendition and it started with Clinton's time and is now being used for very distant reasons. Otherwise, it was very frightening and nervous to condemn the United States as a party to condemnation; as if the creators were afraid to go all the way because they fear they are not patriotic or whatever (see the bulletin board! Anyone who apologizes gets a face from a heavy verbal artillery). Torture is a terrible thing, be it guilty or not; In the 18th century, King Frederick, King of Prussia, canceled the convicted murderers - although I have to say that the life of a child's guardian is much lower than what I want to see. Okay, what is torture? This film did not prove enough of its horror and hopelessness. During torture (now the capitals are coming to emphasize, I will not cry) would say YOU WHO HAVE NOT BEEN RETURNED, IF YOU HAVE NOT KNOWED IF YOU NEED, HOW TO COMPLY, IF YOU SAY IF YOU ARE KILLED, SHOULD STOP. THERE IS NO, IF YOU DO NOT USE AND HOW TO RECOMMEND THAT YOU ARE YOURSELF THAT YOU ARE YOU, YOU "YOU". Another thing that the film did not bring out was that TORTURE IS A PUBLICATION, INDEPENDENT EFFICIENT AND THOSE WHO RECEIVE THE DAY WITH YOUR LIFE. It somehow makes people inside. How do I know that? Do not ask. <br /> <br /> Re-edit: Two things: The Arabic language used in the movie was not an Egyptian break. It's sort of worse than creating a movie in New Zealand with local people, all with American accents. Also, the terrible little preacher who sparked his ignorant audience into violence, the things unknown to those religion that should have come out, speaks. It has also not been explained that any nasal complex may become soil / suck; he does not need any special qualifications, and this is a shame that needs to be corrected: many are acceptable because of their fundamentalist views, and the great US ally, Saudi Arabia, is financing so much. Thank you very much for this room.
