You just stopped watching this movie. I couldn't imagine it when I was watching VHS because there were scenes where I needed subtitles to hear the pressure or sound effect, although the scene was in English. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is appealing. Few CG effects were very obvious insertions, but the effects of prostheses / creatures were not bad. Not perfect, but photography and editing (which were pretty good) made up a lot. Action was generally bad, although how much of this can be blamed on the director, whom I could not say, having ever seen any participant. I think the exception was Mr Gomez (Uxia). He stole every scene he had, and not just because of a very beautiful face, but there was something similar that his performance was urgent, none of which was. Writing could have been much better - the plot was still unmistakably Lovecraft, and many Lovecraft details were written, but I could personally do it without dialogue.
