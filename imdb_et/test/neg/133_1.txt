Today, writers, directors and producers increasingly rely on 'surprise'. The closing of the old art film, the collection of all the information learned through the film, and the completion of a nice complete end have disappeared. Now, what we have is a movie that can be put together in 5 minutes, no matter how complicated, detailed or frivolous. It was all with his head. This explanation is the director's safety net. If everything else fails, or if the writing was not so good or when the money went to finish the movie, we can always say, "It was all in his head" and finished the movie so. Audience buys it because none of us are psychologists and no one of us suffers from schizophrenia (not what we know) so we can take that story and believe it. After all, the mind is a powerful thing. Some movies have pulled it out. But these movies are the reason why we are getting more crap at the end. Every director / writer now thinks they can pull it out because well, Club Club did it and made a lot of money. That's how we get movies like a mechanic, a secret window, an identity, and that movie (just a few names).
