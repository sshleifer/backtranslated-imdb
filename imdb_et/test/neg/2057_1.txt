This film is probably one of the three worst films in history. I rented it at random, unread reviews and wow, I regret it. There really is no plot, really no vampire genre. Just a terrible god. Watching this movie brings your enthusiasm for vampire movies. I felt that the writer / director / producer went to this drug use and hallucination and tried to re-create it on the film. All the time I wanted to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> If this review can only save one person for viewing this mess, I felt that it was worth signing up for my registration and review.
