Aaran is one of the films where you can find loops of loops in Indian cinema. Here is a good example of how great writers, directors and actors retreat to producers. Here is one of the most amazing actors, Mohanlal, acting in the film as a true story of Kashmir. The seriousness of the movie is killed with ordinary comics and songs. It is this character, Havaldar Jaykumar, who is actually the son of the film producer. So he has no hair cut, even though his officer asks him to do so. This child does not know what works and he is the "hero" of the movie. God Help Indian Cinema With Such Manufacturers. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pathetic screen of what is happening in Kashmir. A sensible viewer can intuitively understand the limitations of such wonderful writers, actors and leaders who want to share their real life experiences. However, it is regrettable that the film's highest ranks of Indian Indian soldiers is a pathetic screen that only thinks the film was stupid. <br /> <br /> We should make such producers out of the film industry and pave the way for good cinema.
