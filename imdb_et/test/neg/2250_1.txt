I'll never go to another Tarantino movie. The whole movie was worthless. My husband and I regret that we didn't get up and walked out of the first reference to what the film really was about to lead (which is still difficult to identify because it was such a ridiculous story ... blood, guts, and violence seemed the only real thing ), but we hoped that there was something redemption in the corner. Unfortunately, it wasn't there because there was nothing that would make sense! We, along with many other audiences, went out of the theater, which was "disgusting", "what a waste of time", "I should have stepped out", "where was the comedy", "it was pathetic", and so on. In fact, he made us, the audience, our reluctance and the feeling that we have just just ripped. The only thing worth mentioning in the film was that the movie had almost everyone's costume and acting ... there wasn't just a plot / script worthy of their talent. I appreciate it 1 because it is not 0. I don't quite understand how anyone could rate it higher than 0!
