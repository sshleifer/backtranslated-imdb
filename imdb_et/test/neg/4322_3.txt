SPOILER AHEAD! Mummy (Lon Chaney Jr.) is in the city of New England College, looking for a college student (Ramsey Ames) who is the reincarnation of her beloved Princess Ananka. Bored, slow (even 65 minutes - it's slower than mummy!), Acted indifferently, but the end is worth it. The mummy gets the girl (!!!!!) and she gets older quickly, as both sink slowly in the swamp. This is (I believe) the only time in the universal monster movie that the monster got a girl! It's aside, it's a tough amateur night. Probably the worst sequel to the mummy - and it says something!
