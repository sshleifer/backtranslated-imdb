I have nothing for Paul Schrader. In fact, HARDCORE (1979) is one of my favorite films. But some of the horror movie fans were premature to ring when his original version of EXORCIST prequel (DOMINION; what you read about now, as it turns out) was bursting with Warners, and when Renny Harlin was replaced with spruce things to create a new version that was "more scary". In my opinion, some viewers were biased and they automatically became cheese to hate Renny Harlin's theme (EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING) before the first film was ever out of touch. And I have to know; because I myself went to BEGINNING's theatrical premiere with a stubborn weapon that was ready and prepared for the absolute worst I was certain. Imagine your surprise when I found that Harlin's BEGINNING is much more serious than I would ever have been, Stellan Skarsgard, as the father of Merrini's younger version, who fought with faith in God. It was in no way an excellent film, but it was not close to the garbage I was preparing to see without seeing it. Well, now I've seen a real garbage version - and that's Paul Schrader's DOMINION: PREQUEL EXORCIST. It was relentless, uninteresting and uncomfortable. Stellan Skarsgard's troubled priest was not nearly as interesting as he had been in Harlin's movie, and the actor himself wasn't that good at all. For all those who marked the obvious CGI effects at BEGINNING, guess what? They're also here at DOMINION. Remember the stupid end of Harlin's transfer (which I agree with the rest of this movie)? Well, you find that it ends with Schrader is not much less flat. <br /> <br /> Let me also say that I am angry with the crap that those who appreciate this film are better than Harlin, saying we are "slowing down" or "can't understand fine filmmaking". As a person who despises Stephen Sommers' MTV format for the '99 year, and being a true fan of the 30's and 40's very brilliant and discreet old horror movies, I can assure you that this is not the case for me. Harlin BEGINNING had at least "sharpness" and exorcist type moves; this is just a real exercise in tedium and a great challenge for the most certified insomniacs. It is quite interesting to hear that spooky fans are trying to convince themselves that DOMINION: PREQUEL EXORCIST was as good as they would have thought before; as they were already accustomed to the Harlin INITIATION sheep, they learned that Paul Schrader's name became White-Out.
