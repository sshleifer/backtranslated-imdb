Sometimes, when the film is sealed by critics, you just have to see if it is really as bad as the requirement, even in this case. I believe it was supposed to be a sex comedy, but it wasn't sexy or funny, I think I smiled once Johnny Vegas was unable to arch around the roadside fence and that was it. <br /> <br /> The film follows the life of four men who live potatoes alive, everyone has problems with their sex life; Dave has left her wife and is looking for an old flame who, a few years ago, called her thirty, Ferris lives with her mother who treats her as a sexual object, Tolly is obsessed with engaging strawberry jam in her meetings, and Jeremy says she is in a loving relationship, but in fact she is it's poor women. <br /> <br /> The tone of jokes varies from tasteless and I don't think anyone could write it. the latter is when they talk about a small child, his father is dead in a car accident, then on the stroke of a boy asking how his mother has told him that he is a coma. The reason for this is all the writers' feet, the actors obviously made a bad choice to agree to participate in this movie, but I didn't think their behavior was so bad ... not that everything was so good. Surprisingly, the relatively weak gender related sex is never erotic. <br /> <br /> Certainly, it would not be advisable to see it for any reason other than curious curiosity, although it seems to be love or barely a film based on other reviews, I suspect it would be better to watch some beers and your companions.
