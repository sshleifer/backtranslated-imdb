For all purposes, Showtime was the worst film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Why? For pouring into Denir adds immediate credibility and changes in movie viewing. I had also made a mistake during the 48 hours of watching Beverly Hills Cop before I saw Showtime and for some strange reason I thought Eddie Murphy was still funny. Well, he's not. In fact, it almost seems to have been irrigated. When I watched this movie, I was surprised that Deniro decided it was a good enough script to give his name. There's no chemistry between him and Murphy. Terrible writing, terrible jokes, the movie you think should be good, doesn't make it much worse. Not too long after the session, which was Showtime, I happened to look at the national security that Martin Lawrence played. The movie had its funny parts, but it wasn't that big. But it was 20 times better than Showtime. Please, if your Deniro fan doesn't watch this movie!
