The director is sweet, as is her co-directed woman, Shira Geffen, but their film sucks. It has its moments (and some beautiful girls), but there is too much: "Am√©lie" meets "waves to break" meets "Pauline on the beach". You walk away who want to know more about a photographer and a girl who loves it best if nothing happens, whether in movies or in real life. Instead, you get a golden heart suicide writer, a neurotic actor and an illegal immigrant-coming social worker. The script seems to have more than one really relevant story, but the face value has the story of the dragged and sentimental stories. It's hard to sit as it is.
