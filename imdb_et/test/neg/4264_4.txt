This film did not give Mr Bachchan justice. He is a great actor and I was very disappointed with the film and there wasn't much land on it. In fact, this is the first movie I've ever been disappointed with. It starts at her daughter's home and she is a photographer. He photographs him in the garden, whether he throws himself off. He is a sixty-year-old man who has nothing to do, but to take pictures of this girl. Movie doesn't make sense. The whole movie speaks around him and he tells him how much he cares about him. Then her daughter falls and she has to move around with her so she's not bored and the daughter knows. I just didn't think this film was Bachchan standards. He's better than this movie. I always imagined him as the ultimate person, and then I saw him in this movie and I couldn't see him in this movie. The film had no interest at all. I couldn't wait until the movie was finished. And you don't.
