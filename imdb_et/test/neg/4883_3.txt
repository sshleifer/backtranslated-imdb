This movie is, at least, overpriced. It's not good as comedy, and it's not good as a "serious" movie. Stimulation is too sparse for the former, and too much for the latter. Only a few Bud Spencer's reaction shots are laughing when he gets irritated by his brother's behavior. Duplication is great, but full-frame framing is terrible. (* 1/2)
