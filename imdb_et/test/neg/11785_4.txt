I think Walter Pidgeon was badly confused about this movie. Just in the role is not credible. Barbara Eden was beautiful and worked well enough. No one else was memorable at all. <br /> <br /> As a small child, I remember this movie was turned off from this movie. I even think I had a plastic "Seaview" that would have sunk and was great for playing in the tub. Long time ago. <br /> <br /> With regard to some of the other criticisms that I have read about this film, it is definitely unfair to judge 4-year-old special effects or scientific knowledge by modern standards. The effects were OK in 1961. Not big, but OK. As for science, it was ridiculous even in 1961. The sub was also terribly wide. I understand that the Navy refused to give this film any help, so perhaps the filmmakers had no idea. <br /> <br /> Overall, I miss the movie. (And I'm a sci-fi fan.) It can't be recommended. Rating: D-
