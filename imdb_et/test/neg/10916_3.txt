1983 was the year of Stephen King's book bumper, which put it on the big screen. Christine, The Dead Zone, and Cujo all appeared within a few months. Although The Dead Zone was a mildly clustered choice, both Christine and Cujo were both quite bad and this is a close thing that is smaller than the two. If you want to answer, I would say that Cujo - marginally - is the weakest. <br /> <br /> Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace, fresh when Elliot's mother "ET - extra ground" mother) is a mother whose husband, Vic (Daniel Hugh-Kelly), is hanging on a thread. She has been in contact with a local worker and now lives to leave her husband or not. Married heart pain has been pulled by the young son of Tad Trenton (Danny Pintauro), Donna and Vic, and a very confused child with chronic dark phobia, which often causes severe panic attacks. Donna and Tad take the family car for repair at a nearby mechanical workshop, but when they break their car, they stop. Things get so much worse when they discover that mechanic Joe Camber (Ed Lauter) is not there (he is his pet dog Cujo, a giant holy Bernard who has recently been bitten and infected). Soon the dog will be trapped in the car and will try to get into the vehicle to break the two unfortunate victims. The weather is hot; no living soul does not feel they are there; the car does not start; and the dog is serious about his blood ...... <br /> <br /> Cujo has the potential to be a really tight siege ring, but it never clicks. I read the book and it is quite disappointing - definitely a king - so it is hardly surprising that the film version is so small. On the printed page, the king was at least able to create a certain tension, but the film has been severely hampered by the fact that St. Bernard just isn't very scary. The cinematographer's "visuality" is a constant reminder that Cujo IS is St. Bernard. It could be forgotten in the book. In the book, Cujo sometimes seemed almost a monster. Even with half an hour's relatively short working time, Cujo becomes a tedious and patient tense experience that is sometimes unintentionally funny and certainly never as tense as it would be. They have even left the book brutally at the end of the fall and replaced it with "all well", which ends well, so that the audience can happily go home! Criticize it as an adaptation of another worse king.
