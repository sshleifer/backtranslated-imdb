If you are a Christian or Jew, hoping to see the exact Biblical (or Torah) image of the Exodus events, you are disappointed with this film. In typical Hollywood fashion, people who are not even in the Bible are "created" to support the characters and play a major role in the film. Jethro's role has changed completely and he is nothing but an unreliable father-in-law, not a shepherd who gave Moses great advice. God has been largely removed from the film, and the impression is given to Moses that he had to figure out things himself. In fact, nothing can go further. <br /> <br /> This film is a typical humanistic twist to biblical things and tries to put most of Moses' responsibility in trying to understand what God wants and what he should do. Those who know the Exodus book not only see contradictions in the film, but also the dramatic changes in events. Most importantly, they see the almost complete absence of God's dialogue with Moses, which determines everything Moses does after burning. Moses is by no means alone, as depicted in the film, God is guided by detailed and direct communication. <br /> <br /> Even Hallmark is obviously unable to admit God's direct role and to do many events without the words he speaks. makes no sense. In fact, Hallmark has changed something for compensation. For example, after the golden calf, God strikes the people and must look at the symbol of a living snake. Instead, Hallmark creates civil war and the Israelis choose the parties, then kill each other. The side of Moses, of course, wins. <br /> <br /> The value of this movie can be minimal for the unbelievers, as it can give them answers, but believers should stay away. Twisted events and changes make it a threat to anyone who doesn't know their Bible. Read Exodus for yourself, no substitute.
