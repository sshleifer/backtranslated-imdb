"Undercurrent" contains great actors for great actors who could have been put together for perfect engagement comedy. Unfortunately, they are wasted with a "woman-looking" potboiler - and paper thin. Katharine Hepburn is really brilliant as an old girl who finally marries, but her husband is deeply disturbed and hides the dark family secrets. Director Vincente Minnell has absolutely no idea how to install this extreme plot designed by Edward Chodorov's Thelma Strabel story and friendly, first-rate (including Robert Taylor, Robert Mitchum, and Edmund Gwenn) to be left in dirty waters. ** from ****
