For the film, it seems pretty good that nine stupid prisoners flee and drive on the highway. Especially because it's meant to be funny and I think the heart's warming is weird. The problem is that the movie was very rarely funny and often seemed just pointless and unnecessarily big. Just like jokes or interesting scenes were created over and over, but none of them bothered to finish any of them - no fee was paid. It was just a nonsense, and it was curved in Japan, even though they survived so many victims of crime that it was impossible to believe they were almost caught - especially since they continued using the same stolen camper. end of the day. And as far as it is, I just didn't have to see the scene after the scene when the boys pee by the road. Also believe it or not, there's a scene where four men are rape sheep! <br /> <br /> All in all, I hated this movie. And it is a shame, because I almost always love Japanese films - just not badly done and as interesting.
