It was the worst film I've ever seen. I have to admit that I did not look at it from start to finish because cleaning the toilets was more fun. <br /> <br /> "Star" was the most unpleasant thing I've ever seen, neither funny nor attractive. in fact, it is horrible and unpleasant is too free. <br /> <br /> It is painful to look, no action, especially not for a star who behaves like a doping with mental disability in one of their loud kisses by black actors. <br /> <br /> As it is horrible, because it is one of them, black actors can't hold on watching Puerto Rica's one even worse. <br /> <br /> The film's name is descriptive, it is a pest. This movie is a must.
