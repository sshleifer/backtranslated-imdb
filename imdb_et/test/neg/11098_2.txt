I know I still associate Sophie Marceau with La Boum. That was the main reason I saw this movie. But it was so boring that I almost felt asleep. I'm sorry, but his talents as an actor are not very convincing. In addition, this film was presented as special special effects and CGIs. Yes, it's not so bad for the B movie. After seeing her in the Marquis (a very ugly movie a few years ago), I thought she was playing more convincingly. But La Boum (and perhaps James Bond's "world is not enough") seems to be his only good film. Is it his "talent", does he have a bad taste in choosing his films, or just bad luck?
