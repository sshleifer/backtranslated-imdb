Multi-millionaire marries a female doctor. He has not worked for one day and is committed to his profession. She sees her every day. Something needs to be given. <br /> <br /> Our hero Henry Fonda finally decides to do something with his life. He becomes a department store salesman, but will soon be fired because poorer people need work. In the meantime, Dr. Helen Hunt (Barbara Stanwyck) has given up her practice? What to do? ? When Hunt is angry with his wife, Dr Hunt says, "You have acted like a gestapo." It should be comedy. Hogwash. Very boring, tedious movie. There is very little here.
