Mostly less painful (Alain Delon, Robert Wagner, Eddie Albert) pains, bad special effects (certainly these were the 70s, but "Alien" and "Star Wars" came from the same decade) and a story that is so ridiculous that maybe would like to cry, this is a "flight" that should have been PRESENTED. <br /> <br /> Even the Academy Award winners Cicely Tyson and George Kennedy cannot keep this "bird" in the air. br /> <br /> The third film - the airplane in the Bermuda Triangle - is unlikely to be much more plausible than this turkey. <br /> <br /> Avoid "Concorde" at all costs!
