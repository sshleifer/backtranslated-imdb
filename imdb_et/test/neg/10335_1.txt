If you've ever bought a Wal-Mart, you probably know a 5-dollar DVD that is in the electronics department. Well, this is where I found this movie. But I was deceived! You can see that on this particular DVD cover there was a big picture of Sandy Bullock on it and even named his name "headliner". I chose this to think, "Wow, I didn't know Sandra Bullock made this movie?!?!" So I was pumped to go home and watch the cool Sandra Bullock movie. To my surprise, Mrs Bullock played a small role ..... a very small role. She plays a girlfriend of a CIA agent son. Talk about supporting an actor. He may have more than two lines in the film. In addition to being deceived, this is Bullock's scam, and I watched it and I continued watching the "action packed" movie. Negative! At one point, for special effects, a gun was put on the camera. You have to look at that laugh that is terrible.
