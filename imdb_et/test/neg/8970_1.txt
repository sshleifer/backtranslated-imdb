I will never forget to look at this example at the age of about 13. Even at a young age, I remember thinking, "This is a show of Baywatch's show without one thing that makes Baywatch tolerated. Nevertheless, I was too small to be a backpacker in those days. The highest point in the Pacific was an episode where a couple of gangsters come in somebody." With thirteen years of machine guns ... on a bicycle !!! At the age of thirteen, I never laughed at something that had to be taken seriously, even I knew that Usis's task to kill and kill was a task that should never come before, When someone borrowed a car for a day, this was the decisive moment of this exhibition, with simple crimes and situations of hacking that could be taken care of by the criminals The Bike Cop.
