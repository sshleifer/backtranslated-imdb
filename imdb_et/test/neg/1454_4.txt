Before sheep's silence was beaten, director Jonathan Demme was beaten by his teeth, making unique comedies. It was one of them, and like quite a few Oscar winning American comedies, I can mention that it has a good concept, good pace, great performances, complicated romance. but it's just not very funny. Pfeiffer is a mob widow who moves to the hinterland after murdering his wife (Baldwin). The criminal who killed him (Stockwell) takes pride in Pfeiffer, his wife (Reuhl) is furious and makes things harder. Pfeiffer also falls to the policeman who runs off. All this should have laughed at the minute. Pfeiffer, a cheerful wig, is great as a widow, as well as hyperactive Ruehl and Modine are good as a nice cop. However, the script is simply without one-layer, clerical or humorous or verbal or physical species that such a film requires. The result is that it increases smiles to the best than the guffaws. It crushes charm, but it is cumbersome to humor.
