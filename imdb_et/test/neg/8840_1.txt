With great expectations, I went to see this film, Spain's contribution to the Oscar competition this year. The film is totally useless, banal, pathetic, poorly written, edited, behaved and directed, the film is too long. He cannot give the "message" he is trying to give, his storytelling, cumbersome historical conditions and, above all, his rhythm. Some extreme false alarms I haven't seen in the film for a long time (a story about Lucas, whose dead sister lives in her head, divine revelations, all this lizard crap). The spoken Spanish-speaking audiences around me created and suffered quickly, and some of the comments I heard were whether the members of the Spanish Academy had taken drugs before choosing the Oscar film.
