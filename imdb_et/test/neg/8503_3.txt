The Graffiti artist was not impressive, despite being artistic (perhaps also with low budget improvisation). There is little dialogue and, at least for me, I was disappointed that it did not give more credit and did not encourage the work of such gerilla artists. Instead, it was a story that covered a familiar territory. Two men, who basically do little more than buildings, become friends, labeling partners, and finally experimenting with relationships. They seem to be contradictory, rather uncomfortable. Little has been explained about their backgrounds and things between two young men are running fast (although I understand it because it's only 70 minutes). In recent years, there have been numerous similar parcels and productions, where the sphere of independent films begins to become as saturated as this storytelling, as the mainstream is saturated with it and much more. <br /> <br /> A large part of the film can bring a viewer who needs immediate dialogue and purpose. The primary indicator of this story (at least extensively) fills its routines with almost any kind of dialogue, unknown and nothing else to carry the viewer. And in the case of the short film, I wanted them to be much faster. That, apart from the typical plot, disturbed me. However, at least two graffiti artists had a brief glimpse of their everyday habits, even though most of it was quite free of time. <br /> <br /> Recommended if you're tired of mainstream mess I don't think about indie and are interested in this underground city art form. But you have to look at it yourself, because it seems to have been acquired with a more acquired taste. Check out Transit for the latest indiefs that focus on graffiti artists.
