Having just watched Acacia, I find that I have to accept negative comments here. I like the Asian and Korean horror, and I had great expectations of this movie. The man was disappointed. When I looked at it, I thought "they will definitely do that to watch me later," and for a while I waited for something wonderful. At the same time, I slowly realized that the film was really so bad. This is the cheapest cash for the Asian horror market I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> The main story may not be so bad, but how it is filmed seems to be the most laughable plot. A tree as a "frightening" device can be decent if used wisely, but the entire filmmaker gives us different images ... yes, tree, time and again. He seems to have the hope that the tree will do all the tension and accumulation for him, but it just seems what it is: tree shots. Well done! <br /> <br /> A slow build can be very effective and a movie that only gives the viewer a little glimpse of what is wrong can bring good fears, but not Acacia. Of course, we get a look at a child on a three-wheeled bicycle that disappears at an angle, and again, meaningful tree shots from above or below or from the side, but these scenes are not just scary. They feel stupid, especially since you realize that the director means they have to be scary. They just aren't. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, I agree with some other reviewers that the characters are ridiculous. Particularly ridiculous is the "madness" of one character. But what Acacia actually breaks is terrible editing. It's hard to see why scenes were cut as they are, but it's bad, and it kills any interrest spark that he could have. It also makes me patronize because I see what they are trying to do with it, but I can't believe they think I'm falling for such cheap ploys. <br /> <br /> Movies and lots of bad, but it is by far the worst. They have to have gone through the list of "ghost films" and all of them have been tagged, but in the end they forgot to add the actual movie.
