What a shame. It could have been good. The main problems are the script and the letter. The film is unable to decide whether to be a tiny comedy (very unlikely and normal) or whether it is a recent incomprehensible satire of East Germany and its mores. However, its efforts on the last flop are completely. The film is not well together and the ending is very artificial and incredible. Unfortunately, any stereotypes that might be about German comedy have been strengthened. <br /> <br /> Characters are one and all stereotypes, and Kim Frank's leading character is extreme. She just can't carry the film and seems to have been chosen largely for her child. It may not be the whole actor's fault (he is a pop singer) because the script does not give him much work. <br /> <br /> One plus - East German style vacation. the period is good. The worst thing is that the film somehow feels dishonest and humiliating. The film seems to be people who didn't give him the best and just wanted to laugh at the couple. (When they did it best, this is a sad case!) The GDR regime was terrible in almost every aspect, but those who lived through it deserve the better.
