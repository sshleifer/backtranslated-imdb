Even if I hadn't read Anne Rice's "Queen of Fucking" from "The Vampire Chronicle", I would probably still have thought that this movie was just terrible. <br /> <br /> It was tasteless, plot-less, it makes no sense at all. I was sitting for a while, thinking of a plot separated from the book, and the longer I thought, the worse it was. Linking it in some way to the earlier chronicle is ridiculous because it is ridiculously contradictory to this film, not to mention the book. Bare ideas from the Rice genius in "Vampire Chronicles" are polished and ridiculed. <br /> <br /> For Anne Rice fans, there is an absolute insult everywhere and such a pathetic apology to Aaliyah's last film. Indeed, it is also an insult to Aaliyah fans. <br /> <br /> Maybe the only compliment can be paid for both sound effects and some graphics. Good, as they may be, is still not enough to repent of watching this movie. In fact, I only registered for membership because I interacted with people who watched this movie (7 years after release, as it was), so as not to waste their time and wait much more for disappointment.
