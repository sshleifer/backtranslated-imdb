Here's a spoiler: At the end of the movie, a small part of you dies. You spend the rest of your life looking for this lost part in vain, but it's gone, it's gone. You will be driving in the streets at night in the neighbors' windows as they sit for dinner. Friends and family are trying to determine exactly when you were dead. You will answer their questions and concerns about an empty-eyed and some poisoned kidnapped testicle. When the AMC inevitably brings Tomcats' "movie" a month, a mysterious murder will take place in your city. You wake up on the kitchen floor next morning, with a mild taste. Then you climb into the living room and the couch. You look at the wall, you wake up a little and then start laughing. Because if your dead inside, Jake Busey's thong is actually pretty funny.
