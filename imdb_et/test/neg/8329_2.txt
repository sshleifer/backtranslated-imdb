You think that a film about blood cavities that eventually kill their employer cannot be, but would be wrong. <br /> <br /> There is no plot. There is no sign development. There is no visual beauty. <br /> <br /> This movie is a waste of time. Studying nursing relationships is zero, their sexuality is never more than grotesque, class relations are glossed, and the employer is a foolish caricature. <br /> <br /> Exciting silence and time outfits are not equal to the meaning of depth.
