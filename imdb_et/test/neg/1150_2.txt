I had an unfortunate experience of this movie preview and thought it might be interesting. I'm a fan of the two main players and I find Meatloaf strangely attractive, but it couldn't compensate for the dragging plot of this movie. This film tries to make social comments and be intelligent intelligent. I am sure that the audience will receive the sociological message clearly, but it must suffer it. Personally, no matter how bad the film is, I can't stop it in the middle. Something draws me to the end of the worst movies, but I'm often sorry. This is one of them ...
