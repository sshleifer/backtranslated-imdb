I was Stan in the movie "Dreams Come True". Stan was a friend who worked in the factory with basic education and ended up breaking his hands in the machines and was screaming (where was the ambulance?) The filmmaker was mostly pretty poor, mostly with local players from Fox Valley, Wisconsin. I saw the movie on the big screen. She played 2 nights in 3 theaters and had something special to see on the big screen. I can be biased, but generally I enjoyed it. The soundtrack was also the band Spooner, who later became Garbage. My brother, Steve Charlton, was in the movie. He played Swenson, who reached the door of the crutches to talk to the police.
