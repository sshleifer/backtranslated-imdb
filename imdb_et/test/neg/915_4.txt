It is difficult to estimate the first effort of a writer / director. After all, it's another movie when I've written or directed. James Hunter wrote a story that was interesting but suffers from uneven flow. <br /> <br /> After all, the general idea is that a man (And Rule) must choose between life and straightforward life. even in love with a killed daughter (Tatyana Ali). There is something original in demanding this, and there is no originality in this movie. <br /> <br /> I pulled out so many favorites: Tia Carrere (Trues Lies, Wayne World), Pam Grier (Jackie Brown), Frank Langella (Dracula, Good Night and Good Luck) and Ving Rhames (Rosewood, threshold). They were not disappointed in their performances, but they had little work. <br /> <br /> Direct video is becoming more and more common, but that doesn't mean it must be a waste of time. Perhaps Hunter's sophomore effort is more enjoyable.
