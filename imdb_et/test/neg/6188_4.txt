Eric Idle, Robbie Coltraine, Janet Suzman - it should have been almost impossible to go wrong. Of course, it's funny moments - in the showers when Robbie Coltraine echoes Lon Chaney Jr's terrible werewolf line "I can't help myself" is fun. Ultimately, the plot, the script and the direction are pancake flat and as tired as the 90-year-old nun after the 180's "Hail Mary". When I was a child, Carry Filled the Film in this niche, which is really a sad accusation of a film of such a promising film.
