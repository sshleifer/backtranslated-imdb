"Chairman of the Board" is a ridiculously stupid movie from the popular comic book "Carrot Top" (also seen on 1-800-COLLECT ads). He plays a surfing inventor who comes after a flat tire. The top helps him out and a few days later he finds out he's dead and given to his comedian. Even if someone else was in the role of Carrot Top, it would have been bad. The jokes (which are constantly being crushed all the time) are terrible and the idea of ​​a romantic "plot twist" should have been thrown away. DO NOT SEE!
