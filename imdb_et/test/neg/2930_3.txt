I generally like Iranian films and after Kiarostam had seen "10" at night, I was expecting a big movie. I was very disappointed. It is by far the worst Iranian film and one of the most boring Asian films I've ever seen. If you've never seen a Kiarostam movie before, check out "Ten" instead. If you want good Iranian movies, you can also try "Sib" called "Apple". This movie is divided into 5 sections and only the fourth, with some funny ducks, is worth it. If this is the first Iranian movie you see, you probably don't want to see it anymore. I don't blame you, but you leave some great movies.
