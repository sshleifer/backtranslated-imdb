Jungle terror is a real finding. When you saw it, you're one of the few lucky ones. This is fun! <br /> <br /> The story is about an airplane that falls into the South American jungle. The crash scene must be considered credible. Everyone dies during a crash or later, crocodiles are eaten alive. Only a young blonde boy will survive. Close tribes bring the child to the village and they (all men) respect him for his golden hair! I boy you NO! After all, there is a lot of wrestling between the indigenous people and the man to look for a sunken airplane. All the time, the boy is sitting on the throne and his blonde hair is surrounded by a golden halo and he cries all the time !! It's hoot !!! <br /> <br /> Very unclear and contains very questionable subtexte. Need, if you're unclear, it's so bad, it's good movies.
