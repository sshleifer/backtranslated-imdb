For those people who told me "This movie is good", they have this movie, this movie is for an audience that has no problem looking at everything (especially when it comes to hard boys, weapons, chases and heroes). movie "The Inside Man" {same time lapse}. I'm tired of copying and pasting movies. And I'm dissatisfied, but what can I do? There are many more fans of this type of film .... if you want to watch this type of movie, I recommend "Lucky Number Slevin". I don't mean I just don't like this movie (weak participants, weak script, weak action). probably someone else. Many people - many flavors. HOW MY "CHAOS" IS AN ACCOUNT!
