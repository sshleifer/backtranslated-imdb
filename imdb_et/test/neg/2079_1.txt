This 2.5-hour diluted snail seems to be one of the poorest excuses to adapt. obviously having a budget that allows for an amazing location in Greece, the money could have been better spent on developing a single script whose development and motivation is clearly outlined; especially since the bill has overcome this problem. The lack of images was not a passion and direction, leaving the viewer with a debate about whether they should worry about the death of the main characters. which highlights the second point - the main character of the original work, prospero, is not mentioned in this transfer, despite the fact that most other characters are used. fascination and magic are also noticeable in this particular piece. In fact, all of the aspects that changed the so-called tempest version full of surprise and intimacy, absorbed completely from this twisted version of a self-absorbing, pompo ass, unable to understand how to take care that nothing disturbs his wealth and power. overall, with the best effort and the proposed inspiration brutally imitated.
