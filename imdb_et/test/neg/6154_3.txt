Yeeee-Haa! I have seen that he claimed that most American films are covert cowboy films; That Hollywood is so in love that it is a truly original creation that it continues to invent a cowboy myth. I am not sure that I will fully buy this argument, but Slipstream is evidence to support the theory; it's a cowboy with planes. In fact, it gets better. It's Western Spaghetti Airplanes! Replace the planes with horses, give the android priest, and this film would not be distinguishable from one of the ten Spanish "semi-finishing" shooting games with seventies. <br /> <br /> The film is not BAD as I believed in some of the reviews I read here, but it was definitely not good.
