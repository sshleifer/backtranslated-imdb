It may never be the worst movie ever made, but it is totally boring. Wonder why this is mostly in the dark, and mostly away from or away from the Vincent Gallo camera? Because he doesn't want to show his face to actually participate in the movie. I liked his early stuff, but the "brown bunny" claim and then the casting of this generation knocked him in his book peg. And Val Kilmer? I want to send him a compassionate card. "Doors" to it? In fact, the selection was the only reason I watched this movie, and Val didn't even show until the film was over halfway. Just a sad movie.
