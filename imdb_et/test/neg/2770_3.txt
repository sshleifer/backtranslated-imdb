My question is what was the worst element of this movie? Did it work? targeting? script? Maybe it was a waste of Alan Ladd and Jack LaRue. LaRue and especially Ladd are able to make their role extremely radical. In this movie it was hard to say who was a bad boy. Ladd was allowed to play a secret good man, but even in the roles of his good men, he might be very cold. So the net result was a potentially good film that didn't get any sense of conflict.
