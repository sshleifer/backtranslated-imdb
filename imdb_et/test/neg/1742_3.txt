I thought it was strange and just gory, not scary. I've seen a couple of Japanese horror films, Rings and Jones and loved them; but this movie was disappointing. It didn't explain anything about the curse. I just didn't see any horror ... it wasn't scary at all. The whole time I looked, I waited for Kirie to discover the secret of the curse and why it happened now. If it was an ancient curse, why didn't it happen before Shuichi's father? And it never told us what happened to his father. I was expecting someone to tell us the meaning or reason for this curse and then it ended. I was very disappointed.
