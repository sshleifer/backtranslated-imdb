The cast of this cheap horror potboiler and team members are more interesting than everything that happens throughout the film; we have Barbara Payton, Raymond Burr, Lon Chaney Jr, Tom Conway, Paul Cavanaugh and Woody Strode in front of the camera and writer-director Curt Siodmak, operator Charles Van Enger, editor-in-chief Francis D. Lyon and production assistant Herman Cohen behind it. Unworthy of Payton turns almost every man who is deep into the African jungle, where he lives with his wife Cavanaugh Plantation: Doctor Conway wants him secretly, while the hot leading champion Burr's approach is literally more hands. on. On the other hand, Chaney (surprisingly enough) is retrospective, but the authoritarian figure and Strode is a local police officer. The plot is very simple, but to be honest, it doesn't make much sense: after a particularly upset dinner with a thunderstorm, Burr and Cavanaugh (the art of imitating life later) come across their affection for a great snake suitable for Payton and Burr just crawls near where Cavanaugh hits the ground! Witnessing the event behind the bushes is Payton's mysterious maid (mother tongue, not less) for some inexplicable reason for Burr√© (who has been married to Payton in the meantime), which periodically turns her into a gorilla ... starting her wedding day (when her hand briefly spins)! As a result, Burr takes time to lose himself in the jungle days? even if the monkey creature is barely glimpse of the whole film. It must be said, however, that the version I looked at lasted only 56 minutes, when the official length elsewhere is either 66, 70 or 76! That's why the film seems to be rushed and sprawling, if not less than fun, as it culminates subjectively in the gorilla's search for the jungle of Payton, the former being still Chaney and Conway. Back to the tragic blonde leading women of the film in one minute: after promising start in movies with Hollywood legends like James Cagney and Gary Cooper? KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE and DALLAS (both 1950s)? his career soon nailed to B (and less) class territory thanks to his "colorful" screen appearance: his most notorious misdemeanor was the reason that gave a much-publicized bar room blow between his wife Franchot Tone and brutish former lover Tom Neal, who ended up with a former coma and Payton who was the last to deserting him !! But it wasn't all: nymphomaniac Payton also had Woody Strode among his conquests (a controversial issue); short-lived husband Tone, hit by Payton's infidelity on the camera, spread Hollywood surrounding evil photographic evidence and practically ended up celebrating his days? his last film appearance is Edgar G. Ulmer's MURDER IS MY BEAT (1955), which I have in his "despite the movies". The last 12 years of his angry life were spent on Skid Row during chewing gum, drugs, prostitution, beating, arrests and even beating? before he died in his parents' home in 1967 at the age of 39!
