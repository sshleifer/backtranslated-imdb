This is one movie that represents everything that is bad in the film business. The actors are pathetic and the script is terrible. The special effects, if any, are so badly made that it would be better to do it instead of comics. Besides, it's great! I think the film's creators meant humor, but the only time I smiled was when I saw Patrick's long-haired and colorful costumes that everyone had. The scenes were good at the end, but they were not part of the movie. Finally, you ask yourself, "Why did I waste my time and money with this mess if I could have watched the growth of plants or the movement of clouds"? I don't think I'm a critic or anything else, but it's a really flat movie! DO NOT SEE! STUPID DANGER!
