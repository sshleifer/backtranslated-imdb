"The Ashes of Time" was a cruel project, but ended with a fictional film. This movie is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a complicated way. The "Ashes of Time" plot is quite simple and it is two words: "love triangle". Because of these "love triangles", the main dynamics of characters are overcoming stories, jealousy, hate and love. The narrative is reviewed through the eyes of Ou-yang Feng (Leslie Cheung). Ou-yang Feng lives in a desert where he acts as a mediator in several swordsmen and becomes a means of destiny through which vengeance is achieved. Unfortunately, "The Ash of Time" does not tell these simple stories of love and hatred. Wong Kar-wai lost his motivation to change the frame of every film in the countryside and aesthetic experience. In fact, the beautiful actors (men and women) are all about this movie failure. Dialogues are minimal and not at all original. Image quality is very unequal, editing is one of the worst (at least for me) in the "sword" genre, and finally filming a rare sword fight is very confusing and unpleasant. Even the attempt to create artistic scenes has not always been achieved: so erotic "woman's horse" scene is ridiculous, not erotic and useless. Wong Kar-wai wanted to offer a 100-minute clean aesthetic experience and forgot that the film was first about how the plot was spoken. Forgetting she offers an uncomfortable movie that doesn't even fulfill her artistic purpose.
