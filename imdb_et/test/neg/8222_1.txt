The wave after the wave of undisturbed nausea - this film wants and initially promises to be original and original, but is actually obvious, solipsist and stepped into a clich√©-driven dialogue based on horror and cheese. Throughout the film, we are supposed to meet wall characters who are really very dumb, and just don't work and who struggle through a terrible scenario like men in armor clothes, riding jeeps through manor buildings and spraying existential expression with it. Coldplay beats. The film has funny episodes from time to time, it is often no more fun than a dog playing with its genital organs, which happened twice (slapstick index, rudimentary humor of the film in general), but eventually the film falls into an infinite abyss due to the complete detritus and director's egocentric ramblings that put look for me. Watch this movie for your own risk.
