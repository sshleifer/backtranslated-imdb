Cimarron was painful to sit. Although Irene Dunn does a good job with a heavy-duty manuscript, Richard Dix's brilliant and superfluous role is brutal. The passage of time has not dealt with the nature of both Isaiah and other racial and religious beliefs, although the film is somewhat progressive towards the roles of women and the abuse of Indians. Editing is particularly weak. This is undoubtedly the worst of all the "best" pictures.
