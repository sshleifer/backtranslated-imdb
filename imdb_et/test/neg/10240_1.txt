How can ANYBODY give it something higher than '1'? Indeed, I didn't think anything could be worse. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. "Galaxina" is this rare film, where every single element is painless, embarrassing, blindly bad. How often have you watched the movie and commented: "Who the hell does LIT do?" From lighting to soundtrack and script to cinematic work. . . well, ALL, this movie is absolutely insatiable. It's so bad, I couldn't even say for a while whether it was the worst comedy or the worst drama I ever saw. <br /> <br /> It's too bad even ridiculous. I would eat a glass of broken glass before I sit again.
