Egad. <br /> <br /> I thought Keannu Reeves was Hollywood's worst actor. I'm no longer sure Willy will give Keann some strong competition for her "I'm made of plaster" in this movie. <br /> <br /> Combine this with the fact that there is almost no plot, not one pleasant character, and it's very hard to recommend this turkey. <br /> <br /> Natasha tries her best, but even Julia Roberts could not hide this update. <br /> <br /> Avoid it if it's really late and there's nothing else. -Oh heck, in this case just read the book.
