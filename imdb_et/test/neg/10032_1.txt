I walked to a bookstore in Tennessee, Brentwood. I'm not saying a name because I'm a dedicated customer. I've been happy with every item I bought before. The front of the store was The Bell Witch Haunting. (Can I mention that this is the only store I have seen for sale.) I had heard of this story and I remember that it really had to happen. I was very excited and couldn't wait to see it. I had great expectations for this. I couldn't believe what I saw when I looked at it. It didn't look like a real movie. It seemed like a home video. I had the impression that it should be a horror film. I mean, the movie was about a witch you know. It's not a horror movie. You won't jump from your place by watching this movie. I gave the film every opportunity in the world to get better. I swear I did. It was never better. This little boy got several scenes that gave him a gift and a pee. I didn't find it fun. I looked at the film with disbelief that the store was selling it to me. I think this is the bad economy. I have to say it to the cast and the team. Don't show this movie as a material to get other movies. Don't do that. I mean it sincerely. I thank you for trying. People who bought it. I say that. Don't sell your copy to anyone. They could be very disturbed. Good day for everyone.
