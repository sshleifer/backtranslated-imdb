First Off, I'm a big fan of Robert Blake, always been. <br /> <br /> This movie came to Movieplex yesterday at 10/13 and the title was of interest to me and, of course, to the star. But after I watched it, I was more confused than I was before it started. There are some good scenes and I thought they would go somewhere, but they didn't do that, it was a "policeman" "anti-friend" "anti-hippie", pretty much "anti-everything movie" with an extremely confusing plot that didn't go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Robert Blake is great if the driver could be with this bad movie, I'm still a big Mr Mr.. Blake fan and love his action even as it is ... But this medicine caused the 70s fear, well ... better stay away from it ... And that's the end that pisser.
