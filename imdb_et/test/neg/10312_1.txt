You found this movie at $ 10 in a DVD discount store. It wasn't worth it. Some of the camera's works and dialogues look and function as if the film student did it. Sandra's performance was somewhat plausible, but the film was predictable and the action was punctual and dragged. One thing I give them is. Unlike most movies, people in this movie have actually completed the ammunition for new weapons and ammunition and devastated corpses.
