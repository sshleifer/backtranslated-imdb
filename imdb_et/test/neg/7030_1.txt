I didn't think this movie was very good at all. Basically, they took a lot of one liner from different Shirley temple films, threw them together, and Orr acted like a Shirley temple on the screen. "Oh Judas!" was told quite a few times. If you're familiar with Shirley Temple movies, you will know several movies right from your movies. The problem is that Orr tells them in Shirley's everyday life. Finally, what we get is the hodgepodge of Shirley Temple films, instead of looking at the life of the Shirley Temple. Save yourself in trouble and rent the Shirley Temple movies, much better than watching Orrit and try to create Shirley's play.
