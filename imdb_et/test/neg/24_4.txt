"Bloody Birthday" is a strange and sometimes humorous little budget "Mikey" or "The Good Son" under a less intelligent version. <br /> <br /> In a small California city, three children are born at the height of a shelter, where aligning the planet means they are somehow born without emotions. Ten years later, our three little psychopaths take a smile to kill parents, siblings, teachers and others who are irritating. Only one teenage girl knows the truth to stop them. There is no explanation why children born at the same time are not equally twisted, but you go! <br /> <br /> Slasher is very violent and violent for the film, which I think raises the problem of killing children because there are so many young actors. Instead, it is fun and a bit annoying when you see three decades of murder kill and carrying out your plans using weapons, knives and cross sections. The main reason why this is not completely ridiculous is that the child's actors are very convincing in their roles that they play violent adults violently, showing their dark side to a girl who knows the truth "Bloody Birthday" is rather mediocre than a horror tape where there is little fear and little blood, but because it has a shock factor that kids are killers, it's a bit unique. One to see if there is anything else.
