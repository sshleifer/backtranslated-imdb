I've seen this stupid show in about five or six episodes and most of them were forced to watch. And I didn't like the episodes I saw. What happened to Dan Schneider? Having given us such fantastic exhibitions as Drake and Josh, why did he decide to create such a stupid show? My problem is not only with Dan, but also with those guys who named this exhibition for Emmy, were they drunk that day or what problem? Drake and Josh did not get a candidate for emm, but it is better than Zoey 101. The creators of this exhibition should be ashamed of the existence of this exhibition, we just hope you know who is affected by the show, or better, but that will cause it to be canceled.
