this film lacks a plot. RECOMMENDED that a man move with his grandmother and everyone thinks he is a loser and he must redeem himself. but what happens after everyone knows who lives? they have a great party in their grandmother's house. the climax of the film was not even related to the rest of the film. that the whole plot was put into use within minutes after the end of the film. I see how this might be related to the supposed story - that Grandma's VG skills redeem her - but it wasn't there. <br /> <br /> But the movie was funny as hell and clearly based on jokes. <br /> <br /> "His pussy smells like a big depression" "He sucked his first tent ... yes 13 hours" "It's for you ... I think it's a fuckin"
