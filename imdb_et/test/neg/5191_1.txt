Ewe, Opening shouts at zero budget. Headlines that look like my grandson were left with iMovie. The DVD box gives you the impression that you are being treated with the old age of 80-year-old boobie films. FAST! There is always no nudity with the Traci Lords flick! This film really needs nudity too. Instead, you get a lot of Lords who pull out the shirt, but they seem to be activated by hot steam. It's strange that the headlights come in the Cold world. <br /> <br /> The plot is pathetic, the blind boy is just a joke and not funny. His antics are both forced and predictable. He's going over things and you see him in the fall. He must work with his physical comedy. <br /> <br /> Most of the frostbite is a foul of the hot tub scene, which looks like it was fired a month later and entered into a marketer. And nudity is not worth it. <br /> <br /> HomeBucks; it's just a matter of time before Starbucks digs into it. Not even funny. Billy arrives in town for the first time with Namoi Bucks. He commented: "Wow they have everywhere." It makes you believe that this is a parody of Starbucks, but surprisingly, behind this counter is Namoi himself. Apparently he loves coffee so much that the owner of this big chain decided to work in a small cold city. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie has done is Warren Miller's snowboard film. Yeah, that's all Warren's stuff, so if you want to see a great deal, take the Warren mill. Leave the frost alone. <br /> <br /> There's nothing good about this movie. There is no reason to rent or buy it, and if a friend offers you a free loan. Hit him and finish his friendship.
