This film was sucked on so many levels! Ever seen a dentist? This film made the dentist look like a masterpiece. I do not recommend this movie to anyone unless, of course, really really boring, maybe. It was so horny. The killer reminds you of a monster grandfather unless he has goggles. When Jessica said, "I want you to meet someone, my inner bitch, I thought she was going to hit her butt, but all she did was thrown at her frig-gen trash. I was very disappointed. And when the ranger was his wife's crying scene, I felt the pain behind the tears ......... NO !!!!! So, before watching the movie, grab the blanket and pillow, be comfortable because it is very relaxing.
