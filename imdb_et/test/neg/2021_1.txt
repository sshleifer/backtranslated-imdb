I lose my words. This movie is out of description. I don't think there is a language on Earth that has a word that can describe this terrible movie. If you are trying to look at it, be sure to "end the surprise". I did it about three-quarters through this mess before I got it. Luckily (or unfortunately) a couple of my friends ended up. When they woke up from their coma and after a couple of weeks of treatment, they got me out. This film has no story, no plot, scary writing and even worse action. If you like to look at train wrecks or car accidents, this movie is for you. I think my IQ dropped about 30 points from its viewing (add it here).
