This is perhaps the worst thing I've ever seen on television. First of all, I'm pretty sure he's taking him seriously, and I'm rather good at recognizing satire. Second, it shows aristocratic chauvinism levels; In one of its ads, one of the "playas" women describes "quality". Third, any competitor I have seen (six, I think) has become a shade that is likely to have Facebook "BONING U" or "WOMEN" entered into "Here for". When paraphrasing Roger Ebert, it does not scratch the bottom of the barrel or deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as the barrels. The closest thing to the redemption function I have experienced with the VIP key was a female friend who assured me that the male cast was indeed the opposite of both physical and mental conditions.
