I only gave "Airport '79" two stars because it is a really sad movie. Someone with something to do with it doesn't deserve praise (except for Charo Chihuahua, who does a good job in his role.) That doesn't mean the movie is not recommended. This will help if you have a buzz, but it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> A'79 really looks like "Airplane!" Each scene has a structure and profitability, and the scenes change one after the other as if they were completely disconnected. One of my favorite recurring points is that passengers, crew and plane can continue. Are you a news reporter and a strange boy is murdered in your home in your presence? Then the person pursues the roof of your greenhouse? No problem. You can still do this in the early morning flight to Paris ... no need to involve the police. Your plane drives a single unmanned "drone" rocket, four heat-seeking missiles and an unknown Phantom fighter cannon fire, making a barrel roll, a powerful dive and a crash-net landing without a pushed turn process? No problem, we can mechanics check the oil and reach you in a few hours. It's really funny. <br /> <br /> And I admit that there is a bit of anarchy in me that appears when passengers do not pay attention to cabin attendants. It is highlighted when the sender tells Jimmie Walker that he must go before his start to play his saxophone (God releases me from jazz in front of a saxophone player). Jimmie says basically: "No." Later on, the barrels flew while rolling, and Jimmie will appear in the next stage with another scissor he won't let. This aspect of the movie is just fun. (One traveler actually follows the escort. If Charole is told that he can't take his dog's flight, he leaves the plane. Of course, this is because you can't get your ass and breasts good when he is sitting. Dreadful enough to be a little amusing. Unfortunately, filmmakers and shooters deserve some credit for it, because it was probably totally inadvertent.
