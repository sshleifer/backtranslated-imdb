My friends and I have been watching so much time. It is worth seeing for those who are in the right spirit system, which means that it is not as much a horror film as a movie that is funny about these funny quotes and bad effects. This movie is best observed with other like-minded people so you have a laugh with someone. left back. "Greg, stop clowning!" You laugh like J.G. Patterson gives hand signals to guide Greg to the other side of the desktop while his hand is in the picture. And if you realize that the last woman doesn't have any of the qualities she used to build her, you probably laugh.
