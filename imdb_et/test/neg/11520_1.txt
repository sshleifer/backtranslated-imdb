Ed Wood is driving again. The fact that this film was made should give hope to every filmmaker who wants to be young. All the scenarios you might have thought of using a sandbox or birdcard should not seem so bad now. Don't watch this movie if you don't have a Tylenol or Rolaid whole clamp. Watching the movie <br /> <br /> made me realize that Boa and Python were not so bad. Probably it would have been better to do this movie at Claymation, because at least in this way no actor would have carried this movie. It is understandable why this director has so many pseudonyms. To watch this movie, there is a bright side that if you get someone who brings you a bag of chips, you can eat your way around the cheesecake that lets you <br /> <br /> make a cake of cheese around your TV.
