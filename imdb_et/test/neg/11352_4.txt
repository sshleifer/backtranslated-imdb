"You can survive". Something except the stupid horror flick. The director couldn't even decide if he wanted a demon or just a regular Olympics. You don't have both. It's like Michael Moore, who is catching his cake and eating it (or 1,500 cakes for him), making his special charlatan "docu-comedies": they should be oh-so fun and eager, and yet you are also meant to treat them as truth-based , documentaries, breaking and catchy. Some genres cannot be mixed. <br /> <br /> "Everyone can happen at any time, any place." (Translation: this is a genre of horror, so we can make no sense what we want.) It sounds not so much as the "smart" found on the Chinese fortune cookie paper, but rather the director of every bad credo. We get this statement that has been delivered to us early, such as preparing / justifying the absurd outbreak of the future. <br /> <br /> "My phone is not working!" Well, of course, it's not. There is a much greater chance that Sean Penn's brain will work (after decades of catatonic apathy) as a mobile phone for horror films. The most terrible and predictable horror clashes of the last decade. Why even say? We know that help will never come through a phone call, so your horrible dimwits might not even mention it. In the last 50 horror films I saw this plot device. It becomes embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "You have to wait for an unexpected one." The last twist was quite surprising, I give them so much ... But there's a lot of pointless. <br /> <br /> Check for the tricky heroes put into the drug by the heroine - lab rat - in cold, wet and almost completely dark conditions. I just love the realism of a horror movie ... <br /> <br /> When a bloody thirst for demon is trying to be funny ("sacrificing" your victims), you know that the joy of watching your horror is doubtful. The less you talk about the "more reasonable" old geezer, the better ... Another stupid clich√© served by tired, lazy, endless director. <br /> <br /> What are your husband's attacks and then the striking demon - the same day? "Wait for the unexpected". They could also push into the event where he lives under a plane crash, and then another where he meets aliens who tried to try him ... <br /> <br /> The quick back and forth button needs a temple or a shrine built on it.
