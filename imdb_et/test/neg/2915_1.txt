Remember those old kung fu films we watched late on Friday and Saturday when our babysitters remember we're responsible? Well, this movie plays just like one of those movies. Patsy Kensit's greatest claim to fame was the interest in love for the character of Mel Gibson "Lethal Weapon 2" and this performance was one of the reasons he never made it big: he is a terrible actor. <br /> <br /> "Deadly weapon 2," I thought he was cute. Lovely enough to watch some of the other films she had, including "Loves Music, Loves Dancing", which is another big thing I probably didn't publish. But as tempting as it is in my eyes, my soul yelled at me to turn it off because he played another cheap, predictable role and did it very badly. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Kensit is labeled by a comedienne (and not a good one) who works in French clubs (he couldn't cut it in his homeland, so he makes their ears bleed), who is his happiness but worse The French government wants to throw it out of the visa expiration (or maybe they just hit his act). But he marries Casanova (Freiss), who is just like his happiness and predictability begins ... terribly! Is it possible to give this film a NEGATIVE rating? One of the 10 stars exceeds it!
