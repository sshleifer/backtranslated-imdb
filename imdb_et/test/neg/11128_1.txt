When I went home after work, I bought some films for my four-year-old twins. I had bought this movie that my kids would enjoy. I watched it with my children. My 10 and 17 year olds were about to throw. In this film, the father behaves like a tard. My little people look at it every day. One day they threw all our films. My rating: F ++++++++++++++++ I see the worst dress list rather. <br /> <br /> My kids hate this stupid movie. When you give the idea that germs can talk to each other. I don't know how the dark film is filming in Japanese. I broke the CD when I was upset that I saw it again and again. Not offensive, but Brandy & Elena did the best
