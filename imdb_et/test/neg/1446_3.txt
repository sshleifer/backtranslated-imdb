It seems that Dee Snyder ran through the idea halfway through the script. In the second half of the movie, it's just the first one that makes the movie very boring. In summary: Cop's daughter has been in a chat room where the psychopath is sexually split / tortured (played by Snider). Cop rescues him, the psychopath is put into therapy / jail. The psychopath is released four years later and the whole thing is played by AGAIN. All this has many inexplicable plot elements: Why was "Captain Howdy" a psycho? What is a Bible Anti-Personality Sketch? How does he abduct all adults and sew his mouth without a fight? And maybe the biggest unresolved mystery ... how a 6'2 "pink haired man" hides completely behind a 5'6 "middle-built woman? These are just a few of the questions I've been watching. /> It seems that Snyder tried to make some comments about the "dangers" of online chat rooms, b) the hypocrisy of Christians, and c) the impact our twisted Puritan society has on us as individuals. If that is the case, he could not. just too badly done, never transmitting social messages. The scenes of torture are foolish and boring, bordering on fools (especially when Snyder goes to one of his "pain and death" monologues) and everything else is just stupid. ... when there is a caller ID and * 69 in the police? A young partner of the main police department is especially terrible ... he should not act as an actor, and the sound of the final showdown scene is very bad I think they can't afford two booms <br /> <br /> The rest of the action is not terrible, but it's not good either. The policeman is quite one remark, and his quality is not quite plausible. Dee Snyder is not really too bad, but she's too scared. Robert Englund (who deserves a better way) makes somewhat fun hypocrisy. If you're a big fan of Robert Englund, the film is probably worth it for him. Everyone else is forgetting. <br /> <br /> All in all, we've seen all of the plot elements that have been made in earlier and better-made films, such as LAMBADE, HELLRAISER, and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. I suggest you rent one of them instead of watching this fish. 3/10. <br /> <br />
