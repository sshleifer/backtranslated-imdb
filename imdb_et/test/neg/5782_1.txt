This movie is absolutely terrible ... Certainly it's bull *** and worse. Too bad Charlie Sheen is involved in something like this because she is a decent actress and she has made a couple of really good movies. <br /> <br /> The special effects are the classic car A-standard standard is shot and then slid slightly under the bonnet. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the enemy is portrayed as a complete idiot and dies as fast as they can say "-No evil Americans". <br /> If you don't play braindead movies, don't spend 113 minutes of your life in this garbage. Instead, take "Line" or "Apocalypse Now" instead.
