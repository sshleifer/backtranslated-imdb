let me first say that I did not wait much and that opening it at night should have helped. I believe it would be if there were more than 20 people in the theater. <br /> <br /> It sucked so hard. acting at best was robotic and nothing was really explained until the last 30 minutes of the movie. I think it was their way to turn the plot; keep all the important information in the dark to understand the direction of the movie to the end and IF explain the things and hope it seems like a twist of the plot. <br /> <br /> Unknown to the end of the movie: -Mis Eff is a dark loop? CG was cool, but I want to understand! - What kind of inclinations do you want? especially if the mass murder is ultimatum. -If you want the power so bad? your just normal after, right? Who is farted? <br /> <br /> About 50% of the minutes with only men on screen, their shots beating their husbands, sleeveless t, and then in the intestinal pool scene among all teenage men who had the lowest riding speedos knowing it was ever made. I swear you see the beginning of a boy .... well, it was close to the core. And of course there was a shower, and it was mixed with DUDES. Butt cracks were abundant, sausage festivities. But there was one girl's shower where nothing was seen and surrounded by a room with the best view in about 12 minutes. Then the girl was on the PJ side. the other thing I couldn't go over was the ride that Caleb made on his SUPER COOL ford mustang GT. it was a ford commercial for about a quarter of the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it. or watch it with a friend who likes to film badly. it could be worth it. but don't wait for something breathtaking.
