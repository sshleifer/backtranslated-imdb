With humor that turns to an exclusive, small audience, the average viewer finds it meaningless and monotonous. When the Cartoon Network used this example in advertising, it was done as if it were a big drama or event with a real rainfall and government officials trying to catch the sheep. <br /> <br /> When it came out of the air, I was disappointed how all the characters were so one-dimensional and completely insignificant. The only thing that brought it closer to humor was the names of names such as "Private Public" and "General Specific", some vague references to cultural aspects, and how Lady Richington bombed sheep with her steel wig. > <br /> Slightly on the subject, but I don't see why sheep would love the ball of this dirty cotton ball called "Swanky". It was ugly!
