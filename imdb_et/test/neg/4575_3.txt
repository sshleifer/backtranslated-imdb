Before I talk about my work, I would like to make a few things clear: 1) I am a chick who is not in a bag of chicks ("Kate & Leopold" and "Nobody likes you" is EXTREME exceptions - Hugh Jackman's ass). 2) I only chose this because I am Fichtner's fangirl waiting for her in the bath. 3) I am not a fan of Demi, although I think his performances "Immortal" and "Little Good Men" were supreme and served his vid in the library - also I think he is a little crazy If this is a characteristic study about the unfulfilled a woman who lives a dual life of independence and happiness, I would say we have one narcoleptic melodrama. Marty: Literary Agent. Changes 6-digit salary. Living in an expensive Manhattan penthouse. It is easy for him to read several hundred manuscripts and sleep at his desk to say that it is highly recommended for night-time escapism. Or, perhaps, through an intermediate portal? She has a career, a look, a cool car, a great pad, now with a man and kids? At the same time, our boy Aaron - some real escapades. What are Architects? They are artists who can do math, dreamers who make real money. Aaron gives Mart a dream of security and fills a gap where he has no confidence. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the coin, Marie is still living on her schoolgirls imagination when she worries about motherhood. Her children are her career and life. But Marie, does she only exist through her children? In Wales, William, a stranger to Paris who helps him focus on one thing, he has lost himself: himself. some resentment against Marty / Marie's own mother. It will be 3/10. All I could say is thanks to God for BPL's multimedia distribution, I don't waste this $ 2.99 on Blockbuster, put it on Harlequin Blaze's headline.
