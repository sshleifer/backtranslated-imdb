I watched this movie last night, although I would like to rent fear / frightening movie blockers and got it out. The scenes that opened were so long that conversations between characters did not take anywhere. <br /> <br /> The story seemed so poor to me that he gave him HIV and then he went against someone, but he killed him by an infected man (I think he can do it for a long time for different people) Then, when he dumped the body that just happened, the man he met was in the woods and saw him pouring his body. Then he pursued them (did he stop burial of the body?) And they got into the car and found them somehow from the other direction they came from and killed. I think the split head was the only good thing in the movie because it was quite realistic. and when she ran, she fell in front of her to beat the spade with a spade! AND then it ended !! <br /> <br /> What is relief, this was the most pointless film I've ever watched ... please steer it clearly, it's just so badly done when I read just 5 different people and the scene where he kills , is so unrealistic and they only swear by it and that's it !! It's it from me ... <br /> <br /> STEER WELL CLEAR !!
