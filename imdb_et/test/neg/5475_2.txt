Me, me, my: Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance have been working desperate to give their talents to this turkey. The terribly confusing story of Satanism nowadays in Greece, the Minotaur Land (also called The Devil's Men) is more or less the failure of every imaginary level. This is very scary (always a mild mistake on the horror movie, don't you think?); weak results; countless scenes where characters stupidly travel alone or leave the group safe; and some rather irritating editing techniques that do not give anything to the procedure. I was prematurely excited about the prospects of Cushing and Pleasance, who worked together 17 years after the meat and the fans - but it doesn't make sense to remotely control this movie; it is a huge backlog and rather embarrassing for its much more valuable leaders. <br /> <br /> A distant region in Greece, such as tourists and archaeologists, is disappearing and the local priest Roche (Donald Pleasance) suspects that something is going wrong. He writes to his friend New York's private eye Milo Kaye (Costas Skouras) asking him to fly to Greece to help him get to the bottom of the mystery. In the meantime, there are three more visitors - Beth (Vanna Reville), Ian (Nikos Verlekis) and Tom (Robert Behling), all of Roche's personal friends - going to nearby Greek ruins. Milo finally arrives in Greece, but is initially suspicious of Father Roche's beliefs that missing people have been detained for Satanic victims. Milo and Father Roche also join Laurie (Luan Peters), Tom's lost girlfriend. Together, they discover the activities of the worshiping cult of the Minoan devil, led by the creepy Carpathian exile boss Corofax (Peter Cushing). These crazy cultures are the victims of the minotaur form of victims. Moreover, they cannot seem to be killed by ordinary means, so that Father Roche must use different religious objects in his struggle to combat them. <br /> <br /> The minotaur land should have been much better than it really is. The plot is so weak and unlikely that it has all the pleasant features of a culture / camp favorite. But handling is just terrible. Director Costas Carayiannis has no idea how to associate narrative together so that the whole thing evolves as it was everyday. He also has no idea how to attract convincing performances of his pains, leaving them terribly disgraceful (Pleasance, Cushing) or terribly amateur (Skouras, Peters). What's even worse is that narrative doesn't make sense. Why should Father Roche seek help from a private eye who is absolutely unbelievable in his beliefs? How does Roche know that sacrifices only occur during the full moon? How can the shape of the minotaur speak? Why is one of the victims sacrificed during a guided vision to bother Father Roche only when he himself gets a scene before you can take it? And - most astonishing - why does father Roche push Milo toward the world to help him, if all he needs is crucifix and some sacred water to destroy the bad guys? These questions - and more - come to your mind during the Minotaur land ... but unfortunately there are no answers. Depressing, stupid and disappointing!
