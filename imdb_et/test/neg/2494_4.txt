This movie is easier to see when viewed as a scenario created by Star Fleet Lieutenant Reginald Barclay during his Holodeck addiction. (Barclay is a repetitive Star Trek character played by Dwight Schultz.) <br /> <br /> Dwight Schultz is confused as Oppenheimer. The nature of Oppenheimer's is poorly written, so we never see the depth and breadth of our knowledge. Instead, we see a low, two-dimensional figure from the soap opera. Paul Newman is also a general Leslie Groves, but the problems of this film range from the wrong actors to the wrong role. <br /> <br /> Factual Mistakes and Great Freedoms (with chronology of events) that the previous scriptwriter Bruce Robinson's political agenda makes this movie embarrassing. This is why this movie has found a home on the so-called history channel. "Fatty man and little boy" combine poor science, bad history, bad scenario and mediocre action to create a film that should not be seen by impressive high school or college students who know nothing about the Manhattan project.
