Writer and director Jay Andrews, aka Jim Wynorski, earns more of his distinctive gateway when reptiles created by a Z-class computer are properly cast in "Komodo Vs. Cobras", a common "mysterious island" meeting "Jurassic Park" as you can imagine. The main problem with this predictable yarn, which concerns the eating of mankind from a monster, is the incredibly counterfeit special effects. Kobra and Komodo are terribly terrible. But graphic artists are struggling to integrate monsters with their victims, not that none of them is the least credible. It is clear that "Komodo v. Cobra" was a budget that was so low that virtually everything a non-person looks like fake, as everyone comes out. This cheesy monster episode takes place on a distant island where the US military performs the highest secret on animals. The result is that the giant Komodo and the cobra bloom in this tropical island paradise. When the action opens, the primary scientist beats a cobra that likes to swim. After that, we introduce Greenpeace as an environmentalist and journalist. Planet One of the organizers, Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTavish, "Hellbent") pays the charter master Jim Stoddard (Michael Pare, "CBS TV" Houston Knights ") five more promises when he takes it to the forbidden island. In the meantime, the US military suspects that there is something wrong on the island to send their crew from men who eat oversized predators. Our heroes come to the last scientist of the island, Dr. Susan Richardson (Michelle Borth, "Wonderland"), the daughter of the scientist responsible for this mad research project, telling them that the military is going to target the island for destruction. The two grown-up robber's title game takes place in the last quarter after our heroes, who were consistently pulled out by monsters, find a helicopter and take off in time before the military powders. There is no tension, intercourse or anything of value in this subtle creature function. The best thing is the soundtrack to the composer Chuck Cirino; it gives the "Komodo Vs. Cobra" epic lesson. Usually, Jay Andrews writes and manages the promised generation, but it is much lower than his low standards. Sexy women value survival better than boys. In one scene, our heroic group is by the river and we don't see any wet T-shirts. Drat! There is nothing memorable dialogue or relationship in this dreck. I think the military will do too much if they get their heads together. We hope Michael Pare got a good payday for this garbage. The end, like one of the scientists, takes on the characteristics of the lizard, is strictly an afterthought. It's not so bad that it's good, it's just bad.
