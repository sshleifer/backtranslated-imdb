This piece of Crapi is actually a BOMB, like a barrel at the bottom. I can't figure out what is the worst; Norris's boring image of anonymity (not a big feature in action) or Christopher Neame's hysterical domination. This film does not give what is ever so. The sequences are tame, the piece is thin and the scenes that should be terrible look like a clic of the fifties. You can't just fill the room with smoke and men's rubber costumes and wait for the audience to frighten them. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film does nothing for me. It seems like an unfortunate blend between cheap porn clips and hanging out of Miami Vice, hitting little. No, wait. It should have been a devil.
