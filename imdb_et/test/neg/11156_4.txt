End of the days, pretty good, Arnie plays off and out of the policeman (very similar to Riggs's deadly weapon) and the story looks like a thriller of some serum killer action, good entertainment. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it can't deliver, Arnie is as good as we've been waiting for, but as for Gabriel Byrne, I expect him to choose his roles more carefully. being cast as a curse; this is probably the weakest image of the darkest master. <br /> <br /> This movie gets too little for me and the final sequence, being very weak, is one of the worst visually i 've seen in recent years that CGI has been better off this since the early 1990s. <br /> <br /> Quite simply not good enough. 4/10 (See if you have too much but don't wait too much because it won't get)
