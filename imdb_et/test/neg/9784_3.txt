My jaw dropped so many times that I looked at this flick, I got bruised. Okay, given, I really did not expect, say, the quality of other or even thirteen spirits (a new one that was just terrible and still has head and shoulders above that madness). No one else mentioned thin characters ... I wouldn't call them "thin". "Thin" means they can have something. How would it be almost non-existent? In no particular order do we have: a girl screaming; The American man who sees it; The Macho Guy, who just bites everything until he kills: a wise black man who dies early; Extra Guy who dies first; An extra woman playing hard. That's it. This is a list of your characters and that's what they are and what they're all about from beginning to end. If they were "thin," they could change slightly from the beginning to the end. But they are not. Well, okay, the American man decides he'll end up with fieldwork and Screaming Girl will go back to whatever he came from. This is a change. In addition, they all act according to their assigned roles and rarely betray any real emotion when they end up in danger. <br /> <br /> Now, manufacturers are getting the original threat, I say. I realized that this story was "trembling", but an ants instead of giant worms. I give the writer credit: these are very cool, very frightening ants and what they do with bones is great. (The first time a "bone catcher" appears, I admit that I jumped a couple of feet.) Unfortunately, the very cool concept will soon become Alien in the desert. We get a lot of comments about ants that may or may not be true, but we don't get much of mythology on which the threat is based. And we can ever make a monster movie cliché. People go to places they do not know and when they have no good reason. Moronic characters are trying to prevent our heroes and die from it. One sign fulfills a double duty as a "scientist who does not want to kill the monster, but to study it". The very cool gadget will only be introduced so that the American can tell everyone about the ants I hope everyone knows anyway. The gadget is then broken. Our heroes run out of one thing that can threaten. And then this is the final, annoying moment when we know that the threat is still with us - and we don't know what the hero or heroine came from. It alters everything that was previously useless and wrong, totally totally. <br /> <br /> Three stars for cooling ants and bones. There is nothing about clichés, tricky dialogues, and darker pearls.
