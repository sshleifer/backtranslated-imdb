In the early 00s, production companies had a short-lived craze for supernatural genre films in France after "The Crimson Rivers" and "Wolf Wolfness of Wolf" turned out to be hits, so many movies were in green light or recorded "direct-video fate. But in France, Unlike the United States, Great Britain or Italy, there is little imagination of B-films and it soon became clear that the order of "Samouraïs", "Bloody Mallory" or "Crimson Rivers" were poorly recommended attempts to recreate a kind of magic that had never existed in French cinema before. When they floped, the producers have gone back to their usual ticket price: derivatives or former critic Les Cahiers du cinéma "French New Wave". "Brocéliande could have been green in this short window because it has no other noticeable purpose, this is your portable film that is mixed with a vague mythological element and horror nor can you find bimboesque female characters, a French university that looks like a US campus and the plot is so lazy that you don't even care because you guessed yourself one hour before, even before the movie started. <br /> <br /> These elements make the 70's or 80's B movie fun and await them in the 70's or 80's movies. But we are no longer in the 80s and no one warned director Doug Headline because this respect for the film genre is nothing but a derivative. The title itself is not a beginner and has written as a critic of such images since the early 1980s, but for the first time he shows a lack of skill and ambition that makes Brocélian a hole. <br /> <br /> When you compile a sub-category of clichés and pass them on to a qualified and inventive director, such as Wes Craven or Quentin Tarantino, you get "Scream" or "Death Proof", movies that are impressions of old guilty pleasures, but also enlarge these clichés and add a lot to them. It's called "talent" and that's why you can't confuse these recent films with original inspirations made decades ago. <br /> <br /> "Brocéliande" takes a lazy road and plays only the worst elements of earlier films (unfortunately, for the male viewer, there is no free nudity in most cases). There are very strong similarities (presumably involuntary) between the "Brocéliande" and the Revised "Halloween 3: The Sorcery Season" because both are engaged in supernatural Druid evil rituals, and some foolish attempts to take over the Halloween at night. Since even the "Halloween 3" plot makes more sense than this, it means that something serious went wrong with "Brocélian".
