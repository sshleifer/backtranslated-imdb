I recently saw it at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival and I can't believe it is Sweden's official show for the 79th Academy Awards to be considered the best foreign film. Last year, producer Anna Anthony also gave Sweden an official performance with the best foreign film Zozoga. I was not a fan of Zozo personally, but at least it had this production result. It could have been shot as a high school film project. He may have worked as a short film, but as a feature film, it has disappeared as his characters. This is the story of about twenty-two sinners living in a small Swedish town who have no goals or hopes or ambitions for the future, and who want to live their long-lived childhood. In fact, Falkenberg is not as far away as a northern Swedish village. It is a popular summer resort with around 40,000 towns and villages and is located between the two main Swedish coastal areas, Götborg and Malmö. Characters are nice boys, but if they were kids of high school age who have a gloomy or confusing attitude that they intend to do with their lives, I would certainly be more interested in them. However, they have long gone from the point where they should deal with adulthood. If they want to stay in Falkenberg forever, definitely, there will only be jobs in the tourism or fishing industry, not just cycling, drinking, smoking and sometimes cleaning the house. Maybe if they hang out with their girlfriends or with two of them, girls who aren't at all about this movie, that doesn't make sense. Jesper Ganslandt makes his director debut and wrote the film together with the operator, which I use loosely, Fredrik Wenzel. it is not too bad. I'd give it to 4.5 out of 10, but despite paying for the academic award, I wouldn't recommend it.
