GINGKO BED is a strange film. It is very difficult, as if he had a lot of ideas, but he had no ability to bring them all into a single story. Instead, we get a variety of graphical lines that are different from their separate small movies. Oh definitely, they will eventually end up, but it all seems rather ... superfluous. Note that the girlfriend and her troubles in the hospital. Was it ... interesting? Then there were "we are spirits, so we have no physical element" that brings about the same problem that people had with GHOST, namely: If the characters are not physically (ie, do not have a physical form) and they get through the walls and what not, how exactly do they not fall through the floor or float within this question? <br /> <br /> GINGKO BED was a very new breed of South Korean film. There are many special effects, but the film itself is hollow and its faux melodrama only touches those who are easy to start with. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (see a more detailed overview of this movie and a review of other foreign films) at www.nixflix.com
