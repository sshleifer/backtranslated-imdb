This movie could have done a lot of good things using essentially the same sets, plot equipment and story. For example, why not plant Erica's ability to seed before her lover's murder? Why not develop the relationship between Erica and the police slowly and convincingly? Maybe it contradicts Eric's metamorphic, adding another post-event facet, relationship, etc. to his life. Why not injure innocent bystanders to emphasize injustice in Erica's activities. <br /> <br /> Instead, TBO uses the vengeance fantasy to its maximum level, giving the insecure lip service "don't do it at home" just the messages that are allowed to qualify for a movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Jodie Foster. After Foster has shown some choice in films such as LAMBI SILENCE, NELL, and one where he plays the mother of a child's miracle, Foster has slipped into successive roles where he plays the same heavy bite hero unanimously to overcome evil. This is one or two times as good, but I am used to my "fight for flight" more. TBO could have used a younger actor or one who more convincingly possessed his women in the forties (instead of a 40-year-old Foster who played a younger woman). <br /> <br /> TBO is a film that has important players, funding, and resources to succeed in tipping over.
