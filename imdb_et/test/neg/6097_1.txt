Boats, a married couple, an angry waiter and a shipwreck are the cause of this movie's beginning. <br /> <br /> I love boobs. There is no question about that. But when the main character joins everyone who currently has the most fish, mostly having sex with them and playing the role of a constant victim, my anger rises to a whole new level. Take two men (husband and other man), put a clean bomb girl in the middle of them, ad lag behind the island, divide all his moral questions, advertise a whole range of moral questions to the men, and mix it into a big bowl of arguments, fish and zippo lighter and you get such a junk movie. <br /> <br /> It is, I would say, good. There are some sloppy but not as many as I can see. The main female characterizes me sick. This is due to his lack of moral values. The man with the most fish pays attention. Although one of them is his husband, he does not see any problem when the other man (Manuel) is incredible, because "I have to survive it". How can you justify sexual communication with another man for a fish when your spouse is 30 feet away? And does he even benefit from it? A female character has no problems to justify anything she does. If he does not get approval for his activities, he is a victim. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone to see this movie. This is a movie that does almost anything else you see as a pleasant movie experience this year.
