Stay away from this movie at all costs. I was breastfeeded to watch this movie, to see which of these we knew the "worst movie" all the time. Needless to say, it won hands. It is long and pulled out and has no purpose or plot for what I collect. In the movie, a killer boy who has grown out of a mother who has grown out of a mother has no place inside vcr. If you are extremely boring and have not looked at life, check out this movie. But if you keep your peace of mind, be AWAY.
