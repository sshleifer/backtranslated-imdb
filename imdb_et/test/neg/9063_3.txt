As a serious marathon, I was seriously disappointed in this film. Its target audience is clearly those who have never been to marathon or beginner marathons. After two first marathons, one parent, one injured runner, and two elite stories in preparation for the Chicago Marathon, the film devotes most of the attention to one female beginner whose story is due to lack of a better word, boring. While I enjoyed a brief look at Deena Kastor's workouts, the short history of the Boston marathon and the marathon, let me emphasize: they were short! Looking at some Joe Runners to prepare for Saturday with water bottles and talking about how they look at the marathon is not inspirational, and the non-stop clich√©s about achieving and good costumes make the film about one hour shorter. If you're a marathon for the first time, this movie can give you a sense of "I can do it." No one else, run away.
