I watched this movie (film?) randomly and I never watched the view because it is so ridiculous if any dog ​​can play this act and it is better than the actors of its bad rejection? drives, does not play, only an unfortunate copy of Adrian Lyne's movie, if you have doubts about suicide, and you can choose ... "yes" <br /> <br /> I can't imagine the people who went to the cinema seeing the garbage; maybe someone who had an empty afternoon and chose a cinema near the first house to stay in another 2 hours to forget the problems, but it's hard to relax back home
