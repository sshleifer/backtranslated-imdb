That's not really as good as other Dragonballs. The roots are actually other Z-runners like Cell, Frieza and even Majin Buu. If Baby is a Frieza clone, then Super 17 is a Celli clone and Shadow Dragons is a Buu clone (s). The story is also very bad because it deals with Goku shrinkage. SWITCHING !! She is dealing with her SHRINKING like an eight-year-old to go. Let us not forget when the weaknesses change. Gohan can no longer mysteriously go and is even weaker than Pan. (It's sad, I know). Talking about Pan, he was so cute at the end of Z that he lost all its brightness and became an irritating, tiny girl whose only purpose in this series was to get on the road. Goten doesn't even have any purpose and Trunks ... well, I don't know what to say about Trunks. GT is just an attempt to milk the popular Dragonball franchise. If you like Dragonball, avoid this series. It doesn't even know Dragonball. I'm fair, though the end was really good, and actually it's pretty sad (at least for me) and the theme competitions for both the end and the opening are better (Japanese, not American). It might have been better if Toriyama san worked on it.
