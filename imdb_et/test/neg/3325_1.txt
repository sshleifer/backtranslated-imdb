This film was basically created for studio failure. One, Anne Rice (author of the book), offered to play on the screen, but the studio refused. Two, they tried to put 2 deep novels on a 2-hour movie. <br /> <br /> I keep the only way these two books - Vampire Lestat and Queen of Damn - work in the form of a living action through the mini series. Vampire Lestat is for the first time from the 1700s to the 1980s and has many symbols that are important for understanding the main character Lestat. The whole book of Vampire Lestat set the scene for the second part of the queen's deaths. Without this full understanding, the premise of the film is destroyed. <br /> <br /> Lesta was not cruel and annoyed, he didn't want to go to Akasha's plans, Marius didn't make Lestat, Lestat didn't love Jesse or put him on, Lest could not stay out of light, Marius wasn't after David or vice versa , each character was completely wrong, BASICALLY same names different story. <br /> <br /> If they want to make a vampire movie. Even if you wanted these novels to be inspired, it's good. But don't throw back the success of Rice's great novels and characters into the theater, but destroy what his loyal readers love. <br /> <br /> If you haven't read the books that you can't understand in the movie, you have read the books you offend. Saying this, I am so big a fan that I had to get to know the movie completely, it happened and it still went. Catch 22 must see it, hate it.
