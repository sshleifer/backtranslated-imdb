Let's face it. Tracking cultural classics such as Road House is not an easy task. Now unmount the Swayze equation and get a monumental task. So, with Patrick, who wasn't on board, whose clever idea was to go ahead and make that garbage? I blame the director, who didn't even give 5 minutes of proper video on the film. I was really shocked that they could jump on Will Patton (Armaggedon). Johnathon Schaech took the lead in OK, but writing was cruel. Pressing the partner's brunette bomb (Crystal Mantecon) from the first 5 minutes of the film made me want out of it. But I was stuck with the film, hoping to get a glimpse of this great fun humor that worked so well with Double Duece. There is no such happiness. The DVD cover is fun, these two stacked blondes, who make a movie in 10 seconds. Costar Ellen Hollman actually puts in good performance. But again, it is meaningless in such a garbage and stigma as it is. Has Jake Busey ever been cast into decent movies? Do they pull at least some nostalgia treatment from the first film? Even one of the old rogue or two, or Jeff Healey's performance, would have been nice. Take this movie out of your order right now. -LostFlix
