All movies that contain "dark sound effects" must be photographed. If there is one thing I hate, it must be "whoop whoop whoo" if someone hits one head. The only movies I've seen are Ghoulies IV and Hobgoblins when they're at the bar, and Pixie strikes a red suit boy with a beer bottle ... or rather fanning him with a beer bottle because he never hits him with it. Yeah, Ghoulies IV sucks. But I have to think, did they think they did not move the "ghoulies" mouth when they allegedly spoke? Their faces are almost as static as trolls 2. used masks. Hell, I get a better mask from construction work, some rubber cement and a handful of glitter. It sucked.
