Maybe we're too big glasses when we hear about antiquity. Maybe we are expecting too many of these films. But if we, the viewers, are offered too little, what will happen? That's what I meant after Paul Marcus has seen the IMPERIUM-NERONE series of parts of the Roman Empire. The first IMPERIUM film Roger Young, AUGUSTUS, contained at least Peter O'Toole, but what does this film contain? <br /> <br /> Hardly anything accurate. Historical flaws are so serious that the film changes the facts and represents a distorted image of the Roman Empire rather than a true history. Throughout the film, Nero's youngsters are: the young man Caligula, allegedly during a long rule, a young man during the reign of Claudius, and finally his historical (14 years old). And ... he dies the same. Nero, born during the reign of Tiberius, has been living for more than 40 years, but he seems to die in his twenties when he dies. Nero loses his father, the slaves raise it. At that time, his mother Agrippina, Caligula has been expelled. Later he suddenly marries Emperor Claudius, who already has large children and freshly married Messal. At these moments of the movie, we see Acte (Rike Schmid), Nero's lover. Okay, it's historically "accurate"; yet no source proves that he played such a decisive role in the rise of Christianity in Rome. In the film, he is not only a devoted Christian, but even a witness of St. Paul's miracle (he brings life back to young Marzia). Moreover, Caligula had not historically met anything like Nero because Nero was born in Caligula's four-year rule (A.D. 37-41). I understand that movies can make a difference, but this error makes the script completely unreliable! And many, many other drawbacks regarding content that is difficult to list, but after watching a 30-minute movie, I doubted if I was watching a historical movie or a complete fantasy. <br /> <br /> With their artistic qualities that offer us entertainment, they are just as flat as the history here. Performances are artificial, just plain beautiful faces, but weak performance. Maybe I'm too much involved with Peter Ustinov or Charles Laughton in the lead, but Hans Matheson doesn't fit Nero at all. He may have some good moments as an actor, but never as an infamous Roman emperor. Is he an artist who burns for the song of Rome? Is he cynical who hides love for his relatives? Is he a cruel ruler who sacrifices the life of thousands of innocent people in the name of "alleged justice"? None of them. He's just a young man who doesn't know how to rule, and in the long run, he's gonna come in on his own ... John Simm is in this movie above Caligula and completely worse than the others. Elisa Tovati is only sexy as Poppaea; but he could have been much better. Costumes are inaccurate and the kits are not surprising. Low budget leads to low impact and consequently low entertainment. <br /> <br /> But what made me the most angry about this movie and as a result I give him a few moments that are totally unacceptable: <br /> <br /> Talking of Poppaea and St Paul Neroga his body, <br /> <br /> - Claudius mentions Britannia's current conquest of the feast and soon his death (he conquered Britannia, while Messalina was his wife much before his death), <br /> <br /> - Tigellinus killed Agrippina (Laura Morante), Nero's mother, <br /> <br /> - Nero's arguments in speech senators, <br /> <br /> - finally Nero's death - a peaceful day by the lake and indifferent suicide that leads to morality, what Acte said, "Let's forgive him" <br /> <br /> All this film is a waste of time and it is absolutely necessary as it is another production of the Roman Empire. It is better to make one good movie in 30 years than ten minor in 5 years. 1/10 - it shouldn't have been done at all.
