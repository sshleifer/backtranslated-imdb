The Four Police Detective Special Department gives justice in Los Angeles in the 1950s in a unique way. Nick Nolte is played by Max Hoover, head of unit and his partners are Michael Madsen, Chazz Palminter and Chris Penn. Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly and John Malkovich are also starring. Quite impressive list of names. Unfortunately, this is the only thing that is impressive about this movie. <br /> <br /> Our story begins when Connelly's young Allison Pond is dead in a distant city currently under development. Our four detective band has been invited and it is clear that Nolte Max Hoover is very personal in this case. We will soon discover that Allison, in addition to Hoover's quite good knowledge, also participated in some quite important military and government types that may have had a reason to die. But who exactly was involved and why would they want this deadly harmless woman dead? Hoover and the team decided to find out. There seems to be an interesting assumption, but unfortunately it goes somewhere. <br /> <br /> Despite the impressive series of names, action here leaves much to be desired. Nolte is superfluous, Madsen seems incredibly boring, Palminter and Malkovich come in cartoons, Penn has hardly anything to do and Griffith is bored. By far the best result is Connelly, which is too short for setbacks. Dialogue throughout the film is forced and wooden. This type of mystery does not have the drama feeling expected. There's nothing dramatic. Actually, nothing seems to be the case with most pictures. Instead, we are simply confronted with a rather ridiculous and incredibly disappointing. Once the "mystery" is solved, you may find yourself saying, "Oh, is it all there?" But it will get worse if, after understanding, we have a completely ridiculous and totally unbelievable sequence of actions. And even then, we are making even more suffering when the other terrible, badly acting, totally unnecessary scene comes to an end. And then it's gracious. And not for a moment too fast.
