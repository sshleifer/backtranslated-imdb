Of course, I'm not a fan of Monogram Chani movies. . The plot containing theft of the radio from the bank's treasury is a bit far removed and far from the secrets of the atmosphere produced by Fox. Mantan Moreland and Benson Fong (like No. 3 Son Tommy) give some laugh as usual. But there is not much else here. A big title that's wasted.
