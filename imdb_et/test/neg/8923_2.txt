I usually spend as much time writing my comments as I watch a movie, but with today's death, I feel that it would be a criminal residue of my time. <br /> <br /> So here's five minutes of how bad this film is. In the mid-1980s, it was time for one of Steven Seagal's eyes to be enough to break your rib; Full Body can hit your feet. When he actually got you, he'd like you like a branch. <br /> <br /> These days, although he is still able to do considerable damage, he doesn't see any more. He's gone to the seed and just doesn't know when to call it. He walks as he throws off his pants, but somehow manages to look for constipation and he has considered it. Her trademark is a long ponytail, but her hair is still stupid. How this person works in the film industry is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Today, when you die, the usual Seagal blend is made up of bone splitting, car accidents, weapon battles and pyrotechnics. Seagal mumbles the way through a boring script, offering its lines with zero-enthusiasm or credibility. In this tertiary activity, he plays the thief of Harlan Banks, who is trying to go straight to the $ 20,000,000 robbery. He gets stuck, goes to jail, flees and looks for revenge. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There are some pretty good car rides and weapon races that share eternal things (a lot of them), but reading other IMDb notes has shown that they were actually other borrowed movies. Seagal has also doubled here. <br /> <br /> Seagal is turning to one of his most terrible quests and says something in terms of somewhat funny "action" in some of his recent efforts. His most embarrassing attempt at Ebonics (African American street slang) is the most fun. "I'm a man," sho "no, actually Steven, you sound like a ass! With a ridiculous script and plot lines that go somewhere, this is a waste of time and money. And the last moment Harlan Banks rescues a child's home is enough, to blow the pieces. <br /> <br /> Damn, I just looked at the clock, so I enjoyed this steaming bowl so much that I went over five minutes.
