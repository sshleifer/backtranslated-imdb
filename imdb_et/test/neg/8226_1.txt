I have no mistake as to how the film will not hit New Jersey (like Zach, I'm from there). Good. What ever. I had enough time there. I don't have to see a movie recording in the garden. <br /> <br /> What I have is how bad this movie is. Let's make it easy. We use some dots. There are probably some spoilers that follow. (Not that you can't predict ANYWAY): <br /> <br /> - Music placement was crazy and patronizing. Example: Big: "What are you listening to?" Sam: "Shins. Ever heard" em? "" No "." Listen to this song - it will change your life! "And then they play that Shins song that was in McDonald's commercial. ! "" cry "" feeling inspired "etc.) <br /> <br /> - The scenes were SO BAD. SO cliche. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example: The whole movie. But no, really, for example: They're in a ship's rainy career. Big runs up - in the foundry (oh he's TORMENTED!) - on heavy machinery and SCREAMS! Oh, how it moves! But wait! Then Sam and his friend (annoying drug addict) will come, and they will all be !!!! AGA WANT !!!! OH MY GOD!!!! Here it comes! THESE KISS !!! LONG, DEEP !!!! WHITE !!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> - Dialogue was SO BAD. SO cliche. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example. They leave the ship and Sam says something, "Hey. Good luck exploring the infinite abyss." And the boy says, "You too." Oh ... Oh my! I've never understood ... could it be? Oh my God it is! Great life is like ... ohmigod ... INFINITE ABYSS !!!! Another example: Big and Sam at the airport. Sam says something, "Is that goodbye?" Not enough? OK, Largeman says something like, "It's not at the end of the sentence ... it's an ellipse." And don't guess what happens when he tries to ride along jetways and go back to his life in LA. You know what? Don't think. It's a waste of your time. <br /> <br /> -This is a Z class Wes Anderson movie. If it is not occupied with melodramatic and clich√©, the film will spend a lot of time with mad kooky-off-kilter characters. Hey, Sami's brother ... thank you for Zach Braff's involvement because it made the movie really textured. Anderson's Ripping: Dialogue. Scene: Sam and Largeman are in the bar. Walking With Friends, "Vagina!" says one of them. Then they see him sitting with Sam, so one of his friends says, "Sorry, I said vagina." And Sam says, "It's OK." <br /> <br /> -Inventive cinematography that is not inventive but pointless and annoying. Give me a break with accelerating / slowing down the movie. Again, Wes Anderson does this in his films effectively. And it did well in "Donnie Darko". But in fact it was pointless. Wow. Crazy party where people take X and snooking coke. Better roll all the tricks! <br /> <br /> -You can read good moments on one hand (even if there are no fingers). It even makes it work. Slow trolley thing ... well, that was good! The little thing he (big man) says when they intend to enter the quarry (something from the drug terpentine) ... it was good! Oh, wait, that's it. <br /> <br /> You know, Zach Braff is always a little too cute. But she's nice. But man, it's forced, pretentious, melodramatic (have you got it yet?), Too cute, too much. This movie is terrible. Obviously I am more, because this waste of time is currently estimated at 8.0. <br /> <br /> Please, if you are looking for something really acute and fine and unique DO. NO. RENT. PRESENT. FILM.
