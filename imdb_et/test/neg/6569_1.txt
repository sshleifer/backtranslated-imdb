Leonard Nimoy headed the Star Trek III, which wasn't half bad. Maybe William Shatner thought Nimoy did what he could. After seeing the film, he would have had to cancel that decision. <br /> <br /> Star Trek V The ultimate limit is the worst in the series. Everyone involved, including those such as Shatner and Nimoy, is acting badly and wiping out and making them as old as they see in real life, the special effects stick as if Spock has to fall on the Kirki jetipak when he falls down the hill. <br /> <br /> Humor experiments were pathetic and the story is so terrible that you don't think about what Vulcan basically steals from the company to find God (seriously) take care of this movie and tell that Uhura is not doing belly dance to disrupt men's guards. He seemed to have participated in grandmother's competition. If they want to look her sexy. They were wrong. He looked at the grotesque. <br /> <br /> How it was brought or even written ... it doesn't lose thought. The only place in this movie is garbage. The worst is the series.
