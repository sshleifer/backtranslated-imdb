Anthony Minghella's another tiring hole, which seems to be flourishing with these large expanded super products that take more than two and a half hours to make any reasonable filmmaker in about ninety minutes. <br /> <br /> Nature Centers for Inman (Central Jude Law), going to the Civil War, just barely started the novel by Nicole Kidman, the preacher's daughter who has recently arrived at a beautifully photographed underwater city. The story truncates between Inman's experiments and wars (which are believed by boys and girls? HELL !!) and Kidman's home and temptation to return home (which is very predictable, incredibly boring). Renee Zellwegger will appear on Kidman Farm to help Kidman regain his shape after the death of Kidman's holy father due to illness. Zellwegger acts in all sorts of cunning and bossy fashion in this fashionable Clampett way, giving enough Tough Love and Homespun wisdom to make the belly even the most toughest Watcher In Angel. <br /> <br /> This movie is simply, embarrassing. Avoid it like a big bloated Oscar feed that is meaningless literary adaptation.
