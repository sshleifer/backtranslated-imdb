In this film, there is an open plot man (Bardem) who wants to get financial assistance from his construction company and marries a woman he does not love (with wide eyes Maria de Medieros). He keeps his passionate relationship with his first and true love, and eventually binds to his romantic web. He will never give up his juggling act until the three main characters are face to face. The result of the film is boring, with lots of free sex (well, both girls are really good), all the film's reactions are absurd, inconsistent and of course too many fools. No character is plausible, which makes the film a little annoying. Anyway, the actor is surprisingly good for a bad-looking movie that makes it a little interesting, but if you can, watch another movie!
