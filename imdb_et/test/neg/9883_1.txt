There were only two redemption functions for this movie; The beauty of Bucharest and its architecture, and the way they portrayed human transformation into a wolf form. Forget about the story or story from the book - they're completely missing from this movie. In fact, the only things that have been transferred from the book are the names of the main players. Even then you will hardly know this testimony. If the filmmakers had made a good movie, even if they were not related to the book, I would not be so disappointed. Unfortunately, they didn't. The plot and storyline are typical of low budget horror flicks, acting on wood, and director's efforts everyday. Oh yes, the way the loup garou leans to his driver is pure hok. I think animal handlers must recognize. Wolves were beautiful animals and their roles were well managed.
