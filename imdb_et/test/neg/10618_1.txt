I picked up this movie because it sounded like a pretty decent flick and I've always been a fan of foreign films. But for someone who loves movies, I was surprised how much I hate, hate, hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Although it aims to reveal the lives of young men, the lower classes of men in Lima and elsewhere. to the extent that it succeeds, the characters are hopelessly low, and there are no feelings for them under the wind of the audience. <br /> <br /> Although the story revolves around M, she rarely speaks and her dialouge is the best, amazingly dry and dull. <br /> <br /> *** Warning: some small spoilers *** <br /> <br /> Basically, the story has been turned around by a young man named M who has been looking for jobs but without success (He gets a job times, but giving up because they are not for him "if you are poor, the last chance you want is to be picky. It takes some time with your friends to have a" fun "idea of ​​murdering a little 14-year-old, stealing dirty tires chewing, which is for weed control, and a number of other slowed down activities. / M <br /> A friend of mine must plan to make $ 25,000 and move to the United States by directing cocaine to Miami. who buy clothes in the mall where music is played in the background.We see that they are trying different clothes like little girls who have bought $ 200, there hair cut and then slip out like slippery gangsters (one badge, Carlos, bears this time snowy sunglasses always ... even at night). The day before leaving the group leader leaves to talk about drugs, leaving M and his friend stupid. They compete, take a number of samples of drugs they think they run, and break their old school, act like animals and break everything right away. Who hangs on her. Then, friends continue to pay for setting up the phone with a fire that brings out a lot of children and some old men with a gun. A friend of M and Carlos, who is responsible for drug use, appears on his motorcycle and wants them to leave with him. Then he takes himself down and gets this old man down. The police showed and arrested M and his friends (but not the man who shot the guy) and covered his dead friend with newspapers because the music is playing and it is losing credit. Try Ending Spoiler Complete waste management 102 minutes. Although I have to give it a testimony that it is simple and not confusing elements, casting, acting, and the general direction are still much, much, much desirable. <br /> <br /> IMHO, if you are interested in a movie that explores the issues it was supposed to, go to rent a city of God (Cidade de Deus). Avoid this rubbish at all costs! You've been warned !!
