Note to yourself. Never ever had a serious movie with Charlie Sheen. Big comedian, terrible seal. This film makes the Navy SEALS like a reckless group, where they are actually the world's most elite forms. Charlie Sheen helps to destroy the reputation of the Navy SEAL. Thank you for making such an incredibly selected group of individuals who see the scary one in the worst movie. This is a great story that could be made an amazing action movie, but why Charlie Sheen? Here the chances are very passionate about the story, but Sheen decides to destroy them with "funny" comments.
