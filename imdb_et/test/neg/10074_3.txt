Number 1 was really a great summer popcorn. It was a modern jaw. <br /> <br /> Number 2 has been best summed up by Jeff Goldblum in the movie that it is a stupid idea in the history of foolish ideas (or something like that). <br /> <br /> Number 3 is a relentless message ... JP has achieved everything he ever does. <br /> <br /> If they realized they had no fresh ideas, they should just let them sleep. <br /> <br /> That said. The movie is ok if you don't know you've already seen it. <br /> <br />
