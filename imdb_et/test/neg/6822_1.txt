I'm sitting here watching the movie, Tango and money. This led to a discussion of other big 80s films. The ridiculous Tunrer and Hooch, K9 connection came out. Joshua cites this as his year's film. Wow. Wow. I'm surprised that this movie is there. But so much more than that Joshua likes this gear to distract me from the heart. I think Joshua is one interesting guy <br /> <br /> K9 <br /> <br /> K9
