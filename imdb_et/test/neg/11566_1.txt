In fact, it was terrible. The main chick that gets topless was probably sleeping with the director at that time. It was shot in a warehouse that probably belonged to family or friends. They also chose not to tell the story. Of course, these are ways to reduce costs, but are they ways to keep costs down? No, they're not. At least they could have found a "school" in a student's "creative writing" course. These children may have at least a story about the structure. At least they could have read three factor structures, but obviously acting was not a priority either. Watching these jerks goes in funny clothes that were stupid according to the standards of the 1980s. The fact that none of these actors committed suicide reduction is likely to be a proof of the limited distribution of this film. If the actors had seen the end result of their hard work, there would have been a number of people waiting for the Brooklin bridge to jump. <br /> <br /> I would give the 10/10 stars of this movie, but it just deserves 1 release at all. This movie should be shown to film educators everywhere. It's better than 90% of the pupils' movies I've seen and how this film is a Shiite.
