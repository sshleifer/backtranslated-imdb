The more funny thing about Fortune is that one of the main characters, Lewis (Urbaniak), is the writer's block and probably the writer of the film scenario. It's sad too, because I think it's a great comedy or dramatic, but that's the funniest thing I remember to watch. <br /> <br /> Three friends go and drink one night. At home, the two decide to get their treasures "gypsy" as they call him. These two lives will break down when the third friend is standing. Then nothing happens. <br /> <br /> I hope I didn't break the movie there, but really, this very low budget, poor quality movie had some idea when it started, but quickly snowed into the depths of hell. Yes, I'm tough. Frankly, it wasn't so bad, it was just blah. <br /> <br /> The above-mentioned writer was annoying to look at, although he might have given one or two of only two funny lines. Kliched "ladies man", the only one who didn't get his fortune, was just annoying. The only bright spot was the remaining friend, the married father, whose luck was told that something big happened to his son and he was supposed to be ready. He was funny, genuine and clearly the best actor in the film. Unfortunately, it doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too cruel. Heck, they got the ambition to make a movie, went and got money and got something. Unfortunately, I can't recommend a movie at all, there are hundreds of thousands of other independent movies with hundreds of thousands of better ideas and executions. It was literally a 10-minute idea that stretched another 81 boring minutes.
