I just watched the icon on a DVD and, despite being a great book, it's a weak base for the movie. Those responsible for writing should be sent to Siberia. Why do they taste a great story with all kinds of C-films that are completely irrelevant to the story, entirely over me. <br /> <br /> But the filmmakers and the cast do it to do something, but after all, the movie was not at all satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Can anyone make a movie about it properly to show how it is done. I'm sure the crowd will rally for a masterpiece of a masterpiece that became a book, not a cheap C movie.
