This movie was a big disappointment. The plot sounds good, about half a person, a half-leopard creature in Africa, which will become a young American adult documentary. When many crew members are dead, two dependents are questioned. I wouldn't even call it a horror film, because most of the movie is actually the high-level (which isn't as fun as it sounds - trust me) of the man-made 20-something sex and smoking-induced manure. You rarely see the creature and the main actor (who also happens to be the leader, screen writer, editor and producer!) Is incredibly annoying. <br /> <br /> Finally, I was so annoyed that I never had a dialogue that I quickly transmitted to the end. I had reached the end of this movie in less than 10 minutes ... and I was right. So this terrible movie is also quite predictable - as if it wasn't bad enough. Story Morality: Avoid movies that the same person does not operate, directs, delivers, produces, and writes. And avoid this movie, except when it is held at the gunpoint.
