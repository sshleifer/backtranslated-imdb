It would be a shame if Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duval saw this movie because they are likely to be involved in the coming years. "Oh yes", the public says, "Comanche Moon", this is a mini-series from Texas Rangers and Comanche Indians who celebrated Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duval, this was the real smelly and probably the worst movie they ever thought I was that it was a comedy but not a very funny comedy. I really do not understand why they agreed. This would be such injustice because the original "Lonesome Dove" was a real Western classic and this turkey is a real bomb and Jones and Duva are remembered for that.
