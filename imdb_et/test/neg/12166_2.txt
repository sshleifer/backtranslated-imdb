ok, i'm really King's stuff, but it's just terrible. the whole movie, i expect the protagonist to do something deep with his new youth and power. I can tolerate the worst movies because something is better than watching a cut movie with ads. but it takes the cake. I gave him 2 and I would never recommend it to anyone.
