The alleged documentary that attempts to explore the 1950s sci-fi movies and how they affected (and setbacks) America. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Ridley Scott and James Cameron are interviewed and Mark Hamill tells. <br /> <br /> Pretty terrible. These "insights" are nothing new - for example, during the Cold War and the threat of a nuclear war, affected a whole generation of children. Well! They try to cover all the different genres of sci-fi films from the 1950s - big bug films, invaders of space films, etc. This is good, but they choose the most obvious films and they have already died. It was cool to see the clips "Rocketship XM", "Destination Moon", "Forbidden Planet", "The Thing", and "The The Earth the Earth Stood Still", but all the directors said was so incredible to every viewer that it is offensive. Even if it's less than an hour, I missed it for 30 minutes. For some clips it is 2, but nothing else.
