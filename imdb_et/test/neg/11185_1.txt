How to describe the horrors? !!! First of all, some points: first, this review should be taken with a salt blade - I saw it over 20 years ago when I was a boy at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. <br /> <br Secondly, I give some scenes and plot points. But it does not have much plot. <br /> <br /> Finally, I don't enjoy such art films anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie was directed by proto-auteur Luis Bunuel. He was surreal and dada. These were modern themes or popular movements in the early 1920s. Surrealism was an art school that made things hyper-real, but often they had Freud's symbolism. Dadaism is based on what is supposedly the first word made by a child - Dada or Dad. <br /> <br /> Made in black and white, as did the Communist band (or if they preferred socialists). Bunuel and a group of colleagues and artists had worked on a number of symbolic ideas and issues between world wars in Spain and France. Police (Doo doo doo da), poet Arthur Rambaud, Edvard Munch (The Scream), Rene Magritte (floating hats in space), Salvador Dali (melting watches) and even Hitchcock (Psycho). Not Norman Rockwell. <br /> <br /> Here is what I usually remember about this movie: the girl meets the cow; his shaving eye in his eye; clown men grab a meadow. As I said, there is not a lot of plot, but then again, it must be a point. <br /> <br /> It was then attacked by porn and it would be again today. One surreal brand is important feminism.
