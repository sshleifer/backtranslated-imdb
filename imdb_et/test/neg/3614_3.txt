Various snake stages represent an uprising for tourists who "invade" their island due to damage to their captain's boat. Few surviving survivors who are not vulnerable to snakes are trying to gain access to a mission to escape the existing boats that can safely escape these islands. <br /> <br /> Featuring straight-line injected doses of visual humor with a lot of snake gags, Wayne Crawford's SNAKE Islands have a wide variety of leguminous predator breeds ready to attack. Star William Katt, as an author studying the snakes of future novels, has a role to play as writer / director / co-star Wayne Crawford (as captain of a tourist ship) as a fun hero who looked at the most serious crisis. Kate Connor is Crawford's attractive love interest, lawyer on vacation. Other cast members are either tourists or crew members, mainly snakes. <br /> <br /> Like many other movies of this type, director Crawford has a live snake with computer generated, and violence is really annoying. Crawford even includes the camera's field of view technique as a snake's eye as it stands in front of a potential victim (.. with the actor directly into the camera). Never being taken seriously, the language-in-cheek approach was probably the best way to shoot SNAKE ISLAND because the premise is just too ridiculous to accept your own. because Crawford is often unable to successfully take action on people with snakes. The low attacks themselves do not take place on the screen (.. one or two tops) or are so narrow that they leave little impression. This is not the genre. Roof fans are likely to want to look at it because it offers some facial comedies that set the general tone of certain scenes where it needs to protect itself from the snakes. CGI scenes where we see a large number of snake in the general area are not very effective in eliminating the realism that Crawford has tried to create. There are many better horror films with scissors as the SNAKE ISLAND. The surprising moments of nudity placed in a scene where tourists and the team relax after a long day of bubble, without knowing what the danger is.
