This story speaks of a safari in Africa that meets some guy Trent convincing them to look for a white babes tribe. Of course, they will turn out to be Amazon warriors and men. The rest is quite predictable. <br /> <br /> This film contains everything you would expect from a favorable basement concert in Africa - a vital use of often unnecessary film material, an animal film that is not natural on the continent. (like orangut, moose, Coatamundi and Ground Hogs), white actress in a dark make-up who plays native, bad actor (especially Trent - a beautiful man with balsa wood personality), comic relief (sounds like Chico Marx), boy who is dressed in gorilla suit and bikini-covered white women who allegedly have tight jungle warriors - like angry female Tarzans. According to this look, my assumption is that the film was made for less than $ 49.95 - including cost development and paying for a gorilla suit! But what I didn't expect was an IMDb score of 4.9. This is bad, but not what is poor, given that it is all possible thought production and is not a reason why the film is so high! Now, I'm not saying the movie isn't worth seeing - it's funny and stupid to make enjoyable viewing - especially with friends. Just do not wait for something similar to a professionally made or competent film. <br /> <br /> Finally, this jungle has a classic dialog: <br /> <br /> Oolama as a strong white man. Oolama wants a strong white man ... "<br /> <br /> Oong -bunga "<br /> <br />" me-te-tonga .... no, .... keeel ('kill ") man"
