Naked Deanna Troi! <br /> <br /> Richie's brother Chuck ("Happy Days") with an inverted mohawk! <br /> <br /> The Death Race 3 has all this and more, including one smart scene where Chuck Bronson's symbol creates a mouse trick like a device that drives a punk when opening a window. <br /> <br /> Chuck also puts the nails with nails near the second window and smiles when he returns and sees the bloody footprints. <br /> <br /> All I can say about Death Wish 3 is that it is one of the most incomprehensible "serious" movies I've ever seen - a loaded well and almost zero police response, despite to use military weapons to mow the ticks. <br /> <br /> As I understand, Bronson gave up this movie, but he was happy to make money from Golan Globus. <br /> <br /> If you like high quality movies, avoid this, but if you're a cheap "Jackass" type of excitement, check it out.
