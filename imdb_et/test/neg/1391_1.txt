Carlos Mencia is just not funny! His exhibition is painful to look at. His sketches / parodies are all very terrible, and it looks just like the Chapelle Show filler, which is not its big fan, but it's much more fun than this trash. Carlos Mencia gives stupid speeches and he too often depends on his monologue's finish with a slow voice and "der, der der." It's not just funny. He often makes punches when talking to others. They are terrible and painful. If people don't laugh, he blames them ... why would anyone laugh, he's not funny. He has an immortal sense of humor in everything he does with this show, it's amazing that everyone, except the 3-year-old, is watching it. One of my least favorite things he does is put down each topic with water and get to know the fun! I hope this racist idiot can get out of the air as soon as possible because he slips off a station that no longer has to fool.
