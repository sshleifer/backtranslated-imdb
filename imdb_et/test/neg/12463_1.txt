I just wish I had a good idea to turn off this movie at the beginning when I knew it was terrible. Instead, I gave her this doubt and waited for it to improve. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistake I made. <br /> <br /> The title is not related to the movie. The film has nothing to do with the real world. The plot has nothing to do with the plot. The actor consists of a man who wants to be John Cusack but can't pull it out. Lead is a girl who is trying to be Claire Daines. Unfortunately, he can't pull it out. They are in love, though God knows only why. And finally, I hoped they would all kill each other so I could believe that none of these children would die again.
