No matter what you have heard, "celebrity" is not a good movie. Investments over two hours are not worth seeing stereotypically worrying teenage dancing, singing, learning and watching girls in changing rooms. <br /> <br /> Each clich√© finds a cozy home in this movie. There's a gay teenager looking for approval. It would have been great if it had been dealt with more than a secondary plot point. There is a ghetto boy who has too much attitude - what was I surprised? And guess what? They all want to get big stars, find fame and happiness, and they would all be ready to investigate the smoking bodies of their mothers. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, this movie is remembered for music. But in reality, the only moderately good song is "Hot Lunch Jam", which is still too cheesy to be real quality. Also, the two most popular songs are nothing. "Celebrity" is a meaningless fluff that has sunk into the eye of a massive dance-in-the-street scene. And "I sing with the body with electricity" (which in Bubba's name even means?!?!?!?!?) Is just an incomprehensible joke. <br /> <br /> Poor functioning, tasteless dialogue and hacking (After all, Evita's director, Michael Seresin, has little use to do with normal camera work. But cinematography alone is not able to carry a movie, especially one that is uninspiring and meaningless .
