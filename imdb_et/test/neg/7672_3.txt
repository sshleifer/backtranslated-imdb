Some slack may cut this film because it was made in 1979. It said it was really terrible. <br /> <br /> Do not forget the ridiculous project or the terrible, "terrible" flight of "flying" objects, which are the tricks that Concorde pulls down, which will flash in your absurdity in your sudden misery. Barrel-rolls, loop-the-loops, and violent "evasive" maneuvers left me aware of the fact that world troops were not only flying Concordes as their main fighters. <br /> <br /> So here are the important lessons I learned from this celluloid cheese festival: <br /> <br /> 1. Concorde is at least as powerful as the Phantom 4 jet. <br /> <br /> 2. You can shoot a fire gun at Mach 2 just by opening the cab window and grabbing your hand. <br /> <br /> 3. Do not drop the burner if it cannot be emptied, as it may go out. <br /> <br /> 4. Concorde can prevent up to two Sidewinder rockets being burned at a time. <br /> <br /> 5. Burning pulls the heat-seeking rocket every time. <br /> <br /> 6. Turning off the soldering motors is a sure way to extract heat-seeking missiles if 5 (above) doesn't work. <br /> <br /> 7. Crash-landing at Concordes will probably make it impossible to hit your fuel in advance. <br /> <br /> 8. Concorde pilots are all veterans trained to fight. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, this movie is not very realistic. Impacts are primitive by today's standards, and with the futile acrobatics, Concorde makes this film that deserves little but scares. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Not recommended at all!
