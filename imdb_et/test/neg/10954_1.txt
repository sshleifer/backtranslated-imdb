This movie mixed me. I didn't get it. I thought I might be missing something. I'm glad that most of you agree with me. This is not always the case (see my recent review of RE: Extinctionist). <br /> <br /> To explain the mistakes of this movie, it would be a waste of time ... so I want. .. <br /> <br /> They are dressed like cowboys, but this is the time of today, right? No? I can't do it ??? When I got the box, I thought: ZOMBIE WESTERN! COOL! That's how it was presented. You haven't seen it yet. I hope they did a good job. <br /> <br /> They didn't! They tried to create an iconic character that tells the series. They didn't. <br /> <br /> They tried to make the Aussie indie zombie plasterboard (and perhaps riding on the tails of the hair) very well done by "UNDEAD". They didn't want to. Okay, maybe they just wanted to make a confusing, inseparable, confusing film secret that could eventually be traced. They are not! This is the new number 2 on my worst zombie movies list. So far, there are only two, "HIGH DAY: CONTAGIUM", which is the first (not to be confused with "HIGH DAY", which is one of my favorite zombie movies all the time). If you make a zombie movie (and I'm not a zombie filmmaker, I'm just an expert). Living Dead's flight is a good example of decent recent zombie filming. FYI. <br /> <br /> If you're really forgiving, you might think they won't throw anything to feel we don't want our money back? Guess what ... NOT!
