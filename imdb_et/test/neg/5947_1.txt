Tom Selleck plays with the son of the "pop" Don Ameche and the tired mother of Anne Jackson's son, having taken away his indiscretions (one assumes) and taking them after Ameche has burned his mobile home; meanwhile loses F.B.I. Sellec's work, his property is frozen, his wife and children leave him and his nasty sister and brothers have come to stay. The brightly-colored comedy injuries are as intact as reality as Ameche's old coat. Maybe a serious first draft was added (for example, scenes like Ameche walking out to the traffic of two toddlers) to the second or third version of the bridge (with Handeck bouncing, colliding, prodded and finally losing toe and testicle!). In both cases, it is a painful experience, and Sellec's sudden commitment to his father makes no sense. he horses around and throws pain, but keeps his heart. This movie is bright. * from ****
