Another cookie filter for a hardened adult film that responds to a divine street-wise child (Cop, 1/2, Gloria, etc.). And again, it's not funny or interesting when someone looks - kids or adults. I'm sure some people will find this movie amusing, but I have no idea of ​​why. Again, I am sorry for the poor children who were forced to work in this movie, so that everyone else and their parents can do some bucks for a cheesy cheesy movie.
