Having grown up in the west and considering the western nature of television and theater, I was very much looking forward to the Commanche Moon. fired with a tight budget. Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones are not visible. Is Val Kilmer, but what the hell is going on with her? Four or five buildings on either side of the street and Scull Manor make up the entire city of Austin. The captain will never be seen, just inside the governor's office. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is often time-consuming, meaningless rambling. The plot line separated. Total is completely forgotten.
