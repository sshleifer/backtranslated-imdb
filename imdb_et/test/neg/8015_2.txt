I rented it because I couldn't pass Hollywood's fame to Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones, but it wasn't worth it. The only reason I gave it instead of the two stars is to see them before they become big on the pond. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones, who is usually fun to watch, even if she's not the biggest in the world, it's terrible. Owen seems to be uncomfortable in such a turkey, plus she is wearing a ridiculous, extremely poorly fit chin length (at least I hope it is a wig and not her real hair). And the scene where she dances with Zeta Jones makes you just embarrassed. Joan Plowright walks around the whole movie - he probably thinks he was getting confused. <br /> <br /> An actor who plays Clive Owen's wife is not terrible, but almost everyone else is. Oh, and writing stinks too.
