The old high school teacher practiced that he saw EVER every movie, so one day I decided to make a friend of mine and we compiled the movie "Pacific Inferno". We later came up with an argument as to whether Carl Weathers or Billy Dee Williams played a leading role. Our teacher found the argument interesting, so he came to us and told us that the leading role of "Pacific Inferno" was played by Jim Brown. We thought he was in the wrong trap, it was until we went to the library and discovered that "Pacific Inferno" was actually a real movie. This case forced me to rent a movie ... it's terrible. Our finished film had a better piece than this piece. Views and Billy Dee would have been much better in the picture.
