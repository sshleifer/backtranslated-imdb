Kazuo Komizu, who has not made one decent film, led this "notorious" shocker and should be ashamed that it was the result of Japan's release. <br /> <br /> Yes, it has rape scenes, gore and demolition, but what then? This is a bad American porn movie style photographed by Ed Powers ("Dirty Debutantes") and incredibly slow. <br /> <br /> He seems to have earned his fame based on his attacks. social activities. <br /> <br /> There is a big difference between this and the horror that is well produced. <br /> <br /> Just because someone likes their little cinema, it doesn't mean they accept the crap like that. On the contrary, such a fan (for example myself) can withstand even less tough than the average punter there, because he has seen so much and become too attentive. It's a disgrace that manufacturers don't know. <br /> <br /> One reviewer here (ZombieKilla81) commented that "almost obsession with rape" is one of the factors that killed it. I disagree. Theme is never a topic. The question is how this substance is dealt with. WOMEN'S WOMEN'S ENTRAILS is so immune that it is boring. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like the graphic representation of psychopathic behavior (intriguing context) when the material is well targeted, freshly photographed, and aesthetically pleasing. This Nikkatsu horror / pink hybrid is weird.
