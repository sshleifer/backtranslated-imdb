I really enjoy this genre, but The Cell was one of the worst films I've ever regretted. Although about 25 percent of my audience looked at the theater (or was completely left out) while watching, I was stupid enough to leave it out. The main problems of this story (too many for everyone) are that two things have to be done with this type of film ... one, give fear to the killer (being that they catch him for 20 minutes for a movie that's lost) and you have to give a victim whose life is at stake (a girl in the tank) has enough character development that you really care about, whether they reach her on time or not. Not only did she lose her girlfriend, I was given so little insight that she was just a blurry face and when I remember she was part of a story that I didn't really care about what happened to her. Although visuals were of interest to LSD feedback, they often have no meaning and should be a lesson that visual images cannot compensate for the lack of a good story (see Phantom Menace for another example). do I know or take care of what was in this field for women and heaven? It's ridiculous.
