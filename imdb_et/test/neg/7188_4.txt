let me start with a terrible story and a terrible control system. good animation but not too good graphics. that's why i give this game out of 4 10. IMPORTANT NEED FOR IMPROVING THE NEED FOR YOU! I would like to do this again and make this control system better so that the jaws are not so difficult to control. if I had corrected it, I'd make the graphics better than in the movie. it will drive someone crazy if you have been so easy to kill. I played it and died by the diver if he had one of these flip-knives in two hits. Dolphins kill you so much that the shark comes to the bottom of hell. this game sucks some fat ass. I'm sorry I think I've done it now. It's just that this game sucks so bad that it should take off the store shelf. i dare play you garbage and probably you will get so mad so easy to make it so dead so as not to play it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
