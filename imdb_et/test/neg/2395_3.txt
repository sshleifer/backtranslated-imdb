The love and human remains led by Denys Arcand are a sadly pathetic film because it is completely different from the movies he has made throughout his career. Making a second movie is not a controversial thing that is cumbersome when the film from the master is fully tuned and it is really a bad event. The film begins with a good note, as it has a relationship. But as the film progresses, it has been shown to be just a pointless attempt to create something meaningful, because Arcand shows us half a dozen oddballs, special characters whose life is interwoven. Homosexuality and lesbianism have no consequences here. Even more disturbing is the guilt associated with characters who are rather fixed to each other and to sexuality. Such a movie would be interesting for some who want to see another Denys Arcand movie. all there would certainly not be many recipients for this movie.
