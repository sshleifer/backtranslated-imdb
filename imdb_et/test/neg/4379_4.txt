For Norris, it's pretty annoying. For the action film, it's boring, and when predictability goes to my friend and I had almost all the turns of that movie. It was nice that the clich√©s of the 80's action films did not kill every move of the killer, but came out, the only unpredictable move violating the chart and the structure of the editing. Mostly, it is said quite early that the killer (Jack O'Halloran, one of the few little-known actors) kills only women. Yet, he suddenly stops his M.O. and kills men, huh? I think it can be interpreted and rationalized somewhat, but why has the film been changed to show that it kills women? But again, I am sure there is a reason (ie to build tension), but why spend time looking at how many other temporary films are much better. <br /> <br /> "Renegade" fans can enjoy Branscombe Richmond's small coming to Victoria, but his short appearance can't record a movie and even a 4-member voice is generous. <br /> <br />
