Action scenes were pretty good. But the plot plot, I should give him one score out of 10. It seems that the producers and director of this film did not think carefully about it? <br /> <br /> Don't give viewers much value and value except violence. The whole story was revenge. The boy who showed rape and murder. I would even recommend disabling it. Those who watched it, you just lost money. If you want to see it, look at something else. I'd ask for refunds when I was in the cinema. So your guys and girls are reading this article. Please don't waste time.
