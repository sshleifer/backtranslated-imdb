(As a remark, I would like to say that I saw this movie in my annual camp camp, where the whole group of young people laughed. I bought it when I saw it on the shelf for one year, only for humor. I came from a bad attempt to make an evangelical film.) > <br /> Put it down that doesn't meet many movie fans' expectations on many different planes. Most problems are impersonal. Regardless of the movie's nice cars or the truth of Christ's sacrifice, as a film and witness tool, it puts it down. <br /> <br /> Most good opinion films are supported by Christians who agree with the message. While Christians agree with easily agreed points, the audience hardly sees life outside the clich√©. The fighting style between Ben and his brother is dreadfully duplicated. And the subtitles have at least three coarse errors. <br /> <br /> I encourage everyone to watch the movie the second time the director's comment is. It really helps to understand why the movie was written, how it was. The director's opinion on secular society is practically the opposite of satisfying the needs of the film's visitors: it shows the pedantic understanding of non-Christians and some religious conflicts; most of the editing he admits was rushed, but "satisfactory"; he thought that over-exploited transitions and themes were effective; and was completely satisfied with the actor. <br /> <br /> He also added motives that he was quite proud: -All (read: most) names are significant. Ben Destin = "On", Gus Pelman = "Gospel Man", Nicky D = Nicodemus. A donut that makes donuts is a symbolic circular thing that is life without Christ. -If Ben leaves Pete's motorcycle, he crosses his crutches to form a cross. <br /> <br /> I don't do them. He casts such things around, saying that riders and other like-minded people "blow their brains out of arms" and how "God is under control when you were born and when you died". Yes, it wasn't a mistake. He really says it. <br /> <br /> I have (little) forgiveness for this movie. The "cool cars of the movie" and the "good message" don't make this movie for this movie. The film, however, was made from a group of unprofessional individuals whose budget was less than 1/100 "Fast and Furious's" and the time limit was unforgivable. With that in mind, I give him a score of 2/10 instead of 1/10, I think it deserves it.
