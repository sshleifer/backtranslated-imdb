I find it difficult to find words to explain how much I put this movie down. The historic trial of Henriette Deluzy-Desportes and Duc de Praslin is a tragic and convincing story that I found to be a fantastic film but could not. Although there was definitely something to say about filmmaking, it can't in any way offset the terrible structure of the film, the poorly written script, and the most frightening signs. The worst of them was Duci's children, who were so overpowering and painful that it was almost painful to look. <br /> <br /> To sum up, this film left me more than irritated and deeply disappointed.
