From barely foreign-sounding lasers to basic school-style bus attacks, Nightbeast is better classified as a counterfeit and bare-breasted mix. The almost pornographic style of the film seems to have been an unsuccessful attempt to recover from the lack of a single or effective story. But acting is not nearly the same beast, many young people, aspiring, actors show great hidden talent. Especially Don Leifert and Jamie Zemarel, who shed the light they needed on this otherwise terrible film. Nightbeast would never have been shown up if he knew a terrible film that would give this little Maryland a talent.
