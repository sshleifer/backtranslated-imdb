All this movie was trying to do better - and excellent "Run Lola Rune". A red hair cutter, a critical deadline (s), a threat, and a "crimes-pay-sometimes" message. But unlike "Lola", it's not just credible or well-assembled. This is a labor-breaking that could have worked for me if I had seen it before "Lola" - but that's comparable. Yes! Falling beetle was great! But it was about the only surprise in the movie. Take your advantage and see Real McCoy - (And REAL hip-red head!) - Run Lola Rune!
