Despite being a "Made-For-TV" movie (and obviously this: ie, looking low), CLASS WARFARE left me a wish to get my money back, and given this flat production, it was partly financed through Canada dollars, I can just be justified. <br /> <br /> What made me sit through it first, I saw actress Lindsey McKeon, whom I have watched over the last few years as a "good" Mara Lewis soap opera GUIDING LIGHT, turning to "a bad girl". as he does, Kristen, well-off rich-b * tch, who unexpectedly finds himself dirty, but with the drive and fate of fate that can change his fortunes. The fate is twisted by the character of socially radical attack by Richard (Robin Dunne) who discovers that he has been unable to win a $ 23 million lottery ticket, now, put Richard, Kristen, his jock-boyfriend Jason (Wade Carpenter), and Graham (Dave McGowan), an obsessed friend of their camcorder, in the distant cabin over the weekend world storms and just guess what the story is about the story as well as the characters and the motives too much. Everyone is rather one-dimensional and doesn't take the rocket science ie understand that some things and some people go very quickly very quickly. I don't think this is the original plot and it won't go out to do anything more. It's OK, McKeon is on the ground because a manipulative female leader, and Dunne is very good, maybe sometimes a little too good, but nobody is worth writing at home. The only other real credit that I get for the movie is what I didn't see in the future (not just the end that it is so obvious that it is painful). Regardless, I sat through it and lived to tell the story, so I can't say it was a complete write-off. <br /> <br /> 4/10 "Sometimes watchable, when-something-other-on-on" type of film.
