I had the privilege of seeing this powerful game in Broadway with Kathy Bates in the lead. In the 1970s and 1990s I saw only one other game that had a game like emotional effect. I was really expecting the game to be made into a movie, but I was very disappointed when I found out that Kathy Bates did not play his role in his film - he was not well known at Broadway at that time and the producers had to want the star power I think and most of it instead of Sissy Spacek. Sissy did enough work in leadership, but did not think of Kathy Bates in any way. I love Anne Bancroft, but she seemed too young for that role. The movie was right for the game. Anyone who ever thinks of suicide should watch this movie to understand the destruction of those who are behind.
