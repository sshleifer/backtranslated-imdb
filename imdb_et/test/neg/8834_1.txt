This proves how awful the WB network has been in recent years. As a home educator, of course, I deplore the demonstration of this ridiculous, fantasy land, hidden and uncomfortable stereotypes that children are "strange hippies that are so smart that they alienate from super cool high school students". Sorry TV writers, the world that is being seen inside your ass (which includes your head seemingly when you wrote this exhibition) is not the world we see as talented people when we live in a small thing called reality. For those who really liked this exhibition, please, dear Jesus, PLEASE PLEASE think again about the statement that you like this crap for a very long walk. The exhibition is even more hollow, fake and wood than the stereotypes that the whole exhibition was built on. Thank you to WB for doing the right thing and putting this horse out of strain from start to finish. This exhibition should never have been a privilege, no less than eight terrible episodes. I really hope that these actors finally came up with a clue and finished such role-playing roles as soon as this show ended.
