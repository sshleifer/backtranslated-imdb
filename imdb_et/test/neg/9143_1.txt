If any movie that has ever been made of Italians seems bad, that's it. <br /> <br /> Duke Mitchell - A-HOLE. Duke Mitchell, I'm in your grave. Seeing that virtually every person coward Mimi has shot this film is either a black or some other racial or ethnic minority, it is hard not to be convinced that the boy owes ultimately to Ku Klux Clan or skinheads. Awww, but he doesn't shoot a small black boy in the opening order of the elevator, so it means he can't all be bad, right? ERROR. A typical sentimental sentimental fear. <br /> <br /> Although I understand why some people may be able to catch and even to some extent admire the brave, completely un-PC verve of the film (this is definitely his own lack of reluctance) and a feeling of self-esteem), it does not change the fact that the main character Mimi (and more generally Duke Mitchell) is a thoroughly reluctant person who earns no empathy or interest, especially considering that Duke Mitchell is the performer of such a FULL BORE. But what do you expect from a boy whose main claim against celebrity (besides movie dog t) was Dean Martin's second level imitator?
