Like someone who has read all Baroness Orczy's books and seen most of the films on them, I have to say that the 1980 version was better with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour. It was better written and left more to the mind than what seemed to be going out to involve people to shoot. This new adaptation is less delightful, but it is not so deep. Although there are good deeds, the participants did not have much work to do. Nice costume.
