Take the Agility Agent / James Bond's Sixties Madness, mix some of the concepts of Sax Rohmer's feminine Fu Manchu femme fatale and mix some of the more absurd twisted revisionist Franco - you have a man-hating lesbian Sumuru or "7 secret ..." better than a "Rio girl", recalling "this man from Rio" that has nothing to do with it. Yes, it is in Brazil, we have to give it. Sumuru or Sumitra, as he mentioned, is like the "Modesty Blaise" version of the evil that actor Eaton played with this familiar coy smile, which most of us first introduced in "Goldfinger". Looking at his camera, there are many close-ups, slowly opening his mouth, apparently looking at something unpleasant (but he has doubled in his main lesbian scene). He controls the entire army of female soldiers, a colorful costume, and leads the city of Femina or something (just in Rio de Janeiro?). These concepts, which previously appeared in the "Sumy's Eye," sounded terrible, but despite some intriguing designs and visuals, it follows the same ventricular atmosphere, such as the very dated "Some Girls Do", which came at the same time and which also contained female armies. At first glance, all those armed women who line up in a row are interested in sight, but after 15 minutes you realize that there's nothing more than just setting up a visual task. /> The plot follows what seems to be a secret agent, a man who arrives in Brazil for $ 10 million. He is catching the attention of a local criminal (Sanders, who is an elderly Bond-type villain), who sends him dark suit-throats. It puts everything into a three-step conflict between an agent, a criminal, and a mysterious Sumuru (the criminal master wants the secrets of Sumur). Sumuru also holds various prisoners in glass drills - maybe it's one of the secrets. It sounds exciting, but there are problems that go beyond a slow pace; there are many shots that could have used a lot of effort: for example, there will be one shot on an incoming plane when it stops almost as if it hadn't been captured before the movie. A similar approach is a typical sunset, as if it were unusual. Fighting scenes are very inferior, as the filmmakers should have used the first. There is a real Rio carnival about one and a half times to add the production value. I think there were a number of budget problems, especially in the fight against climate, where counterfeit sound effects and smoke cover a lot of counterfeit activities, such as the lack of real-looking weapons - it reminds those times when children use plastic weapons and pretend that the bullets are fired convincingly. There are sadistic touches, such as torture of character to get answers, and female nudity, such an early depiction after some restrictions have been lifted. But mostly rolls eyes.
