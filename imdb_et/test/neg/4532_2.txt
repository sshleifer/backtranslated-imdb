It is a poorly written and poorly directed short film, clean and simple. What is interesting and keeping me in mind to some extent was the value of production. Seeing a video appears in a bad script and in a bad direction, it would have a terrible value for production. This is what the viewer is waiting for when they watch a movie that is horrible and video-recorded. But not in that case, they spent the money and it shows. It keeps me very interesting to see what's next, just to see! <br /> <br /> Probably the worst short film I saw, which saw a big budget for Hollywood, though it was filmed in some form of video format. <br /> <br /> Instead of spending the amount of money they had to spend on a rather impressive design, it would have been more beautiful to see a better-made story with a good direction. But then again, how can we expect the new filmmakers to be able to do it even when Hollywood can't.
