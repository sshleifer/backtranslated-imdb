CAUTION SPOILER: At the end of the movie, it is reported that the bridge fell a few days after shooting. The impression is that the attack was anything. In fact, taking Remagen's bridge was the last major victory of the Western Allies. The Allies had been trying to reach six months on crossing the Rhine. As the Remagen bridge was taken, the war ended in just a few weeks. <br /> <br /> The bridge must last only one day after it has been taken. It was enough time for the Americans to send combat engineers and a great defense force to the other side, and then they could start building pontoon bridges. Taking the bridge was a complete success and meant that the end of the war was near and did not last in the summer. Contrary to the cynical nature of the film, the victory was declared by the troops who did it. They knew how important this battle was. <br /> <br /> This movie is not really related to real history. Rather, it reflected the cynical nature of this production.
