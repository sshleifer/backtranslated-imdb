It's terrible. Not really, it's, no, the absolute worst ... the worst ... I hesitate to even call it @ & $% '_movie_. This is the ninety minute visual root channel. The plot is practically non-existent: a crazy scientist who looks like the front panel of "The Cars" impregnates a woman in her secret lab, under the lawn, which I think it might be a garage, injecting Palmolive. After a few hours, she is born with an adult monster who then robs. It's the whole movie. Death scenes: they are badly set, take _forever_ and work ... how can you confuse _screaming_ ?? Victims stand there, while crumbling, wheezing, overwhelmed freak promotes them and continues to delineate them for about 3 days. Sets are cheesy, most of the film's lighting is made up of one magite (yes, a big incandescent lamp), the sound quality is bad, there's only about 40 words about the movie and the show. of wood. To reuse the film, the film material is re-used shamelessly. And the special effects would make every BBC sci-fi production shake its head and proclaim "They didn't even try". "The Monster" is somewhat unnamed in a $ 3 halloween rubber mask with some ties. In his meeting with the film lonely policeman, fire fire, smokeless, invisible bullets, apparently traveling so slowly that the monster can prevent them at five speeds. Don't look at this movie. Not really, it's not bold. Don't look at this movie. The director should be let. The writer must be linked to a giant stone where Ed Wood eats his liver every morning. Enough rentals and there may be a sequel, don't let it happen!
