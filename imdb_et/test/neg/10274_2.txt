We found this movie almost impossible to watch. With such a superpower, it is a shame that writing and direction were so terrible. The exciting pace at which the story was spoken was crazy. The flashes were clumsy. The characters were one-dimensional. Heavy-handed metaphors - the river, the cat - were repeated too often. <br /> <br /> A movie that no one is stupid is based on another Russo novel, was endlessly better, probably because it was more written and directed. <br /> <br /> The Empire Falls Photography was lovely. Too bad it was not a travel letter. <br /> <br /> I read a novel and enjoyed writing style, but I had some news myself. I'd give the novel 5 out of 5. Perhaps the reputation of the novel is that they felt the script writers and directors feel that they had to include every scam in their films. It was supposed to be a television movie, boys, not tape books.
