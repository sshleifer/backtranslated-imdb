Like many movies that contain small children, it starts with "really cute" and pleasing ... and then, in about half an hour, it will be reversed. <br /> <br /> This is definitely so here the storyline (which I usually love), where an adult meets a child who really is him at the age of eight! A great prerequisite and great actor for Bruce Willis, but ..... <br /> <br /> "Rusty" is smart and tiny and Willis Rusty, who has now grown up as "Russell". his constant shouting. Is this entertainment? Well, thanks. <br /> <br /> Young Breslin has become a very good child artist by participating in several films, including The Cat In The Hat, the most famous child's actor: Dakota Fanning. In general, a disappointing film, especially in the case of this good movie, has been released.
