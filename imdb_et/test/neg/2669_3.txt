Usually I wouldn't bother to comment on a horror movie sequel because it is usually assumed that they are BAD, and if you look at them with healthy disrespect, they can be very fun and enjoyable to quarrel / laugh. But with the current Halloween saga, this chapter reached almost everything the original one was. In the first film, dr. In Loom (very accurately that I could add), Michael Myers was evil and it is trying to explain why (I could add this bad job). I think he was much worse than he was just a hungry freak of blood. The whole goth / cult thing was an unnecessary and desperate attempt to throw a new curve into the Halloween equation. The result was a boring, predictable film that was not funny or funny.
