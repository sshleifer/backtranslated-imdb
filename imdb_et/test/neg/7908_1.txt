I don't want to comment on something that I didn't finish, but if I were for one person I sat for almost an hour before it turned off in disgust, it's worth it. <br /> <br /> I decided to look at it openly, knowing it was in the 100's. <br /> <br /> A bad idea. I usually love raw humor or at least I can tolerate it. I love so-called "black" comedy. I'm also not easily offended. <br /> <br /> It started well and went down quickly. I laughed a few times (for example, when the main character stuck in the airplane toilet), but that was the case and it didn't compensate for the strong nonsense I felt. <br /> <br /> I didn't laugh when the dog sucked into the engine. I usually don't see humor in animals that die (except for the animal house). I didn't laugh elsewhere on the stud. I turned it off after a blind and baked potato incident that I don't care to repeat, just because the wave of nausea is still not over me. Simply put, it was filled with smell and just not funny with just about any plot. This is once, if you have nothing to say, you should take this word out. <br /> <br /> Don't tell me I didn't warn you.
