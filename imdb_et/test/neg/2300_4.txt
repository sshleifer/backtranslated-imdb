The murder of the Red Comedian at the Greyfriars Monastery was far from one of the most terrible things ever done in the Scottish War of Independence, and the struggles (and killing) in the churches were not at all unusual. Not so much later, Robert Bruces's wife, daughter, two of her sisters, were caught in a fight in a church where people were killed. And if you compare it to the Berwick massacre, where at least 8,000 non-fighters were killed in English (some, yes, in churches), it's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> That means it's not a well-made movie. This is a little antidote to absolutely RIDICULOUS for Braveheart's Robert Bruce. No matter what Bruce was, it wasn't a mistake. <br /> <br /> Too bad they didn't do a better job, because someone should make a really good movie about war that is so amazing that it sounds like something someone made from completing Methven's battle to a secret return to Hide Bannockburn for a long guerrilla ride. It's not. Poorly done and largely poorly written and acted. Damage!
