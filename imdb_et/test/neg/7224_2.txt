The only quality of redemption of this movie is that it shows bands and their music when it changed during NY in '81. As for the film, it has at least three major drawbacks. First, the whole film is narrative, which is not necessary at all. In a few places where clarification is needed, little addition of dialogue would have come a long way. Secondly, there was no obvious attempt to sync any sound, but it is quite obvious that most of the dialogue was recorded later without trying to match the movie. The third error was the end. I do not end the brave souls who suffer from the torture of a movie session, but it puts the cardinal sin in the scenario. It is not worth the money or time it takes to watch it if you are not a fan of one of the represented bands.
