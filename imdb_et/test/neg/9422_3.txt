Solo is an action movie about the Terminator-like android, designed and trained for the military. If an error is detected, it is released to the programmer. Instead of dying, he seems to be escaping into the Central American jungle, where he hides in the village. The army drives him there, taking a great party. Mario Van Peebles performs android well. His movements and gestures see the work mechanically enough. The real scientific realism is abandoned to make a good-performing hero. And it works; The action scenes are not so spectacular, but they are not too bad either. Addressing other characters is pretty bad, but I didn't expect anything too good. Special effects were also decent. <br /> <br /> Solo is decent, but very forgotten. There is no substance that most movies have. But if you just want a few hours without much thought, then this work is done.
