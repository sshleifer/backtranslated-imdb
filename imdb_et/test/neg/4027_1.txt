That's what I and my friends asked each other during this flick. We couldn't believe how stupid it was! I think someone shot it on your camcorder at home and shot this movie store and put it on the shelf to see if anyone ever took it. Well, I think the joke is for us. <br /> <br /> I think I should have come to this website and read all the reviews he has received, everyone says this movie is HORRIBLE, STUPID, and on and on. And the boy is right! Though it made some pretty good laugh (I and my friends were pretty drunk) because it's so stupid. We just can't believe someone was stupid enough to make such a ugly movie! I swear that it had to be done in the 1970s before they had a good movie for movies and things, because every scene looks really outrageous, but when I looked at it, said it was done in 2001? What? Surely it doesn't look like a movie made today, but I think that's what you get when you use your camcorder and take home videos with strobe lights and truly counterfeit lasers, and instead use the real people of your home city as participants or even aspirants BTW - some of these chicks (or they had dragged the queens, we couldn't say!) They were so cunning, even my drunk horny college buddies didn't touch them with a 50-foot pole. <br /> <br /> So there is no appeal to this film at all, with a bad example, poor writing, bad control, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. Don't waste your time or money on it, you're totally disappointed!
