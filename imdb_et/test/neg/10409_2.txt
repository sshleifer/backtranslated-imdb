It's a slippery little movie that's worth your time to find and see. <br /> <br /> It's really about all the everyday choices that we all do every day and, like HG Welles' story, which I can't really remember, can live back on request. <br /> <br /> Remember that this is short (very short). It starts slowly, but just as you think it is boring = bang = it's over. Believe me, the "break line" is what you remember. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if manufacturers make it available for purchase or available on the web, but are you happy to take the time to keep a copy - I'm sure.
