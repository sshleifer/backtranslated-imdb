Spoiler with plot explanation: poor families are thrown into the midst of war between an evil boy (who pops up somewhere and doesn't ask questions) that went to Wacko and Casper's friendly ghost who tried to get his death. Every film with a frame becomes more predictable, a big disappointment. Finally, the stitches are completely stupid, he has nothing to film himself, I think someone runs out of ideas or just reach the point that the film is ** t this way, so it can also be a stupid end. Waste of time, resources and money. The actress game is very bad. If you think dialogues, you can find out that family conflict comes into force artificially between bad characters. Some scenes are stitching randomly. In summary: boring, predictable, bad, pathetic. Waste of time and money.
