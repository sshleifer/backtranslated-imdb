Imagine the exploiting remake of the Defiant Ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other. Set a story on some of the Caribbean islands where drug dealers dominate and the revolution has arrived. And if the black woman has to be Huggy Bear's women and the white woman is put on Patty Hearst and you have a black mama, a white mother. <br /> <br /> On these descending days the theater must be a big old hit. All the hot buttons of the seventies are pushed into it. Although they both wear their clothes better and get some whistles from the audience, nobody ever lied to Pam Grier and Margaret Markov for Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis. Well, Halle Berry and Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> Margaret and Pam are prisoners where the guards and the guard are looking for new fish. Margaret is a rich girl from a country that took the "revolution", while Pam is your main high-priced call girl who has served local drug leaders and grown tired and tried to leave the island. <br /> <br /> The revolutionaries of Margaret's colleagues are attacking a bus that transports these female prisoners to the city, but they disappear from escape. Both have their own action plans, but like Sid and Tony, they can't really agree on who's on the agenda first. It makes interesting times like police, drug dealers and revolutionaries looking for these two inadequate chains. <br /> <br /> So you don't get the wrong ideas for revolutionary leaders, and Markov's Kanoodling partner's name is Ernesto, played by Filipino actress Zaldy Zshornack. All the confusion was fired at Phillipines, who started their film industry. <br /> <br /> A nice location for photography at Phillipines is what Black Mama, White Mam has to recommend. But if you're really a fan of bad black exploitation, it's one for you.
