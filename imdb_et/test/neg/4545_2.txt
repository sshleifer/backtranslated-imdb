As expected, there is a pretty good reason why this film is so hidden and unknown, despite the fact that zombies are always popular and starred in the 80's Queen Linda Blair, namely: sucks! "Cooling" is trying tremendously hard? too hard? be a story with a deep and factual background, while it should have been a light and gore-packed horror blow for cold zombies. It takes an incredibly long time before something far from interesting or important. There are a lot of slags that I learned in my physics class about cryogenetics, studying products and their behavior at extremely low temperatures. So, of course, in this film the behavior of human bodies is deeply frozen. Needless to say, it is very boring, until two dim night watchers decide during a power outage that it's a good idea to put metal-built cool cells at thunderstorms. Coolers are probably hit by relief and the bodies melt themselves and come alive to go to the murder of a zombie rampage. "The Chilling" is a boring and surprising (at the end of the 80s, at least) a gore-free horror film that doesn't even use a quarter of its potential. All the painful attempts to build up the atmosphere and the atmosphere of the idolatry are not huge and I don't think for some reason why the zombie attacks had to be so beaten. Even with a low budget, they could have done better. Sets, makeup effects and costumes are merciful. The research lab looks like a flat flat, while the zombies did not look less dangerous with their green faces and foil-packed equipment. How Linda Blair was once again able to get involved in this embarrassing low-budget fears, is a complete secret. He's tempting to B-films like bees.
