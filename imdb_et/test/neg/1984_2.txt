This movie is sometimes referred to as "O-Pt.2 Story", which tries to exclude (varieties) after the French erotic S&M thriller "The Of Of O".

I think the "O" angle comes from the random S&M overtones (which were never as explicit (and unpleasant to watch) as "Mistress."

About 1975 In the year, the producers had to scrape the bottom, trying the adult cinema maven, not to mention the foreign / Art Cinema, so the film's visitors had to fight with the dreck like "The Last Woman" and others like it.
