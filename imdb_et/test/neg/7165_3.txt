I liked some characters, but our leader relied too much on a charming smile. I didn't care about two whips. He makes bad choices, and I really don't care that he didn't seem to. He seemed quite unpleasant. There were a couple of moments that made it possible for some human understanding (the view was interesting), but they disappear in the overall poorness of the film. The interest of love was acceptable and the other different characters were somewhat interesting, but the plot slopes too much and left me in many movie spots. Finally, I wondered why I stayed so long. <br /> <br /> It is somewhat humorous moments, but eventually I didn't care. I can't judge the film higher. - 3 out of 10
