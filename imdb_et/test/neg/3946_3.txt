In my opinion, this film was not very good. Although this is not the eleventh plenary (fortunately I did not have to pay for it), it was not very scary. There were parts where I jumped and some minimally violent / gory scenes, but generally only anyone easily frightened would consider this movie scary. <br /> <br /> The general writing and acting were very weak. The characters did not develop or grow as humans. Even at the end, there was no leading man, regardless of his name, a man and had to save the fire in the last minute. The plot also had contradictions. The killed police officer was not killed in the same way as he died in the game. The girl said in October that you had to read something from the right text to kill the demonic theme. Funny how they never bothered and were still able to escape. Malcolm-in-the-Middle died in the game but did not die in "real life." The game itself was also very weak. It would have been just a brother's death just to play them again. But you should play a video game and stay alive and 3 people die before you play again ... why do you even need a game? If you like movies like Ring and the thing that is scary and fun, check out this movie. If you know someone like that, you can laugh at it, do it. If you like "horror" movies that make you laugh out loud and have the chance to watch this movie for free, do it. Otherwise, stay far.
