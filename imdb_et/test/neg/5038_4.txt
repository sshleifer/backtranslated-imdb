The Great Rock N Roll Swindle is not only inaccurate, but when it comes down, it's not much interesting or even fun. Malcolm McLaren apparently destroyed most of the income from Sex Pistols from this film waste, making it much more unpleasant. The goal was to create a monument to McLaren's "genius" from the very beginning, which still takes full credit to create punk music by creating Sex Pistols and sometimes even writing all the songs. Viewers follow McLaren in different settings where he talks his story to his sidekick, the female dwarf, and just takes one thing after another. One particularly irritating scene is McLaren's abandoned aircraft hangar, waiting for an airplane that journalists are hounded and giving them a "big story". But the most fun elements of the film are animated short pieces, even those of McLaren's overwhelming self-importance. <br /> <br /> Even if farce, this movie doesn't work. Little of this is fun, except for Steve Jones, a surprisingly pseudo-detective type person. Twenty years later, Julien Temple, who wrote and directed this film, also directed the documentary "Filth and the Fury" by Sex Pistols. Although this film is much better and more interesting than "Swindle", it is still full of the "artistic prosperity" of the temple, which just doesn't work like an interview with band members in the shade, as if they were some kind of criminal trying to hide their identity. Interesting little trivia: film critic Roger Ebert was one of the original screenwriter films "Who Killed Bambi?" For what finally became "Swindle".
