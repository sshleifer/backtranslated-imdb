At least that's the episode. Here is a time traveler, a professor at Gilligan Island, not less, going back to 1865. There are no really interesting variants of this old theme. As another reviewer has said, this episode is particularly unpleasant and insecure, with little to say that the "professor" really is in the 1860s. Budget constraints are easily visible and the direction is strong. John Wilkes Booth adds a spark, but it remains very flat to produce. We all too often feel we're on stage waiting for something smart. Finally, there is a small turn, but I emphasize the minor.
