As a child, this film scared the green. As an adult, I couldn't stop laughing. <br /> <br /> I haven't been happy to watch this movie through MST3K. Instead, I got it at the end of Saturday afternoon when there was nothing in theaters and there was nothing to do outside, but some autumn leaves were left. I thought it was better. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The film has some very good elements; water-sharing mystic, beatnik-painter, couple idiots, handbags, buffer for the elderly, and "bad wind". I mean ... the bad head. An evil head, which as soon as the systematic hypnotism of every presence is complete, looks for its evil body. <br /> <br /> The whole story goes on the evil "ranch" that apparently is not growing on crops, does not cause evil cattle. <br /> <br /> Because everything is said to be "evil" by the mystics of their residents, do you roll your eyes terribly or laugh at your sides, depending on your mood. Me? I laughed until the tears flowed under my face. But some kids are afraid of Santa ... not? Anyway ... if you're in the 50's horror camp, it's definitely a movie you shouldn't miss. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good story, this movie has it. It's a drama over time and a fair innocence of the time that makes it so terrible. The action was just BAD, but he still had some good elements. Maybe it will reassess ...? <br /> <br /> It's 4.3 / 10 since ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
