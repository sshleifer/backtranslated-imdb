<br /> <br /> Summary: Not a movie worth <br /> <br /> Like a wind viewer, I was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had missed many important characters. Fortunately, the film itself was great. When the book Scarlett came out, I read it in the hope that I would be able to move on with my favorite book on my two trips. Although the book lacks real quality, it is a good story, and as long as I was able to separate it from the original, it was still enjoyable. But I think the six hours I spent watching "Scarlett" mini-mines are the worst hours of my life. With the discrediting of original features that were so well designed in Margaret Mitchell's book, this series also changed the story of rape, mistrust, murder, and misguided relationships that even the Scarlett book left behind. The choice of many characters refused to explore the well-developed qualities of both the original novel and the film, and even through the second book, and again leaves at least one incredibly significant character. In the novel, Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows his alienated husband Rhett Butler to Charleston by visiting an extended family. After getting "agreed" with Rhett, he agrees to leave and rejoin his O'Hara relatives in Savannah. Finally, he sends his relative Colum, who is the passionate leader of Fenian Brotherhood to Ireland, to explore the "deep depths" of his family and is finally called "O'Hara", the leader of the family. Although his duties at O'Harana keep him in his Ballyhara city, Scarlett begins his business in the world of English landlords and instantly becomes a visitor to many of his parties. He has been scaring Rhett again and again and finally agrees to marry Luke, Fenton's ear, until Rhett comes with a clich√© "night white horse" - a rescue type. The "Scarlett" minicomputers can't even do that justice. The scary team and scared by his family shows that Scarlett has been thrown into jail after being accused of murdering his cousin. <br /> <br /> I heartily recommend someone who is considering spending his day looking at this decision to reconsider this decision. <br /> <br />
