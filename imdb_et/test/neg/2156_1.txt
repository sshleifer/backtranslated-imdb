I love a good Western movie, but it was rather a stage on stage or a local street carnival show. I can only count on it for 38 minutes to hope it will improve, but it only worsened and I had to stop it. Each participant (s) marked the lines as reading scripts or smart cards directly. There was too much predictability for lines and activities, not as if it were a natural occurrence or a conversation. Rachel Kimsey's wig was obvious. Native American sister playing actors could have played non-local parts and they should have. The Nordic American wardrobe could have been better and a bit more authentic. If I decide to look at it with my friends in the future, I'll do it not with expectations to look good in the West, but look forward to producing an amateur comedy movie.
