Ocean Twelve: Just stupid, bad and nothing compared to two others. <br /> <br /> Robbery of Art. At least 10 well-known participants. Weak script and very slow development idea. That's why I characterize a movie that I only saw for 20 minutes. Don't get me wrong, you might like it. But I like the movies of the ocean because of the theme of Heist. If this is not the ocean of the 12, what is the point of seeing it? Glad Soderberg saw his main mistake and redeemed himself making the film much better than the first. Tissue for that. <br /> <br /> Steven Soderberg is not really a good director. In addition to his hit "Sex Birds and Video Tapes", nothing happened to this director's career. Shame on her. But his mistake.
