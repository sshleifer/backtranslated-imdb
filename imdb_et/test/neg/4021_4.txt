I've seen about half a dozen low-budget poverty line B westerns, which Ken Maynard did in the 1930s, and I'm consistently surprised when his actor is poor. How did he ever become a leading cowboy actress? They say he can go back very well in quiet rides, but he doesn't make them particularly impressive in these sound films. However, maybe he got the wires because he was big and could drive. <br /> <br /> Phantom Rancher is not as bad as some other Ken Maynard movies I've seen, but it's not much. Some other characters refer to him a couple of times as "young fella", where it seems to me that he is as old as the other older actors. <br /> <br /> And if it's not stupid enough, this movie has a pretty significant script problem. At one point, one character makes a note of how phantom had prevented the pit from being poisoned, something that hadn't happened yet. Just a few minutes later, we see this particular scene. No, it wasn't a setback. First of all, I thought that when Treeline Films made a DVD broadcast, they could reverse the two rolls. However, these days the film rolls contained about 11 minutes of film and the entire reverse took only 3 or 4 minutes. Everything else was in a logical order. So it seems like this was a real consistency problem in the original movie. Perhaps this is why colonial pictures did not last long.
