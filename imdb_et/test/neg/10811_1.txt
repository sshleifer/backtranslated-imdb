That was how I was when I walked (alternated) from this "movie". I couldn't leave because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people. I was in the middle. Trapped. <br /> <br /> The tiny fragment of the original material that attempted to tie the movie contains some of the worst things ever to give the screen grace. The daughter was an eye-catching performance - in the bad sense. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was scary, consisting of scattered framing and some of the most obvious illumination I've seen. <br /> <br /> What's about the film footage ... well at first ... <br /> <br /> Wait. <br /> <br /> Why am I watching this movie? Why do I recognize its existence? Please, don't look at it. Do something useful within two hours of your life and see how the color is dry.
