Lucille Ball was a powerful force in television in the 1950s and 1960s, but he still made a casual film, especially LONG, LONG TRAILER and LIFE FACTS. Although his television career remained strong, as the 1970s began to fall into his film career, Ball decided he had one last big screen, and his chosen project was the 1966 MAME music. <br /> <br /> In many respects, the role seemed to be customized: a popular novel that highlighted two different Broadway plays, Mame Dennis is a funny, wildly unhindered woman who "inhibits" her orphaned nephew Patrick - and leads her to a life opportunity , bumping into one comic competition. Jerry Herman's best work was music that contained songs like "Open a New Window" and "When He Walked in My Life Today". Best of all were the best support that included Robert Preston and Bea Arthur. Expectations were high; opening the evening was great; the film was a disaster. The critics were dirty and the audience sat quietly on the jaws. <br /> <br /> Whatever hardcore Lucy fans can say, MAME is a fiasco so it's hard to know where to start. It is poorly targeted, poorly filmed, poorly performed, and there is Lucille Ball all in the middle of those who can't dance, can't sing and smile like a dummy dummy, while incredibly bad choreography around. However, the disaster is hardly alone; Supporting fares are no better. Bea Arthur and Jane Connell create the roles of Vera Charles and Agnes Goochi; the first is gradual, the latter is depressing. Robert Preston manages to sing with a smile, but he is quite independent and obviously very happy about it. <br /> <br /> DVDs bring the movie from the VHS pan-and-scan version to the widescreen, but that only means you have more horror. Everyone loves Lucy, but only the most critical fan could love Lucy MAME; although I wouldn't say it is bad enough to want your eyes to go out, you might want to. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
