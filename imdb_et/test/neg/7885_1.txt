This is one of the rare movies that I didn't discuss right after watching my friends. It wasn't because it had attracted me or impressed me. On the contrary, it did not give me anything. <br /> <br /> Why? Because there was so much that I couldn't take that movie any more seriously. There was so much sex and violence that I had the strong impression that the movie was trying very, very hard to be offensive, as if it was aimed at English superstitions, instead of talking about a convincing story of two women caught in the spiral Baise-moi me described as "Thelma & Louise's Real Sex". Well, it is true that the main idea is similar. There are two women in the country because they have committed crimes and know that their lives are now over, that the police are trying to get them, and they decide that now that everything is over, there is no way to hold back. <br /> <br /> Baise-moi was described as a feminist film in which women, who had been dominated by a man in the past, were exactly a revenge against the men they met. <br /> <br /> This is something I've never interpreted in this movie, just because none of these women had ever been innocent, and because they don't just kill irresponsible, violent men, but also the men they lure, men who show they want to make a protected sex. And they kill women. No, they are in no way better than the signs they face and the murders are outraged in cruel ways. <br /> <br /> How easily "heroes" decide to assassinate and how much joy they do, it makes me absolutely impossible to communicate with them in any way or even take them seriously. It was just too much. Too much sex, too much violence. I had the feeling that sex and violence were just there to create a surprise in English, not to tell the story or to score points. <br /> <br /> Baise-moi gave me the impression I didn't have I think of me because it was so far from every real world. Both built, unrealistic and up. <br /> <br /> Nothing could make this movie, nothing to think about except "Why did they make this terrible movie?" If there was intense discomfort in this film, I was just for that purpose. But since I didn't find anything because the story of the movie seemed to be not just an excuse to squeeze as much and as ugly sex as possible into one movie, I put it under "unnecessary torture", I decided, EVER, watch this movie again and I have to now it's the worst movie I've ever seen. Worst, not only because I really don't have a cup of tea to watch people rape, rape, sexualise and kill each other ... but because whatever it was, the makers wanted to tell the world their movie ... if they were would like to say anything ... it just doesn't work. And something else that could save this movie because it's also filmed in such a ugly style.
