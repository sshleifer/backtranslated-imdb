Anyone who writes that this is a good child may have worked on it or put money into an attempt at this pious college. It was delightful, slow and painful to look at. The duration of only about 84 minutes seemed to be three and a half hours. The only person who accuses is the director who knows nothing about how to control the scene, where to place the camera! 95% of this terrible movie was shot with a long master shot. Two or three people in the frame are talking or screaming forever (or forever), no close-ups! No medium shots !!. There are two so-called fighting scenes that every brain maker would have shot at their close-ups or middle shoots. They saw great amateurs. Scenes where the father and son scream at each other would have worked better if the father or just the son was acting or reacting. Tri-C must be very moral to show anywhere. I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time when some of them are fun because they're so bad, it's not one of them.
