Vicente Aranda has made a terrible historical film. It shows the bad resources of Spanish cinema. In the film, the unrealistic script Juana, like the ninfomann, standing in front of Felipe, is concerned about sex only ... but having sex with other people not with her. The technical flaws begin with a wedding ring that shows that Castilla-Isabel has not noticed it? Then the voice that is turned off in the documentary, the actors and the actress's film sometimes laughs to look at the queue when Juana arrives at the council that wants to keep her isolation; Castles are almost broken when they are newly built at the age of the film, the crowds are just "four" people, the lights are bad ... Compared to Amelie Poulain, a French film for the Oscar ... she has no point in talking about a bad movie like Juana la loca.
