I watched this as a vampire marathon with a research intention, otherwise I wouldn't have looked at it all the time. The first scene where a bunch of vampires on very bad wagons appears to be electronically bursting by various slow-moving weapons that are used even by slower-moving Van Helsing wannabe ... black-and-white ... over the rest of the film. The fighting scenes seem ridiculous, the dialouge would be funny if the actor was not so bad, which schemes are not meaningful and the product values ​​bite (from the Spike's coat that the hero carries by the hero) to cheesy cheap magician corners around their leading vampire). <br /> <br /> I've seen some bad movies (see the Magic Sword with B. Rathbone or Raven with a very young Jack N.), but it gets my voice from the worst time.
