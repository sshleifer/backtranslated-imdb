People who have a movie from the second coming and from the third will have the right to assume that they had read the other two, or at least knew them a little more than miracles and the day of judgment. This film is absolutely irrelevant to viewers who are interested in Jesus, religion, or philosophy - there is only the usual British social realism, where there are traps and murky characters in pubs. <br /> <br /> In fact, the good candidates for the true Third Testament are published many times - such as "Miracle Factor" or "Conversations with God". They all have thought-provoking Christian faith and theology and angles. <br /> <br /> The most interesting information The IMDb rating is not the number of stars, but the number of people who are bothered to vote. In just four years, only 387 people have voted on this film. As usual, enthusiasts are the most eager. For comparison, see "Jesus Christ, superstar" - the original version since 1973.
