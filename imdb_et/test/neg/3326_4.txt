I thought this movie was too absurd for me. The premise was too silly and predictable. I didn't make that movie far. <br /> <br /> Let me see. She's probably older than the cabbie (unless she's a lot younger than she looks). She's black and she's white. He makes more money than he does (he's just a cabbie). It is three of the most statistically failed societies in society that are all structured with each other and we should pretend they have the opportunity in hell. She would be married to a husband she didn't love. His actions were great. He, meh! It was OK, but the assumption is too silly. Didn't see the end. Couldn't do that, so I don't know if it ended differently than I predicted the end would be. I can't imagine any black woman who likes this movie. There is something sick when you look at a black man who feeds such a white woman. And the old one. PLEASE! Not in the real world!
