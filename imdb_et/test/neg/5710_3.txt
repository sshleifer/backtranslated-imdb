The only reason I bought a DVD was to satisfy my curiosity as Liz (Kim Basinger) strips for Joe Cocker's music. It was the best part of the whole movie. Not because the scene was good; just a song. I'm not saying it was a terribly bad film, not just that good. Disappointingly so! <br /> <br /> Especially if you could have widened the study of male and female sexuality. Instead of expanding to the dangerous side of lust, obsession, and torture, and where it can lead, it brings concerts from one idea to another. For example, when John (played by Rourke) is able to leave him on a big wheel, Liz (Kim Basinger) is a convincingly overwhelmed experience of John's sense of humor, but less struck by his sexual exploitation associated with ready Liz; and, as one of the readers mentioned, that a woman has sexual pleasure, she must experience a dangerous side that is not convincing. This "dangerous" side of the movie is not used enough and the person knows the way of thinking that it can all go horribly wrong. The theme of the prison career is often an appearance, but only one takes the threat to the edge and then everything goes well. Does the film send a message that such a "foreplay" is FINE! If the film gave rise to a slogan of slavery and expansion of slavery, the sad consequences of sad Masochism, perhaps it would be a good moral point. Instead, the film jumps uncomfortably from Rourke's "sizzling" scene that feeds Basinger and puts him against another. In a movie that might have been good, it falls on the face because it does not expand or expand the topics that film MAYBE tries to associate; so for me this is not a mixture of a plot or a theme but a mixture of ideas.
