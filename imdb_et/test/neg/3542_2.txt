It's terrible even for a TV movie. I can't believe that it took three people to write this movie. I do not know this novel, which is the basis of the film, but it must be better than it. I'd rather look at the "Full House" marathon than this stupid movie. I gave him two of the 10 stars only because the ads were better.
