Predictable, gory, overpriced, mediocre. Don't waste your time - there are many much better movies. <br /> <br /> Resurrection begins with OK, but the graph quickly becomes repetitive. My level of interest dropped steadily. At the end of the movie I was just glad it was finally over. The characters are never fully developed. Cinematography is muddy and the POV turning of rapid change - though perhaps impressive in 1999. Movie shooting tricks serve some purpose (delivering tension and anxiety), but are constantly overestimated and ultimately harmful. A general shame - obviously the film / story potential and the producers / leaders and actors are probably technical skills. Disappointment.
