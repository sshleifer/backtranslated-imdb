As bad as this movie is, I like it. Poor action, dialogue and action made it so funny. I loved John Travis from Omega Cop and stayed overnight to find out how the death cars at the airport, if they couldn't speak, were likely to shake up on security issues. In fact, why can't they talk ?? It doesn't follow any kind of film making convention that makes it strange - just a lot of people who are killed around a loose plot that surrounds hired killers - not "machines" as such, and these weird face / mountain things are covered and the trailer doesn't appear! I love not having a good boy in this movie, but about one and a half times, and I love countless meaningless scenes from landing this plane - a lot of people are killed who have nothing to do with a "plot" and no explanation is given - DO NOT wait to understand this movie. Instead, admire how the main good boy can't even handle an occasional old boy - who's been presented as a bad boy, but is against Barman's decision to hire a barely clad woman to dance badly in the "entertainment" corner - All good guys seem to enjoy it ! Why did the old man beat his hero and why did he randomly decide to help the old guy fight ?! Why did a hero fall from an old man to a bar at the time of aging, where the jet of water flowing in the background, so it looks like it's in his mouth? Definitely the top 20 B-Movie, must check section 2.
