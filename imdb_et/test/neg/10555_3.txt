This is a commonly used line, but it summarizes this movie ... "If it's the current state of gay cinema, we're in real trouble". I saw this movie in SIFF because of a high IMDb rating (7.6), and if IMDb has ever had a voice control case, that's it. Just look at the fall of the number until weeks of movie release. <br /> <br /> Simple plot ... The boy discovers his high school ex (boy) marries a female friend so he goes back to his old hometown (still a 10-year-old flashlight) to see what happened. <br /> <br /> First of all, I liked the last day, which is the director's last feature, despite his cookie sign and plot contraction, but you should become a better leader for each subsequent release. I don't know how you get so much of the terrible support of TV veterans (Robert Foxworth, Joanna Cassidy, Tori Spelling), but he somehow succeeded. Writing was the quality of a lifetime network (return when they were really bad) and the situations were incredible and uncomfortable to look at. I tried to go a long way to move on, but finally I ended up hoping for a decent ending. Ugh ... no. Even the nakedness of the free spouse, opened during the film, was so brutally free that it seemed to exist to keep people in their seats. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the two leading positions, especially irresponsible nude scenes, were excellent. When their friendship was restored, there was real sweetness between them as they discovered how they left. And the film showed great ... good quality and color saturation for an independent film. <br /> <br /> How is it that network TV can provide great weekly fun weekly episodes (such as "Ugly Betty", "Desp. Housewives", etc.), but so many similar genres can be as bad as it?
