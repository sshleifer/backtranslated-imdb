If we all have more, there are a lot of reality TV shows with people who for some reason are foolish, too fat, or can't sing or cheer worth the damn value when I know Hollywood's original ideas have run out. I can't remember the time when something original or intelligent appeared on television in the last 15 years. What is our obsession with seeing that the fraudsters make themselves stupid? I would have thought that such programs would have run a full circle, but each year they will come up with something new that is strange than before. OK so people in this one need to lose weight ... most Americans need to lose weight. I think we all enjoy a certain amount of people being humiliated. Maybe it will make us better if we see someone who looks like a jerk. I don't know, but I just want something intelligent coming out that didn't break your intelligence.
