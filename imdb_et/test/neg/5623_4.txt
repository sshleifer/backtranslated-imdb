Quentin Tarantino crime partner Roger Avary ("co-author of" Pulp Fiction ") independently (QT goes live this time) boiled for a French thriller. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz is Zed, a safe cracker who is at the request of an old friend From USA to France, where he team together with a dirty team of drugs out of hippies, who, little or no planning, think they can break the bank's treasurer full of gold bullion French public holiday. <br /> <br /> Avary has been reworked by robbery was the wrong topic that Tarantino developed so well in "Reservoir Dogs", only "Killing Zoe" is not good enough to survive its strength alone, so Avary has been thrown out quite pretty attention. Julie Delpy is a Zoe, a student who calls a girl who amusees Zed on arrival in Paris. Stunning confusion he's definitely, but nothing else. <br /> <br /> I think our director wanted to add a different angle to this main topic d movement add depth to your low plot so desperately need. In this sense, there was never a story that was more than an idea. Even the surreal trip to Paris' diving dives is uninspiring. I think one should admit that there was never a lot of movie about gangster strikes that shot each other over a botched jeweler, that is, until you add complicated signs and a glaring dialogue. "Reservoir Dogs" was it, "Killing Zoe" no. <br /> <br /> Stoltz's strong interpretation of the suspicious Zsist and Jean Hughes-Angels crazy obsessive circular leader does nothing to cancel the proceedings. In short, Avary tried to imagine having nothing to do with entertainment. <br /> <br /> Friday, September 15, 1995 - Astor Theater
