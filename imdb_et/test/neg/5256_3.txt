This movie was highly recommended, but I'm not sure why. I'm not really a fan of Adam Sandler, except 50 on Monday, where he leaves his usual angry man routine. Damon Wayans is a secret police officer and Adam Sandler is a man he pretended to be with friends for years to break him. Of course, Sandler is quite angry with this betrayal. Cue angry shouting and silly facial variety king. They get to run and, of course, they will make friends again with great misunderstanding (involving Wayans, Sandlan's head - he will survive being Bulletproof). Do I have to go? You work out what happens when you look at it. When our DVD player paused (hey it was $ 80 from the supermarket OK?), It was said that the player knew the film was boring and refused to play it.
