I like Harrison Ford, so I just want to disappoint this movie in just a minute. Mr. Ford seemed to be walking through very hot water, looking for a urinating site. His co-star was very good and had better lines. The story was of interest to me, but a mistake - BIG MISTAKE - because everything is identified through a driving license or passport before they put on board all American commercial aircraft that were left in my mind for numerous questions. <br /> <br /> I could have been less caring for these people. In fact, the bottom-up study of home affairs was more interesting than the first two killed lovers in Miami. <br /> <br /> I'm a disappointed director at Sydney Pollack, who gave us classical Tootsie and other movies. This is a waste of time and energy.
