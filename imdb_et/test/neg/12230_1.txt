Do all the damaged films need a lack of pure stupidity and any intelligence for humor? Is there only one truly FUNNY parody movie? All I see is zero-quality movies that look like a few stonework high school students who get bored with a camcorder everyday. These movies are not funny, they are not smart, they are not entertaining, they are simply unthinkable. <br /> <br /> Comebacks was a movie that tried to hide its foolish trash without calling itself a "Sport Movie". This is the same thing. For some of these films, there are some different writers, some of Wayans, Freidberg and Seltzer, and I am sure there is another couple. I can't even say what the direction or humor is to be honest, everyone seems to have been written and directed by the same people. I can't tell if Comeback was made by people who made Scary Movie or boys who made Epic Movie or someone else's, that is just the same joke. <br /> <br /> If you have any taste or no value for humor, this movie doesn't see. If you have dignity, don't worry about it. If you have any respect for film making, don't even consider it. Don't see it in any broken, abandoned theater that can still wear it, don't try it, don't order it on Netflix or Pay-Per-View, don't edit it again and don't even look at OD for free. Avoid this as a plague. <br /> <br /> The only conceivable reason why I see this movie is the following. <br /> <br /> A. Masohism. If you like torture yourself, there are very few better ways. B. Seeing the best example of why to avoid something that says "Fox Atomic". C. You are paid a lot of cash. <br /> <br /> I really wouldn't look at the whole thing if someone offered me $ 100. It's just pointless, mental collapsing torment. <br /> <br /> You can also watch Zohan.
