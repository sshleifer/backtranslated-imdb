New Orleans is nothing like it is portrayed in the persecution of the film. Quaid's attempt to talk to a cajun (by the way, hardly anyone is talking about this in the new <br /> <br /> Orleans) is terrible. Plot = elemental and pointless. This image refers to the mystery itself, but the mystery involves a gradual process in which the viewer is given clues and turns in the film. There is no such thing here. "Great <br /> <br /> Simple" is trying to get a trend with New Orleans stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled - the real Big Easy is nothing like the city that Quaid & Barkin worships.
