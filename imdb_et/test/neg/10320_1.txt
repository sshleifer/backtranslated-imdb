I saw that it was remastered on a DVD. It had a big picture of Sandra and said, "Sandra is doing ..." and showed that she had a big part in it. Not so. He's hardly in it. It does what you can do with the script, but it's not much. <br /> <br /> The sound was terrible. For that, I mean, things didn't go together. The shots are shot and the number of frames did not match the sound. People who talk in the car when it is moving, and the picture is outside the windscreen, but there is no noise, noise or other noise in the engine. Weird. <br /> <br /> Score was terrible. It sounded like little notes over and over again. The dialogue is really terrible. <br /> <br /> The action was terrible, I couldn't believe it. Fight scenes were like Batman comic without "BIFF" and "BAM". They were very flat. The shooting scenes I mean with firearms were literally ridiculous. I quickly transmitted this movie. Even then it was too long.
