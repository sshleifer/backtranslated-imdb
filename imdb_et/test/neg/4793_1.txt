Infamous for "bringing you a team of digital effects behind Independence Day," Coronado is even more remarkable with ID4. This ridiculous crap of the movie starts with a pointless assumption and goes downhill from here. The themes of this idiotic story are abundant, soon married to Beverly Hills. Claire's groom has taken off on a business trip during Christmas, so he decides to spontaneously fly to Switzerland so that they can spend their holidays together. I especially love the fact that his initial reason for wanting to go was that he had left some documents at home that he thought he might need. He grabbed them up and screamed for him when he drove, concluding that his best choice would be to fly to the other side of the planet, not to call his cell phone. I refuse to believe that a couple living in such an amazing mansion as theirs did not know the existence of mobile phones. <br /> <br /> So until then, the movie is amazingly bad, but look at it, this is where it gets worse! She goes to Switzerland and, if she doesn't find her husband, she gets a cake and invites her friend to have it all that is unfair. This woman is not a acting hero, and she is not definitely a German Indiana Jones because she cried out loud. He is an overgrown cheerleader, a pampered corporation whose experience of appearance is likely to have been limited to digging a mine ear when he gets enough to migrate to a bubble during a wine and cheese party. <br /> <br /> He gets a tip that his fianc√©e is in South America so he, like, flies there to get him. If there is, he thinks he's going to the jungle, sniffing the enemy base and rescuing his poor helpless boy. He laughs at the danger of getting there, then scares him later because he finds there are battles. "You never said anything about the battle!" <br /> <br /> There is one point where Claire and a journalist encountered this huge truck across a bridge that is hundreds of feet high and hundreds of feet over and stopped four. Literally. Thousands of thin pieces of wood are assembled with twine and these mores decide to drive over it. Not only does it crumble under the weight of the truck, but Claire can fall from it by falling hundreds of feet and landing in a shallow river. Later he remembers the event, laughing like, oh, maybe it was just a hundred. At least he was not haunted by his fingers. <br /> <br /> What really sad about this catastrophic bad movie is that they even managed to breathe the amazing performance of talented John Rhys-Davies. REAL Indiana Jones Veteran. There is a lot of nonsense about the uprising at the end of the film, where we meet an extreme rebel leader who, when we meet him for the first time, has such a thick accent that he rolls his r as he thinks he is in Ruffles commercial, later he talks like a guy they pulled out of the streets of Venice Beach. Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Special effects are insignificant. The team that brought you Independence Day, precisely because they were associated with ID4, just walked through, throwing some mats and blue screens, I have to believe, because they had nothing better to do. The story is amazingly bad and Kristin Dattilo, who many other IMDb users are the only reason to see the movie, is not making the slightest effort in his work. Perhaps he thought that the team of digital effects behind Independence Day could be somewhat meaningful. <br /> <br /> And considering how far they have fallen, maybe they thought they could. <br /> <br /> They would have tried at least.
