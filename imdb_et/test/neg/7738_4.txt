Because they all just look at MST3K there with their artificial friends who make (mostly) not such funny and obvious comments about movies. And this is the only way these people are watching them and then commenting and voting on IMDb based just on that, they don't even try to watch their movie. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on his own, I didn't read the reviews first, I didn't have some people say what to laugh, I just got a DVD (bought on the backside of Morons Outdoor, old fave) and watched because I I knew what I was doing with Golan Globus, Albert Pyun, but usually they can be quite fun. <br /> <br /> The film is not too stressing the brain Alice down the Rabbit-hole story done so many times, and sort of similar to the basic structure (but completely different content) to Warlords of Atlantis, another fun B-Movie. <br /> <br /> The voice was annoying, but then it is the idea that they even rob some lines of the movie. <br /> <br /> The hero's character was one of the worst voices / accents in English fi History, but you grow up against it and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie, but it's not a bad movie, it's just a bit of an average B-Movie DTV-type movie, something too new is not too prominent, and probably the younger age class would be for example 7-14 years old) than I. This is a bit of a fascinating fantasy. <br /> <br /> I see it again, probably not about ten years ago. <br /> <br /> Don't be so tough on the film, because a couple of dolls also told you that this movie doesn't take itself seriously and it's definitely neither Troll 2 nor Space Mutiny.
