When you make a temporary film, it is important that the "villain" is not more sympathetic than the "victim". And it fails. It was so terrible and frustrating to see that I was actually registered and commented. OK, so the husband is rich and bright. There are worse vices and a chuck boy and a woman show a lot. The husband is a jerk because he did not praise the Kana boy to physically attack this woman - a witch who had nothing to do with the plot BTW. The Cabana boy threatens a man and repeatedly tries to attract a woman. She then forces her up - what a woman finds so hot when she finishes rape thinking and starts thinking that she wants her. Uh ah. Misognistic, inferior, complex thoughts that the director displays are simply reluctant. This is one thing, when a subtle film, like American Psycho, deliberately tries to get a man, but in Survival Island I felt like I was watching a movie about Ted Bundy, but the director couldn't make him unlikely and instead hate the victims. What did he mean?
