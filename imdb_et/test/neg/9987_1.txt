Apparently, the most notorious Roman emperors who went crazy, misunderstood the terrible mishmash, leaving the notorious party slaves and merciless killings on their journey ... I know there are several versions of it and it's based on the 102-minute I watched - but I don't understand how it can change to raise the rest of this movie out! <br /> <br /> I heard a long time ago about the alleged sexual "shocking" content / nudity (which honestly is not much at all - and boring, if there is) - and blood, but be careful - this is the technical amateurism of production that here well and truly strikes: everything looks plain and just like a younger school schoolgirl project! Camera-work is hopelessly intuitive, full of strange zoom, unsightly framing and confusing pans (which most often look like a huge theatrical stage!) With a grainy, inexpensive picture. Lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven - is it day or night? Are they or outside? Have they changed the scenes? Who is or is meant to shoot? Editing is the ultimate sin here, which makes confusion about confusion just by accidental leaps, with continuity errors and random transitions that destroy every opportunity for momentum, progress and involvement. There is a potentially interesting dialogue and an equally interesting real historical story ... but these bugs disturb so much tragic. <br /> <br /> A story with lots of chances to be great is just one big, burnt (and Fellini-like) turkey that's only good for some of the smiley colors and Peter O'Toole, who makes the most memorable Tiberius. Oh yes, that brings us to the big name participants. I would like to join them all one after the other and just ask: who did you get free access to bonkile organs to be part of it? There I have wasted enough lines on one of the really worst films that are in the whole time! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 Ozjeppe
