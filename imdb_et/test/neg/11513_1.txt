For actors like Depardieu and Richard, it's really hard to make a boring movie. But Weber is a champion in slow paced setting and allegedly making funny scenes without meaning and depth. This movie is a great story, but it is characteristic. You never recognize any characters except the superficial blow. Unfortunately, Weber has no idea what it is all about. His style could be described as a hit and absence. Of course, some people laugh when they see someone slipping on a banana cream. Weber manages his humor on this party. It is shameful how bad it is to use good talent. Many good French comedies have wasted mediocre leaders.
