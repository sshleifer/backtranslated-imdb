I didn't expect "Citizen Kane", but I was hoping for some extreme guilt! The script is bad, but the exterior images of the school were clearly made on the same day with the same 5 appendixes, and the dormitories' external images were shot in the hurricane easily. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe was changed so much, I was hoping the wardrobe man had a good strong soap for washing the underpants. I know the budget time, but do you think they could have bought a few different different underwear? What kind of vampire hot chick was wearing latex trousers? I was released to see one strip of skin in the penultimate scene. <br /> <br /> Good points: Actors were all * very * attractive and girls had natural boobs. Too bad they never took bras. <br /> <br /> Special effects were ineffective and can only be described as special when they traveled to a short bus editing site. Especially the last scene is terribly, ridiculously bad. <br /> <br /> -Lizzzzzzzz
