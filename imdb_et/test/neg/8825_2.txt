Othello has set the eyes of the viewers to burn. The bad image of the Shakespeare characters and the terrible rendition of Desi & John's love made this film a terrible pollution. Far away, Othello, led by Jeffery Saks, is a medium and cruel. <br /> <br /> Film Othello is sad about the love of John and Des. Their loyalty to each other is tested by a man's friend. The opening of the film clearly shows that the love between John and Desdemona is inseparable. A moment later, Ben Jago, John's friend, jumps on the screen, scaring the viewers and showing them how big the liar and the hungry person are. <br /> <br /> This movie was a lot of fright as Shakespeare's novel itself. It says it has a small amount of good parts. For example, the love shown between John and Des was well illustrated and it seemed that the couple was so inseparable; as explained in the book. Although the love between them was exceptionally well shown, it still did not show joy that Othello was as good as needed between Cass and Desi. <br /> <br /> Love, jealousy, deception, this movie is based on all three major themes in Shakespeare's novel. The novel, however, really explains how it all came together much better than the film. For example, the end of this story ends in the book much differently than in the movie. The novel also has many more details. This is why this movie is such a disappointment, trust me, those who have read it will also find it disappointing. Finally, this film was by far the most frightening imagination of the novel that mankind has ever put out. Avoiding this movie, viewers will not only save one hour of their lives, but will also keep an eye on them or two of Ben Jago's embarrassing faces that expose them.
