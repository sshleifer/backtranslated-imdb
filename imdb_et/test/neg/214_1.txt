this movie is so bad that it forced me to create an account with IMDb to warn others about it. <br /> <br /> I have been using IMDb for a long time and many movies have come to my wish to register, either to praise or to start, but never worth it. Until now! <br /> <br /> I'm a big Matt Dillon fan. all I can ask about this movie is "how did Dillon choose this script?" really. I mean, there are larger openings than Vredefort. <br /> <br /> I mean, this is the hilarious movie of today, not the 70s. To cry out loud, even a child knows that armored trucks have GPS tracking and sorting. makes you think about what it takes to get a Hollywood script. <br /> <br /> I could go on with age, but I wont. believe me when I say it. save time and skip it. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Matt, I'm still a fan, but this movie was sucked.
