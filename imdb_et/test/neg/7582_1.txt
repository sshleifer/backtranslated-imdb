That this movie is clipped to the chapel wall to prove that God is really dead. Am I the only one who really saw (rather dreamed) this "movie"? This is the only movie I've ever seen in the theater, I'm sorry I didn't go out and demanded my money back - that's just boring. And I even saw "Highlander 2: The Quickening" in the local cinema. Gibson and Downey have absolutely no chemistry from the beginning to the end, as two unlikely things that are put together by the things that eventually work with the best friends. The activity (which little is there) is funny and as dull as the writer's skull. Thank you to every divinity who intercedes for us, because he watches for our "cinema" that there is no way for "Air America 2".
