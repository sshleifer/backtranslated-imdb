Okay, so Gus Van Sant wanted to redo the color of Psycho so that he could bring it to the modern audience, who would probably go to a halt if they were ever forced to watch a black and white film, though they forget that both "Clerks" and "Schindler's List "filmed in black and white and are great movies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the same narrow-minded people who don't want to see a big movie just because it's black White are the same people who wouldn't like "Psycho" anyway, because it doesn't kill every two minutes or sex game. And the murders aren't cute blood / guts / gore / bones that people are used to seeing "Halloween", "Friday 13th". and "Nightmare Elm Street". This is why the reprocessing of "Psycho" almost exactly as it was originally intended should not work because it is really only interesting for people who are fans of the original. All others just look at it to go over until the next "Scream" comes out and for that reason they are disappointed. "Psycho" is based on skipping and mystery, not on blood and guts. (And so no one thinks I should be an older citizen if I like older movies, let me set the record straight by saying I am 21.) <br /> <br /> So when the color of the movie was all that Van Sant wanted to change why not just paint and shoot it again? I mean, what's the point of reusing a movie if you're not going to change anything *? At least what he could have done was to place his own director's spin instead of just copying Hitchcock - or even better, hiring a new writer to adapt the new script from the original "Psycho" book. But it seems that Van Sant could not decide whether he wanted "Psycho" * or not. It should have been all or nothing about the project - whether to make the film exactly or to do it in a different way - but in its present form it is about 95% the same, but with a few touches that don't seem to be in any way. Such as Norman's masturbation when she spies without Marion. It does not serve the plot at all and the only reason he did so was that he * could *. He wanted to say, "Hitch wasn't able to masturbate in 1960, so I'll do it." Whoopee, a big deal, as I'm so shocked when someone masturbates. And what on earth was the idea of ​​displaying single-frame images and farm animals that were assembled into murder scenes? And then he leaves an important scene where Lila and Sam meet the sheriff outside the church. <br /> <br /> Plus, using almost exactly the same script, the whole movie looks a little anachronistic. Opening the credit say the year is 1998. Then what does Marion's 60-seat dress or the sunshade accompanying her? Why should Marion and Sam have their own rooms in a hotel room if today they would not be shocked by what they do? Why don't Marion have air conditioning? Why don't Bates Motel have a TV set and probably the doors are not locked automatically? Why should Sheriff contact Bates motel? That's why using the same script was just an error - just changing a few words here and not enough to upgrade it. It needed a whole reprocessing. <br /> <br /> Although Vince Vaughn was for Norman, he didn't seem to be right for that part. Part of what made the original "Psycho" so horrible was that Norman had such an innocent, boy-neighbor quality, so no one could believe he could handle such terrible crimes. What Vince Vaughn is playing, is anyone surprised that Norman was a psychopathic killer? <br /> <br /> I said that I understand that Gus Van Sant was probably the fan of the original "Psycho" movie and wanted it to be a tribute. This is not a bad film, but the problem is that it can be the only exposure of some "Psycho". I really think you should only see this movie when you have seen the original. Since I have something to do with "Psycho", I bought a copy of the remake I used to watch from time to time. The original film was filet mignon, while the remake is a hamburger. But even filet mignon would be boring if you had it everyday, so it's great to change the hamburger at once.
