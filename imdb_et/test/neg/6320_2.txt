"Where is poppa?" Opening, George Segal rises from his bed in the morning, shaves, holds showers, puts a gorilla suit and goes to his mother's bedroom, later on, to give him a huge heart attack that kills him and get him out of his life forever. It is about the level of humor that can be expected from most images: madness, blended with what can be considered moral courage. <br /> <br /> Segal plays a New York attorney who lives with her allegedly sensible mother (Ruth Gordon), whose life is even more complicated when she hires a girl with her dream girl, hired by a parent's bag, with French Trish Van Devere , decorated as Florence Nightingale. His dilemma: how to integrate a cute sister into her acute mother's life. <br /> <br /> Segal's play is the only thing that keeps the picture together. His disappointments, his reactions, his comic timing are almost equivalent (what happened to this man?); where the film fails, there are other areas. The character of Ruth Gordon is terrible as a mother. At first you can't figure out if it's character is senile or just deliberately vague to keep your son out. Finally, it is clear that he is just nuts. When Segal brings Van Devere home to meet her, Gordon's eyebrows are foggy and she gets a medium, bad look. He wants the intruder to be removed from his son's life; he calculates. This is not an ancient human mode. You won't get the same performance across the whole picture, which is probably the guilt of the director (Carl Reiner) as much as Gordon. Ruth Gordon's old lady "Rosemary Baby" is much more successful because Ruth Gordon generally plays with a contented, embarrassing person who reacts to her annoyingly. But when Mia Farrow is too modest to fight back, Gordon becomes more and more astonishing, her arches dig deeper and deeper and we are afraid of Farrow; such capture is really terrible. Here we are asked to laugh, which we would usually fight, and when Gordon played it helplessly on the nut, we could. But he is selfish and thoughtful, and it suppresses what is a little humor. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good laughs. The courtroom with Barnard Hughes as a military officer and Rob Reiner as a counter-culture bank is quite fun, and Vincent Gardenia makes a nice stroke as a Lombardiaque football coach. There's also an inspired bit where Segal's brother (Ron Liebman) who surreptitiously surrendered to Segal asked him to carry something home - and he gives him a gorilla suit. <br /> <br /> But many scripts are poorly prepared and just do not make sense. Why is New York's lawyer even living at home? Why does Segal try to think logically, if his mother is senile, "If you break it for me, I'll hit your heart." Why does Liebman cut through the park when he knows he's going to loot? Why does he take a taxi after leaving Segal with a gorilla suit? Why didn't he have to use taxis all the time? Funnyer bit would have been Liebman, like gorilla, terrorizing muggers. Why does Van Devere go back when his first husband was a cake, why does he want to deal with this bunch? I think when I put it on Carl Reiner, he says they are mad people, they don't make sense. What a convenient way to apologize for the sad script that is full of holes. The current status of characters may not be reasonable, but their motivations must be, and there is "Where is Poppa?" decomposes; Situations are created just to be gag, and gags are mostly single shots, they don't build anything. <br /> <br /> Carl Reiner is the most guilty of this fiasco. How he has acquired the spirit of comedy of this spiritual image, which rebels me; Basically, her career has been to keep Sid Caesar and Mel Brooks in front of the microphone when they talk in funny voices. His son Robil is a leader with ten times more skills and intelligence. The show has a Reiner by pressing buttons; a monkey could do his job. And this is most evident in shaping his activities. Why is everything in New York dense and close-ups, but landscape scenes are all distant and panoramic? It is the way of Carl Rhein's direction, claustrophobic to the city, spatial. In the last lunar scene of the old people, the camera is so far away that it can't even do what's going on. The abrupt termination suggests a resolution that Segal could have easily reached ninety minutes ago; it also indicates that Reiner was unable to end the picture. So he just cut it like another example of "madness". It seems Reiner thinks the fool is equal to craze, and madness without logic is always funny. It is not, and the creators of "Where Poppa" are as demented as Ruth Gordon, who puts Pepsi in his fruit circles.
