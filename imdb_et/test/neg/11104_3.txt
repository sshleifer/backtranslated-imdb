It's all my fault. They all told me I shouldn't see this movie because I'm a big fan of old TV series. They were right. Although the production values ​​are good and the actors themselves (including "don't look now"), Julie Christie is not so bad, the whole film has a thrill and self-awareness that is obviously unfounded. The comparison between Karloff "Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns 2000" is in my opinion. In fact, Belphegore 2000 owes much more to new mummy films than to the old series. But then, scripting is terrible, there is no speed, and sometimes the movie is full of involuntary jokes (the first scene in the tomb is the usual stupid) where the cats are clearly thrown when they should jump (landing with their back)). Belphegore moves around like a statue on wheels that are not an impressive or scary and psychological drama that emerged on old television when the heroine had to learn that he was a villain. This film is so WASTED (wasted money, wasted participants, wasted plan) that it is painful. It is below the better mummy-rip off, which is good for just a few smiles, but has nothing at all with Greco's classic (it also has a small role in this movie - the graveyard).
