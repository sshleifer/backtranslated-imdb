I see that Thomas Howell has appeared in many films since his flowering in the 1980s as a young actor. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD because it was a cheap and partly internet-related plot and see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I can't remember seeing her in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> In a few words: what is very disappointing. I give some of the low budget movies a chance, but it started flat. In the first 15 minutes of the film, this tempting woman speaks in Asia. They basically stimulate themselves in their conversation, and then require a personal meeting with the participant. He meets him, sexes, binds him and then murders him in cold blood. Then the plot decreases even further. <br /> <br /> The piece is thin and thin, and the operation is very rigid. Don't worry less about buying, even if it's on a $ 1 DVD. I'm going to take a copy of my DVD to Goodwill. I'm really surprised that any movie from previous reviewers gave a bad rating.
