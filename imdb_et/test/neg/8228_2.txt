I chose this movie. This movie has been on my "black this" list for a while because people talked about being "annoying" and the VHS box also contains many and many quotes from people who say "amazing" is or how "so close" you You'll get a Texas chainsaw massacre and such lines. But sorry people, I was disappointed with the big time. The idea is interesting, but the script is so underdeveloped that every character is mistaken for the creation of evolution and people really make the film the foolest movies. <br /> <br /> This in turn takes away any credibility that the plot might otherwise have. I couldn't believe somewhat looooong some "where he is, we find him". Some gory moments that please gore a fan but they are so few that by the time we reach them it makes no sense. When Luther is a geek, filmmakers have to be in the food chain.
