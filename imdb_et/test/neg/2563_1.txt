Steven Seagal played in many films. Most of them were bad but not bad as a patriot. This is a Z series low budget movie. After Operation Delta Force, War of War, Substitute 2, Plato's Run, Base, Drive, Sabotage, etc. must be a patriot. Steven Seagal is definitely a bad actor like Mark Dacascos, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Treat Williams, Jack Scalia, Gary Busey, Chuck Norris, Michael Madsen and many others. The scenario was full of holes and the characters were not realistic (maybe because of the very bad actors) and the 4.25 bucks you spent on renting a Patriot are called lost money !!! I'll give her 0 and a half (laugh) from 5.
