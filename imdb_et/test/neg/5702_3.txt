It's funny how instinct warns you. For example, as soon as Nu Image reads a corporate credit, I knew instinctively that I saw an unprecedented film somewhere but didn't remember where. Nonetheless, I just knew that THE COURT AND JURY would be crap and that was. Maybe I'm psychic? <br /> <br /> !!!! SMALL SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> Opening is quite violent, as many people can no longer blast for a wrong place in the wrong place. I don't know about you, but now I'm getting violent violence on the screen today with a bad language, especially when the actors are as bad as this movie. Anyway, a bad guy who has been executed and returned has turned around the plot to get a man who shot his wife again. Did I mention a bad guy and his wife murdered a few people on their wedding day? Yeah, he's a serious bad mofo. In fact, he is so bad (and I don't mean acting - I get to that moment) that he is impossible to take seriously and that is before he only performs Elton John's return, Elvis, French cook, etc. I don't know if Keith David was paid for that? because he looks like he has such a fun screen that he is the only reason he plays a role. I'm sorry that this reviewer had no fun watching JUDGE AND JURY. Hey, maybe the manufacturers can send me a Keith fee? Gawd only knows that I do it. <br /> <br /> I didn't like much about this film if you hadn't thought and my main beef is not foolish or with cheap production values, but it is violence. If I like that you have a bottle of wine cracked on your head or hit the ribs very many times, you know that violence is a nasty hurt thing, but in JUST AND JURY you think that when you throw out a window, some banners and falls on the table twenty odd feet, not only when you're faulty, but you can attack a few rails of fucking dogs. Of course it can be said that Sly, Arnie or Bruce starred in the same dishonest violence, but JUDGE AND JURY is in my chain
