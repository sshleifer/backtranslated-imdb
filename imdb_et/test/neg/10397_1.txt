If Dante were aware that his masterpiece is ACTED OUT PUPPETS !!! The actors who played the doll also sell out. Because playing a doll doesn't work, it doesn't do anything. No one really cares about who the doll was. people only care who played an important role as a real movie. it's just annoying how you could mock such an amazing man and his conviction, this stupid little movie. It should be a crime, and .... I can't believe you're offending such a book. I thought the movie was completely ridiculous and it must be destroyed !! It completely destroys what you think of reading it. Your just making a big joke.
