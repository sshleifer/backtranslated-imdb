An extraordinary story hanging from a flat Hollywood movie, a terrible, cheesy dialogue and not a "up-to-par" sex. This is another great softcore parody! I enjoyed this movie very much! Of course it is terrible, but it's part of the fun! The story is ridiculous, but some things have to be sacrificed when the story has to turn around the sexual scenes between girls. And because it's just softcore (not penetration), the sex scenes were tiny. But it is like the great god of soft porn player Russ Meyer, "who really cares about what falls under the belt." I don't know if I agree with Mr Meyers on this, but what the hell ... flick attracted me for an hour and a half. I'll give him C +, it would have been B if they could bring out more girls to act as actors for Russ Meyers. VaVoom! VaVoom! ~
