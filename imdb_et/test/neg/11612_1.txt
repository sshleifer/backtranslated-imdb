The style seemed good, the actors seemed good, the film should be fine. But it wasn't sure - it didn't drive us anywhere, <br /> <br /> scenes are weird. Perhaps it was meant to create something new that we would think. This is at least: Where is the rest of this movie? For me it was a waste of money, time and talent. Someone may want to have this curiosity to see if they can figure it out. Anything else that I personally do not want anyone to <br /> <br />.
