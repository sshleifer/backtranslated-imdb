Okay, <br /> <br /> I understand there are some suspicious Thomas ... I was one of them ... but then I saw this celluloid masterpiece. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that the scene where George Wendt breastfeeds his A ** spacecraft left me trembling. Sometimes I sit upright in bed, screaming like an old man on a procologist's desk that thinks about it. If the director reads it, I'd pay as a supplement.
