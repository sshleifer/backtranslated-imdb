I saw this movie and I missed it! I'm a fan of peanuts, but I don't understand why Charles Schultz is making this catastrophe! Front spoilers. <br /> <br /> I can't believe Snoopy will let his friends sleep on the ground outside a dangerous situation and go to the bar and walk a couple of cold without standing! The story was a complete nonsense, even a comic book. It took them a long time to reach France, and when they arrived in France, I had the feeling that the writer (I still can't believe it was Schultz) didn't know what to do when they got there. <br /> Peanuts are best prepared in 30-minute episodes, not in 80-minute films. <br /> <br /> Go home to Charlie Brown, you're the best. <br /> <br />
