This movie is one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life! The actors are ridiculous and Corman hasn't improved his pirates since 1978. 90% of the special effects are raised by Piranhalt (1978), Up From The Depths (1979) and Humanoids from The Deep (1979). This makes Piranha II: flowering looks like it belongs to the American Film Institute.
