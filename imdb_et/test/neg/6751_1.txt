it was pretty bad. pedestrian work or worse. I don't think it was homophobic, just very bad. if something was really amateurish, as if you are 14 years old and you first discover the curses and the skin mags. <br /> <br /> The main point of this movie, romance, really falls flat. I can't help but know if writers have ever had a serious relationship before that movie. <br /> <br /> Drawing and stretching is terrible, not at all. one minute we look at these guys cheaters, then we are in the gay club, then we are on the date. somehow the girl likes comics and they sleep together. none of it feels real, like Shakespeare's primary school production, when Hamlet wrote to the frat boy. girl. Necessary and really disturbing. <br /> <br /> However, you must watch it. Why? <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, the director's comment is really fun - what professional talks about "beating" or "catching" with actors? suck, the relationship was not chemistry. you're on the floor, laughing at this terrible jackas.
