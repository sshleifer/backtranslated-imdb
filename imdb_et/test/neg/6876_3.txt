Yes, this title line actually appears in this movie. Why? I'm not sure. When the line was actually spoken, did anyone in the team ever laugh at the moment? I would have liked to see this movie because I think they would be more entertaining than the film itself. <br /> <br /> Director Jim Gillespie, ("I know what you did last summer") is a teenage film that seems to imply that we have never seen a teen movie. Of course, he must not be blamed. Three writers are also responsible, and this is somehow based on a video game that is still in production. The title of this game is "Backwater," but when I was looking for information about it, I came up with something. <br /> <br /> And so we start the movie ... I'd like to say before I go on it I don't expect this Oscar to win. When I'm in the right mind, I enjoy having fun with the horror movie. I think there is an opportunity for an efficient, original and smart movie. "Venom" is not this movie. <br /> <br /> Almost no character at all. That's fine. You don't expect much. However, instead of this movie, which is a pair of woven, this film will introduce us to the cliche of the following many horror films ... <br /> <br /> 1. The ultimate girl: she's just broken for her boyfriend. This means that at some point in the movie, if they are in danger, they decide to come together again. That means more than likely he dies and he's the last remaining movie. "Eden" is played by Agnes Bruckner, without much enthusiasm, I could add. <br /> <br /> 2. Boyfriend: She's almost with the final girl until her death. Of course he can save him, but he's doomed and we know it. "Eric" is played by Jonathan Jackson. <br /> <br /> 3. Bimbos: Usually, horror movies are only one of them, but here we have two. They trade, steal, show their breasts (not in this case) or they can be alcoholics. Genre status. They also travel in dimly lit areas throughout their lonely, usually saying, "Hi? Is there anyone?" "Tammy" and "Patty" are suitably called Bijou Phillips and Davetta Sherwood. <br /> <br /> 4. Jackass: Of course, he looks pretty, but he's an idiot in a movie that is purely idiotic. He says that stupid things, no stupid things, have never seen a horror movie and one of the most enjoyable killings you look at. "Sean" is played by D.J. Cotrona. <br /> <br /> 5. Girlfriend: She loves Jackass, though pretty much no one else does, and she is usually the one who has been alive for a while so she can scream and cry until she starts bounce and stay behind. "Rachel" is played by Laura Ramsey. <br /> <br /> 6. Creepy Guardian: In this case, The Creepy Gas Station Attendant. That's enough. "Ray" is played by Rick Cramer. <br /> <br /> I could continue, but I think you get the picture. The remaining characters are not so common that they are equally killed. There is "The Gay Guy" (Pawel Szajda as "Ricky") who was definitely kidnapped at the screen and "The one who knows what's going on". Of course, there is nothing about it, because first of all everyone thinks it's crazy. "Cece" plays for Meagan. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of other characters, namely the method played by Method Man, but he and others have been killed quite quickly and get even less character than the following So, you probably thought, "Why does this movie need such a deep analysis? It's just a summer horror that shouts "out loud!" "Is this question a commodity based on this question? Yes, and no. Action is not particularly persuasive, even considering the accompanying talents. br /> <br /> So, what's gore? There are some. It's really about that. Many juices bits are cut. Namely a scene that includes someone's face and sandpaper used to remove car paints. <br /> <br /> For the filmmaker's credit, there are a couple of interesting scenes. I liked the bit where the house was literally pulled out so that the unstoppable villain could get to the characters. <br /> <br /> If all of this was centered around a smarter scenario where the characters were not made the same foolish mistakes that have literally made hundreds of horror movie characters, they could have made a more enjoyable experience. d and then it just becomes a non-particularly interesting timing until we know it's just The Creepy Janitor and Final Girl. <br /> <br /> I think I have to be a little imprisoned, but as a fan of horror, I don't know why I should have worked if I could write better. I don't even mention many terrible CGI cases.
