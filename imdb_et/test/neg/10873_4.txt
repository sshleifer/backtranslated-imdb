Director / Director Larry Bishop tried the way, too hard with Hell Ride. The film wants to be nervous, witty, provocative, extreme, biting, seemingly in the Quentin Tarantino / Rob Zombie style. But it's not sharp. Links seem to be forced. The dialogue is trying to be smart and unsuccessful. Humor is never funny. Nice try to set a shining tone, but we have to make sure that the characters or its story is remotely successful. <br /> <br /> What you leave is the cool Harleys and the beautiful girls who surround the tired bunch of old and cubic "bad guys" who look like an attempt to make the modernized West Coast of Sergio Leone. If this film gets newer generations interested in films from the 60s and 70s, then for that. But in itself, it is quite boring and irrelevant. I believe there is a style for the substance. But this movie is not it.
