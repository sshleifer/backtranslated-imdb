The movie starts with a lot of voice, a bad sign. It then slips downhill with foolish and intelligence-offensive scenes involving traps and Indians. But it gets to new and impressive low places when all the cheerful mountain men dance with each other on a high mountain ridge. Meanwhile, happy-lucky Indians are sitting watching them. This is a better scene than the "Blazing Saddles" on the dance lines. There is a small mistake in this comparison; "Acid the Wide Missouri" is not a comedy. <br /> <br />
