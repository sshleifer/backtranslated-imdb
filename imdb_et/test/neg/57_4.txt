in general, I do not make negative comments here. But because it's a festival piece, I don't want you to waste your time if you see something else that may not play again. <br /> <br /> I thought the actors were pretty bad. For example, they did not play each other, but they waited for their lines, which were quite poor at first. The dialogue was really forced. Norman or whatever his name was trying, or so it would seem witty and biting the line he chose, but just fell really short. <br /> <br /> After asking the words, he asked if anyone saw the coming coming and some people were all "yes" and all but called them liars. See that there were so many clues, the biggest was a suitcase full of money for a $ 500 hour whore. I mean, John gave her at least 20g ... tell the story. Now you didn't see exactly what would happen, but by the time the twist really happened, I didn't care. I was just glad to get out of there. I asked him who pulled him down and said 8.1, maybe next time he would expect to shoot 15.3 because it needs a lot of work. <br /> <br /> But he seemed quite a nice man, he's making his films, he's probably going to heal and I hope he doesn't, I don't, I want him luck. Remember, this is just my opinion.
