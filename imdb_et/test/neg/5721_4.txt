Frankly, this film is weak. Very weak. Only the nature of capital gets something. It works like a compressor with a bad engine ... so if you like red hair Valkyries - look at it. But better to find Brigitte's picture of Sonja and put it on the desktop. This saves frustration. Well, Arnold is also doing his deal ... but it's definitely not his role. Other signs - the word is not bad. Sword fights? Monsters? It's ridiculous. The plot is really a shame. Why was rape necessary? Especially we don't see it. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is weak. Although there is a worse movie ... Without basic characters, it would be just ******. And if anyone even discusses it, maybe ...
