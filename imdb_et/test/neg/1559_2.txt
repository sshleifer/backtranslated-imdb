Aliens are losing a giant monster called Zarkorr, then sending down a hologram that sees your average foolish teenage girl telling a postman, Tommy Ward (Rhys Pugh, the only movie you ever saw) to fight. Even when he loses the plant, it goes to death, so he goes to Zarkorr to fight against the intruder! This movie is bad, very bad. So bad is the need for negative numbers to give him a rattan. Deer-written, bad leadership, below Power Rangers, from top to bottom, which means you're just whiting to get the hunter of forest friends to get out and cut! And don't let me start with the theme song at the end. People who made this S $ @ # stemming should not be near camera or movie related things. Zarkorr is a cool looking monster that should have been a million times better with the film. Do it yourself and don't watch this movie, it's an 80-minute life. Participants in this game have never worked ever. <br /> <br /> 3/10
