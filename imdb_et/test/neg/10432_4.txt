I saw this screener on the DVD a few months before it was released. <br /> <br /> I liked the main characters and the general story, but some scenes are pretty sloppy and confusing. Sets were suitable, but some just looked like the left-wing uprising of Freaks & Geeks or reminded me of a commercial strike on a mobile phone in a middle-class home. Certainly not what the DVD cover claims, "forced to be the next stoner classic", barely. Wardrobe and hairstyle are well done and yes, there are some pretty beautiful girls, always nice to see a good-looking cast. <br /> <br /> Almost every scene contained a guitar that just turned on and on. Sound design was a bit bad. I think less would have been the best.
