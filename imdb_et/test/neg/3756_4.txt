The four main players here - John Candy, Jean Kelly, Amy Madigan and Macauley Caulkin - the only one I've never heard of (at that time) was what irritated me and destroyed the film. Well, he must have done a decent job of wanting to throw him and the VHS trash. I'm talking about Kelly's teen brat, "Tia Russell." Ironically, six years later, he played an amazing and extremely pleasant role in "Rowena Morgan" in "Mr. Dutch Opus". <br /> <br /> Candy, as usual, is fun to watch as "Buck Russell," or the title characters "Uncle Buck". Few actors were better than beloved, unhappy slob than Candy. I enjoyed my character here, but I can't look at this spoiled teenager more than once. In the first few minutes of the movie, the little boy "Miles" (Cauklin) says "G-damn". How bad is it, a six-year-old boy who says the movie is wrong with the name of the Lord? These Hollywood people are such sick. No wonder many of these kids' actors turn out to be mentally screwed, Caulkin is a case.
