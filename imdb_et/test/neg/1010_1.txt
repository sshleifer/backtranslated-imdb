It is a little less ill than the first two movies, but otherwise it's a common: a blurry, sloppy, and unbalanced section of the cinema. Charles Bronson is back, breaking down when the neighbors terrorize the neighbor. You see that crime is 11% in the South Belmont area, so what to do? Stronger police presence? Tougher prisons? Tougher phrases? No, the only solution is to open a cannon like Bronson to get a bloody revenge? or, as the writers would do, justice: this time he is the personal killer machine of police chief Ed Lauter. <br /> <br /> Writers bend backwards to make Kersey a hero, sending the useless police to the area only to confiscate the weapon from the elderly who keeps it safe, and supplying the scene where Kersey has stolen the camera and let the thief behind it to watch applause by watching. Death penalty for theft? Well, okay. The attitude of everyone in the film is that it is a solution, and dishonest twists of the characters as scramblers that exist only to rejoice or retract Kersey are terrible. bump, but shouldn't the movie leave the audience in their minds instead of leaning towards the whole thing with Kersey and its meaningless answer? The funny population is not afraid of gang revenge or blaming Kersey for any kind of violence that is strange because one character is killed just because of Kersey's involvement. At the end of the film, they take all the weapons from their sock drawers and massively joined the massacre, never stopping to think about things or struggle to kill another person. <br /> <br /> Brutally low performances don't help? The Bronze literally has the full facial expression and he can't even put curves on the right words. Are there new heights of stupidity here? machine gun? Rocket launcher?! ? and new areas of misogyia: the film worships the character of every woman, whether it be rape, explosion or throat; and it puts them in a very foolish way, like a victim who commits a crime-wandering neighborhood to ask a stranger or another who buys alone at night. It is a dreck, clean and simple, meaningless garbage that is put together without style or meaning.
