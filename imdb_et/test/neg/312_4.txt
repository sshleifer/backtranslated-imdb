Halloween is terrorized by the city of lunatic, who has a big pumpkin. Bad action, which most often threatens local talent and ridiculous special effects, makes it one. B-Movie Queen Linnea Quigley seems embarrassed to be part of this and even her remarkable charm, which has helped so many other films to help. If you are looking for good Halloween horror movies and rent a "Night of Demons", which also means Mrs. Quigley, let it give you the cheese color.
