Why this is nothing more than Ator, who is Miles O'Keefe's fun bad. Surprisingly, I had the misfortune of sitting through this turkey before the Mystery Science Theater 3000 burst into pieces. I recommend reviewing MST3K because it is fun and one of their best episodes. <br /> <br /> The film itself is basically a typical B-film crud captured by Italian filmmakers in the early and mid-1980s. This film was probably made for money by Conan's craze, but it doesn't work for all the stories. <br /> <br /> Watch out for scenes in which Ator fights against a giant snake and can perform a complete glider during a break. <br /> <br /> "Tang, the fish is ready!" <br /> <br /> Rating: The movie itself - 1 version of MST3K: 10
