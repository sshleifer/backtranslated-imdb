I had a rather pleasant The Wrecking Crew (1999), the last of three films from this series (the first is Urban Menace (1999), which I still saw). I know it was a baaaa, but these three did a decent job with all this in mind. <br /> <br /> It was really cruel. Ice-T was terrible and he's a manufacturer! I can't say I've ever heard of Silkk The Shocker (who probably didn't learn to spell) but his performance was one of the worst I've ever seen in the movie. <br /> <br /> Miss Jones did quite well in her small role, though she later made some cruel, racist jokes in her radio show after the Asian Asian tsunami (unfortunately in other cases). How to go, girl ... <br /> <br /> No one comes out of credit. Strangely enough, TJ Storm and Ernie Hudson (who are both pretty bad here) are in a much better breaking team that was made with the Urban Menace while corrupt. How it works, I don't know. <br /> <br /> Now I'm trying Ice-T comment to see if he apologizes for the movie or tries to think that it's a great piece of film making.
