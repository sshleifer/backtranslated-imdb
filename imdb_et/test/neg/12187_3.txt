After all, I had heard about Jane Austin's novel and a book on various film versions that I found very disappointed with the film. I was waiting for a classic drama, but it wasn't. First of all, let me introduce my review of the fact that I love old movies, especially secrets and dramas, but not movies directed at women. This is probably a big difference, so take my overview of a big salt. I thought the action was a bit over the top, but it is very common in films of this era. June was Allyson good as Jo, but I found that every sister is stereotypical and formal. There were no surprises or too dramatic moments. I hate writing negative comments, but the film was very cold for me. My intention is always to read the book, but after that it seems unlikely. The only warming story was between the old gentlemen and the youngest sister, which was a very welcome spot for the otherwise disappointing viewing experience. Again, there are others who love this movie, I'm not just one of them.
