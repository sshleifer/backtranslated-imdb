I know it's a movie. But when it comes to depicting real life (on any matter), it should be as faithful as possible. Sorry, but "El Misterio Galíndez" is not as accurate as it seems. Also, the Dominican Republic is not depicted as it really is. In fact, I was surprised that Santo Domingo was in Cuba. And amazingly movies with Cuban themes (Havana, lost city, bitter sugar, godfather, part II) were filmed by Santo Domingo! So what happened here? Why did they shoot a movie in Cuba D.R. Spanish dialogues with Cuban accent are terrible! These are not Dominicans! At historical level, Galíndez would never be hung. He could be so badly killed, lost or died because of the inhuman torture he had received. Then throw your body at the Caribbean. But Trujillo would never have commanded dead death. His sick mind would not have allowed it. <br /> <br /> Operation is not expected. Harvey Keitel looks like she's just waiting for a salary. I prefer the leading actor "Deep Blue Sea". The rest of the cast would have been excellent in some Cuban films, and the same applies to the selected scene. <br /> <br /> I recommend Mario Vargas Llosa, the best-selling author of "La fiesta del chivo", directed by his cousin Luis Llosa. This is a bit more realistic with Dominican history. The character of Trujillo is very well illustrated and the Galindez case is dealt with very briefly in this film.
