What could have been a somewhat horrible stuff is that it is an incomprehensible, dirty movie that even the filmmakers themselves probably did not understand. If they had seen more satanic ritual or anything, it could have been easier, but now it is a waste of time and brain cells. Does anyone else get sick of the whole "little boy who draws horrible pictures with a crayon"? Maybe there might be a bigger horror click? Probably not. I know I know it is from another country, and it is of course too refined and complicated for me, so I shouldn't expect the "plot" to be for me, blah, blah, boon. What ever. I'm still saying the film is blowing.
