This fantasy was a complete garbage. I thought Michael Moore was in the market for ridiculous anti-government films, but it was much worse than he'd ever done. No wonder British media critics complain that its press is tabloid. This film is the leftmost loony's greatest fantasy that lives on the big screen. Anyone who is even a little better than such rotten Bush-bashers should be terribly pleased to do so. I am sure that it works well in Syria, Iran, Pakistan and North Korea. It is hard to believe that these days, Muslims who are blowing innocent commuters will be in the United States who thinks Britain should surrender in the war on terror. I think it is no longer the country I was wondering about, I stood nearly 70 years ago against the Nazis. All hail Neville Chamberlain and pathetic indignation!
