It's Sooooouullltakaaaa! <br /> <br /> Wow. What skin peel off bad film. Frankly, this is one of MST3K's favorite episodes .... Just a few things to point out ... <br /> <br /> 1) Pretending lesbian mother-daughter exchange was weird. I need advice now. <br /> <br /> 2) There is no God, there is just a guy .. I love this quote from Crow. <br /> <br /> 3) What happened to the Nuns who took the bus home, do we ever know? I have a terrible emptiness in my belly. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, don't watch this movie unless it's MSTied ... It's Joe Estevez as the main star .. Yikes .. <br /> <br /> 1/10 when M -Mied is 8/10.
