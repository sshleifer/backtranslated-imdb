A good attempt to solve the unusual theme of the May-December novels. However, the treatment is completely unrealistic. Of course, sixty-year-old men get and fall for younger women, but they are usually adult women with whom they share common interests and values ​​... not neurotic, immature underage girls. Of course there are exceptions and they are close to naming pedophiles! Sorry to RGV, but it's not believable that a reasonable and achievable sexual figure would take away a comfortable family life and make jokes to his peers ... all 18-year-olds who have no practical thinking in their head and that they behave like an unstable gospel. You do not have to have a PhD in psychology to see if Amitabh's character has attracted sex, and that young women have unresolved abandonment and missions. <br /> <br /> Vijay's recurring scene is the edge of a rock, contemplating suicide, which is about as close as when he sees something in common with Jiah, acting like an attacked teenage boy. work and cinematography good.
