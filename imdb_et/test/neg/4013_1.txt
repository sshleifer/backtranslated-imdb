This video has a sound designed for listening to someone during their sleep. The same can be said about video. <br /> <br /> Morgan and his wife pretended they were working on a minimum wage? Does the camera run? And his little wife-poo complained? Leave me alone. They are both rich. They sit in their counterfeit $ 350 / month apartment, filming their $ 1000 / month with each 12-member video team. <br /> <br /> I honored Morgan, but now his 30-day experience is nothing but trying to fool volunteer viewers who want to fool. <br /> <br /> Morgan, you are making a $ 6.00 per hour job, and you are paid by naive employers who don't see the big cameras that shoot the whole thing? And we don't have to think they won't pay you under the table?
