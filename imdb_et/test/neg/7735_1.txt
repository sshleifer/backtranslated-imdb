Impressive vision and some hot chicks whose swords are flying around, oh and those hypnotic Chinese violins too ... Let me think, "Tiger, hidden dragon"? <br /> <br /> I liked CTHD, underground simplicity, and well-developed characters that give you enough space to enjoy the vision without having to think about DEEEPAA's thoughts. <br /> <br /> "Hero" on the other hand is painfully pretentious and demanding both visually and conceptually. Higher morals were terrible. I mean, sacrifice your life, sacrifice your beliefs, sacrifice your love so that your mighty people succeed? WTF ?? <br /> <br /> No, thanks. <br /> <br /> But Hay, Mao and G.W.B. would be proud! <br /> <br /> Viva
