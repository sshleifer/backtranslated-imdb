I recently rented this promising mini-series, I didn't even know they had adapted for television. I was really looking forward to it because the book icon is one of the best spy thrillers I've ever read. What a disappointment it was. The plot only resembles loosely in the book, the characters are completely wrong and there is terrible behavior. Shame really. The story behind the icon is perfect for a silver screen, but I think that television budgets aren't big enough to properly adjust this remarkable book. <br /> <br /> Forsyth deserves much, much better than that. Avoid and stay in the book that is black-read.
