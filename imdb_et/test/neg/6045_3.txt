I had seen this movie a few days before Halloween. I noticed it at lunch and it was an interesting description in my menu so I decided to watch it. Seriously, only the movie suits the late night TV ... you know, after Conan, but before infomercials sorta. <br /> <br /> Although this film has very little to do with the web, it has a lot to do with spiders, see my section if you need to update. <br /> <br /> I find the idea of ​​the story completely exciting. Hidden nuclear generator, scientist and credible portal ... It would have been a good start in cool fantasy, but then it goes down in 15-20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Poor and memorable performances, a poor-quality queen who has sprouted her breasts ... whereas spiders don't wear breasts. In addition to the bad sound effect. Obviously a low budget movie, though cast has been tried. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> 4 electricians stumble at a hidden nuclear generator in the workplace. They refer to the buttons and open the portal. The portal has 2 employees and closes ... scrambling to find out what's going on, our world side has help when the other side monitors their surroundings. <br /> <br /> No help they open the portal and follow the meeting in parallel. They are facing the soldiers' name of the human spider race. After death and pursuit, they are saved by the survivors. <br /> <br /> Now it's boring ... they're hiding, talking a little, trying to build another portal and attack the hive. After losing 2 electricians, they open the portal and flee to our world ... about 200 million years ago. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting?
