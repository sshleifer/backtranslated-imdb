We rarely saw a movie that differs so much from its original assumption and remains (more or less) acceptable Bloodline is quite short (which is good in this case), which focuses on the mysterious Hellraiser box. Who wanted to do this and how it spell on the whole blood line of the person who finally created it. We introduce the 3 generations of the merchant's family (all played by Bruce Ramsey); one in the 18th century in Paris, one today and the last in the future galaxy far and far? Opinions about this story can be very different, do you think it is very idiotic and far drawn or original and dared. The original atmosphere and atmosphere of Clive Barker are completely gone, but the affected area remains and many sequences are still very horrible and uneasy. The Hellraiser: The Bloodline contains quite a few fine killings and the Pinhead (Doug Bradley) charismatic presence is still a horror value. Pinhead? this time with a pet puppy? still knows how too bad to kill that she speaks too much and her cruel speeches tend to get bored quickly. The best aspects of this production are the newly introduced "cenobiids" and the occult portrait of Paris. Huge deviations are a weak script, a lack of typical spooky humor, and references to Barker's original masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Although Bloodline is not very memorable, the latest movie to follow is Hellraiser. After this sequel, the series went down completely. Two more sequences have come out so far (two more are still in progress) and neither is worth it. Hellraiser: Bloodline suffered a lot of production difficulties and the director finally preferred credit to Alan Smithee. Who could blame him?
