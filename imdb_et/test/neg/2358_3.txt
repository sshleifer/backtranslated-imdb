If I hadn't got any expectations for this movie, he would have received 5 or 6. As it is, I'll give him 3. 3. Action is bad, the lack of real drugs is missing and I have some empathy for the empathy. <br /> <br /> Just before I watched this movie, I saw 'Adam & Paul' and I laughed and shouted several times. This movie didn't even hit a similar chord. Human traffic managers may have ecstasy experience, but there is no real drug-related semantic knowledge here. In fact, I find it rather offensive and counterproductive to shift the current drug laws to a less political one. <br /> <br /> Look at "Sequel to Dream" if what you are looking for is an amazing film about drugs.
