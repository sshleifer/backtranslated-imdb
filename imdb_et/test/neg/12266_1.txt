In about 5 minutes watching the film the first struggle I watched, I can just help but crush the lack of tension in the scene where the cameras move forward and back really show that he had no idea what he was doing, but actually the soundtrack shows it is the best. I'm not in my low budget movie and you're not going to get a top 40 song, but at least get the music that goes with a scene that's not really as hard as I saw that I'd like to let you know. the script was so badly written that it would surprise me a bit of a man who drove this record beep, i will give the person one 10/10 and it was with the cover of the dvd because when i actually saw the "before watching" store and it was like 10 15 bucks, which I would have bought it, why, well, if you look at the front cover, it's really well done when you turn back and see that it has actually won prizes. now, this is a very misleading thing, because even during a small film festival I would never believe in my life that it could win something I can say is "wow if it would be the best I wouldn't know what the crap movie was like "<br /> <br /> Films that have this bad are just one good way to use and this is an ambitious filmmaker who uses such inspiration films, has better tools than good movies because of a good movie you almost don't know is a good way to make a movie, but if you use such a movie, you can watch all the things that the director or the writer did wrong, so you don't make the same mistakes, and you have added the movie watching plus and telling you if you can make such a beep piece , there is also hope there
