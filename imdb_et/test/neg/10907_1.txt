Nothing about this movie is good. This is a formidable "romantic comedy" designed to make women compel their important others to watch. In other words, it is a predictable stylish flick that is neither comical nor romantic and is exceptionally forgotten. If you like watching the same thing over and over again, this movie is perfect. I was forced to watch it with my g / f and it is not surprising that we are no longer together. I enjoy great movies that are wonderful to watch while he just wants to see the same thing over and over again with different actors. There is nothing good to say about this movie. The title says it all. 1/10 (one b / c I can't give it to zero.
