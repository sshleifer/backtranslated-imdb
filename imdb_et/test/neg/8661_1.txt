Almost every fan of the periodic drama and its great fan of Jane Austen, I was terrified of this adaptation. As a fan of Mansfield Park 1999, I compared these two continuously and it was a long way off. It seemed very hurried and very one-dimensional, so it got bored very quickly. It seems that relations, especially with Fanny and Edmund, did not seem fine and despite the fact that they were in a beautiful place. Despite Jane Austen's season at Christmas, I turned out after that hour and went to sleep. I am interested in seeing the adaptations of the Persuasion and Northanger monastery, which I don't have a very loved version to see if they manage to carry me in this way.
