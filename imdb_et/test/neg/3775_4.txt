Veber is not known for his outstanding leadership skills. In fact, nobody cares when they laugh, quite a few to be honest, scattered throughout the process, thanks to the semi-nature of the Depardieu and the Veber dialogue in his mouth. <br /> <br /> But this is not enough to make a great comedy, because there is no movie in the usual Veber assumption: the harsh man is doomed to be very naive. In L'Emmerdeur, La Chèvris or Les Compères there was a real story about fire and water procedures. Le Diner de cons, though it was a game, managed to create a real skip for the next disaster of pony. In Thailand, the second is revenge feedback, both redundant and too weak to generate our interest. The advantages are on the screen as well as on the script. <br /> <br /> Now what's wrong? Veber breaks it up, creating some kind of action, no rhythm. Instead, he uses systematically and moves the ellipses (maybe he met in Hollywood with William Goldman), and "music" really emphasizes that the lack of nerve and backbone is a story. Depardieu results.
