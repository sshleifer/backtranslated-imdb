I start with just a few other evaluators that describe it best. <br /> <br /> "This is one of the most overweight films of the year and probably the worst movie Tarantino ever did." "The only good thing about this movie was Mr Waltz's performance". <br /> <br /> "So I was really frustrated and seeing this movie on # 40 is the biggest ever movie of all time, which leaves me open" Now read more about "Hated it" comments. <br /> <br /> One thing I hate for a movie is when he treats the audience as a heap. . (Spoiler forward). Now, I know that Tarantino's style is based on fantasy and fictional plots, but come, Adolf Hitler and 200 top Nazi officers take part in the film's premiere in occupied France, and you only have two guards in the theater and the surrounding area? If America also runs freely with steel pipes that lock the doors and put them on fire. These two guards are then filled in seconds, opening the door to our two "heroes" to kill Hitler's point about 100 laps ... very stupid. At least challenge our intelligence and create a smarter plot to kill one of the most feared tyrants of all time (Go look at Valkyrie). Moreover, the exploitation of the British generals of Mike Myers is more realistic and authentic than the one who makes Hitler, just a picture of it. In a movie that ends with a psychological and moody interrogation, the film can be fooled by the most meaningless characters. more bravery and humanity than our basters !!! Imagine that this is the case. <br /> <br /> If you have insomnia, 2 hours 33 minutes wasting my suggestions, or want to break your mind, check out this movie.
