A slow, odd film that draws and plagues (I really mean PLODS) with a climax of frustration. Finally, you can wait for a punchline, but there's no one. Both Milland and Snodgress are inconvenient; In fact, the magic of the film can be the only thing he does for that. In general, the atmospheric score has some absurd parts (like monkey playing the first time playing music) and is a truly terrible fantasy scene that includes ... gorilla. (**)
