This film deals with a struggling actor who is trying to find satisfaction in life, especially in the love he has not tasted for 5 years. <br /> <br /> It's basically a movie with a man with very bad social skills, and he's always saying the wrong things. The plot is hollow and busy. The protagonist James is lonely, but the subject of loneliness is not explored enough. It is rather an empty statement, from which other sub-blocks are derived. Sadness and disappointment after dumping are superficial. The film has a serious lack of emotions. <br /> <br /> It's not as funny as comedy. There's some funny one lining, but that's it. There is no happy and uplifting atmosphere to infect people with a happy mood. I can't find funny "I want someone to eat cheese".
