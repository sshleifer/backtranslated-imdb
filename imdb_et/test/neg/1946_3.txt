There was an interesting surprise in the film. Somewhat psychologically thrilling. And the makers would have been able to finish it tastefully, without simply turning it into a Hollywood movie, promoting homosexuality and / or other sexual abnormalities. It could have ended with "paying", but there were other motives behind the pen. What's on my turn is that your face starts to mud after you've seen the whole movie. Like disappointing "Talent Mr. Ripley". Yeah, I'm just another one. This gay content destroyed the whole movie. I would not appreciate a film of artistic or entertaining value if its sole purpose was to promote external political motivation, that is what it was.
