Robot vs Aztec Mommy was one of the smoothest and least believable films I've ever seen. O. K, I can buy that woman in the movie is a virgin reincarnation that was sacrificed to the god of the Aztecs. What I can't buy is that the incredibly fake looking mummy and even worse looking robot. If you want to watch such a movie, you want to see a lot of fighting. But the robot and the mummy are fighting for about a minute! Probably the worst thing was that they had an art that contained credit. It's the worst I've ever seen. Avoid this if possible.
