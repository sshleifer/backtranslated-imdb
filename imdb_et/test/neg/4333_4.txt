The author of "Prince" manages to take a great painful, decent story, mediocre script and carefully combine them into one boring, monotonous, amateurish confusion. Although Frank Nasso, the Prince, has a strong central performance, this scattered film moves out of the scene painlessly, painfully breaking into the hash. The result is relaxation at the end where the tears of joy should be. A long waste of time and talent, and a good example of how not to manage a movie. <br /> <br />
