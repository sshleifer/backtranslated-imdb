When I and my GF movie started watching, we didn't know what to expect, but he assured me he had good reviews. So I went with it. We got into the cinema and bought tickets and went to the screen. After a while, the film waited for someone else to go through the door. I was very suspicious because you usually get at least a couple of people screening for each movie. The film finally started and we sat there. After very little dialogue and so-called "arty" moody scenes, I began to understand why we were the only people out there. It was divided into random cuts for the main work for children in the skate park, a story he didn't think of himself. The child had to commit a crime if he did not, and if he did not, the writing of the letter is not an answer to anyone and you should not feel guilty just because you wrote this letter, he should have been punished. This movie didn't make any sense at all. I have no idea why we didn't go and get our money back through the movie. I tried to give it a chance. The concept of this film was scarce and the execution was shameful. The writer and the director, and almost everyone else who made the film, should have understood what they did and stopped. It's an hour and it's never going to come back. I'm sorry for everyone who liked this movie, but ... it's just so terrible, I mean really bad. At least I don't have to do it again.
