Don't tell me that this movie was funny or a little funny. It was a complete disaster and one of the worst films I've ever seen. Ali G is just a funny Channel 4 Ali G Show. After watching your presentation, I can tell you that he's not made for movies. There is nothing in the Daft script or any storyline that would leave you entertained. Filled with a tedious, unrealistic character, this movie is a complete garbage. At the end of the movie, Ali G gives a speech. He mentions when you hated this movie, tell people it was good. Even if the call could not save the movie, he probably knew it was smelly. I'd give it 0/10, but the minimum start is 1. Don't waste your time with this garbage in general.
