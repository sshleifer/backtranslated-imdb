Only saw this movie last night. I remember the hype of this release and to be honest when I looked back at it, so I might not have been so generous. I hate hype, it can destroy the movie. I think the movie set the characters and put too much emphasis on Woody. He was also good - though he thought he was stoned all the time. It never went too deep. Redford was in the dark, but not too dark and his character finally. For me, he would have had to be more in conflict with Demi - I threw him out or told him he was paid. After all, he would have studied them before starting the investigation - it would not be shown in the film, but no one would have made an offer to anyone in his perceived position. He was cruel by breaking them and the last shoulder was the house and Demi fell on him? The best part of the film was the sections that give an overview of Demi's and Woody's relationships. There was a great depth that precludes John Gages' character. He might have been much stronger and, as other people have pointed out, I think Redford was the drawing card for the films and they didn't want to hide their "picture". I say what the hell Robert was in this movie old! The characters of Woody and Demi were somewhat naive in some ways, but I think it was very deliberate to draw you to their situation and their decision. But the reality is that they lost their dream home and where did they go? Las Vegas? Play what little they had left, and then accept the extremely rich billionaire. I found my naivety when Redford attracted them a little unrealistic. The film could have been so much more and other actors would have changed, but said that late night on television - it was enjoyable and I didn't think too much - also tasty
