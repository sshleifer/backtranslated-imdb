Topic? Certainly. Entertainment? Probably - but only if you remove common sense from the viewer. Reality? Only so much that it was made on this planet. <br /> <br /> How thousands of people died in a 5-meter water layer in a city that was freely subordinated to buildings that exceeded 25 meters in height beyond me. Carlyle's line "How can anyone survive?" If there are buildings on several floors, the water is completely ridiculous. In addition, if someone commits to an area (under water) where one air cylinder is not sufficient (ie they die), why not use the simple purpose of taking more than one cylinder? It is clear that the writer believes that in stressful situations, people cannot read one (one cylinder, one floor). on pricing on the outer packaging of cellophane. <br /> <br /> Weak, truly pathetic and terrible waste of screen talents. <br /> <br /> Sexual propaganda, which shows that only women see problems to enlighten men's solutions, but more on PCs. It is a little wonder that the first blood, delta forces, naval seals and other, or, at least, irrelevant, films are always the same, while this blatantly politically motivated bilge is put on.
