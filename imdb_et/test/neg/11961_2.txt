I watched the first scarecrow film and didn't pull it out, though I knew it was a b-class, because in fact he had some good gore and the man who played the fear of bumblebees was an awesome acrobat and had some good skills. The effects were better and the costume seemed better than this film. <br /> <br /> I borrowed it open, I am also a fan of ken shamrock (former UFC superfight) and hope it was a decent film. <br /> <br /> The boy was wrong, the film was sucked, the monster was both in appearance and really scary, the story was so predictable that it was like watching a movie in preview mode, as I already think what happens, music was so a bad, terrible lipstick song that made me smile on the screen. <br /> <br /> Generally avoid this crazy movie. <br /> <br /> Save money.
