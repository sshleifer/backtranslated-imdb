I'm talking about this movie from two different perspectives. First, if someone sees a movie and never read this book (and may never read it). The other is someone with. <br /> <br /> (Film Without The Book) From the point of view of the movie, it was okay. Not nearly as good as any underworld, but much better than UltraViolet. And I'm not just talking about the line. Visual effects were beautiful in many parts, although the rebuilding of the wolf was very nice. The characters have very little development and Vivian didn't really care that his "love" killed any of his species. Some other characters could have had more air time, like The Five. The plot was similar to Underworld for my taste. <br /> <br /> (Movie with the book) As many have said, the title, characters, and some small parts are not a movie and a book. the same. In the film, Gabriel was much older and was Rafe's father (so Astrid was once his companion). The book was about 24 years old, Gab, who had never been mated with someone because the wolves lived a life (Astrid was trying to win his affection) and Astrid was Ulf's mother, not Rafe. Another important thing is location. The book was held in Riverview, Maryland. Also, why they moved from West Virginia is very different. In the film, Viviani's fault is present and his whole family was killed for that. In the book, The Five, named Axel, killed a girl from her girl. The hunters watched the wolves and killed many of them (including Vivi's father), forcing them to move. Also Vivi's mother, Esme, had a great character. <br /> <br /> One thing from a book that would have made the film better would have been a "slut dance". For those who do not know, this is a challenge where all females (women in the parcel) are fighting to see who is the new leader's companion (since there was a fight for men in the past). Vivian won it, trying to save her mother from Astrid (who is a terrible evil woman in the book) and so she had to be with Gab. There was no bet! Anyway, if you've read the book and you liked the book, I suggest not to see it.
