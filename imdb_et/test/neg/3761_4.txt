Although it may be very annoying from time to time, this movie is not so bad at all. Operation is pretty well done when stereotypical, and production values ​​are quite high, considering some of the Sci-Fi movies that came later in the decade. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with this film is some very outdated testimonials. There's a man from Texas, a "professional" scientist, and the worst of all the female scientists who finally understand their femininity. The film, which wants to express its opinion on humanity, loses its part of its effect by reducing its character through sexist stereotypes.
