"Tycus" is almost as bad as science fiction can go. <br /> <br /> I can't say anything good about this movie. The rooms are completely wrong. The comet should strive for the moon and cause catastrophic damage to Earth, but no one believes this predictive scientist. The entire mountain range, plus a nuclear missile launcher, is being built in the California Mountains without notice. When the comet goes to Earth, the news is made for TV and newspapers almost a day before the event. And so on, and so on ... <br /> <br /> There's also no emotion on the screen. Is the genius who discovers the comet and builds the underground city a savior of mankind or beast? The director or Dennis Hooper, who plays this role, does not seem to be decisive until the film is made, and in fact it makes no difference, because action and leadership are so confusing that you stop wondering what this film is trying to say. Special effects are so cheap that not only do they not convincingly convince themselves in the era of computer effects, but they could not convince even the 50s, four decades before the film was made. <br /> <br /> A waste of time.
