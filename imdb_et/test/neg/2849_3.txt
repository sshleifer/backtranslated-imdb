Terrible. Absolutely terrible. Long, confusing and careless. After about three hours, this painful mess ends up in the coffin's final pound. Even the wonderful, sexy, beautiful goddess Francesca Annis will not save the poor adaptation of Agatha Christie's work.

A complete waste of time and undoubtedly one of the worst adjustments that bears the name of Agatha Christie.
