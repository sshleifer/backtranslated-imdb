In the film, there is a point where the female boss of "death mechanisms" (who is an ethnic trio for everyone, inclusive, I think it is called these days) talks about using the leverage of a businessman. Except for this, his delivery is that it sounds like "skin care". At this point, the viewer saw that this dull film changed the corner of the new gift world. But it wasn't. The boss lady had to speak because the "death mechanisms" didn't say any words throughout the movie and talking. Immediately. There is action in the film, but it is not so exciting and the plot goes from one clich√© to another. Three silent "death machines" live to survive another day at the end of the movie. Hopefully there was no sequel.
