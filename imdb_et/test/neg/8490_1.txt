Is there a reason to revive the characters 10 years after the only reason they worked for the first time is due to their players. <br /> <br /> Who can replace Jim Carrey or Cameron Diaz - or better yet, who can replace them at lower prices, as most studios know that after-results will not bring the same benefits as the originals, so they cut the corner get-go of. <br /> <br /> Where good movies are going to play when powerful Hollywood studios can clog 3000 theaters that open the weekend with everything they know when the public can suck. Hollywood people need to work together or start distributing a much better foreign product. <br /> <br /> Wake up to Hollywood, cause people to be awakened and not buy it just to cause it new and shiny. Give us good things and send it to the rest of the DVD shelves, because we take the theaters all the time!
