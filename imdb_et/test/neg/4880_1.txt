I got this movie in a favorable binary, hoping for fun badly. The boy was disappointed. (except avon.) You see, the movie is really terrible, but so terrible, it's not even ridiculous. Plot, wait, there's no plot. I think you could say that this is the main character rising up in the ranks of street fighting. At the end of the film, the directors decided not to understand, or more likely to die, and the monkey had stopped directing the film. DO NOT READ THE RECOMMENDED SPOILED! although the end does not harm anything. The main player somehow arrives in rooms full of mirrors, entering a dragon, and then getting angry, he has a stupid kickback and strikes the mirror. End. Wheeee. <br /> <br /> The only redemption factor in this movie was Avon's scene. He talks to a competing street fight boss and says something on that line, completely dead: "Don't worry about him anymore. I've killed him in a complicated way. "At this point, the boss says" good job. You are number 1 ". And avon says, "Number 1! Alliiiiight! Alriiight!" The scene continues with avon, continuing to say "allride"! again and again. The next scene is floating in the dead Avon basin. Intelligent? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> Finally, I own the version of "Homeboy", which means "Homeboy" in my own box. It shows a great man with a gigantic gun and screaming. It never happens in the movie. This man is never in the movie. High quality. <br /> <br /> Note - I'm new to this review, but hell yes, I keep it.
