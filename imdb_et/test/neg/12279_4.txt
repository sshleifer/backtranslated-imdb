This film is very violent but exciting with original dialogue and cool letters. It has one of the most mobile stories and it's very alive. The film begins with an action star with Leo Fong, who is a policeman who is approaching the end of his career when he stumbles upon a big case involving corruption, black writing and murder. Here are the killings. From the start, the supply of the Fong will end in seeing the action capsule. This film also includes Richard Roundtree. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie as a child, but when I got older I realized that this movie was pretty funny and not very good. I do not recommend this movie and the action is very bad.
