First of all ... I have to say that this is not very good. Miranda Cosgrove is the main character, but she is not so good an actor. Spencer, his brother is so much a better actor. Spencer is just my favorite character because he is probably the only one who knows how to act. Conversely, Carly tries to get her heart out, but ... I'm sorry, it's not just good. Sam doesn't even get credit, I mean fire ... ICARLY ... pretty central? Freddy is not bad, I have no comment. I have to add that Carly and her doll Sam are changing their attitude towards filming a website, they scream out all their lines. This is sorta bad effect because Carly is a web show and when children copy it, Maybe they give their information and not pretty safe. <br /> <br /> The only nice thing is that it has some funny parts that make it entertaining. At least this exhibition is not boring, it has beautiful plots, quite strong. Many children love it because they are not looking for mistakes. <br /> <br /> Generally, it's a bad show, but it's not boring.
