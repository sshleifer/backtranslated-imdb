We chose this as part of the Brentwood kit under "The Broken Skull". This movie comes straight to a video that has very different sound and light qualities. This film comes in hyperactive quality that can inspire the viewer to become nervous, confused and irritable - and not in good "Evil Dead" ways. br /> <br /> Without entering spoilers, it is becoming increasingly complicated and strange to start with a simple revenge-ghost story. While there are some interesting ideas here, the overall effect is likely to scratch your head and say "hunh?" <br /> <br /> This is a very expensive movie. Gore effects range from the whole bloody head device to the stupid Video Toaster effect, which must be frozen with a frame to believe. The level of "Fangoria" in this film is extremely amazing and should probably appeal to gore-hounds by making someone weak in the weak constitution. <br /> <br /> The Broken Skull is also an extremely noisy movie. Not only does it contain the surrounding noise (caught by mike and not replaced in the post), but there are many ailments. No, no, I mean a lot. Much, much! The characters scream, scare, flutter, scream, hit and laugh maniaally. Turn down the volume when you rate your headphones and nerves! But you can't make a mistake for their enthusiasm, they really eat in the landscape and sometimes the effect is quite fun. In particular, the actor playing a certain Vietnamese immigrant offers a significant amount of all the above. <br /> <br /> In fact, very few actresses were made of wood. Some of them may have been a bit overpriced (oh, just kidding!), But most of them are definitely fun to watch. The cast is ethnically diverse and commendable for filmmakers. Two middle-aged white women, however, are the two toughest and most irritated symbols from the MST3k classic shopkeeper "Brute Man". Just check out all the other characters, it's fun! <br /> <br /> At the end, Headcrusher may not turn into a horror icon parallel to Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers or Freddy Kruger (or even Leprechaun). , but we can definitely say ... it was a movie.
