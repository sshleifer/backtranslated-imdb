This film gives an overview of the family experience and healing that comes with the death of the child, which eventually comes to them. <br /> <br /> The family learns about his son's death on Christmas Eve, 1991, destroying them for Christmas. They won't celebrate it for years. The daughter is an interesting comment that reminds viewers that in such a situation the needs of surviving children are needed. <br /> <br /> Matthew's character refers to Jesus, but I suspect that he will come from other non-Christian sources. I don't know if other viewers would know these comments. If that is the case, it would be an interesting addition to the details of this movie.
