These days, Ridley Scott is one of the leading executives and producers of huge amounts of bullfighting films - especially since he has films such as ALIEN, GLADIATOR and BLADE RUNNER for his credit. So it is obvious from this partial list of credit that he is an amazing talent. However, if you look at the very early effort that he made at the film school, it is probably difficult to say that he is assigned to greatness. This is because although it has some nice camera work and style, the film is hopelessly boring and enthralling. However, given that it was not meant to be released to the general public, and it was just a training field, I am ready to look at it in charity - hence the 4th score. <br /> <br /> The film is part of CINEMA 16: European Shorts DVD. This DVD has 16 shorts. Most of them are not big because it contains a man without a head, COPY SHOP, RABBIT and WASP, it is an amazing DVD for short film lovers and it is worth buying.
