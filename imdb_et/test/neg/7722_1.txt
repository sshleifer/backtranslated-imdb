This is one of the most terrible movies I've failed. Don't make me wrong, I love good zombie folding, but it wasn't one of them. <br /> <br /> ... Maybe (at least from the opening scenes) it was called "Titty" in the outer space zombies. It had nothing to do with another movie or video game (as far as I can say). <br /> <br /> The best aspect of a movie is how the two main characters get so much blood covered and remain so. I would definitely recommend giving it and leaving it and staying safer for a zombie like '28 days later 'or' living dead dawn '(of course if you are not a serious campy).
