I only watched this movie when David Dhawan had been waiting for that entertainment. <br /> <br /> David Dhawan.he's bad return has made many funny movies in the past that didn't make any sense, but none of them was a stick! What was the waste of talent and beauty? Donno why the participants are willing to make such a movie. <br /> <br /> There was no practicality in this movie. The movie is down par. Standard and potential Bollywood is. <br /> <br /> The only thing that needs to be seen in this movie was Katrina, but we don't have to watch such a movie to see her! Being a Hollywood remake, Hitch makes it clear that Bollywood directors can't even make the right remake. I see this as the worst movie I saw. Awful 1/10
