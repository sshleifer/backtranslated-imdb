I wanted to see this movie because I liked "Kavkazskij Plennik" and "Brat" ("Brother") with Sergei Bodrov, Jr and Vor ("The Thief") with Vladimir Mashkov. Unlike other movies, "The Quickie" was a waste of time. A story that makes little sense, very uneven behavior (Lesley Ann Warren was particularly bad), a really terrible dialogue, bad cinematography that could still go wrong? I find it fun that, for virtually every American film, when foreigners of the same language (in this case Russians) remain alone, they prefer to communicate with each other in mostly broken English (and if they speak Russian) for some reason, translators are obliged to add sentences , which is not pleasant, literally or non-verbally, much "f ** ks". At the same time, native English speakers speak Russian. Why so? Back to the story, most movie sub-platforms (such as house betting, inviting Latin American paramilitaries, etc.) make no sense and do nothing more than confusing viewers. It is too bad that Bodrov, Mashkov and Leigh (all good actors in my humble opinion) participated in this disaster.
