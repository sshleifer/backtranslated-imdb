Before seeing this masterpiece, I would never have guessed that a devastating and terribly contagious virus could have been destroyed by Lutheran prayer ... and "erbide". The result of Ralf Moeller is huge; Realism glowing. I was so inspired that I would fly to Zambibwe tomorrow to break the pesto and get my hands on the wealth of the Third World. God blesses this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I have to look at Troll 2 and Anus Magillicutty just to believe that it is possible to create more confusing dialogue. It is so tortured that taking a cheesecake in your fingers can be better than sitting through it. The only success that it can achieve is its little hidden racism, because poor islanders are turning to an ineffective foolish collective prayer that does not reach anything before Ãœbermenschlich, a linen-covered German hero, Moeller, who has a direct line with Yahweh, is able to provide a blood sample of the horn. Blowing yankee scientists can work and save unhappy natives. This movie sucks.
