Well, <br /> <br /> First of all, as many observers have pointed out, this is to discard the story of Martin Cahill - first the BBC and John Boorman's film "The General" - which is a great movie and far, far better than that. <br /> <br /> Speaking of a native British person, Kevin Spacey's support was really good for both British and Irish actors, especially Peter Mullan - but it was completely wasted. The characters were c ** p! And, like Kevin Spacey, it didn't come like a beloved scammer, but nothing really important or important. <br /> <br /> There is not much to redeem this movie. The best bits are from other movies that have been ripped. Compare this movie and "General" notes - I'd be interested in what others think. <br /> <br />
