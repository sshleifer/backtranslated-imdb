I looked at the first few episodes a short while ago and I felt that I couldn't take it anymore. The scary looking scenes are the worst I've ever seen in my life. About one-third of each episode is dedicated to Flash Gordon and his "powerful" fight. I know that the choreography of this era is not exactly in line with today's standards, but it is ridiculous. They don't even try to make it realistic. Flash Gordon, who hardly resembles a fighter, uses his drunken slow motion and naked fist to crowd four or five men with knives, weapons and other weapons. Leave me alone! There is also a scene where he does the same in the water. Basically, every episode has similar scenes. As for the rest of the episodes, I don't remember much more. I looked curiously, in principle, which science fiction looked like 70 years ago.
