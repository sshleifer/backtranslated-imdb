If someone tells you that this picture is just terrible, they probably have something to do with either doing it or getting the benefit of it. This movie is a real loser and it copies situations from big budget horror movies and not to mention soundtracks. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. It's a low budget movie with amateur actors. It seems to have been filmed for a film competition. Action is terrible and I won't be surprised if the script is written by the Hee Hawi script writer. My family laughed. Grade ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ all the time. You're not afraid of that. Here's a little taste of the horrible elements of this movie. When a man gets his toe Ricomp's foolish image of Reverend James Johnston's walking rack. The reactions of the boys are similar if he had amputation without an analgesic. Watch DVDs after watching a movie. If you see Ric White and others who talk so seriously about the movie, you laugh until the stomach hurts. How people pull the truth and what they do to earn an unfair bit. Don't let yourself be deceived as we did and buy this mistake.
