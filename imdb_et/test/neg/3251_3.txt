I usually give queue suspicion and I can easily go to them. But it is very bad. Exactly the same thing that happened in the first movie is here again. Exactly the same. Only they wanted to see the younger children (this means Bugs Bunny's repeated presence, but why did they throw into one of the "f * ck" that is outside me). <br /> <br /> They didn't even bother to change Jackie Mason's character in Dangerfield. Let me explain that in CADDYSHACK Rodney Dangerfield played a tough property owner who announces dense members of the Bushwood Country Club. In this film, Jackie Mason plays a disgusting real estate owner who proclaims dense members of the Bushwood Country Club. The great effort they made to change the contents of the script? No, I don't think so. The very unpleasant Dan Aykroyd copied Bill Murray's character disgracefully. He even goes as much as Murray after the gopher (now more like Gremlin). <br /> <br /> There is no laugh. An example of "comedy" in this film: Jackie Mason is preparing for a hot date with Dyan Cannon. She's in the bathroom is her rope. She moves to the door to dress her bedroom when the door handle breaks. Wow!?! That's the best they can do. Eight years to think completely new and it's all! I could have pulled a better script from my ass. <br /> <br /> Look at it only if you are a fan of the original. This is the only way to laugh at it. All others are clear.
