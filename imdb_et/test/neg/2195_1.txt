When, when, when does Hollyweird write a decent film around computers? I can't believe that people consider this movie a reliable story. <br /> <br /> No computer operating system could ever survive such a tedious scrolling interface. It may be good on the screen, but if you really tried it, you can go to the nuts. <br /> <br /> With regard to tracking people, you can't do that easily. Network security alone would prevent it. The keychain registration was at least ridiculous. <br /> <br /> With the allegedly installed software, no system administrator would allow such critical software to be installed in the production system until it has been tested, tested, and tested again on the sandbag system. <br /> <br /> But probably the worst part of the movie was "virus." There is no chance that a single operating system will run on another system. And in the case of a virus that can be removed from the mainframe, it takes a few seconds, it just spurs faith. An open remote connection has no way of using the required superuser access to allow system files to be deleted. <br /> <br /> I could continue but I can't bother. <br /> <br /> Porn is a better thought plot to make a bunch of rubbish.
