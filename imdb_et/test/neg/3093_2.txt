I was sucked by big names. Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles, Burt Reynolds and the fact that it was an independent film. Incredibly slow start: 35 minutes, two tough songs and botched rip. I don't care about the characters, and on the plot I was never tempted to even pretend it could be realistic. I can't believe it's doing it on the screen. I loved watching this movie because it seemed as good as it was.
