It seems to be one of Noel Coward's lesser-known movies and it's easy to understand. It's not a bad film at face value, but it's not very good at all. There's nothing going on in the movie, it's just a story of Chris and Leonora's bad thing and Barbara's reaction about it. The only thing that keeps the movie interesting is that we already know that it is bad for one reason or another because of the first scene. Strangely enough, the story of conflict has many perfect possibilities, but none of them are used. For example, it would have been more interesting and more credible if Barbara had crashed with Leonora, but the two remained good conditions throughout the film. Barbara's concept, which her friend had betrayed, hadn't been studied at all - she didn't even feel her husband betrayed; he even encourages him to go with Leonora. Also Chris's two secretaries in his practice, Susan Birch and Tim Verney, who are close friends of both Chris and Barbara, have never been forced to take over. In fact, Tim goes away from the conflict, saying to Chris that he has been lovingly loving him and Barbara. Despite the strange lack of conflict, the biggest mistake in the film is that we don't care if Chris comes to Leonora or Barbara. Anyway, two female personalities are indistinguishable, so we don't know which one is best suited to Chris, and moreover, Barbara promises to give the impression that she hardly cares about it. In addition, I found the relationship between Chris and Leonora somewhat unconvincing. I can't forget a ridiculously short time when they fall to each other because it is so common in films of this era, but even then it seemed low. Coward's character was too harsh and cynical to be the subject of Leonora's affection. He reminds me of the socially incorrect genius of Sir Earnest Pease's "Very Important Person" - I'm sure these two would have gone well. Chris's frustration and savings made his love unknown to Leonora. I think Coward would have had to sit it out and give it to a younger man - as it was, I was constantly thinking about what this young beauty saw in such a puzzled, mostly emotional, bald day in the Middle Ages. Despite all of his criticism, the film succeeds - it's just not terribly convincing. The fact that no character is particularly well developed gives them a mysterious character that is somewhat intriguing. The amazing heart is definitely worth it, but it's a crazy movie.
