The goodbye of a gift is intriguing. American "deserter" (I had the impression that he and his three comrades were trying to escape the Philippines only if their desperate escape to the raft in Borneo is not your classic desertion). But not sooner will they come to shore if they have discovered Japan. Nolte's character (sergeant) has been beaching alone for a while, and they didn't notice. And incredibly, no one noticed the traces of his sand that would have led the Japanese right to him. But anyway, Nolte has taken the peahunters tribe and becomes their king after winning with another tribe. So he's out of war. Then the British teams appear and want the tribe to help them fight Japan. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Nolte's unremitting loot will destroy an interesting story. Instead of acting like a former soldier pulling back to war, Nolte acts with the warrior tribe under his command, as the tribe brought. He speaks like English is almost a foreign language, rarely using contractions. He speaks when he speaks, and acts like he is with nature, as if he was grown in the jungle. <br /> <br /> British interacting with Nolte has many activities and many interesting scenes. tribe. But the nature of Nolte is never credible. He always seems to be overwhelmed. He had to be a little more American soldier and much less a tribe. As he is, he does not come, not as a regal king, but as a crazy one who has forgotten who he really is. But this is not the purpose of the film, because the script is admired and trusted by British commandments. There is never a suggestion that the British thought his behavior was strange. By the British, he is simply seen as a tribal leader. So it always seems that Nolte's character is not compatible with the film that should be in the film. <br /> <br /> Another actor could have done a great job with his role, gave his lines credibly and made it a great movie. But Nolte destroys the film, grabbing every scene and appearing that he doesn't understand what his character should be. <br /> <br /> What a waste.
