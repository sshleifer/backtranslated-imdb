The film begins in Latvia immediately after World War I. As a history teacher, I knew that during this time many Russian troops had occupied international forces. Because of the proliferation of Boolhevism, there were serious troubles and troops seemingly protecting the interests of their peoples. Sometimes they fought with the Communist army with armed conflicts because the countries concerned really wanted to see the so-called "white" victory. The whites, however, were deeply fixed - some wished to return the Tsar, some wanted the republic, and some wanted something. Due to these mixed goals and the lack of real commitment from the foreign army, the entire expedition was doomed and left the USSR in just one or two years. But I didn't know that German troops were involved. It surprised me because they had just lost the First World War and were not in the best shape on such an expedition. <br /> <br /> This is the background of the movie, but it is also a rich lady of communism and her bad love for a childhood friend among German troops. He throws him away repeatedly, but in any case he's restored. So he sublimes these wishes with different things. Although none of these sexes is graphical, this and the reason why a man is not interested, makes it an adult film and one that I would not show to a younger audience. <br /> <br /> This movie is interesting, the overall movie is as gray and lifeless as I have seen. I do not recommend it if you are not surprisingly patient or you are actually overpriced in German films. In particular, I warn against suffering from depression as it will undoubtedly make it worse. The simple thing is that there are so many better German films to be expected - like MOSTLY MARTHA, DAS BOOT, EMA CUSTOMERS, HIGH, HIGH, FUTURE NETWORKS or ALI, FEAR EATS THE SOUL (among others).
