And again, Columbia Pictures simply decides to make "hash" using the original version of Curly and without revenge or joking. At the end of this shameful flick, when Joe shut up during the flight, the studio didn't make much effort to re-record the sound when you listen carefully to get the Curly going "Woo woo woo woo" here. Even when Moe and Larry throw a darts to "shoot down the bull so that he can get out", it is raised to the right of the original, because you actually see Moe and Larry "magically" 15 years younger. Why oh Moe promised all this to happen? This is a burning question that will probably never be answered because, as far as I know, he was quite sensitive to any criticism and had quite high standards for his work, as did Larry, Curly and Shemp. Don't waste your time on it.
