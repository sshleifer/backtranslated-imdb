First, separate the story from the movie. The story of another ongoing war in heaven is good, very good. Religious thematic films are not the main choice of many people, but the angels of war are. I really loved this story and some of the images that were designed to back it up like an angel field with studs. The real movie was poor, I can't find any major character - the priest-cum-cop is there at all. Leading female ... there is no reason to be there, dialogue between the main characters was just empty, it had no substance, the story could have been told to them. Now, some of the silver performances had a function, Walken, Stoltz, and Mortensen pulled out some wings, although their scenes were mostly with inanimate leaders. American natives rituals to clean the dark soul. The child who carries it is obviously of American origin, but after the final scenario, there is no such legacy here. The plot of the dark soul, barely speaking, is strange, given that the dark soul is the prerequisite for the whole film. The attack of the original owner (Colonel) is briefly touched, but it is not enough to understand why his soul is special. <br /> <br /> I can't find a lightweight landscape design. this film also has several plains surrounding the "chimney". I feel they had a helicopter and wanted to make the most of it because no shots are of any importance and not in harmony with the mood -> Horror. The film falls into the sci-fi category more than horror. There was no real shock or scary scene, some light gore and blood, but not an element of fear. <br /> <br /> So, in addition to the three roles played by the damn well, this movie is very big. Unfortunately, dud-factor weighs a good working factor, just too many weekend participants.
