--------- SPOILER ALERT ---------------------------- <br /> <br /> It was the most worse is that the political satire is hidden as a horror and is as thin as a sledgehammer, not very scary and not very sensible. Does Micheal Moore have anything to do with this trash.? <br /> <br /> I am very sick of Hollywood using entertainment as a political campaign against George Bush and repeating the same point again and again. This movie wants to be DeathDream, but unlike this movie, which was a little bit of a problem, the soldiers who came back from Vietnam, making the main character smart zombie and slowly on the subject: this was a real horror film that was also a good social comment because he could not consecrate, exploit, and preach. <br /> <br /> I think Joe Dante thought it was trying to make a horror movie to scare Republicans, Conservatives and Liberals, and the last one on that list found that this movie was totally ridiculous, manipulative and exploiting all at the same time and I don't mean a good type of exploitative, often found in "drive-in" type movies, I mean exploiting in the most sick and whimsical way: using our soldiers' deaths as a manipulative political statement hidden as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> This film assumes that all soldiers who died in Iraq would vote against a conservative president when they come back to life as zombies, which is a false premise because, as I usually recall, George Romero rules; Zombies are foolish, meat-eating creatures who work on a pure impulse, and while the zombie in Andy, DeathDreamer could speak, he couldn't really talk and was motivated by his dependence on human blood. Okay, zombies are pointless creatures driven by impulse and not intellect, and probably they're dead, why should dead people first vote? The interpretation of this movie is that the only war a Liberal Democrat can win is to vote against him inadvertently, dead people, I think they had to say that people who vote for the President, such as George Bush, are pointless zombies, while real meaningless zombies are actually those who decide intellectually. Yes, whatever. Dawn of the Dead dealt much better with this idea, but the user was a useless idea of ​​consumption. This film is not Dawn of the Dead of any stretched imagination. <br /> <br /> The film deals with this problem, while the soldiers are alive that most of them voted against Bush as president, but after death they would vote for a liberal anti-war democracy if they are zombies who are usually considered as dead brain creatures and ridiculously destroyed after the vote. <br /> <br /> When you make a zombie movie with Mr. Dante and use the name of George Romero, the better ones are meaningless zombies who want to defeat people and eat their guts, not zombies that vote. I also like the way zombies go to the "evil" Conservatives who support the war. <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie with social commentary, leave this badly done, preaching spam and watch DeathDream. /> <br /> The worst fear Master Master hands down.
