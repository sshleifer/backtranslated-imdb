Now really u call that movie. I knew some movies that the Japanese people are not good at, but is it bad? I mean, I fell asleep three times with this movie. There is no horror, some small percent (0.2-0.5) comedy. Action just to admit that it has some, but the scenes are poorly filmed, actors are pathetic. No participant did a good job in their role. They were not convincing. The script is also terrible. I mean, this movie can be great, really, but for the 60's (not 100% sure.) I suggest not seeing it if you don't want to be so bored as I did. I can't get pretty hot when this movie got a rating. It's over, over, overpriced !!! This is of course a personal opinion. I don't want to offend anyone, but who could like that mess? So I hope this helps someone NOT lose any time to enjoy this movie. However, it is your choice!
