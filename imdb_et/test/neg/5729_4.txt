"Red Sonja" is faulty, weak and incomplete. Even camp training is not good. There are only two good things about "Red Sonja"; Costumes (although the red Sonja costume is ridiculous. It is ironic that a girl who even fears that men touch it because she was raped still chooses so few clothes, even rain.) And music. by Ennio Morricone. However, the film is somewhat observable but certainly not recommended. <br /> <br /> The story is extremely simple and they didn't bother to be interesting. The story could have been forgotten if there had been some good sequences of action and some humor, both of which are present, but are seriously wrong in many ways. The film takes itself too serious and tries to impress, but it doesn't work completely. <br /> <br /> Brigitte Nielsen is a terrible leading lady. I don't know who is the accent? He or Arnie and on it; He can't act. There is no chemistry between the two characters that makes the story of love completely unbelievable. Even worse, Sandahl Bergman was the main villain who was worse off than a paper bag. Ronald Lacey was somewhat good in his role, but my God he looked terribly, he changed as much as his (only known) role in "Raiders of the Lost Ark". Maybe he had something to do with his illness, which claimed his life in 1991? And by the way, what were the participants of all these "Raiders of the Lost Ark" films? Beside Ronald Lacey, Pat Roach, Terry Richards and Tutte Lemkow, a role appeared as a "lost Ark" rider meeting. <br /> <br /> The only time a movie got a little interesting is during the (sword) fighting, although some of them are unnecessary and weak. <br /> <br /> Fans of the fantasy genre are truly observable. <br /> <br /> 4/10
