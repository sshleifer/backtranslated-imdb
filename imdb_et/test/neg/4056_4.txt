Softcore is not a mistake, but it's pretty clinical - a lot of nudity, but it's all fake (of course it's always fake - it's a movie, but you know what I mean). There is no sexuality or eroticism, it is all random nudity and bad that act with one another as "lust" and sex. <br /> <br /> Part of this is of course your personal preference. These women obviously have some body problems related to their flights, tattoos and silicon - not to mention that too plastique and skinny looks are so if it's your thing - great, you can see it all here. <br /> <br /> I think somebody expects a great deal of expectation when looking at such a movie title, but for many people it would be pretty much like watching cyber gases ... they seem almost real, but it's really horrible.
