I was actually planning to see this movie when I noticed it in my TV program, but after about 5 minutes the time definitely decided to be more valuable than "Who is this girl" could ever be worth. Describing how bad Madonna's action seems impossible and the end result is one of the most annoying characters ever captured on the film. This crap is an insult to movies and intellect. I almost never! rate a movie that I don't see from start to finish, but in that case it's impossible. 2/10
