As Paul Kersey ran to get rid of the actual relatives, the third installment of death is returned to New York to visit an old war dog. He only arrives to find out that Brooklyn became a completely resurrected gangland, and that the youthful tongs killed his friend and constantly terrorized all other ramshack apartment tenants. Kersey reaches an agreement with a local police commissioner, captures the heart of her blonde lawyer, blows out a lot of bad guys with an impressive Wildey Magnum weapon, and gradually trains and inspires the resurrected New Yorkers to stand up for themselves. Okay, there's no point in protecting the "Death Wish" series after seeing the third part. The original 1974 was a masterpiece that turned to social drama as much as it did, and even if it was pure exploitation, the other half had quite a few redemptive qualities, and at least the events were logically related to the first. Thirdly, it often seems to be a completely separate franchise. Apparently Kersey is no longer an architect, he's ten times more social and conversational than ever before, and maybe no one, not even the police, is against the action? All these changes and many other aspects make it clear that Michael Winner and Charles Bronson reduced their "Death Wish" success to be a purely brainless and exploitative activity with an increasing number of deaths in every episode that changes more and more into explosive and criminals nastier, sleazier, meaner and much harder to kill. However, gentlemen did not realize that non-violent violence actually produces the opposite effect, namely, it is extremely monotonous and much more boring than the previous two. I repeatedly read a review that referred to "Death Wish 3" as a pure definition of cinematographic masturbation. This description cannot be more on-site because the script moves tirelessly from one reluctant execution sequence to another. Especially the last twenty minutes is a complete "orgy" of fire, explosions, and executions, realized by self-made improvised measures. Yi-Haaa! This series has a very interesting supportive casting, including Martin Balsam ("Psycho", "12 Angry Men") as a neighbor of fatigue, who keeps his gun in his closet, Ed Lauter ("Family Plate", "Longest Yard"). ") as a somewhat unusual copper and even Alex Winter (" The Great Adventure of Bill and Ted! ") in his debut role.
