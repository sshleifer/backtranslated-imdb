Okay, I like to give in. I watched his show. <br /> <br /> It's not funny for me. All I remember was a lot of "weird" voices and shouting. I don't think I'm even smiling. The only thing that resembled humor was his Anjelina Jolie / Jennifer Aniston. I think you can see it in a minute, you look at it. <br /> <br /> What is "Ask White?" part? Is it "Ask a Gay Dude? / Black Man?" Chappelle from the show? Isn't that so clear? But when Chappelle did, he revealed the ignorance of this topic. Like Borat. But what happens to the selection and shouting of random white people? It's not funny, it's just plain. <br /> <br /> And I'm pretty sure I heard some "jokes" from somewhere else ... he seems to be funny as he is "plagerizing" bits and pieces that throw in some "loud" screaming. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it wasn't funny. Seriously. Don't even waste your time.
