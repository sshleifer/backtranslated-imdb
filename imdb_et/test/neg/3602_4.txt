Here we have a standard Disney direct DVD track where I expect all beds to be cut in all areas, resulting in a pretty animated movie that goes beyond the original. This does not mean that it is a terrible movie, but it is a very mediocre movie full of preaching messages that aim to show friendship with each other and be pleasing to one another and if not done finely (what it is not here) can quickly thrive on adults . The film has a very thin line with Kronk, trying to get his father's approval and finding the true meaning of prosperity and success. It has comedy moments, but it's not really a full-length movie.
