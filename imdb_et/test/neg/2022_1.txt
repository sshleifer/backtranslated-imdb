Space is vacuum, right? So space sucks. Vampires suck too. In fact, a bad vampire movie in space would be twice the suction power, right? <br /> <br /> It started with what could have been a fun prerequisite. Bram Stoker's Drakula story will be reused in the future. There's a rescue team sent out to investigate a ship that has disappeared in space, called Demeter. Fans of the original novel think inadvertently that this will be a direct extract of Dracula in the future ... unfortunately, if the names of the characters are not shared, it will go to the low lane and will go to the B-film galaxy twenty minutes later when Coolio becomes a vampire. Trust me when I tell you that he is the best actor in the movie, and that doesn't speak much. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Dien should sunbathe his products on his television. Erika Eleniak should have left Baywatch after leaving and the poor Udo Kier has problems reading the smart cards. The man who plays Dracula is more ridiculous than Frank Langella in the 1970s version. If you manage to sit through the whole movie, you will be rewarded with the worst end. The end makes wonder whether the actors and the team realized what garbage they did and left the kit. <br /> <br /> Vampire fans. It sucks twice as much.
