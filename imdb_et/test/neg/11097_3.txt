The size of the Eiffel Tower is a confusing, pointless script with holes in the plot. All involved are terrible - an exception! A ridiculous and cheesy dialogue. Flat tests of humor and romance. Extremely cheap special effects. All of this makes the movie a gigantic mess that would be better avoided.
