Twenty or more years ago, Charles Bukowski was my hero. I looked blindly at the image created by different types of intellectuals and in different films. Of course, I could never answer the intellectual types that Bukowski heroed. Typically, they can be found safely at the desk in hipster video shops and record stores. These people hardly talked and asked, they usually asked and nodded in an uncertain direction. They were useless when they found a specific title, but their shelves were always equipped with strange and unique titles. I believe that in order to invade a secret hipster club, I had to support my civic building and counterculture. celebrated by Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunnaway. I was a Rourke fan at that time. He also embodied a sort of modern male fantastic anti-hero who was an intellectual type. At that time it turned to me. The Barfly hero despised the convention. A race living in the mid-thirtieth century, living without a bond, does not answer anyone, - Oh - and being recognized as a genius by a hot female literary snob that is left on the cake. Later I read the post office and Hollywood, which is later experienced with Bukowski. Now let me move on to a newer film based on the Bukowski Factotum, which I read and enjoyed. In this novel, Bukowski is in the form of Chinaski. I often don't know where Bukowski ended and Chinaski started. 20 years after Barfly, the fictional film Bukowski is still the same. I was watching the movie for about an hour and I haven't seen the signs of cleavage on the facade yet. Here's why Factotum Bukowski was my hero. Chinaski is beautiful (played by Matt Dillon). She's pure clean hair, designed but not up. When Dillon smokes and writes, he looks cool. Chinaski goes to work, ignores and / or fights with different bosses. He screws two buoyancy, one of which he lives, walks through, but returns with little rebound. Chinaski is his own man and we never see him. He is sterile, one-dimensional, 30 something, the archetype of James Dean. Factotum is on the viewer. This happens so that the person (writer) has no idea. A poor man suffering from his art. What could be cooler than this? Now let's say that Factotum has the truth that the events happened. What the audience is missing is the pain that Chinaski exists. Perhaps the thing about this movie and most movies is that it takes 80 minutes. We have to flee from a world full of consequences and pain and resurrection with a social female woman who smokes, speaks, cools away from drinks. One who rejects the usual behavior of work and family. My hero was previously a film Bukowski. It would have worked a long time ago. It was easier then. Now, I still have to demand a hero. Things are not that simple. Hyper-logic and film transmissions of counter-culture icons do not provide solutions or even questions.
