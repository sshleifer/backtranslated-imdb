I only write more because it's necessary. But the summary I have is too cinematic for this movie. You know pretty much who's from the beginning. In spite of efforts to plot and twists - making "talents" who are trying to hit hard, and when the twist happens, you never have to think about this "mystery." <br /> <br /> The more I write, the more I feel bad I have to write so much to comment on, but the rules are rules. I feel it bad, but it is the lowest I've ever appreciated for a movie. This makes me think about what I save with 1 and 2 votes. But I thought this film was worth 3 because I believe the film had some talent. Johanna Watts (or Watson) did a good job. She wept and tormented in one part, and I thought she had conveyed this emotion well. The man who played the "drummer" character also made his short part. Many actors did "ok" work. But the leading actor David forgot his surname (with terrible names) - was pretty bad. I think he had to think that he was doing dramatic exhibitions of "Youth and Unrest" or "Days of Life". If you try, you can just depict her on a white lab coat, playing with a doctor with many people in a general hospital. It doesn't help to make the movie even like a daily soap. While I'm pretty sure I can take this film with the camera; though without the obvious and soap-like sound editing. I wouldn't look at it again if I didn't get big money.
