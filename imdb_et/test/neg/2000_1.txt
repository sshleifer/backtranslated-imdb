This is my first comment about the movie here. I have to say that all the bad movies I've ever seen, including, for example, Braindead, are really WORSE! I promise. Don't even look at it. It is boring, bad behavior, bad script and plot, bad effect of the whole movie is one big piece! If I could give 0 to 10, but since the lowest is 1, which is terrible, I have to vote for it. But I would say the film is worse than terrible. <br /> <br /> Don't hurt yourself by seeing and hoping for this movie because I can tell you, it's a habit! I was hoping that there could be one scene worth looking at. Good scene didn't come at all. <br /> <br /> What a great piece. And Coolio Vampire? LOL! LMAO! YARGH!
