If I decided to try watching a movie about cryogenic zombies ("cryoids"), I didn't expect much. That's exactly what I got and then even less. In addition to the lack of special effects (squibs?) And the absence of serious shortcomings, The Chilling also sports the absolute worst script I've ever made for a movie. In the first 45 minutes, I had to stop the tape several times to improve my intellect damage to see such a terrifying dialogue as found here. <br /> <br /> Moreover, collecting characters is both formal and one-dimensional, it's ridiculous: a corrupt doctor; his assistant, played by Linda Blair (we know he is his "assistant" because he refers to him repeatedly with this title); a recently widowed businessman whose heart is golden, who is developing a romantic interest in the nature of Blair; his criminal son; Alcoholic, abusive, unemployed boy from the Blair character we introduce to the most modest use of rebound; and, of course, a hard-hitting, hard-working beard who becomes a hero. Obviously, the preservation fluid used by some cryogenic laboratories on their bodies is very leading, which naturally causes a disaster when all laboratory containers reach outside (Halloween night, no less) in a spectacular sequence of events. As for the zombies themselves, if you enjoy people watching green latex masks in aluminum foil suits, "Cooling" is a film for you. Zombie action is very weak; The primary method of killing the zombie seems to seize people on the shoulders and shake them to death. The businessman and security guard make most of the zombie struggles, including the extremely stubborn scene, where the undead is frozen with liquid nitrogen. Let me tell you that the "T2" steel factory scene has nothing to do with "The Chilling", which depicts an enemy who has been frozen in his tracks. <br /> <br /> How Linda Blair ended in the middle of this dreck piece is really a mystery. True, his career did not rise (unfortunately) in the 80s, but this film is embarrassing for him. The script doesn't even have to use it well. The most, when his character is given, is that it takes out things like "Here they come", "Do something", "Hurry!" The only thing I think is that the poor Linda was compensated for her work on the food portions of this film. The hero is played by Grizzly Adams himself, Dan Haggerty. In this picture he faces a strong competition with his beard and security dog ​​and he does his best to overcome them both. <br /> <br /> The only frightening part, The Chilling, is an introduction that highlights the factual elements of cryogens and suggests that "the movie you see could be in your own community". As I read how many times the names of the closing credits were repeated, I was on the floor to suddenly see Lucasfil. Fortunately, it was just a movie sound. 1/10.
