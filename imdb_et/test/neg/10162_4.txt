In the 1930s and early 40s many "spooky" western countries were made, and although it has a strong start, it is not one. Randy Bowers (John Wayne), who stops in the Halfway House salon, finds it full of corpses, the barman's body is draped over the bar holding his arms, eyes are looking behind Randy's eyes cut from the back, and the player's piano plays "The Cute Night of the Year. <br /> <br /> This was the result of Marvin Black's gang abduction to get Ed Rogers $ 30,000. Randy is a researcher who "works alone", who wastes little time in arrest, escaping (with the help of Ed's daughter Sally) and literally landing behind a black gang hiding area. It all moves quite quickly. Only one too much sinks after Randy's slowdown. <br /> <br /> We even get George Hayes, a clean shaved and playing two parts - Marvin Black, a villain in wool, as well as a good citizen, Matt Mute, who interacts with handwritten messages. Playing two opposing roles was a good idea, but writing messages really quickly, even for him, because he finally gives up at the end, saying, "Ah, I'm tired of it!" You'll find George playing whistle, whistle, double cross teacher The Lost City series (1934). <br /> <br /> I think this is the only Lone Star movie whose title is related, or mentioned in the movie! Sally offers her hand to Randy and says, "She's no longer alone!" Then cut your hands around each other as they look towards the lake. Sally, who has run off with Randy, seems too steep and not ready enough. Too much time is spent on escaping from the sheriff to the horse keeper. <br /> <br /> Not as bad as you think, but not so big. I really would give it 4 and a half.
