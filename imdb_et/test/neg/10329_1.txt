This movie is # 1 on the list of the worst movies I've ever seen, where # 2 is "Lessons for the Assassin". <br /> <br /> The actor is sad (sorry, Sandra Bullock, but even your performance was terrible!), the music score could have been a bad x-rated movie, and that story was ridiculous. It was a common film: the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of one syllable words. However, contrary to the average feature film, there was no real action. The only reason I watched it was that at one point there would be at least one interesting scene in the movie ... <br /> <br /> Thumbs down on it.
