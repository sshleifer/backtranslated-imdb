The most positive points of this film were credit (text style) and a few moments at Ice-T exhibitions. Story; Two competing gangs, who have to fight against it, with treachery, power, and subtleties of change, are well-worn plots, but in this case, it is (very) sinking. Destructive terrain, which at times gave little credibility and questionable lighting, continually disturbed all kinds of interests / characters (actress tip / nose shine was dazzling, not to mention other scenes with the same problem). even halfway through the film, I wanted to know more about how and why it came about, not what was happening on the screen. Disappointing when you see Ice-T in other roles. Tissue to other actors / actors who looked weak despite their role; Corruptive sideburn and another restaurant worker.
