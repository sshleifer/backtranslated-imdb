I sat all for 2 hours. I don't know what was worse, a terrible plot, flat characters, or a Hawaiian hottie that Eddie's 11-year-old child and 80-year-old grandfather made sexual progress. The money spent on it was simply put under the throne. Matty Simmons should be ashamed. The original idea of ​​this film was "The Swiss Family Griswold" and it somehow became such a mess. The only bright spot is that its ratings were so bad that we never see it on TV. OUT OF ALL ... RENT ERNEST SAVES XMAS or anything else.
