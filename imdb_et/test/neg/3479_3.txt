In this pretty flat Italian film, it is worthy of some appreciation for the nice special effects of Rick Baker-esque and Deran Seraphian. Cerchi gets some credit because most of the other Italian directors (Ruggero Deodato, Sergio Martino, Lamberto Bava and Enzo G. Castellari) have moved on to lower-key TV. As for plankton, this side of Piranha is the half thing where people become monsters, rape women and cause general chaos. The film's extremely wretched, weak and sexually sensitive feel makes it difficult to enjoy. Available only in Italian print jobs that float around.
