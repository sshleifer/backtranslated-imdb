This is the ultimate Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie I've ever seen! I give too much credit to this movie! My best guess for making this movie is that somebody wanted to show someone else's martial arts abilities, but realized that you didn't just get a guy fighting with another man and people watching it, so he made the story behind the fight ... and people still didn't look at it. This act was funny and stereotypical for every Kung Fu movie. Duplication was literally the worst thing I've ever heard. It seemed like you played a small role in this movie, such as a fat boy or two men trying to catch the main character of the net. It could have been dyslexia with an insecure stotter and no one would have said anything. But next to it, the film is somewhat fantastic to fight. <br /> <br /> Fighting scenes were definitely what this movie was. But the incitement of fighting was completely absurd! In most cases, the guy appears out of the tall grass or looks at the distant protagonists and then attacks him. But when the fight begins, things are balanced. However, there were only two things that really prevented the fight. These continuous "wooshing" sound effects that were added to every fist or leg or sword, and poor editing, made 25 percent of the struggles very nervous. Someone would be in the middle of the flap and then suddenly hit the ground and then back to their feet, blocking the punch. Although editing editing and pasting was rather distracting than anything else, it didn't affect the overall movie. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it wasn't a great movie, but I wasn't expecting a big movie. A big movie is not something you should expect when you see a movie like this one. Everything I saw in this movie for five and a half years of boredom. I rarely say this, but it was just one of those movies that you practically do not use, so you look at it whenever you have free time. Enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it! Good day gentlemen. <br /> <br />
