Missed this cinema, but was always a little forced. I found it out of my local video store to throw in two bucks! Will I give it to anyone who wants it now? Obviously! There is no purposeful plot, one-dimensional symbols, much better films in the plastic world, not a proper dialogue. Do you know an empty feeling when you get off the ecstasy? This is the feeling here. The sad thing is that Australia, I know, is moving in that direction, minus the melodrama and the simple answers. It's only interesting to see older Aussie actors (who had to go back to ACT on their day) as compared to the newer Aussie actors (who note!). Like some terribly harsh narrative introductions to a movie clip that never starts ... Bad Kylie, started her career as an actor ...
