The dark, pointless film should turn to South Rednacs, teenagers whose IQ is bounded by a slow and average Bush support. Noble Willingham plays a leading role in this simple script, which he uses and uses an excellent dose of MFers, doing it and eff it and SOBs. The end I was expecting was that hollow story was the biggest backlog, leaving me hanging and thinking, "Why"? <br /> <br /> This is a cat and mouse story or more like Bully vs. victim. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time if you don't like to listen to your phone every 2 minutes and keep calling and shouting all the 123-minute trash bin.
