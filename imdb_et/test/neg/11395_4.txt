After watching this movie, I thought they really grew up in the life of Errol Flynn! The movie is really a pleasant eye candy. They really got into the atmosphere of Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s. The costumes were great. All the women seemed glamorous and all the men saw the beautiful and the dim. <br /> <br /> Is this a serious movie about Errol Flynn's life? Nah! It's a fun movie based on all the scandalous things she did in her life. <br /> <br /> Why am I criticizing this movie? This is a film that had many promises, but could not offer it. Duncan Reagher was very good as Errol Flynn. He was not as good as the original look, but he thought that Flynn was not just a beautiful playboy who didn't take himself seriously; Flynn's love life was a disaster, as he had so many failed marriages. He also lost many good friends during his lifetime. He also suffered from insatiable love for elegant Olivia DeHavilland. The last scene in the movie showed that Errol was begging for Olivia to stay with him and walk. She is shown in her tux, looking really empty and slowly around the pool as she pours her drink into the pool. It was a sad way to end the film, but such a match, because everyone now knows how he finally left the alcohol and his dispersed lifestyle. <br /> <br /> This movie can be much deeper, whether you've been well-written. Of course they showed all the scandals, but they never showed Errol Flynn's human center. Surprisingly, Duncan Reagher was somewhat emotionally deep in the character of Errol Flynn, although the writing did not make any depth. <br /> <br /> I will probably never see this movie, but I can still remember after watching the movie, "Gosh, it could have been so much .....!" I'll give this movie D +.
