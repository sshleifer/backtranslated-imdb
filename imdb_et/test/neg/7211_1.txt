"Direct Video" is a phrase that never sounds promising to the consumer unless it is a direct video next to something that was originally directly on video. Nevertheless, the studios have demanded the distribution of direct video clips that have spread over many years of culture. I do not think that it should even be mentioned that these after-effects belong to the worst titles of all time, including HITCHER II, STARSHIP TROOPERS 2 and CRUEL INTENTIONS 3. It is suitable that ROAD HOUSE 2 was directed by Scott Ziehl if he was also a man who was responsible for destroying a series of cruel intentions. Like his entry into the trilogy of cruel intentions, Ziehl takes elements that made the first ROAD HOUSE an excellent dude, and repeats them without any success. It's not a sequel, it's a new road. Repeatedly different original lines, the intersections are cut and pasted, and scenes are copied from the first shot. One thing that couldn't be duplicated was the amazing fighting scenes that made ROAD HOUSE what it was. Here, we get terribly targeted combat sequences that are either too short or too long and seemingly planned and shot within one hour. Compare it to your predecessor's fighting scenes, which look like they were preparing months and months. Ziehl is able to lead the action as he did well with the remake of the 2001 EARTH VS. SPIDER, but none of the talent shown there comes through this confusion. It's not entirely his fault, because the scenario is very, very badly written and junk. I don't care if something goes straight to the video, but it still needs a good script. Someone should keep this mind while continuing to take their DVDs straight out of their small budget. Leave it completely. 1/10
