Top scroll! Top scroll! This is a great Gay Bruce and his big Gay Death Cannon! Reliable plot? Needed! Decent action? Needed! Respect for his mighty predecessor? Needed! Yeah, it's another maliciously stuffed turkey in Butch Bruce's canon. <br /> <br /> How do you start with this movie? Okay, let's start with the misconception about what people might think it was in some way related to either the book or the original movie The Jack. This is not. In fact, it is so different (and so bad) that Fredrick Forsyth asked to take his name away. Now, I am not necessarily a British who can't do Hollywood British movies. Well, okay, maybe I'm a little like that, but luckily this is a point in this case. This film is so different from the original that the name and odd reference are the only ones that survive. <br /> <br /> Now we're going to the assumption. The Cheesy Russian gangster is killed in a Moscow police attack (somehow the FBI is involved, although no one doubts why). In case of revenge, the gangster decides to imprison his brother by killing the spouse of the US President (although nobody encourages to explain why it is a good move, though fair, it was 9-11 so he didn't know it would have led the US Gangster hires a "nasty" killer (Willis) .The police rent a "cozy" killer (Gere), a "cozy" killer chasing a "nasty" killer. Police fanny around and regularly killed. "Cuddly" killer kills "nasty" killer. The first lady is saved and we all realize that the IRA is the real cute boy who knows who just wants to kill innocent people. Nice. <br /> <br /> Let's make a terrible Hollywood habit to play on one side In Northern Ireland's concerns, as was the case in the sandbox of the theme park (I will deal with this in more detail on the message boards) .If Hollywood directors want to give the Belfast butchers the gift of the gold hearts, it is up to them to decide. This is a free country. <br /> <br /> However, it is a deeper fact that the film succeeds in patronizing and offending Ireland. It's not politically unpleasant, it's much worse: it's incompetent. It is no wonder, for example, that Gere still looks so damn, because he's been up all six months when he took that cra * p. The fact that Gere's accent is not just a dreadful parody of South Ireland, but shows that filmmakers were not looking for money from this movie beyond America. Then this is a fun place where Sidney Poitier (a complete waste of space in this movie) says she's for coffee, offers to get our "cuddly" IRA person, then randomly says, "Ah, but you guys drink Guinness, you don't ". Yes, that's the right Sidney; Irish people live in Guinness and potatoes. <br /> <br /> While we're on Poitier: why? In the original movie the detective is watching. Jackis is Gere's watcher. What does Poitier do? Well, he just hangs around and looks like tw *, of course. She has absolutely nothing to do after calling the sailors at the end, and she only does that because a nice IRA man tells her. <br /> <br /> While we are on Gere: why? I think this is only a matter of time before Hollywood makes Gandhi again when Vin Diesel plays the former Mujahideen Commando Mahatma Gandhi, who pushed his way through India in the 1940s and 50s (after all, it is a bit darker and therefore probably a Muslim fundamentalist) . Let us not forget that Gere's character is a killer and therefore a nasty job. And if he's not, why does he know Jackal? If he is not, why does he know all his moves? And if he is, why is he a butterfly cookie and such a "lovable" person? All this shows that the makers of this movie can not be disturbed (a) to think of the plot (b) to have signs of decision-making that were in line with their character (c) avoid cheesy stereotypes like a big boss bad guy to kill his friend ?? I honestly thought it had become a Bond movie (s) to give "central" characters something to do with (e) credit to the public with intelligence. <br /> <br /> This movie is a British offense and the Irish have killed the terrorists, it is an insult to the Irish people, an insult to the big, but pretty good film it hangs, and an insult to intelligence. But most of all ?? and the most unforgivable? it is an insult to me, because I need to sit for over two hours, which took me to the end. To be honest, you would not think without a plot, no characters, no dialogue, no time. But they didn't even have a good desire to leave early.
