I'm very surprised at the good rating of this movie. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie 9 years ago and I still remember how I would be angry with the movie in the theater and look at it. I'm a big fan of John Boorman's work. I like her movies. So I went to "Beyond the Rangoon" with great expectations. But I felt that I was watching a fool, cheap Chuck Norris jungle movie, where all the activities were cut out. Even the soundtrack was very annoying. <br /> <br /> I can't believe John Boorman was a director because this movie was so badly made. I think the people of Burma deserve better films to illustrate their struggle.
