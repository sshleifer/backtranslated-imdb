Cheerleader's massacre was supposed to be the fourth installment of the Slumber Party Massacre series; if they do (what he is considering as the actor's original return in the role of a small comber), they have failed and made "quadrilogy" by far the worst. Cheerleader's massacre seamlessly combines a bad actor, a terrible plot, a stupid killer, a dull and boring death, a boring landscape and a tough camera that makes it one of the worst-made movies. Did I mention how bad it was? Don't do it wrong: this cheesy and slow-down excuse for the horror film is not as bad as the Napoleon dynamite, but it is undoubtedly a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Cheerleader Massacre is the exact polar opposite of the original Slumber Party Massacre. Stay anywhere! This movie is the perfect garbage!
