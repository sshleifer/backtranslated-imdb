Let me say right now that I am not a very artistic person and that I do not get a new art. Nevertheless, this movie is totally crazy and I think it is not a good way. The film is completely black and white filmed with a very loose series of stories. The film is open to those who can look at contemporary art and say "wow, I feel the energy and passion of this painting." The only reason I give this movie is three out of 10, because I managed to laugh somewhere, though mostly smelling the movie was useless. Two characters casting a chair on the lawn to do what these characters did, I have no idea. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
