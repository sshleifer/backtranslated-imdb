"Dogmatic", as the other reviewer described this movie, is the right word. The idea of ​​the director was to present Bach without a plot of land, actors, amusements, theaters, dialogue, narration or drama. Mission accomplished, Monsieur Straub. "Pretentious?" Yes, yes. "Cinematic?" Not possible. It's an anti-cinema. No one moves. Hardly anyone talks. The camera keeps static frames for 10 to 12 minutes at a time: the camera slides in from time to time. You can get a glimpse of Gustav Leonhardt's fingers that move over the keys. That's right. <br /> <br /> If you like to catch a stapler (counterfeit) in 7 minutes while listening to Bach, it's your movie. I would like to listen to Bach in my stereo when my eyes are closed.
