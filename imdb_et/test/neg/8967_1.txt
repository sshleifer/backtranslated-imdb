It is really a fool, which is a disorder - about as bad as Hepburn plays a Chinese woman in DRAGON SEED. Lead Hepburn Games is a combination of Granny from Beverly Hillbillies and a Healer of Faith! This movie is even worse than Bogart's Swing Your Lady, because at least Bogart didn't play mountain biking - they were just surrounded by them. The dialogue sounds like Li'l Abner's band! Indeed, the problems do not end with outrageous casting because the plot is completely confusing and the "love story" can hurt your head. For some reason, WHATSOEV, married to Robert Young, falls for this Ozark bobcat. Was it his lovely person who won his heart? I doubt it as the name of the fiery "saliva" movie and it really seemed like a pleasant fight and a scrappin and a holler! Was it her feminine charm? Without a makeup and a fashion that looked like a Kettle design, I doubt if it was. Eventually, Ralph Bellamy eventually fell for him, though again it doesn't really make any sense. <br /> <br /> So here we have two urban forests. The unexploded, feminine smile played by Hepburn - this is a good recipe for the movie!
