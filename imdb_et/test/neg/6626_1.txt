Is this a bad movie? Don't take my word. Think of the following press reports from people who tried to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> · When he watched this movie, Harusk Faber, Sandusky, Ohio, forced his brain out of his skull for 200 kilometers an hour and before he hit the floor reversed NOOOO NOOO NOOOO. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Louise Robbins, a 69-year-old pensioner from Oklahoma, a 69-year-old pensioner who made this ritual during a watch with a foam. <br /> <br /> South Carolina Columbia Janine Hosmer was born to a seriously deformed child while watching this movie, although she was not pregnant. <br /> <br /> · Watching this movie, Mr and Mrs Lawrence Wells, San Francisco, California, spontaneously exploded with such force that Mr Wells' left tibia was later found in the building on the wall of Marini County House. <br /> <br /> There have been many similar cases. <br /> <br /> Of those who did not suffer more serious consequences, as described above, after watching this movie, at least 75% became immodest, violent and understandably crazy. Of the remaining 25%, most were already crazy when watching the movie; the rest were either blind and / or deaf or with a permanent vegetative state. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying you don't want to rent it. I just say what was in the papers.
