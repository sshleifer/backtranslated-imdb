Spoilers are plenty. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> I was deeply disappointed, this is my first STREET FIGHTER movie I've seen (I dare not go closer to the 1994 joke). Very little attention is paid to STREET FIGHTER ZERO (ALPHA) and not to most of Japan. The struggles have been fun over the ship (Shun versus Zangief was more widespread) and dramatizing is too spirited, especially to the end when Ryu has to control everything in his fight against his brother. <br /> <br /> The main street fighter, Ryu, has weakened a much darker version inside. The frustrations of checking this darkness are compounded by the unexpected arrival of the younger brother! The shady street fight tournament is more than just fighting the promoter's mind. <br /> <br /> What is the artist's feet drawing? All the anime drawn over the stomach is impressive. The soft nature of the story makes the STREET FIGHTER genre too intelligent and puts much more emphasis on the character (Shun), not even a fighter in the video game! Additionally, the original character of the original STREET FIGHTER is ignored completely. How many times did you send Rolento? Adon? Dude? STREET FIGHTER ZERO lacks the imagination of a video game.
