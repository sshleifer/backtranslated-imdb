Take a couple of dark and stormy nights, the fog coming from the coast, obsession and suspicion, two brothers with mysterious anger, suspicious disappearance, a shining cigarette lightly glowing at night in the shoe, and finally, a tremulous heroine who finds himself threatening as much as his own doubts if one - but what? - The men around him. Sounds like we'd have a good 80-minute noir. Instead, under the leadership of Vincente Minnell and Katharine Hepburn and Robert Taylor, two A-list leaders, the Undercurrent is a nearly two-hour melodrama, a long threatening threat that is completely groomed, stripped and dressed cast. If you look at your watch half of the movie and with a painful heart you will see that you have one more hour to go, both you and the film are likely to have problems. <br /> <br /> Minnell, along with his earlier non-musical movie, is not as strong as he is after the Rococo House. However, what is basically simple greed, murder and obsession, has become an endless Katharine Hepburn vehicle. Hepburn shows us carefully illuminated close-ups on how to show fear, love, anxiety, nervousness, happiness, doubt, suspicion and fear. Robert Taylor is more or less a ride. <br /> <br /> Hepburn will start the movie as a fearsome Ann Hamilton, an energetic young woman who will help her father with his inventions. Their housekeeper has decided to marry. When Dr. Hamilton decides to sell Alan Garroway (Robert Taylor) an important formula, this love is at first sight. Garroway is a smooth, beautiful and dynamic inventor of the Garroway Intermediate Controller during the war, who has made it a manufacturer of hard-to-load millionaires. He's the captain of the industry because one of his many Washington friends says. However, Ann Hamilton, now Ann Garroway, may be a bit of a tomb, but her husband shows her how to dress and how to be a successful social hostess for all those congresses and judges she knows. She learns fast and eagerly. They both are apparently and blissfully in love. But wait. The cannon will cope. Ann realizes she doesn't know anything about her husband's family. None of his staff or friends seem to be inclined to talk to him. When he learns a little about Alan's mother dying on the piano in an old family in Middleburg, or having a brother, Michael, who is missing, Alan becomes very quiet ... and sometimes gets furious. She always apologizes. But wait again. Did her mother play the piano? Didn't he die in bed? Didn't Michael try to take the family business and Alan sent him away? All of this is played by the magnificent hotel suites, the horse stables and the delightful beach house by the sea. Everything in the movie, except for the employees, is dressed in nine. Twenty years are an exclusive cocktail party and intimate dinners. Even the black and white movie can't help Minnell, but gives us dining tables that are full of crystal and Chinese, delicious and elegant furniture and lots of clothes. At the end of the movie, when everything is finally known, when a horse on the horse Ann is a horse that is a horse on another horse, if she is a threatened death dragon and her chaser ends up with a horse's death, it is a relief. Even Robert Mitchum, who plays Michael, is unable to bring much tension to the film. What could have been a tiny little B-film in a small hand, instead of the A list, is just a burnt melodrama that is too big for your bones.
