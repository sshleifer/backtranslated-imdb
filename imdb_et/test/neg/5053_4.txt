I did half of this movie and realized that I didn't care about how it ended. Basically, this is a cumbersome teen comedy that I just watched because I like Helen Mirren, who is actually a very impossible cruel teacher. <br /> <br /> The movie's basic idea (or say in the first half) of the movie, because I don't know - or take care of - how the other half goes) has been done before, especially 9-5, and the comparison between the two shows how thoroughly Tingle does it wrong. You need to feel that things are out of control, so you feel that events are inevitable and you need to have well-defined, interesting characters you care about, and you don't have it. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it never grabbed me.
