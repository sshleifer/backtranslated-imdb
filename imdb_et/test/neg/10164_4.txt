Randy Bowers (John Wayne) comes to Half Way House just in time to take a break and discover the bodies, including the man he was supposed to deliver - Ed Rogers, business owner. He follows the dead man's sister, Sally (Alberta Vaughn), behind a hidden room where she was ignored during the killings. <br /> <br /> "Randy Rides Alone" was directed by Harry Fraser. He uses the method of filming here as in his other films, where he transmits an action from one place to another, usually involving a horse rider. It's pretty well done and seems to be a rather innovative Lone Star Westerns in their 1930s. <br /> <br /> Pre-Gabby George Hayes is in the hands of sans whiskers, and this is the first time I saw him as a snare. In fact, it took a couple of scenes to realize that it was his twofold role: first as the irritating businessman "Matt the Mute", who communicated with a pencil and paper, only to make Marvin Black, the leader of the balloon group. The Black Gang was responsible for the killings of Half Way House, trying to sell Sally to Matt / Marvin. Here is another major player, Yakima Canutt, as a black Henchman named Spike. Interestingly, Yakima was a long black woman named Sam Black named after Froner / Wayne's Neath the Arizona Skies. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of time between Black's Gang and Sheriff killing horses. like John Wayne's character maneuvers to expose the bad guys. Finally, he saves the day, securing Sally Rogers for thirty thousand dollars at the destruction of Half Way House, where he swaps some dynamite sticks safely. Ahned Marvin Black is trying to open it with his six shooters and the explosion is the end for the villain. With his best "Aw shucks" attitude, John Wayne falls under the spell of Sally Rogers and unfortunately Randy is alone!
