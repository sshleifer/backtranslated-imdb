Up and down the career of all kinds of movies, this is the Altman one who is trying to sci-fi, and it clearly shows that it's not his forte. <br /> <br /> The film is practically incomprehensible. It seems that the experimental theater pretense and the big studio trying to jump into the Star Wars attack seem to be a catastrophic combination (not that this film is modeled after that, but you can imagine that the studio signed a lot of hope for Paul Newman's sci fi movie). The story is non-existent, the characters stay alien to us all the time. <br /> <br /> Altman has dogs feeding dead bodies throughout the film, obviously struggling to make some point. But since the film has been so badly thought out, starting with the lack of a plot, it is actually nothing at all. <br /> <br /> The planned production is confused, photography is blurred edges and the score is terrible. But "Quintet" has one redemption function. Not only is this film clearly filmed on snow and ice, it is also kept indoors in the cold. You can see the soul of the participants in each scene. You really feel cold.
