It's really one of the worst movies ever made - and I don't want it in such a bad-good-kind way. Eddie Murphy is a great comic and it is a sign of how bad this film is that it almost punished her career. Writing and direction are wrong, kits and productions are as imaginative as Brady Bunch's episode and actors show how bad it is to have excellent casting when they have nothing to do. If this were not the case for costumes - which, apart from Eddie Murphy's ego, seems to be the bulk of the budget - you would swear that this matter would be hacked by a number of higher education institutions who wasted peppermint pills. The fact that everyone can find this travesty in a funny or entertaining way is amazing. It is probably not a coincidence that the wrong souls who praise this stinker are hardly literate. But if your idea of ​​fun is Della Reese, who dropped her "pinkie support", first leave her fool and go to the movie.
