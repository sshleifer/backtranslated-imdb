I agree that this film is too pretentious and it is not easy to know where it goes. I've been teaching literature and film for years, and I find this film one of the most appreciated, according to some previous reviews. But let me remind you that this is the same director who has L'ora di religione (my mother's smile) for her credit - the pearl of the movie! <br /> <br /> Did he try to review Fellini's 81 / 2rd here ???? The dog scene, which is also mentioned, is absurd and excessive? just one example. Others take up too much space and some reviewers have already mentioned them. Generally the most frustrating and annoying experience!
