Fast Recovery: Almost nonexistent, poorly selected musical soundtrack, continuous cam filming takes place without a permanent but lots of coffee and hyperactive operator, NO plot and nothing happens. The film goes from one dialogue to another, sounding hollow, never reaching the depth, never creating the illusion that you are really a conspiracy within the conspiracy, and all-on-an-affair - everything is just a boring excuse to show the main actor's nice underwear. (which, along with his rusty voice, is definitely a nice but not the basis of the movie) For me, the highlight is a scene, and this movie has come down to the point where I just wanted to abandon the movie for about 45 tracks. I'm sorry I'm sitting.
