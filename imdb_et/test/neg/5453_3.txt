I've never understood what Karen Black's attraction was. He always had these beaded eyes and a kind of strange look at him. He often seemed to be eccentric or cast into a "second" woman. It has a psychological advisor and a knowledgeable expert on bad advertising producers studying astral design. He's an average mammal, even without new luggage. Obviously, this is the path of immortality, because if you do well, you can live in the bodies of future generations. I believe Star Trek had a plot with Jack Ripper who had been hanging for several centuries. Anyway, this man is really dangerous. She has a nice family and makes them unhappy. He starts murdering friends, just because they have an uncomfortable comment on them or he doesn't like them. You can see the end that comes from the left on the back. It's a very tough, humorous movie. Most of it must be taken. Why are some invited but few selected? I found it to be long and not very satisfactory.
