This film had the biggest advertising campaign ever in Russia. "An epic film about Russian culture", "Great Saga of the Russian Spirit", endless articles and interviews. For me, this film was the biggest disappointment. Oleg Menshikov's main character is a stupid immature boy who is ready to make his companions for a woman who doesn't even look like a woman. What's there to admire? In the first part of the film, the story has not evolved at all. People's festival scenes look like Russia's horror. .
