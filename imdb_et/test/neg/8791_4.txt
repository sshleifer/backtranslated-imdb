A ridiculous film where two swinging college graduates move to California and one gets the star of the film and the other one becomes his director. a TV show where women compete for their affection. <br /> <br /> The film is unpleasant and ridiculous. Girls who love a boy are stupid. Only one girl seems to be the manufacturer of the exhibition. She is really an amateur who is against another woman, but she is healthy and also has good ratings for the show. br /> <br /> We know that Ryan was actually meant for undergraduate studies. Although the ending is somewhat cute, you really know where it happens.
