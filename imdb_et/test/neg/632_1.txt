I did my best to see this two-hour fiasco. It combines the terrible special effect of the original "Blob" with the "Runaway Train" scenario (outstanding) scenario. The only explanation for this film is that someone needed a huge tax credit and thought they would combine it with a blow that offers a casting couch. What an incredible stinker! Lou Diamond Phillips wants to show us why he's taking part, no matter how bad. Barry Corbin continues his career as a top scorer, US Senator from Texas, and plays it well. Next, he should lead the story of Trent Lott or Jesse Helms. The women of this flick seem to have created their roles as consolation prizes at Fay Wray Memorial competitions. Special effects are incredibly bad. H.S. children in the film class in North Dakota could have done a better job. Writers have to be drawn from the cliff bank to gather it. I could no longer keep track of being forced to sit in the Clockwork Orange chair. I have no idea how it ended, except for probably 119 minutes too late. Ugh! Caveat emptor.
