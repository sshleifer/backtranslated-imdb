It's not a good movie by standards. It is very poorly written and the actor is just a little more than a parameter (some performances are much lower, but Swayze and Gray do a great job for a little work). <br /> <br /> What was good: <br /> <br /> The dance sequences were choreographed very well, and as noted above, Swayze and Gray were high points. <br /> <br /> What was bad: <br /> <br /> Script. "Bad" guys were just too evil to be credible. The best villains are those who are not so evil. These guys (the owner's nephew, the waiter who impregnates the girl) do and say NOT to leave me to believe they can be real people (maybe there are such boys, but I don't want to see a movie about it). <br /> <br /> The second scene, the first, where Gray and Swayze meet when the resort's staff are "dancing". Swayze and Gray are dancing together and are happy. Next time Swayze meets hostile ones. Why? What happened sometimes, that he wouldn't like him, so if they danced well together? <br /> <br /> And some of these lines, I mean COME ON (I dropped at the end when Swayze muttered the line "Nobody's gonna let kids go in the corner." /> Another thing is wrong, 1960s. Everyone saw and dressed like the 1980s! Who was responsible for costumes and hairstyles? <br /> <br /> The music (original music of the movie) was ridiculous (except "I had my life time", which was a good song). <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've ever seen but most appreciated for CLOSING
