I've seen many - maybe too many live videos, no budget movies, and I've created a taste for "good" or those who are less fortunate than ridiculous as it sounds, hahaha. DR. CHOPPER is what I want to refer to as ... an absolute mess. Nothing is enjoyable - the actress sucks, the characters suck, the killer sucks, gore is minimal ... and sucks. It is a group of college friends who travel from a recently discovered family that belongs to one of the parents of a child. It's designed to be a relaxing retreat, but they don't know a little about the death of a former plastic surgeon who went badly with his two female assistants to look for the tissue to use to save the doctor. His name is Dr Chopper because he is driving around a motorcycle and of course with a carbonate. It's just a terrible movie that's not worth anyone's time. That's enough.
