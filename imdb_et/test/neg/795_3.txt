Before you leave your post "don't get it", I say I'm one of the biggest fans of Richard Kelly and "Twilight Zone" out there. Donnie Darko is one of my all-time favorites and I even thought Southland Tales had moments. I'm a big sci-fi fan. I was very excited to see The Box, couldn't wait until it came out. <br /> <br /> Having said that ... "Box" is terrible. "Drag Me To Hell" was the worst film I've seen in 2009. And it just doesn't stop! If you think you've come to the end, the second plot has changed and you are no longer tortured. At the end of the movie I was silenced in the theater ... I hardly took it any more. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with "Box", no matter how you cut it or try to justify it is that it just doesn't make sense. Trust me, I got it, I realized what was going on. But that doesn't mean it will change it a lot. Take, for example, the basics. The main couple ... Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, who play Norma and Arthur Lewis. Diaz loses his finances in his workplace, then complains to his spouse that they are "wagey". Well, sell this F-Ing Porsche, which your husband will drive then !!! They live in a nice 2-storey house in a nice section. Marsden is working on what seems to be a high-paid job at NASA and Diaz is a teacher. And yes, Marsden drives a too expensive car. But are they somehow living? No need to press the button. Just cut a little more expensive lifestyle! The film would have worked better if they showed a couple of unemployed and serious debts. Instead, they are seemingly desperate for money ... living what I would call a luxurious lifestyle. As I said ... you understand what's going on, but it doesn't make sense! It's a rare combination. <br /> <br /> The library had a terrible scene that feels like one of the worst segments of film history (terribly too horrible). It was idiotic, illogical and inappropriate. I can't even describe it completely, so I'm moving to a sub-block that includes nasal bleeding and body aliens. (Yes, I'm sad, really). The child is in the Diaz class, where the face is evil and a smile (a bad smile that seems to be completely unnoticed by all those in school). He asks Dias personal questions, literally embarrassing to his class. No punishment is given to the child ... he didn't even ask to talk after the class! Then Diaz is a party ... and the same child is one of the hired tools ... an ironed shirt, an apron and everything! I do not know that many alien children (who appear to be in the Junior High), who are also in the moonlight as a coach at the sponsorship of teachers and school officials ... but we found one here! (See what I mean ... you can understand it completely, but it doesn't make sense ... a rare combination!) Like many things on the film, the child comes and goes ... no real explanation, no ending in his character. Moving on ... The woman approaches Diaz in the grocery store, telling her that the tests are secret and her family is one of the subjects. Well ... hmmm ... if foreigners have the authority they can take over the body ... and the foreigners don't want to help Diaz ... then who took that lady's body and gave Diaz advice? ! Again ... the lady tried to help Diaz ... and the foreigners were not interested in helping Diaz ... so who the hell had checked her body?! Never explained. Never talked again. Nothing!! It continues and continues in the way that seemed to me for 2 weeks. It doesn't end! I don't know if this movie has massively fired again at some point. It was badly edited. Diaz's accent was there for one minute, the next went. Lower plots began, but never ended. The numerous returns of the release date clearly show manufacturers' problems with the finished product. It's really a train-wreck. <br /> <br /> Forward this ... there's no redemption value. 3 out of 10, just because I like Diaz and sci-fi! It's probably worth 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading! <br /> <br /> JD
