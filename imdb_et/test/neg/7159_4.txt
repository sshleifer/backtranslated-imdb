This glorious discovery documentary documentary, part of the Bible study, part of the treasure hunt, all illegally possessed, can be well on television but falls as a feature film. Immediately at first glance, if it is artistic with a cheesy look, there may be doubts about the credibility of this serious topic, showing on the front panel that searching for the tomb of Jesus is a general action book that looks more at the national treasure or at Tomb Raider, then all the informed discussions of the historical burial site. This is how the whole procedure revolves. <br /> <br /> More curious child than a worthy researcher, Simcha Jacobovic's research has come across as self-conscious as his research is manipulative. For all the exciting revelations, this filmmaker tries to provide his viewers with supposed evidence, a flood of repetitive statements, repeating the same studies and conclusions proving that Jesus' lost grave contains very little information to back up expanded, albeit tempting, claims. This is a very frustrating attempt to deceive the audience with almost as little factual evidence to support the authenticity of this grave that ironically reduces it. Although untiringly linking many of these mini-coffins found together to support the theory of Jesus Nazareth, this study abandons a well-rounded approach to continuing the unique obsession of this romantic archaeologist. There may be some impressive factual data that will help to shed some light on many of the traditional dogmatic Christian beliefs, but in essence, the shady nature of this project has just changed to use, which was funded at a time when the Da Vinci code was all the rage. <br /> <br /> Finally, the cheeses' art was right. Despite the recognition of the documentary form, Jesus' lost tomb always takes an interesting topic and makes it a long and unchanging geriatric adventure hunt, replacing the relevance and sacredness of this team's uninvited motivations. By the time these tomb visitors completed their investigations, they had to reluctantly stop the research because of social demands, leaving the viewers with the idea that the director demanded this secret, whether it was in the beginning or not. There are some really strong moments in which history halls move through this documentary in uncomfortable ways, but decoding, exploring, and theoretically leaving the whole world still leaves this misleading vanity an awkward empty apathetic answer.
