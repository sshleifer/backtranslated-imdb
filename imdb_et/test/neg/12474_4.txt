One of the first things I noticed was that this culture looked different because of Sole's place. The aerial photo is used to show that the only one is flowered by the sea of ​​women with kisses. I believed that this was a comment about the proximity of women to each other in this culture, who came across generations, departures and misunderstandings, and were able to bind and rely on each other. The film also seemed to respect women almost flawlessly. What I mean flawlessly is that they did not suffer from the consequences of their actions and were treated as if they had no drawbacks. An example of this is shortly after Paula accidentally killed his father. His mother immediately comes to his salvation and takes full responsibility for Paula's almost no regret for what he has done. Again, there is another example of every daughter (or grandchildren) having the opportunity to reunite with her supposed "dead" mother (grandmother). Knowing the stress that this is likely to have caused them in their family, each of them is still a mother, regardless of what she has done? In this light, women are depicted as not only those who do not love each other independently of character, but also of those who are hardly at least aware of the actions their friends / family members perform. <br /> <br Another idea I thought this culture was intriguing was their supernatural idea. With the death of Raimunda and Sole's mother and her inexplicable return, the director builds the audience's emotions to believe that this film embodies supernatural. People in this culture seem very supernatural, ie very eager to believe that life is outside the grave. Their aunt, long-time friend Augustina, a prostitute and other people living in La Mancha, believe that rumors from the dead will come back to family members to end the unfinished business. I believe it was a confusing reflection of the religious religion of culture (predominantly Catholic) and their need to change those who could not forgive at the time of death. The faith they considered "alive" to be dead was also to give hope to their poor circumstances that they suffered in mortality. When the viewer is open to the fact that this film is not supernatural, it is interesting to observe the role of the mother. He is still treated as a ghost (i.e., hiding under small cracks (under the bed or in the trunk of the car)). I believe that the director depicted the mother in this way to increase the supernatural beliefs that the city had already adopted. The mother's character seemed to be a metaphor for the city's long-term faith in death.
