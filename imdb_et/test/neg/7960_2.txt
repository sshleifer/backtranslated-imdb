Water shows the situation of Indian widows in the late 1930s, finally saying that the problem is still high, finally giving statistics, Gandh refers to the film several times before finally depicting the scene and depicting it in a special, innovative or new film. Yes, cinematography is quite impressive, but it cannot be the soul of a movie. <br /> <br /> India has had many problems, like many other countries, but it has been widely freed from many of these problems. What if the film is about racism in America in a particular year that ends with "x the number of Americans still experiencing racism today". <br /> <br /> a) How would it be appropriate, and b) How would it be so uncommon for a cinema to be portrayed. <br /> <br /> Reading Deepa Mehta in the interview was that this movie is interpreted as a voice marginalized everywhere. From the reviews I read every time the general thing I hear is how the director did a good job and was bold about the world problem. The film deals with the more specific problem society faces (and has been released through reforms). <br /> <br /> I don't see any land breaking film. Moreover, the film lacked the soul and shifted the plots of Chuiyya and Kalyan. The young Sri Lanka actor Sarala portrayed Chuiyya's role perfectly, and that was the only thing that strangely impressed me with the film.
