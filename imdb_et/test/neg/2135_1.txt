Never before has such a big man gathered together to make the same ugly movie. <br /> <br /> There is a huge and terrible thing in the waters off Florida's coast. its awakening. Depending on the horny beer, Bob thinks he's stuck on the "bad voice" on the tape. Bob's assistant, an amazingly unpleasant and painfully skinny Stella, decides to use her husband, Peter, an electrician whose equipment can help them find a mysterious creature. But anyone who puts his nose in the mystery too far, dead to the dead, dead to the dead, hit by a bad perm. What's the terrible secret behind Sea Killer? Ugly scientists have torrid things, inept cops and doctors puzzle over getting more corpses, stella and peter make out on the beach and the characters we don't care about are killed or munched up. Sea Killer, a combination of octopus, shark and large prostheses, never seems as dangerous as it should be. The conspiracy behind Monster's creation makes no sense. No characters are particularly pleasant and those who may be killed are immediately killed. It is poorly photographed, poorly dubbed, plot less confused. The whole thing is so puzzled and smelly that made me a hot bath. I've had sushi plates more than this movie. Avoid this if it is not the MST3K version.
