I'm a very bad lover of the B movie. And I especially love aliens / scifi movies. I say that the cheaper, cheesier and campier are the better. The low budget and the hokey idea are fun enough for most of the bad B-films, but this movie is so bad that I really felt embarrassed for filmmakers and Schlocky ad-libs. First of all, there is no real plot, it is any situation of "comedy" (if you can name it). "Comedy" in this movie is more of a character, saying "look at me, I'm in a bad situation! Isn't that funny?", But it's just pathetic because nothing is funny. There is no comedy action skill or a kooky plot that will carry all the very imaginative scenarios with this burdensome turtle. acting, actors who say really stupid things over and over again (maybe trying to entice pharmacies, maybe just b / c all that bad), really unpleasant women are played as hot chicks, and people are bathing and leaving the bathrooms. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, there was one medieval actor I could say he had some actors and he was convincing in his role. In the bathroom of the weekend detox unit she was the same as solid BM. Corey Feldman was filmed for about 3 minutes (fortunately, we didn't have to shut him down anymore) and he was filmed outside - probably outside his apartment to get out. He said there were some very funny things about foreigners and having sex with foreigners, and that was the scope of his appearance. <br /> <br /> If you value your life and 90 minutes (and years of pain remembering), you will lose sight of this garbage, avoid it. If you do a lot of drugs, such as Adam Sandler's comedy styles (and therefore have no standards), and they are considered mentally slow, this film could be liked. <br /> <br /> P.S. I think people who attacked this must work for Troma or some other, b / c I can't believe people can be as flat as this movie can enjoy. (Are drugs really so destructive?)
