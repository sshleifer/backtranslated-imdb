It's about the same intentional film as the low director like Joel Schumacher, I think. A group of medical students die for several minutes of death; in revival, they discover that their sins are manifest in some way. Since some people are visiting dead people and some seem to be guilty of haunting their conscience, it is not quite clear what the connection is, but the visions look like the sixth feature film. Why do students treat their experiment as a great journey that makes them famous, is a bit of a mystery, because the results are completely incredible and, as the movie is mentioned many times, is documented many times. However, it is nice to see Schumacher practicing his Batman workouts with a bit of old neon color and colorful light bulb. And William Baldwin is a plank.
