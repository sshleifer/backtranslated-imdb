Solo is a bad film that can't be ignored. Most work very wood (the only exception is Adrien Brody as Bill's creator Bill) and the story is small enough to make you probably forget about where you watch the movie. This means that such films are activities rather than plot / action, and activities that live or die as such, which are ultimately the point of such films - to give 14-year-olds a smile while adults watch movies of the real substance. And even this Solo is unable to offer it - what is a small activity that is badly done, boring and uninspired. After watching it on the TV, I was hoping that Predaot would have a robot replacing Predaot. Instead, I got a rather inanimate action film based on a poorly designed experiment, taking the message that robots are feeling too. See Terminator II or Predator. Both the classics that this film desperately wants to have, except that it lacks inspiration or a fair budget.
