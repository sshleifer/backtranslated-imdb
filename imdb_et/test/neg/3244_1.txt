I am ashamed to publicly admit that I even held the cover of this movie once! This is the absolute reason why you should study the movie before seeing it! The "makers" of this film have called us all fools and gullible losers who have too much time in our hands. <br /> <br /> Based on the mighty caves that change the mythical Indian shape and the rebirth that the story leads us to a painful ride. College 40+ Actors (Now Really?) Is the target of their former friend Manisha Koirala (who was in his former life as a cobra, but is now a ghost) and his pathetic, eternal, powerful girlfriend of cobra / killing machine Munish Kohli (who hasn't been fortunate) . Now you need to learn more? <br /> <br /> I will vote for this upcoming test at school, not for the movie! Give it a mileage if you're sensible. If not ... you will probably enjoy it.
