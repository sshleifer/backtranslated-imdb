Okay, now I know where all those boring cop / killing TV shows came. I believe they can follow this movie. The "crime scene" seems to be a TV episode or serial. Fill in the characters and situations of the stock - a hotshot policeman who collides with his bosses ... with an aging policeman who doesn't want to work at the desk, despite seeing ... reckless beginner ... double crossing, etc. <br /> <br /> I like many actors and they do a good job, but in general I found this movie dumb as I am not a fan of the genre. I had to tune when they discussed the case ... something about bugs and informers. And yes, there was a stripper that was previously played by Gloria DeHaven. What I want to know is: Why did he call Van Johnson "Uncle Wiggly"? Wasn't Uncle Wiggly a rabbit? Is children's literature? What the hell is it doing? I guess I just can't get a tough movie movie Noir-ish kinda jargon. <br /> <br /> In fact, much of the dialogue made me bang "no one talks like that!" But I could relate to one scene where the police woman (Arlene Dahl), who is worried every time she goes to work, realizes that she might not have put her husband in the center of her life. Yes, I know that I love someone so much, being so dependent that there is a constant fear for their safety. So the film has moments of truth, a stylized dialogue and an atmosphere that strives to be both sharp and realistic, that it seems to me to be unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Small Background: This film was made when Dore Schary took over MGM from Louis B. Mayer and started to finish the healthy musicals that made MGM so big. Dore Schary decided to bring more "realism" to films. I hate Dore Schary. Maybe we can blame him for all the modern acts, the dark films, the life of the ugly "truth", focusing (and, in my opinion, helping to erect) the worst humanity as the best. We no longer support us in providing the classic films - giving the necessary attention to the great depression and the Second World War. Well, damn, we still need this kind of attention. There's still a lot of depression and a lot of war. And what do people turn to today if they want to escape? Trashy, Brain-Deadly Reality TV. Thank you, Dore!
