Caddyshack II is one of those pictures that makes you ask "Why?" "Why was it financed?": "Why was it done?" and "Why is it disclosed?" <br /> <br /> At least, it's a bad movie. It serves little purpose, but stressed how good this prequel is, by setting an almost identical character on a line similar to a new money developer who is trying to buy a company golf course. <br /> <br /> Right after the ex-post control is somewhat odd for 8 years after the original. I mean, if your money goes to a very successful picture, such as the first one, you have a window of a few years. But leaving it for 8 years, this means that the formula is not fresh enough to just make a follow-up or bad imitation, so you are forced to get rewarded for the original fans by giving them at least five if the actual contributions aren't the actors who did the first memorable. But there is little or no. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get cheap imitations. Whether Ted Knight's passing in the intervening years has made it impossible to bring the memorable judges back to Smails, but the involvement of Robert Stack in "Chandler Young" (a companion of WASP elite similar to Smails) is unimaginable and seriously lacking Anarchic disappointment that made Knight's move so traceable. Jackie Mason's "Jack Hartounian" is a weak attempt to restore the character of the first stop by Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield). Although Dangerfield's role was endlessly quoted, Mason is completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> Bill Murray's ridiculously laughing groundbreaker "Carl Spackler" and his devastating war with an irritating local waffle are replaced by his Ghostbuster co-star Dan Ackroyd as a military captain. Tom Everett, who is a high voice, shares your frustration with not laughing. <br /> <br /> Randy Quaid, brilliant as Cousin Ed in the National Lamp Holiday series, is playing the opposite, playing Hartounian's unstable lawyer. The spectator disbelief shown by an actor who looks at the Quaid character is meant to be a fun inappropriate violence. You don't laugh. You just ask, "What the hell is he doing?" Chevy Chase appears, all this from time to time and wisely, rather than taking into account the catastrophe around him, as the pro 'Tye Webb' movies only refer to an original that does not tolerate the golf course itself. With her deeply tanned skin and loud Hawaiian shirt, Chase looks like she just got back from a long summer break and needs a salary. He distanced himself from the actual picture of the events enough that he takes little charge and leaves with some, everything is little, the credibility remains intact. <br /> <br /> Jessica Lundy as Mason's daughter, "Kate", takes over the role of "Danny Noonan" as a teenager struggling against the classroom. It looks ridiculous, isn't it? At least in Danny's first (Irish Catholic blue collar family) and his ridiculous attempts to penetrate the dominating world of golf club and shaker white-Anglo-Saxon-Protestants, he played as memorable pieces as the triggered Lutheran bishop has fired and mocked the descendants of the local yacht club. Lundy's embarrassment of his father's inability to install suggests that he is the root of the Jews. This omission may also be related to him being a classmate moor, but such complexities are wiped out, even though I stopped caring long before they were resolved. At the end of the day, Noonan tried to move on in life. The biggest problem with Miss Hartounia is getting a local golf club boys like her multi-millionaire father to get a date with the club's missing white boy. Or so I gathered. <br /> <br /> Anyway, summing up your badly written, poorly written flat sets and wasting a lot of talent. Indeed, if you were able to sit down to the end. It's really a repentance. However, it is a question mark why so many original actors did not come back instead of replacing those who at least saw their equality on paper. Maybe they just didn't ask. Maybe I suspect they actually read the script. Stay with the original !!!
