I'm a Christian and I watched pretty Christian movies, but it's too bad. They try to do that good, but for me it is too difficult for them. <br /> <br /> - You see that the movie is poorly duplicated in many places. - You can almost guess that the main teams in this movie were the only ones left behind. I think there are many more of them. <br /> <br /> - Quality is bad and action could have been better. The story is not so bad, but it could have been better. The only plus I give is the story of this movie, but I can't judge it more than 3/10. Instead, look "left behind"!
