Well, where we start, there were many opportunities for this film when such big stars played a role. But the whole story was destroyed by a terrible plot. This movie didn't put out to wait for a good man to make it alive, I mean co mon nobody wants a good man to be successful. The end was a spicy and very clich√©, never thought of, YOU ARE THE HIGHEST HIGH BIRTHS TO BE COMING. <br /> <br /> If you want to spend 1 hour and 2 minutes of time wasting something else, this movie was a CRAP display. I really think the actors made this movie for some quick Vegas money, no doubt about it. SAVE your money for better movie viewing.
