I really like Ryan Reynolds and Hope Davis and I really had great hopes to watch it on DVD last night. Mainly because I try to avoid comments until I look at myself and form my opinion. Big mistake! My 2/10 is meant for the first segment that is fairly decent and fairly well and if they only made the movie about the stars in section 1, it could have risen above 5/10. in the territory that he high in the sky. Ryan Reynolds excelled in the character of the actor, but as a gay TV writer and famous game creator / dedicated family member, he was certainly less effective. I had a little thriller on the Memento lines in the box bell - unfortunately, it's not close to the film's standard.
