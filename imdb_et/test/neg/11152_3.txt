I was waiting to welcome Arnold Schwarzeneger's return to action after the dark films he'd made after Eraser. However, the "End of Days" can be added to the unpleasant films he failed. <br /> <br /> "The End of Days" begins with a very engaging action sequence, but quickly becomes a cage focusing on action and skipping, focusing instead on exploring demonic events and a fast approaching millennium (read "Doomsday"). Performances are hidden, special effects so and so many. Considering himself a deadly Schwarzenegger fan, I couldn't believe I didn't like this movie, but with such a terrible, flat script that Arnie could have done, in addition to the turkey. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 <br /> <br />
