I thought this film was a poor effort on the part of the British Film Council - it gradually fell as he was, come on, Tim Robbins is an old man and here is a beautiful young woman who also falls directly to him. As lost in translation, it is very difficult to stop disbelief in this context. It's a good looking movie, but there's no punch. When Tim Robbins pretends to be psychic, he seems to have a small migraine. He sees discomfort and life less. Part of where he siftes suspect workers to the sphinx is ridiculous. When the researcher came to my factory, the last thing I would like to do is tell her about her freckle fetish. It's obviously too intellectual. Cumbersome. The city is as it is, with a comfortable background. They probably chose the background of the most futuristic city (shanghai), but the city never really came out and did not affect the signs, such as the blade runner, where city characters often intersect. slow wet week. No chemistry, real dramatic highs, so plot.
