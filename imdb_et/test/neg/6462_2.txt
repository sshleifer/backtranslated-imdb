I am a big fan of Northern Exposure. Men inside the tree are a complete interruption of northern exposure. The city of New York City is far from the backwoods town (Marin Frist / Joel Fleishman). He didn't hit the local spot (Jack Slattery / Maggie O'Connell). The city has only one pilot who is not often available. Ther is only one radio broadcast. And the whole performance is with peculiar and strange relationships with peculiar people. Too many parallels. Just like Northern Exposure, except for one obvious demographics, each character has changed. I am bored. Give me something new to think about. <br /> <br /> Up is writing good. But if it were a school project, it would certainly have been a plagiarism. <br /> <br /> Maybe people who love this show were protected by Joshua Brand and John Falsey for their dedicated creativity and hard work.
