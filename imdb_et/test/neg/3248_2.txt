Okay, I'd give it 1, but I'll give him two, because I laughed at watching this movie ... First, I can make a much better movie than this ... in a week. .Every effect made this movie a joke. Such movies should not be made with terrible special effects, because then people will not take it seriously. Action and direction were also terrible. The plot had lots of plot holes and the whole movie wasn't at all credible. It must be the worst Indian film. The songs were also bad. Operation was bad and artificial. I need to say more. Don't watch this movie unless you're curious about how bad it is. That's why I looked at it. I'm going to the movie and I wanted to see how bad the bad movie is. Trust me, I watched one of the worst films in history, if not the worst movie.
