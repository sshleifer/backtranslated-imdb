Aghhhhhh! What a disappointment. Perfectly good chicken like Antonio Sabato Jr. and something more than embarrassing firing from his mouth. I hit 95% of the dialogue! It would have been better if the character had silenced! How Antonio Sabato and Michael Pare could talk about these lines without losing control of some physical function, over me! If Michale Pare's character precedes or finished another sentence with the word "Men", I would have thought that I would be an iron over the TV (I love multitasking - especially through bad movies). It should have been a lean year for both of them to sign up for this movie. Car washing for life seems to be pretty good. And a bad boy ...... if he was so bad, why didn't he let all those rich college kids who promised promising toilet breaks. Even the title was misleading. "Crash Landing" means that the plane actually runs and does not only fit without a symbolic fire or an injury. Instead of safely landing, the plane should have hit and burned like a script. <br /> <br /> This movie is a reader!
