The final result can be seen miles away. All the characters were there ... prom, liqueur, fast ride, female distraction .... good belt for belt use and later vehicle model that sits passengers beyond the windscreen. It also ends up climatic because Ford Econoline van hardly suffers for his nose when he strikes a high speed bridge abrasion (very unlikely). has made it a little more credible.And why do these films always take place during and after the prom? Is this the case when you survive, you have a good life? More than anything else, it shows that there is no bolt for the liqueur and keeps the MINORID who will leave the dance for joy.
