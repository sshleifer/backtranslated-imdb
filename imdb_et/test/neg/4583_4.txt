But like the two-generation Disney movie, this film has also failed in the accuracy department. But at least Disney used the Skye Terrier. <br /> <br /> Is real story for everyday filmmakers? I do not belive. There are enough documents to allow them to accurately portray the true story of fictitious accounts. <br /> <br /> One day, the movie is rightly represented by Bobby's owner, John Gray, as a Edinburgh cop that he was and correctly depicts Bobby's license for the Lord's provost. When that happens, I'm in theaters.
