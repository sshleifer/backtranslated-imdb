What makes this movie so bad? Is it a stupid humor of juveniles? Can it be terrible "trendy" suck ass music? Maybe the story is not going to be uncomfortable? Or maybe even the fact that Traci Lords gives him the worst performance and adds insult, keeps all his clothes between all the evaporating sandwiches. Regardless of the reason this film sucks, it is true that it really does. I never wanted to see a movie with Dean Cameron instead of what I watched in my life, but "Ski School" is a masterpiece of the comic gene compared to this traverse version. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nikol Nesbitt, Buffy Tyler and Suzanne Stokes release all their Tupperware tits <br /> <br /> Where I saw it : Starz on demand
