Okay, someone who wants to see a great work of art shouldn't watch this movie. An experienced filmmaker is undoubtedly frightened to look at the production values ​​and the outstanding actor (Joseph Cotten). Mr. Cotten must either really need the money or he was too senile to understand that the film was nonsense. The same phenomenon happened with Dana Andrews, who appeared at the end of his career in a fun and terrible FROZEN DEAD. I know Mr. Andrews was in alcoholism, but why did Cotten do it! <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, it is a reprocessing of the Frankenstein plot. The first half of the film seemed really like they did seriously, but seriously, with the original Frankenstein story. Then they introduced the daughter inexplicably. It wasn't a bad thing ... until then they decided to quit the blue movie, but made a soft core of pornographic flick! The change was dramatic and odd. It was almost as if he said, "Okay, Mr Cotten has made his scenes and gone home ... now ladies, ... STRIP!". <br /> <br /> The problem is that at each level, the movie is just terrible, except for the monster makeup. Although not big, it's still pretty cool to see. But bad writing, acting, and a $ 17.46 budget collapsed to make it a drab and a terrible flick - one so bad that tearing into perverse shouldn't be enough to see anyone.
