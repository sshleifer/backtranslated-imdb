Why oh, why am I watching this movie? it was given to me on a video by a friend and I thought I was looking at it, it might not be so bad. First, action is simply terrible and we should believe that it is real? secondly, this film tries to knock (fun) the Blair witch project and does it very badly. so if you want the fear of your life, I would recommend that the Simpson Halloween special be much worse. but if you just want to laugh, maybe this movie is enough. but generally I would avoid this movie at all costs or drink a large amount of alcohol before watching. the best bit? it's only one and a half hours, thanks to God.
