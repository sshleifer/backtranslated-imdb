I am surprised that critics and the public have so well received the "hospital". I found it terrible, visually ugly, and generally pointless. In the first almost 40 minutes, the invisible film improves (relatively), but it remains too far (not to mention unlikely) to be successful as satire, and there are too few substances to succeed in drama. The insecure tone of the film is the biggest guilt that even overshadows Scot's terrible (as usual) occurrence.
