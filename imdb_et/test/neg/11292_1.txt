The only reason I didn't sleep during this movie was that the seats were not so comfortable. Hannibal COMES> CAUSATION> CAUSATION AND WINNING !!! This movie is simply terrible, not because of violence or graphical distortions. This is actually pretty much in this respect. The story moves at the speed of lazy snails. I feel like director Ridley Scott just called it. Participants are all right they just need. The music score is also very annoying. This is especially noticeable, because so little happens in the movie. It looks good, but that's not a good reason to see it. By the way, I mentioned that this is a CALL? <br /> <br />
