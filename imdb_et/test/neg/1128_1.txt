It must be the worst heap I've ever seen. Randy Quaid is funny as an actor but not a leader. Too Much Eddie. The original is classic. Like the original, the actor also showed. Ed Asner was very funny. He's Santa Claus 2 Eddie! How Snots will still come after the same years and all others look out of the original 14 years. 15 minutes after watching this movie, I don't think I'd even laugh. The island is just not working. If there hadn't been a good-looking Pacific female tutor on the islands, the film would have been a complete loss. I sat through this week and yes, I think the film should never have been done. We hope you are NOT THIRD! <br /> <br /> Shawn Gearin
