I've loved the book "Little Princess" for most of her life and I was very excited about the movie. But I was adapted to this adaptation. Not only do they work on wood and the plot has a mish-mash shrunk, but the subject is wrong. The real topic of the story should be that the girl can only be a princess if she behaves like one, as Sara does when she gives her 6 bats to beg, even if she is very hungry. The theme of the movie seems to be that all the girls are princesses, which Sara's activities are greatly appreciated, and it seems that it should be written on the Hallmark card when the story is used. <br /> <br /> There are many other things wrong with this movie - too much to list them, but here are just a few: this story should be in British in the mid-1800s, not in America during World War I. Miss Minchen is tough for Sara from the outset, doing her activities when Sara is much less amazing than she would be in the sweet syrup at first. Nowhere is it mentioned that Becky is black. Sara's father doesn't come back, he's dead. It's her closest friend and partner in diamond mines who finds Sara and restores her to the right place. In fact, the diamond well is not even mentioned at all, even though they are the source of Sara's wealth. <br /> <br /> Everything Sara has faced is always like a princess, giving her what she can and forgiving those who hurt her. He would never have called Lavina a "double ghost". Such a thing is completely characteristic of him and undermines the whole philosophy he has to behave well, no matter what it is. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the worst customization on the screen I've ever seen (significant exceptions "Ella Enchanted" and "Anne of Green Gables Continuing Story") Book is a book is wonderful and cleverly written, so I do not understand why the director felt it was necessary to change it to make it interesting. I suggest that anyone who wants to know this story should look at the 1987 version, which is much better. Or better, read the book. It's worth more than an hour and a half when the movie is wasted for this version.
