After the matrix, the travesty of the movie unlocked with VR has been reinstated with the word "Matrix just Deadler!", A box that has a very Matrix inspired cover (still called "wait to die") though). However, because of the fund's choice, the tag-line will look to the world as it says "Beablier". Anyway. <br /> <br /> In order to move the Matrix wannabe around, they look at the VR fighting scene that has Morpheus-a on the back of the box. Perhaps it is important to know that this character does not recognize the movie. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is travesty for every level. Jalal Mehri is a terrible actor and does not impress his martial arts. But his partner Stone is played by Evan Lurie, who in this movie is just the worst actor I've ever seen. It is clear that he was chosen to make Jalal look good. The worst movie I've seen for a long time.
