The problem with this movie is that it's not funny, it's not scary, it's not dramatic, it's not intriguing, it's not stimulating, it's not, it's not exciting, it's not even the least interesting. I recently saw this movie on tape and I was glad I didn't spend money on renting it. This is basically a poor test for making movies. I'm not even telling you this story. Story? What story?
