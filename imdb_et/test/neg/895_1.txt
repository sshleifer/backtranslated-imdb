I know it sounds crazy, but yes, I'm a big fan of House Party 1 and 2 (and proud of it!). I hated part 3, and then comes part 4. I was like you joking with me? Kid 'n Play is not in this movie anywhere, and it would have been okay if they did not have the foolish right to own a House Party 4, just as it would in any way, shape, shape or fashion linked to its predecessors. Every time this movie appears in the US late at night, I shoot my TV with a rifle. Frankly, this is really cruel. * Hurling * <br /> <br /> Kid 'n Play is the only other fan who admits to being a fan (doing hee hee), I was awful. Remember, this silly little boy is immature? They would make their way to House Party 3. Okay, well and well, but how can Part 4 be almost for them and nothing else, and it also seems that they're not the same kids in Part 3. * Confused !!!! * House Party fans: Do yourself a favor and keep House Party 1 and 2 and Class Act. Moreover, everything else is ridiculous.
