This movie is terrible, it was so hard to believe that Katie became a cordial teenager with the ability to save Chinese people in the film with no convincing argument to prove it. And the rest of the plot didn't try to show us more than the common sense ... <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous and the only thing we get out of it is that it shows how a person can be arrogant. Katie has to inherit her arrogant from her mother, the most annoying nature I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> The actors and landscapes were fine, but the plot is destroyed by everything full of cheap clich√©s and hypocritical scenes. I'm not expecting this movie again in my life. Leave it out!
