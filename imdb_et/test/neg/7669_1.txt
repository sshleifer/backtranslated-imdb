WARNING ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The Lord knows that since my time I have seen some bad movies and it makes me hate. It's an insult to people looking for a bad movie. The "story" includes a stewardess who discovers his boyfriend (badly acting otherwise big Robert Wagner) is a murder, thief and just a general face. After the Concorde start, he sends missiles to control the Concorde. So when Concorde travels at the speed of light, our "hero" (playing completely stupid, George Kennedy) opens the window in the cabin, sticking his hand out to shoot on the rocket! I'm not a rocket scientist, but it seems that his hand would get at least wind. Then, towards the final "climax" when Concorde is targeting a certain disaster and everyone dies, the traveler turns to his groom and makes a marriage. The priest just sits in the next row and continues to marry when the planes fall! (I'm not doing it up) Wow, the man who wrote the script, must have the glue scattered within a week.
