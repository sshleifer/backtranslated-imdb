I went to watch this movie with my boyfriend last night. I'm 20 years old and this movie was too much for ME. I couldn't imagine taking a teenager, a preteen or (especially) a child to this movie. It was raw and offensive. I was totally wrong with the PG-13 rating and the previews I saw. I had originally seen it in Nickelodeon, and I thought it looked pretty cute (maybe I just don't remember the preview right). Plus, Drake Bell (the main character of the movie) stars on Nickelodeon's television show that they are targeting teenagers and teenagers. I really didn't think the content of the movie was as risky as it was. I should have studied it more before I went. However, I hope that the parents read this movie before they watch their children because it is with Drake Bell. <br /> <br /> Don't take your kids or teenagers to see this movie. The rating should have been R. There is a sexual reference, drug references and disturbing events throughout the film. Examples: Sexually charged animals attacking Drake Bell, a number of scenes involving men's females, a lot of frightening, Drake Bell uses a bong (or something) to smoke frosting, people get in, hit and hurt making a movie and an elderly lady and his dog is crushed. There are many other offensive and nasty scenes during the movie. It was indeed humiliating for women in general. The film is made by the people who made the Scary Movie series, so it should tell you something. Remember that seeing such movies can give children and teenagers all the wrong ideas about gender, drugs and violence. Most children and teenagers cannot decode between spoofs or comedy and reality. <br /> <br /> I have a sense of humor. I also know that humor in this movie is typical of its genre. But I find the child and teenagers see this movie HORRIFYING. <br /> <br /> With regard to the overall quality of the film, I didn't think it was the original or funny. It pulled into parts and some humor was just forced and painful. Operation was not bad considering how bad the script is. If you are an adult or older teen who is looking for a funny movie, skip it or rent it.
