Oh If one day u want to see a supernatural thriller that is comedy, watch this movie <br /> <br /> This movie was shocking because it had so many participants but what did they do and how did they fit? <br /> <br /> College Scene Handling is like a school game where every person speaks and then the next person comes right now. <br /> <br /> Okay reasons to laugh at the film: 1) Akshay Sunei, Aditya Panscholi, Sharad Kapoor, Arshad Wars College Students 2) Akshay wears a monster with 3 weapons, some pathetic stunts and SFX <br /> <br /> There are still a number of mistakes, why don't the snake's lover be raped and come so late? as well, why doesn't he kill all of them only there? <br /> <br /> But after that, they have to make a 2-hour movie so you have a tortorius movie <br /> <br /> The movie is painful to watch The film was directed by Rajkumar Kohli, who was a film expert in the past and was successfully recorded such films as JAAN DUSHMAN (1979) and NAGIN Rajkumar Kohli wants to help his son's non-existent career right from VIRODHI (1992), Aulad Ke Dushman (1993) and QAHAR (1996) all the flops he tried to promote his son and He also puts the big stars in order for his son to notice, unfortunately, nothing can help his son's career. <br /> <br /> The film has several comic scenes, such as death scenes, how the actors are so capable of fighting after the snake and climax. Rajkumar Kohl's direction is bad Music is bad <br /> <br /> It brings us cast Akshay Kumari - to common things, he has nothing to do, then he stunted Suneil Shetty- the terrible Sonu Nigam - the worst debut utante goes to him, he gives the comic a new meaning. Aftabrible Arshad Warsi - Nothing to Do Sharad Kapoor-Bad Aditya Panscholi is irritated by Sunny Deol - is comic when she comes to save Sonu LOL Manisha Doggy- ordinary Rambha - Akshay couple Kiran Kumar, Raza Murad is the usual Raj Babbar- fun for wrong reasons what girls are terrible What brings us to Munish Kohl This man is a huge body, he is even stronger and higher than Akshay Kumar poor man Akshay His voice is terrible, his expressions are painful The only thing he has to do in the film is wearing glasses and the evil face of Rajat Bedi is terrible
