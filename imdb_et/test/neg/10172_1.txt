This movie was the biggest garbage I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> It is marketed with Sci-Fi if it is nothing more than a Christian recruitment tool. <br /> <br /> It tells you quite a bit about the status of a Christian church when they have to use fraud only to listen to their sales pitch. But then, what do you expect from an organization that goes through such lengths to help protect your organization's huge number of child morals. and war traffickers. Let us not forget that our former ex-president indeed came out and said "God told him" to penetrate Iraq. And no one asked if he could hear the voices or see the things? <br /> <br /> Anyway, going to the subject here. This film has nothing to do with UFOs, it is nothing more than religious production.
