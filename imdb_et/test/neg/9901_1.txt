What a mess - and I'm not referring to the "destruction" of the title. I could go on a hackneyed plot, sad effect, (actually noticeable) cast grimacing when they deliver the worst line in their career, etc. I just say there was no palm trees in Chicago the last time I checked and leave it in it. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... needs ten lines to post IMDb. OK, well, I think the DVD edition with excerpts might be interesting. Maybe Dennehy reveals the benefits she could have. Perhaps Dianne Weist is telling us the money he needs to get involved. Maybe sorry CBS execs ...
