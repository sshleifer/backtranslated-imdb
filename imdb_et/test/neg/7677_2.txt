All airport movies are stinkers, but it is their biggest turkey. The formula was different because it focused on two catastrophic flights and lots of on-site plots, while other films focused on just one catastrophic flight and a smaller plot on the ground. The Concorde Stunts are worthy of laughing, though special effects are not as terrible as the 1979 film expected. George Kennedy's sexist remarks are disgusting and his meeting with a prostitute in Paris is completely unnecessary (and made me grasp a bit). Poor Martha Raye was left with a role where she did nothing but released her gut in the Concorde bathroom. There are no big letters in this movie compared to previous movies, which gives you another reason not to watch it.
