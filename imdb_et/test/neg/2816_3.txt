When I was watching this movie, I never thought I would protect it. It is honest enough from the beginning, if there is not a lot of land. No actual characters except killer. Some actors may be better, but most are capable. <br /> <br /> I know three out of ten are not stars, but there are comments that say it's bad and totally useless. I think it provided what it should do quite well. Lighting is sometimes minimal, the habit is more common than most viewers, but it should seem like a sniffing camcorder. In fact, sometimes quality is probably still too high to be true, but nobody does it during camera work, which is really so bad. <br /> <br /> It's not very scary, but it is occasionally annoying. There are one or two characters at all who do not believe at all and that the soundtrack is not tiring from time to time, but in general it was put together cleaner than many camcorder films.
