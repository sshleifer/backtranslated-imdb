I'm generous here and give it to 3 just because I live in Huntsville and it was nice to see how well the city was filmed. This movie was pretty bad. It's like they hardly started with any script and the director just told the actors that they looked at each other, playing a lot of music. And Billy D. Williams seemed to be rather everywhere, but in this movie. It's just a mess. I think I could write a script better than crowding out this movie, and I'm not a writer. the impression that the film begins during World War II and actually seemed to begin in the late 1950s / early 1960s. Although the army was not separated at that time, I am quite sure that the troops waiting to board the train will still be divorced at a location like Huntsville, Al. If the film had to start in the 1940s, Billy D, Lesley Ann & Rae Dawn should have been in the 70s and 80s in the early 50s or '60s. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time if you really don't like actors because the story isn't very interesting.
