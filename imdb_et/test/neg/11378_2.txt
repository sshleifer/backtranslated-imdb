In a pharmaceutical key, Gaud√≠'s afternoons can be a mediocre exercise. Marcia Gay Harden and Judy Davis turned to good pain (Juliette Lewis' new-born freaky character is incredibly taken from reality, I know a young American lady like her!) <br /> <br /> significant scenario contradictions. Two samples: You pay 14 euros to enter the chapel where Cassandra and Frankie met, NEVER 7 o'clock, and you can't leave the terrace without paying the bill (they charge you if they don't know you) or the taxi ATTENTION IF QUICKLY ( you Americans always cut, though they don't expect it, but the sequences depicted in the movie were ridiculous). Don't believe me, reader: come over and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> If you've never been here before you care about everything, but good movies should be believable despite your origin. Nobody knows about GA here, and I'm sure it won't change in the future.
