The bad news for anyone who wants to film a lifetime movie in a full-length parody - those who made a deadly meeting have already done so, albeit involuntarily. All lifetime slings exist - a divorced mother who is threatened by an unsuccessful stalker, an unreliable former spouse (who of course has been deceived by her) and a police department who patronizes her complaints, forcing her to stand for her. Especially jaw-dropping is a scene where the heroine, after he has interrupted his mother and murdered his murderous stalker, decides to relieve stress when you buy! Having first seen the harassment of a collaborator with some of the churches he met in church, I know that stalking is not a joke, but it is definitely in the movie.
