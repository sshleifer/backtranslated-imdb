I just registered at IMDb.com so I can comment on this movie. My God, what it was a steamy horse. It should not even be called a real movie, it is very deceptive. this is the best 15 year film project. Operation is terrible. But even good participants couldn't save it. The dialogue is probably the worst part of this movie. Who the devil wrote about that fucking? And the constant joke that comes from the fat lesbian that Kaye is "a girl in trouble" became old. I would like the camel to take my dirty garbage in my ear when I look at it again. Don't rent this movie. If they give you a movie for free, don't look at it. grab it with a hammer. Even if this video would cause you to lose your Hollywood video or blocking video account, it would be worth it. it is abomination. I think I've said all I can do about it without being superfluous. questions .... send me an email.
