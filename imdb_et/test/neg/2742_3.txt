It was quite inevitable. This movie lends "The Core" and the movie he borrowed, "Armageddon" and the movies he borrowed and so on. Except this time, Luke Perry. The renowned savings-world plot films include super-earthquakes that start in the northwestern Pacific, extending all over the fire. Soon it was decided that everything on earth could just be doomed. So the military and some scientists are building one of these high-tech drilling equipment to go into the Earth and improve things (it wouldn't be so much fun if they hadn't gone anywhere in the room or on the planet). There's even a line trying to make the journey to the ground more impressive than a journey into space (like Armageddon). This is a Sci-Fi network movie, so the script is a catastrophic movie. There is a struggle between scientists and army soldiers, there are rock-melting lasers, people die and sacrifice for the good of all, and above all there are special (weak CGI) effects. Not original and not all that entertaining. This is a movie to watch if you have nothing to do, especially if you have beer.
