This film is related to a party assembled by a high school "scary girl". Due to the illogical nature of such films, he is allowed to hold a house that was formerly a crematorium, a suspicious place that had been closed and locked for a long time. Obviously, the history of this property is one of the secrets of the city, which is best said among the best peoples, although the legend does not come among the young. <br /> <br /> Why did this cremation really close? What really happened in the past? <br /> <br /> I like these supernatural kill-kill-killing movies if there's something that isn't copied from a hundred other movies. The highlight of this film is the robbery of the "7-11" theft, which interferes with the secretary's vivid view, by the "good girl" of the changing clothing scene shown by her jerk younger brother. holiday, spooky mirror image and the concept of flowing water is an obstacle to supernatural barrier; the best part of this film is when the overwhelming party sponsor dances in front of the fireplace in front of the BAUHAUS; this scene rocks.
