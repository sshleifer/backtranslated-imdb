This confusion begins with a real tank that travels over the car with pictures of a toy tank. This is followed by a family who runs a birthday party without saying anything. An unexplained tank and an unknown family take over a 10-minute movie. Finally, the family sees the car after it has been in the wreck, and decides to report it to the right authorities to find that the citizens of the city are hiding in their houses and in the police station to hide the police. Interesting? Almost. When the town's people have come out because of the presence of the family, we learn that both the writer and the editor agree to replace the relationship with incomprehensible narrative methods in the hope that the audience's inability to say what is happening will somehow bring anxiety to the audience. and it works! ... but not as they thought. I was very pleased how bad this film was, but not at all frightened. The dialogue consists of things that do not make sense. There's no fun with David Lynch in a sort of way, but a sort of I-walked-in-time-in-the-middle-of-a-bored-conversation sort of way. In the next hour, we learn that filmmakers are trying to frighten us when we see that we see annoying everyday scenes with the above-mentioned "what's going on?" Scenes are written. <br /> <br /> The plot has something to do with gently-seeing old people who put the children through the power of transsonic Satan and then bring them to the party to play with toys, and even more embarrassing intent, and that depends on the group of white men (everyone's white is in the movie) to grab their guns and save the day and tag-a-long eye candy-woman who asks for a hat drops. They are looking for kidnapped children, looking at random places and screaming the names of children. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic movie for anyone who has never seen a horror movie because this person is scared of the idea of ​​Satanism, Paganism, Wicca, or even Catholicism, because the life of the Trinity Broadcast Network has been through life. This is Satanism, because elderly people in Halloween costumes with candles, while mixing with the party, Ankhi. Fill up with the priest, who is completely ready to ridicule the Satanists, calling them "sorcerers". The message that anything that is not Protestantism can all be thrown into the same category for condemnation. Earn teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin, which may or may not be words. <br /> <br /> The highlight is the guy who laughs a little for the green people's idea for a definite 3 minutes, a family that looks out of their car without having to talk for 10 minutes while listening to the musical of the elevator. A priest studying Satanism for 4 minutes with ooh-so-scary demons drawings to scare the crowd of the church lady. Random dolls. Random pictures of children. Color every time you paint it. Film School Dream Sequences. Introduces irrelevant characters who do nothing before they exit. Sometimes they work like something they do is a big deal. <br /> <br /> Leadership is at best sloppy. An example of leadership involves a scene at the beginning where a man and a woman kiss and the man loves to draw his eyes and some dark red colors fall on the cheek. Looking up, they see that it's not blood, but the girl's snow tones. Snowcones have ice and colored / flavored water and would not have brought the same color droplets, not to mention that his snowcone was a bright red orange. Hackneyed writing definitely, but made even worse bad management. He then cuts the male, female and girl substitute and shows that he stands at about four meters from them, so that the snowdrift would not have dropped onto the woman even if she had seen her snow hook on her face. How to go, editor! Of course, this is a blast. The operation of the entire cast act can take place on a scale and in balance between over-expansion and underfilling. <br /> <br /> The director's most offensive method is to give the participants some motivation and then to leave for lunch as the blind eye of the camera characters when the actors themselves make the fools. <br /> <br /> In the end, we will end up with what would have been great if it were competent people, not Jerry Falwell.
