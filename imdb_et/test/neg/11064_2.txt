when I sat down to watch this movie, I thought it might be a little good. but not. it was an OK movie, not good, but not for most of it bad, but then you end up and it loses all credibility. they should have just died. they did not leave the last bit, which did not make any sense. if they had something at the beginning of the air strike, but we didn't. the first bit is OK and I give them credit for it, but the rest is just flat bad and unnecessary when you think about watching this movie and watching DON. It's terrible to go and rent something that is really worth it. 2/10
