If this movie had been in English, all critics would have thrown it away. The language is extremely bad, the scenes are terrible and it is not funny at all. After the film, I thought that this film could have been written by the eighth grade, at least when you think of the absence of credible characters and certain male parts of the body. (oh, also in dogs ...) The story is just uncomfortable with the more mature Vingar avglas that first appeared for the first time. Of course, Jalla picked the public! Jalla! while Vingar avglas had paid little attention. <br /> <br /> What was really disturbing to me was that the movie seemed really bad. This was probably due to the fact that the first-time director Josef Fares really used cheap camera accessories and then decided to play it just for fun. But the result is a movie that can be easily divided into 12 short films, each with a new director. It was very frustrating. Perhaps Josef Fares should have stayed with his short films as it seems to be the only art form he can manage. Many times in the middle of the movie the story has to move very fast and the characters get into each other so incredibly. <br /> <br /> And then I have not mentioned 2-dimensional symbols, especially those that have supportive roles. <br /> <br /> Although I think it is one of the worst Swedish films of the 1990s and one of the most overpriced, it's understandable that it was popular with the public. I mean, the bad taste has always been the trademark of the masses ... <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the critics enjoyed it. They should have felt better ... <br /> <br /> Grade 2 of 10 / <br /> <br />
