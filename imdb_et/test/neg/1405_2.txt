=========== BIG SPOILER ================================== It's terrible movie with no pleasant characters. So many clichés and pointless scenes. It needs a good editor, but then there may not be any movies. Please save two hours. The only dignified and unpredictable scene in the movie was when the younger brother refused to kill his brother. The description includes "moments of dark comedy". Maybe I missed them when I flashed. Dreadful characters begin at the funeral. Funeral banners laugh and complain about food when they commit suicide at a very young man's funeral? Then does the father make the only son of the well who left? Just at the funeral? How is it that a neighbor whose husband deceives him in the nature of Sigourney Weaver is a bad man who spoke to his wife? The father does not even know that his son can play the piano, although everyone else around him knows he is a great pianist. The film attempts to bring every dramatic cliché into one movie: the father's overall sporting son succeeds, the unsuccessful family loses the chosen son's suicide, the son missed and alone, the drugs, the marriage, the child created through the affair, but raised as the man's son, incest, homosexual predispositions, bullying, potential terminal illnesses, etc.
