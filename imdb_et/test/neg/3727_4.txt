OK, when I was in the rental store and someone asked me if the movie was worth three dollars for rent, I have to say no. The plot was incredible. I have come to the conclusion that Keanu Reeves cannot act. Sometimes he may have a painful look (though my wife thinks she is cute). Dan Aykroyd (who is usually big) was even a little disappointing. On the plus side, the graph (as it is far removed) is unpredictable. Cameron Diaz was good.
