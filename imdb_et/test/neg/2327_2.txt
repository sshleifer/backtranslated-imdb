If you don't like bad performance, bad editing, ridiculous dialogue and incredible characters, you hate this movie. If you like all of the above, ie if you are a Lynch fan, you will love Mulholland Drive. This is probably the worst film that has been rated over 7.0 IMDB. <br /> <br /> Outside Naomi Watts, it's hard to find some competent action in Mulholland. "Hide your face with your hands if you don't have a cap" school. Given the script they were supposed to work with, it is a miracle that not all actors held their heads in their hands. You have a beater, a mysterious cowboy, a married woman, and a lover of her pool keeper, a mafioso-type figure sitting in a dark room who speaks through an external voice box and many others too much and annoying to mention. Suffice it to say that they manage to do a little more than filling the screen time. <br /> <br /> It is not so bad, however, that it disturbs the viewer that the film has no distinct plot. You wait and wait until all the loose yarns come together and you are finally disappointed. For the writer, the hardest thing is to put everything together in a credible way at the end of the film in a way that leaves everyone feeling satisfied. For the writer, it is easiest to make many odd characters and put them in scenes that are not connected to the film as a whole, and then take some small single threads and drag them to the end to surprise. Guess how Lynch goes. SURPRISE !! <br /> <br /> You know that you have a bad script if you have to use the sequences of dreams to make sense of it. After all, the dream sequence includes all sins. Dreams need not be reasonable. A dream can happen to something. <br /> <br /> Editing is similarly distributed. Let's just say that good editing doesn't mean attention. Much of the change in this movie seems to have been made only to pay attention to editing. "Look at me ... You see my editing ... I'm not a genius?" Well, well ... NO! This film has all the badges of the worst and most sensitive French films. <br /> <br /> So why is this movie so popular? My theory is that it is another sign of the breakdown of our culture. Melodies are hard to write, so let's listen to rap. Plots are difficult to follow, so let them give up. It is difficult to paint the pictures, so let the cup sit and paste it into the cross. These are the symptoms of our time and Mulholland Drive is just another part of misery.
