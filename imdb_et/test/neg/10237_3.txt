"The Racketeer" stands for Carol (without the e-name that usually appeared at the end of his forename) Lombard as a woman thrown out of society because he left his wife's concert for a violinist (Roland Drew) who has since become an Alcoholic and a decline in his love. and the interests of the New York criminal flag in the interests of Robert Armstrong. It is virtually concise about what was wrong with previous speeches: stiff directions, still cameras, stagy acting and ridiculously slow temple. While the sound teams told the leaders that their actors were speaking every line s-l-o-w-l-y and wouldn't start speaking their line until the previous actor had finished. About five years later, it could have been an interesting film, but director Howard Higgin faithfully follows his sound recording and systematically defines the talents that Lombard and Armstrong did not have to watch for their later films. "The Racketeer" was made in 1929, a year that, despite the silent listening to the transition problems, gave us some legitimate masterpieces? Vidor's "Hallelujah!", "Mamoulian's Applause", "Wyler's" Hell Heroes, "Capra's" Ladies of Leisure "? All leaders with strong enough wills to tell recorders to fill and let their participants speak and act naturally Too bad Howard Higgin was not as strong as it is, of course, looking at the fast paced actor, such as Armstrong's slogan through the ridiculous part he has spoken, cannot help but do not know where this 50-foot gorilla is when Armstrong needs her.
