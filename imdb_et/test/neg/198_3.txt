When a friend made me the first movie sheep (a pretty bad video-type thing), I said I could grow up; Orson Welles' first film was even worse. He challenged me that it couldn't be, so I pulled out (I think) the laser disc of the CITIZEN KANE criterion and played at the age of HEARTS OF AGE. My friend only lasted a few minutes before giving the point. <br /> <br /> In this short period of time, there is little humor, but it is basically the same intent as (and perhaps a collegial response) to the blood of the POET AND other avant. time movies. That's what it is: sequential pictures of twilight themes, and if you really don't enjoy any of Welles (heavy makeup, to boot), it's not worth it.
