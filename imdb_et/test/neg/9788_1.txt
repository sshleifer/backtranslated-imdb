As a former MST3k observer, I even found this movie unobtrusive. Terrifying experiments with humor - terrible terrible attempts to act. No one needs to read this piece of spam. <br /> <br /> I like how all positive reviews were clearly written by cast members or family members. Just click on their other reviews and wow - they all look at modern vampires. Give me a few bucks and I can do this movie better. One of the most incompetent parts of film making I've ever seen, and that says something. See at your own risk. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10
