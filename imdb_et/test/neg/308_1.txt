It should be one of the worst films ever. The film was screened at the Italian Film Festival in Melbourne, Australia. After screening, I wanted not only to repay my money, but also wanted my life 1.5 hours ago. I have a very high level of tolerance when it comes to promises of making a European film, but it is one of those films that is only chosen for the festival's reputation as a filmmaker. This film shows that although such choices may satisfy the filmmaker and the selection committee egos, there is no joy for the audience. There is no character development, the plot is a messy mess, the style is meaningless, the image selection is terrible and editing is worse. At the end of the first roll, you know if you were in the wrong cinema and at the end of the third roll you pray that you would be out of trouble. This movie is abomination.
