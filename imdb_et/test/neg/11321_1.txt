I like the song of good news. No, I'll take it back. I love a good novelty song. I find absolutely GGROBAR bad and the first comment I've ever heard. When I found out someone had made a comic on it, my head exploded almost. Now that I saw it because my kids asked me, I want my head to explode. It would have saved me from the exhausting misery it was. First of all, making an hour-long exhibition is a ridiculous idea based on a three-minute song. To stretch a song that was going to be crazy to be so long for an entire hour is even more ridiculous. It was badly written, cheaply animated, badly acted ... the list goes on and on. Dear God, is it ever bad.
