The title doesn't make much sense for me. I'm not sure what kind of film the door shouldn't have opened. <br /> <br /> The film starts right now, a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly equipped train car, with a train journey. In fact, a man's house is a train car and he has a train cassette. The woman leaves and calls a young woman. A young woman tells her girlfriend that she has been told her grandmother is ill and she has to return to her home town. He hasn't been there for 13 years. <br /> <br /> Flash back 13 years ago. The building house enters the house. She caresses a sleeping young girl, then goes to another room and stabs her mother. The girl wakes up and enters her mother's room and finds her with a dead knife. He screams, and his hand comes out somewhere and grabs his hand toward the mouth. He's looking for fear. This early event killer shouting in the movie and the girl's appearance is one of the few effective films in the film. <br /> <br /> It's not much for the visual departments. Sometimes the strange use of sound is in the attic and there is some strange lighting in the attic, where many glass panels are red and blue. <br /> <br /> Back to the present day. A young woman arrives at her grandmother's house. There's an old doctor with whom he doesn't trust, with the opening man "Judge" and the city museum operator Kearn. He does not trust any of them and it is true that they do not inspire any confidence. He's pretty dirty for the whole movie. She wants to check her grandmother's hospital. The men in the city want their house and the museum organizer wants things in it (his museum is already filled with many grandmother's stuff). The woman inexplicably wants to keep the house. <br /> <br /> A young woman starts making phone calls from a person who speaks in an embarrassing whisper. He makes a variety of dangers and wants him to wake him up. Such scenes are often repeated. Unfortunately, there are so few signs in the movie that its capabilities are limited. Worse still, we see right from the beginning who is calling. So when a young woman does not know (although the caller occasionally falls into her usual voice), the audience always knows: no intercourse. Every call spins him more and more. <br /> <br /> The end was unexpected for me, so maybe there will be points that don't obviously go, but I'm not sure I will take care of it.
