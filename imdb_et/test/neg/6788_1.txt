It must be the worst show I've ever seen. I always liked Chuck Norris in the movie, but why do we have to politically correct these exhibitions by adding a black side kick that is as dangerous as the Shirley Temple in Little Miss Marker. I also thought the exhibition was limited, because you can get out of the face several times and make it interesting. I know this African-American who looks like this Trivette boy and gets his butt hit about once a week is his attitude. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris is a man and he deserves all he can, I think this show started great, but time lost in steam. <br /> <br /> They should have let the Chucks side bar
