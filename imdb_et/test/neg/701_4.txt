"Ride of Destiny" was the first of several western Wayne who made the Monogram Pictures Lone Star in 1963-1935. In these records, the producers try to make a cowboy singing the Duke called "Singin" Sandy Saunders with fun results All Wayne fans know that the Duke could not depend on his life because his voice was dubbed by Smith Ballew, whose deep baritone sounds like Wayne, but Wayne sees music "Submission" discomfort and inconvenience Thanks to the sky, the cowboy experiment soon ended. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, it includes a standard B-western design for fighting water between the cable (Forrest Taylor) and the local duke, of course, playing the hero, not yet developing the character of his screen and still seeing the line of poverty cowboy. <br /> <br /> Also in the movie were George (pre-Gabby) Hayes as the hero of the heroine, Cecilia Parker as the heroine, and Yakima Canutt is "one of the boys" who performs their "dropping racing horses" on the wagon while Wayne doubles. Both Canutt and Hayes appear with Wayne in most of the other series. In particular, Canutt would have a profound influence on Wayne's future development by teaching him how to move, fight and comfortably watch. <br /> <br /> The westerners of "B" do not get too bad, but I have to give him a failed class because of "singing".
