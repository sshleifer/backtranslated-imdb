There are many movies, mostly from the 80s, that are so terrible that you can't help but love them. Last sleeping party is one of them. I hate this movie so much, but it's still one of the collected movies. I've been watching it countless times and every time I have a huge laugh. This is the best example of how every film in the 80's could get rid of it. <br /> <br /> Our killers are called Maniac Randles. (Scary, huh?) Randles has escaped a psychopathic killer running around in a doctor's peeling and a doctor's jacket hacking people on a scalpel. She's coming up over the girls' house, who has a dream party. One of the girls is the daughter of a doctor who tried to act at Randle, and Randle pulled her into some sort of sexual position. (Lol just look at the movie to know what I'm talking about.) Now I know what you have to think about this issue: It must be another cheesy low budget hack and slash flick like Slumber Party Massacre or Valentine's Day massacre, right? NO! This movie is HORRIBLE! First, the movie quality is turned off and turned on. Sometimes it seems that this could have been filmed this year, but otherwise it is so grainy and blurry that it's not even traceable. The funny thing is that certain specific corners of the camera are blurry and blades, and other specific corners of the camera are clear and perfect, which is completely ridiculous and proves they don't care at all. <br /> <br /> The director played the killer (as if it wasn't funny enough), but because he wasn't talented enough to act and run at the same time, he just filmed one picture of him walking the camera with his scalpel, and then just played this clip every time someone kills. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are completely ridiculous and unlikely, and people who think they are 16-18 years old will see more than they are 25-45. I know that films are usually used by adults as teenagers, but I've never seen a movie where it was obvious. I think the reason why none of them are still in the film industry is that they all have died of old age ... Or maybe it was just because this movie was so terrible that they didn't want to show their face again, and it is good because I doubt they could have got more movies even when they tried. All I can do is hope that Tyler will do the LATEST SLUMBER PARTY 2 one day: FINAL CONFLICT and all the original actors are back. I'm sure everyone would love it. <br /> <br /> The movie was directed by Stephen Tyler, (No, not a singer) who never went to lead again and it was released by B & S (which I am definitely referring to pull and ****) Productions. Bull & S released another movie "Forever Evil", which was quite terrible, but not as bad as the last Slumber Party. <br /> <br /> Terrible, terrible, terrible movie ... Very recommended.
