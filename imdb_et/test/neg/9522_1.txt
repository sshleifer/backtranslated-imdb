I have somewhat worshiped the comments that praise A.K.A. Not only do they sound like they were written by the same person, they contain all insider information that you can only find on the cover of reading from the journal. Please do not say that the director will write his own assessments because it would be just too sad to think about. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I'm another one who hated the movie and was surprised by its unwelcome amateurism. Great idea, shame about its execution. And it was the most annoying to see so many good actors (just like some very bad people, including the lead leader), all probably thinking they would appear in a series of very different films. <br /> <br /> I wish AKA had been cruel, innovative or just just interesting. Unfortunately, it was like an unintentional hysterical home video with artistic endeavors. Missed opportunity.
