I am not a big fan of musicals, although it may not be technically musical. But I thought I'd give him a chance when I love war films. At best, it was mediocre. <br /> <br /> Hudson seems to be completely out of this role. It just didn't work for me. Julie Andrews probably played his part as well as he was, but I just find it hard to buy him as a deceptive spy. Sorry, I know it's my classic stereotype. But I have to say it's Julie's most beautiful and feminine. I've always thought she was more of a matron, but then it's definitely the result of her roles in music sound and Mary Poppins. There is no doubt that they desperately tried to highlight this role in this role. He was very obvious here, but I still didn't buy him as a spy. <br /> <br /> I couldn't concentrate on the whole movie and found myself tuning in and out and chatting with the people in my room (which I usually never do - I'm always all trembling). So it tells you how little it drew my attention. Don't waste your time!
