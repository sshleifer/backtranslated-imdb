The 20th Century Fox ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only a rather silly noir but is an incredible unitary cage of the film. With all the convincing carton marks, it is written by Edward Chodorov, who also produces, and is headed by surprisingly Jean Negulesco, who is expected to do much more. Miscast is in the lead of Ida Lupino! Lupino, a lady who was able to do so much oral sex, is under the illusion of being Rita Hayworth, who plays part of a sexy room at Torch Singer. Stylish Cornel Wilde as her lover is wooden as well as ordinary and completely wasted by the talented Celeste Holm, whose role is a bit more than a bit of a part. Then we have Richard Widmark, who is the most ridiculous in the picture! When we see him for the first time, he's nice O.K. a man who leads a successful Road House. Then suddenly - and for reasons that are not clear enough - he becomes mad for his leader (Wilde) when he tells him he's going to marry Lupino. You see that Widmark wanted to marry him, but - 1) He never offered him - 2) they never had any relationship (they don't even have something like a love scene) and - 3) without anyone (including Lupino)) she has got a marriage license. Wow! So, how Widmark had to bless Lupino for something like that after such a "punishment". Ah? Well, if Widmark goes all over the whole thing, that's the movie I'm sorry to say. This Widmark character is involuntarily comic! Losing his marbles so early is absolutely incredible and convincing. Eventually, he goes over the edge, gets rid of it completely, and with some Tommy Udo snigger he goes ridiculously to poor Cornel Wilde before biting his own dust. <br /> <br /> And if it's not enough for a movie about confusion, the picture is also corrupted by the constant use of studio equipment and the look of the interior. There is no field cover in the whole movie. It adds - 95% of the movie at night. <br /> <br /> In addition to the interactive journal and photo gallery, the extras include featurette "Widmark & ​​Lupino At Fox". No matter what kind of documentary that drove me further! As far as I know, they were never together with Fox or anywhere else! But this featurette is organized by heavy hitter knowledge like Robert Osborne, Eddie Muller, Rudy Belhmer and some others who are astonishingly praising this tiring and brilliant thing. I can say that it has to be me. But so far, "Road House" was forgotten and buried in Noir, and as far as I think it should have been. <br /> <br /> Fox would be better off delivering high-end and hard-to-reach Widmark DVDs like "Ships to the Sea" (1949) and colored "Red Skies Of Montana" (1952).
