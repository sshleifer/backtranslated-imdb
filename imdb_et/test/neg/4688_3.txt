For the unknown, almost all of Andy Milligan's films are shocking, but despite the fact that I've seen many of his films, it's still a cake that's shameful. <br /> <br /> This is, of course, Milligan has taken the Sweeney Todd story, made with period costumes (but not necessarily period hairstyles, in some cases) and the usual headache-causing camera work and grain quality. Well, maybe, I saw the version I saw was somewhat cut because the title is "bloodthirsty". The best reference to loosening film making here is a meat pie consisting of just a few poor snails. <br /> <br /> So when I get this piece, my work, treasure on my video shelf, it's definitely a bit behind the content. Recommended only for foolish and sickly curious. 3 out of 10
