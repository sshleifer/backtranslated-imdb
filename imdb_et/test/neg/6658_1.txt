This movie, "Desperate Action," was .... I'm not sure how to put it in words. Was it supposed to be a comedy? I couldn't laugh when it was absolutely ridiculous. I love Michael Keaton and I can't really understand he did it. They did a good job of keeping their attention, because I couldn't wait to see how much more ridiculous it would be in a minute. I just registered on this site to get it out. I'm not watching movies. I don't have the time for that, but I can't let it go, knowing that I haven't done my civilian duty, letting people (who are IQ 85 and more) know it's not an action / thriller, it's honest good-humor. You people who actually got this excitement intimidate me. Go see a good movie like Million Dollar Baby. Clint Eastwood's acting is not great, but I was at the end. Use Your Brain In America!
