The movie is okay. Meaning I don't regret watching it! I found it working cleanly and most of the dialogue silly ("oh no, it was my grandmothers bible!"). This is a kind of bad remake of the U-turn. The man arrives in a desert town somewhere, meets the wrong people and falls in love with the wrong woman. And take something, he thought he might leave him. The film is quite predictable and there is really nothing new about it. When it's over, you really don't care. Most characters are stereotypes, especially Brian Austin Green! All in all, it's just one of the country's movies, but okay on Wednesday night fun. IMDb vote: 4/10
