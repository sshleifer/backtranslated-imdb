I was looking forward to seeing it at the Sydney Film Festival. I left the theater, like many others, before the final credit because I couldn't sit it any more. It was badly fired, the sound sucks and the actor was worse than The Love Boat. Now I know why this movie hasn't been able to find an American distribution company to release it in the United States. It screams from low budget high school output.
