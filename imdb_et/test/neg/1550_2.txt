Well, the episode I just watched was the older "Gastineau Girl", who was angry about why people mention their man (Mr. Gastineau, famous American football player, probably). He does not want to accept that he is the only reason he does not move burgers, he married someone famous and therefore he is the camera that directed him. <br /> <br /> When the interviewer challenges what he is actually doing, he gave an excellent circular reason why people should pay attention to him: "I really work hard on my reality TV show." Then he said, "I'm not a celebrity ... I'm a personality." <br /> <br /> I am not quite sure who this series is for, except people who have had all their intelligence removed. Certainly this is not an example for anyone except gold miners, because two stars do nothing but spend money, and all this tells the rich people that they have no money problems.
