I don't know where to start. Maybe the whole idea of ​​this movie was just a disaster that is waiting. There is little humor about robbery. I don't know what was more offensive - the subject or the "performance" of David Arquette. It was like looking at the bull to stop this penis, although I think the bull was feeling better later. The filmmakers should find something about Sinatra, except the kidnapping of his son to show (as I don't know his TALENT AS A SINGER !!!!). His family should not relieve this horror. Thanks to God, it was shown in HBO and was not published in theaters. Please do not look at it if you have any self-esteem.
