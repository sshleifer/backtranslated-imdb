It's just one of the worst films I've seen for a long time (and I've recently seen Starship Troopers 2 !!!). I couldn't redeem this movie. A workable, which is probably the best aspect of a film, is fair at best. Michael Madsen carries it in his usual personality. Denis Hopper doesn't seem to know what he should be. Vinnie Jones accent is odd. One positive thing is that Leonor Valera looks fantastic. His behavior is quite poor, but I doubt that is why it is there. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is really terrible. It's just garbage. I don't know who signed it, but they need professional help next time. <br /> <br /> This movie is the reason why the IMDB rating system should be able to add a zero in ten. Avoid at all costs.
