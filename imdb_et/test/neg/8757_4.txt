Well, I didn't know what to expect from 555. In fact, I had never heard of it before a few months ago. But as a collector of some kind of horror, I thought I'd go ahead and grab the 80's twilight things. in a row. What the third title means ... no one knows. In any case, killings begin as the killer looks for young teenagers who are blinding the blind. He demolishes men and ruthlessly punishes a woman. After that, he continues to rape the corpse. The police think they have a lead in killing, but they really don't know what's going on. How do they find a killer? Does anyone care? <br /> <br /> This movie is full of some of the worst actors I've ever seen. No wonder none of these makers did anything else, literally. The three leading participants consist of two detectives and a "sexy" female reporter. I'm sarcastic when I say sexy, she's about as sexy as she gets. These two detectives are like seeing the head and the couples. One of them lowers his part and the other can go to Shatner. Action is so bad that it almost forces you to lose interest in the movie, so it's almost asleep. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps this terrible movie together is some decent gore scenes. For this budget, filmmakers have to put all the money into special effects that are still not so big. <br /> <br /> If you're not like me and I have to have every single horror movie out there, I'd recommend clearing this movie. 4/10
