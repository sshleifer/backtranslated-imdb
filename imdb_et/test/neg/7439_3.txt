Unnecessary money, with nothing but nastiness, is a sluggish second for Robocop. Irvin Kershner's anesthesia, the confusion of the plot's less and tired intervention is traceable and even slightly entertaining in a suspicious, unpleasantly uncomfortable way, but it has virtually no original elegance, emotion, intelligence, or excitement. Instead, we have another empty sight, the only reason for it to exist is to see the ruthless violence of the unseen viewer, which is much less costly than anything in the original. Omni Consumers, who made the original Robocop cyber, have become more totalitarian than ever before, the rental of suspicious Nazi banners, storm players and tanks; like an anonymous old man (Daniel O 'Herlihy), he is a less benevolent defender and a terrifying type of Mr. Burns, surrounded by moral shortcomings who really believe that the brain of a murderous psychopath is put into his body. a brand new Robocop 2 is a good idea. Oh, and the first Robocop has somewhere in this mess, though you don't know what on earth is an exquisite actor, as Peter Weller saw the script. Tom Noonan has nothing like a villain, but Nancy Allen is badly wasted as a Robocop partner. There are some fun moments; for example, opening the "Magnavolt", but this is a bad follow-up of a really great original.
