Yes, the voices are in. This film may be a plan for our 9th generation space. But given that Ed Wood's film, despite all its mistakes, still retains a certain charm, this film defines the word "charming" to the nth degree. In fact, I would advise the editors of Oxford English dictionaries to cite this movie as an important example that defines this word in the next update of the dictionary. <br /> <br /> Carrot Top is the performer of such performers. the insecure ability that normally rational people feel when they hear his name become the most murderous manicures dedicated to killing Mr Top as soon as possible. Indeed, when you go to Amazon.com and look at customer reviews of Carrot Topi's movie and other DVDs, you will find a number that could be interpreted as a death threat to Mr. Top. <br /> <br /> Another curious about this movie is that MST Nelson, the MST 3000 head writer, in his book about Mike's Mega Cheese movies, good and bad, said he saw this movie and soon after, he didn't they were able to recall something about it, including the title. Obviously, Mike suffers from a classic reaction to trauma. Seeing this fear was so breathless, Mike Nelson had to block it. (Obviously, Mike Nelson in the later chapter of his book had theoretically recovered this film. Mike Nelson was certainly not due to his memory because of his review.) \ T just God's honest truth, it's not funny. None of them, not even the nanosecond it's funny.
