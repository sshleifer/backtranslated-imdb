My friend showed me this movie yesterday, and I was really surprised that someone could make this movie terrible! <br /> <br /> Mix the most terrible clich√© dialogue with the most wood you have ever seen with the most exciting special effects on humans and you will get this great beast! <br /> <br /> 'Vampire Assassins' is more funny than most have seen comedies, it's really terrible! <br /> <br /> I was in scenes where ex policeman / vampire assassin is a coffee internet journalist. Just look at it and see what I mean! <br /> <br /> Honestly, one cannot believe that someone did this with serious intentions. <br /> <br /> A tragic but really good laugh. It must be seen as believing.
