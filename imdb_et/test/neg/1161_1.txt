I've done some research on Ed Gien and found some interesting things. Like Ed Gien was quiet and lonely, there were some buffs that wore jerky like in this movie. I say I didn't finish this movie, but I want to. I quarrel over the fact that we all speak in Wisconsin as we are in Kentucky. You know this movie is funny, but oh so sad a factor whether Wisconsin is not as warm as they see it. <br /> <br /> This film is not only offensive to the people of Wisconsin, being Wisconsite himself, but it is a complete insult to a man who has turned out to be a mad, lonely man. He killed two people and the film couldn't even get that right. Ed didn't get that close and personal and scary man, he shot two and the only person he killed. So why are these films lying and saying "BASED ON THE RIGHT NATURE"? It is not based on anything but what the director came with his flawless head. <br /> <br /> Nali and more! <br /> <br /> OK, I would like to add it. I finished this oh sad movie and I personally would like to laugh at the director. Do your homework when making a movie. I would like to inform you that there are no mountains in the mountains (for those who have never been to Wisconsin) and there is no soul! What the hell, Ravenous had more pine trees and snow and it was probably in California. OK, for those who don't know anything about Ed Ge, I would like to give you a lesson in history. Ed Gein is believed to have killed his family, but it was never shown. He killed a barman, he was shot near a bar if nobody was. He took the DEAD barman back to his house. 10 years later, he shot and killed the store secretary, he stole the cash register and the store. He was killed for this murder, he came to the day when his son was there and asked about antifreeze. On the day he killed him, he was there buying antifreeze and the only evidence that had to start with a man's wolf around the world was a recipe that was only antif ...... He kidnapped the tombs, actually robbed 56 graves. He hates the people he digs, and he made a fur coat; lamp tones, sofas, chairs and other things. <br /> <br /> He had a family where he had a dinner once and for a while, and they threw all the meat he had caught, considering he was caught in his house. He was arrested and hidden by the police behind the car, maps out what could happen to him. How do I know all this? I read a book that the judge tried to write to him. <br /> <br /> After this movie ends, after watching all the terrible things, not only have I been offended by the terrible view of the Wisconsin women. I mean, it was hard to tell who this man was on the board for half a time, you know that Wisconsin women are all BLONDES. Please! I'm too insulted by the lack of homework that this man did and the poor work he did on this movie. I have no idea who this Kane boy is, and I think he may be something else, but he did a terrible job of playing Ed Ge. <br /> <br /> After that I am so sad that I wasted the movie 3.99. <br /> <br /> The film was completely wrong after graduation, this movie is like I say the world is flat and George Washington wasn't our first president. Come on people, it's your history, and it's Wisconsin history. To end this bead, how do you all feel when I made the movie and George Washington looked like Brad Pitt (some of you think it's good, but that wouldn't be true) and he lived and wasn't president and whatever. You can't rewrite history.
