Wow! I just don't know where to start from what made this movie so terrible. Maybe I should just start by saying that I had to leave the theater in the "hot confrontation" between the antagonist and the protagonist because I laughed so hard. Yes, yes. The action was really so bad. Operation was not even the worst part. The plot showed almost completely in the preview. The characters are all extremely underdeveloped. Dialogue and "dramatic moments" are ridiculous. A bad guy is a cartoon that is out of control, drunk, sadist. <br /> <br /> Hey, the actors are beautiful, so I think it was supposed to make it all better.
