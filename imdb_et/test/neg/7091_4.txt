OaCD, the YCSF, was a younger audience, keeping up with the descent of the 70s, when the odder and odder material was chosen to be musical. Here's life's regression, ESP and hypnosis ... pretty loop! The real problem of the concept (music or not) is extremely low dramatic contributions; just where can you shoot and what happens when a man falls in love with a previous girl's incarnation, which she can't stand? It can't go to new places, but strangely it can't even go to the old place! Indeed, if it were possible, the audience would still not be interested in Yves Montand (playing a lot of parents, arrogant, French ass) and Streisand's union. (a much younger girl). We do not invest in them, in their situations or in their results. Montand is uneven and his strong accent makes many of his words incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> It has all received a low 60's plywood that makes it very single-use; despite the effort here and there from Mellell, which is honorable. It's not even a custom non-musical story that met any previous success ... it's too passport! Streisand sometimes has a funny business as he tries to fall asleep on his roof and improvise the energetic dance. But he relies on his delicate (translation: irritating) kooky, a Jewish girl. However, he can sing very well at the ends of both the "gentle" and the "power source". In the middle of a musical dross score, he gets 3 or 4 amazing songs * that are much higher than any Fanny or Dolly. "He's Not You" is a sweet cavity as sublime as Lorenz Hart's "My Funny Valentine," but the film can't understand any effect; Because lyrics don't seem to refer to anything in the movie, and something far from hints that great love is flourishing between Chabot and Melinda. <br /> <br /> The only thing we can look at is a bad hatchet job with a much larger film. Strong research shows a longer, better explaining and more decorative, but not necessarily better movie at: http://barbra-archives.com/films/clear_day_streisand_2.html. You can be sure that there are more Babs in this version, but more importantly, Minell would have more thoughtful work. <br /> <br /> Finally, Montand sends Babs a title song for singing after her discovery of a full dick who feeds her self-esteem homily to allow herself to be hooked. And he takes the feed. So, uh ... hooray for that. <br /> <br /> (Hurry up here, love all the decorations, she's not you, and the title song)
