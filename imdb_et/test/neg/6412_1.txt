"Fate" leads to a mysterious novel by Walter Sparrow that has similarities in fear and links to his life, all based on number 23. As the story in real life and fiction, Sparrow has to explain his relationship with the book and how the story ends. <br /> <br /> Number 23 offers an intriguing assumption that has been withdrawn due to weak performance. The film failed on many different levels, which is quite disappointing because it had so many options. The scenario was probably the worst part. It was full of stupid sequences and a ridiculous dialogue that just killed the movie's mood. It seemed that the scriptwriter had a good idea, he just didn't know how to develop it to reach over 90 minutes. There was little ideas on the other side of the movie, writhing was quite obvious and the end was terrible. <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst films and redeemed himself in the Telephone Cabinet and some other movies, but number 23 reminds me that he is still able to smell. He's a purple film, but he just doesn't get good attention. He moves the film at a cumbersome and slow pace. He switches from reality to what is actually happening in a book that quickly became annoying. The actual book in a movie titled "Number 23" is a terrible detective story and the audience gets stuck when Carrey tells it. When Carrey is finally done with the book, we stick with it, watching her run around trying to solve the problem. Here the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We are eagerly awaiting the film to come to an awful end and an unbelievable explanation before we mark the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The exhibition was mostly medium and quite forgotten. Jim Carrey was obviously dreaming through his performance and he didn't even seem to try. In some scenes he was either upright or just very wooden. His narration was full of hearts to listen to, and he didn't put his character in. Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role, but she had to choose better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty cute like Danny Huston. Generally, number 23 was a terrible thriller that offered more laughter than a break or excitement. Rating 3/10
