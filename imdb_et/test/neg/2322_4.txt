I'm not quite a fan of Abbott & Costello (although I enjoy "Who's First") and, frankly, there wasn't much in this movie that would inspire me to look more. It wasn't really bad. It was a somewhat amusing scene and really a very convincing giant, played by Buddy Baer, ​​but somehow, given the duo's fame and respect in which they are generally kept, I have to say that I was expecting more. When the story goes, the couple stumbles on their baby-sitting job and sleeps while they are reading a book by Jack & The Beanstal (when the child reads it to Costello) and dreams of a story. This is the story of "Wizard Of Oz", which means that the dream characters are equivalent to Jack's real acquaintances, and the film opens in black and white and shifts color during dreams. The fun parts of the film include Jack and giant scenes, and Jack and Polly (Dorothy Ford) dance pictures. Polly, of course, also leads to the question of one movie - what happened to her? Jack and the gang were probably behind a giant castle. I know - it was just a dream, so who cares. Still - I was thinking. The couple also had a lovely song and dance routines. My 4-year-old worshiped a bit during that time, so he was able to appreciate some humor. I found this to be an acceptable timekeeper, but definitely nothing to convince you of Abbott and Costello as a comic genius. 4/10
