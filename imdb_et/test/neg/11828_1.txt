Ah Animorphs. I loved a series of books and I dared to enthusiastically everyone in high school and when I heard that television was adapted, I was very excited. I think that was the moment for Nickelodeon to stop his cool programming and more general. <br /> <br /> What was wrong with the series? Let me read how: 1. The characters were HORRIFICALLY miscast. In the books, Animorph was somewhere between 12 and 14, on television for at least 18 years. I remember fear when I first saw cast photos. <br /> <br /> 2. Scary action / bad writing. I can't blame it, so I'm stuck in a thin mass. Perhaps this was the fact that the cast accelerated age prevented humor, which is at least cute, coming out of the 13-year-old, because Marco is not funny. In fact, I don't remember any comic moments from the group and there was little. The actors were certainly not helpful in writing, which was their best and endlessly pathetic in their worst case. <br /> <br /> 3. My lord, who was budget-wicked. Andalite's end result alone should have convinced Viacom to pull the plug ... Their heads were clearly showing what the helmet was. <br /> <br /> 4. Back to the majority - Rachel was by far the most abandoned woman, far from being a book warrior, the best TV equivalents were "scarecrow". I also know that Cassie was an idealist, but there is a difference between "idealist" and "idiot". <br /> <br /> 5. One of the worst headlines. Must music be obvious? 6. Answer to question 6, "yes" because everything else was disappointed, so why shouldn't unexpectedly less intelligent viewers get a thick rap-rock rip-off or whatever it was hell. <Br Since then, there have been major descents (Iraq, 2004), but when I have not made myself clear - this exhibition sucks and was an imitation of the series of books that it was supposed to be based on.
