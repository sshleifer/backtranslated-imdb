Seeing! Antoine Monot, who deals with Kevin Smith's silent Bob, asked for it, but the writer / director Christian Zübert never listens. Zübert just can't say jokes, no matter how inexpensive. The best thing about this movie is its soundtrack. Of course, Joey Burns Calexico and the divine Jonathan Richman, who is underrated by the fame of the old school schoolboy "May something from Mary", would be the story of the fall of every small town for grace. In visual enthusiasm, Stefan (Lukas Gregorowicz) looks cool enough, driving his six-seven BMW doors from two doors, wearing aviator tones. True, he * accidentally * sleeps with his wild eye, the bohemian boy's sister (Marie Zielcke), but then who doesn't? A little bit about how he mentions the black-and-white of this mysterious substance at zero, but if you are looking for a more serious change that poisoning can do for you, I suggest you check "Fear and hope in Las Vegas".
