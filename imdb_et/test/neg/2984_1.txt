Just saw this movie last night and I almost shouted. No, it wasn't because it was completely despised, no. It was completely HORRENDOUS! Sometimes you see movies that make you think about what will become of mankind in the near future - this movie is one of them. Just like a writer, actors, director, etc. just came together and copied and pasted the scenes of their favorite fears, pulled it up and said, "Hey, here's Satan's whip !!!" After seeing the film, I couldn't help but torture it in the eyes of the people called "participants"; turning around as they are some talented art interpreters ... don't be fooled to suck! Do not bother to waste your time or money !!!
