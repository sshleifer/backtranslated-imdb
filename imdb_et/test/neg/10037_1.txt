In addition to being just an abysmally movie (imagine giving a camcorder to an average high school drama club), people who think that there is something "real" about this legend must grow. This is the 21st century. Guess what: ghosts do not exist. Most people learn it from their mother when they are about 5 years old. You need to grow seriously. <br /> <br /> The fact that fraud was committed almost 2 centuries ago does not make it less deceptive. The fact that a large number of English Tennessee Mountains believe it doesn't. Go to college. Or at least stop high school.
