This exhibition makes no sense. Every week, two ladies go to inheritance to do some gardening, and every week they can't kill in any way. Because everyone with a big house with a large garden has been involved in the murder, right? But even if they killed somewhat after the murder, it wouldn't be wise to tell the police? You know, people who actually do something like that ... But these two fools are moving every week, polluting evidence, committing their own crimes, and in some cases causing more murder. If they solve the murders miraculously, the murderer can never be convicted. All the evidence is sabotaged. And you think people who kill murders think they won't hire the two, aren't they? Yes! We have solved the murder! Now, like every other week, we go and kill ourselves with the murderer and tell them that we know about it without backing up. There's no way we could endanger ourselves, isn't it? Rosemary and thyme are one of the worst shows on television and certainly the most laughable.
