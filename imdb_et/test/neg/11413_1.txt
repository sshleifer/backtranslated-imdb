As embarrassing as it is to admit, I was the film's production manager for my first! In fact, this first feature film was for almost everyone. Watch closely, and you will see me even in one of the opening scenes as soon as the asylum seeker named "Cely" (my own surname) was killed. <br /> <br /> Originally called "Hostage", this image was transformed into a "second son" by a producer director who wanted to bring a killer in the series. Nothing would have helped. I don't even think this image is good enough to show "MST 3K!" -Il. <br /> <br /> The film was mainly filmed with old Mitchell cameras and early Arriflex cameras. In fact, the helicopter was hosted during the hostage-taking period of his World War II Arri. The picture was completely filmed in Charlotte and Belmont, North Carolina in the mid-1970s. Most of the "stars" were local TV broadcasters and the rest of the team was inexperienced or gullible enough to believe the former stuntman and director-director, Dave A, Adams' adequacy. If you like to see such a picture, you may like another North Carolina, legendary Earl Owensby. <br /> <br />
