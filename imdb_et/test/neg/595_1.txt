Let's see, cardboard labels, like Muslim terrorists, have forced a cardboard scientist to do some exotic drug tests on some cardboard people who have been stunned and kidnapped. Definitely laugh if these pathetic apologies for humanoids get their deserts! It turns out that drug experiments have given them the ability to understand the other world .... the world of religious fantasy! - with cardboard demons who look like they are made of Papier Mache. Everyone pulls into hell, except for one poor who goes to heaven, where he can probably spend eternity with the absolute games that created this absurd masterpiece. I think I would choose Hellfire myself. Go see something else if you have not stoned the stones, in which case you can really like it! Could not be injured!
