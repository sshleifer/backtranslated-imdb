The first two hours of the television version are full of character and plot exposure - after the tornadoes have been hit early in Las Vegas, this act will not start in just two hours. However, some characteristic relationships do not change to another part. Participants turn to competent performances, but nothing special (but better than "Aftershock: Earthquake in New York"). The exception is Randy Quaid, whose character is superfluous and incredibly annoying. The plot is a fairly common mix of "Independence Day", "Speed", "Day of Tomorrow", "Earthquake", "Anti-Tower", and many other films. You can predict what will happen next, and close to dialogue, literally foretold. Special effects are incredibly bad. Despite the effects of "Twister", the tornadoes in this film seem less realistic than those of "The Wizard of Oz", and other effects were probably less money than "CSI" and "Cold Case" spending on the integrity of one episode. If you need to see a TV-made catastrophe, check out "Day After", "Asteroid" or "Special Edition" instead - get better plots by acting and acting.
