Positively ridiculous film. <br /> <br /> When Doris Roberts, Shirley Jones, and Shirley Knight remain in such films, they can submit their pension papers and collect social security full-time. <br /> <br /> Although the idea of ​​a 35-year-old swinger working on video games loses her apartment and is forced to move with grandmother Roberts and limits Jones and Knight, it has been stupidly treated. Imagine that the 3 bags that your grandson Alex has left in his home and Jones sleeps with someone who may be his granddaughter! <br /> <br /> Video game sequences are as stupid as the rest of the movie. The choice of styles Alex is working on is incredible because he enjoys his weed with others. <br /> <br /> The best describes this unhappy movie.
