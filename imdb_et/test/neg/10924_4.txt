Lil Pimp is a story about little boys who will become a pimp. Animation and voice action were ideal for this type of film. <br /> <br /> I laughed out this movie for the first 20 minutes; mostly on the concept. After that, the joke was thin. Lil Pimp would have been a classic in 15-20 minutes of animated short time. Instead, this film consists entirely of one joke that lasts too long. Unfortunately, it is all that the boy's pet rat is good for if he does not let anything else. Finally, I grew up forever with my comments because I made the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I am a big South Park fan and other adult-oriented animation. I also play a number of online games, so I'm part of the story about the blinds. The transition from a small shop to a lil pimp was great; but after that, both the story and the dialogue became superfluous and predictable. <br /> <br /> I give this movie five ways. It deserves attention to a great concept and voice. Just don't wait much else or you're disappointed.
