This movie was just so terrible that I couldn't get the whole thing without turning it off, it was just so bad! When I watched it, I thought it looked like a real cheap movie back in the 1960s or something like that terrible special effect, but then I realized it was made in 2001. <br /> <br /> The dialogue and acting were really terrible and the plot was almost non-existent. I didn't think anyone would go back to making cheap and old movies, I'm not sure if they did it for the purpose or if they didn't have any budget for that movie. It looks like it's hit on someone's video camera in a local person's house or something. Maybe they thought they were retro or something, but it just appears to look really cheesy. <br /> <br /> I really don't know how anyone could actually look at it. <br /> <br /> 0 5 *.
