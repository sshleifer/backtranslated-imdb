*** SPOILERS! *** Sometimes you do not know what the successors think they have to explain (and thus destroy) the secrets of iconic horror films. The original "Hellraiser" of 1987 was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the most frightening films. The 1988 Hellbound sequel was also a fantastic Horror film, although I personally disliked how the viewer got background information about cobobites. The third part, "Hell on Earth" (1992), was already quite confusing, the makers of which obviously considered it necessary to add a pre-incomparably horrible leader-cenobite Pinhead (typical 90s foolishness) humor and destroyed most of his blur. This fourth part, "Hellraiser: Bloodline" (1996), is somewhat more atmospheric than the third, but it reduces this quality by creating even more stupid and completely unnecessary "background information" about opening centobites and gates to hell. br /> <br /> Seriously - did we need to know how the mysterious puzzle box that opens the gates to hell? I think not, and this is not the only mystery in the philobots that are foolishly destroyed in this film. The "Bloodline" setting goes back and forth in three different periods. The film begins at the 22nd-century space station when scientist Dr Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) tries to shut the gates forever. When government troops interrupt his mission, he must explain his reasons. In the 18th century, Paris was the merchant's ancestor, who was destined to build a puzzle box with an aristocrat embedded in the occult. The beautiful Angelique (Valentina Vargas) body took over the demon raised, the princess of hell. Since the only person capable of destroying the gate of hell is the one who built it, it would be the worshiper's bloodline and those ancestors infected by centobits of all ages ... The film that takes place in the 18th century and in the 22nd century is really a mess. I admit that the 18th century part is a horrible atmosphere and is by far the best film, but also the smallest part of it. The current and future parts are rather weak and filled with fools and worthy elements. The undoubtedly strong sides of the film are terrible make-up and gore effects, absolutely frightening Valentina Varaga as a demon, and Pinhead (Doug Bradley), who, despite losing her fear, is still a threatening villain. For the "Hellraiser" fans, this is an almost offensive idea that Pinhead should be defeated by ridiculous lighting. In general, "Bloodline" is not a complete disaster, but it is sure that it is a valuable sequence for a series that started so well. Even director Kevin Yagher was obviously embarrassed because he preferred to be credited with Alan Smithee. Generally, it is only recommended for hardcore Pinhead fans, and most of them are likely to be angry with their favorite demon fears. Everyone else is well versed in the first and excellent second part of the first Hellraiser franchise and skip all the others. "Bloodline" makeup effects are as horrible as hell, but almost everything else is disappointing. My Rating: 3.5 / 10
