I really don't think about the creative ideas in these films, but seriously. There is no single part of the game in this movie. It seems to be a trend, buy rights, and then just make a film that has zero what the fans want. This grinding is almost entertaining because you know that you can hide behind the lack of skill and control of the money (not yours), which allows you to do it. Play a game or hire someone, please make a real movie or put a pair of rings and let your ass deliver it because it doesn't. <br /> <br /> Wow, 9 lines of text and I did. had to add a blah to apologize
