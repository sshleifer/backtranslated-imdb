This movie is not a horror film. There's nothing frightening, it's more of a torture flick. And that doesn't make me incomprehensible, there are few scenes with missing bodies. For example, a female movie at the beginning. It gets pulled Away returns to the scene toilet Nicole and she and she disappears completely. Then he kills the policeman to put him out of his outrage and disappears from PLUS so that he fires almost twice to kill him, so I don't believe so much when you see his head blown and not kill him? At the end, He sets the killer truck on fire. But he's not in it. He's standing behind him. Then it completely cuts to the rest of the stop and some people are on holiday and a new girl arrives and Nicole asks for help like the first girl she doesn't fully understand. Save yourself money and leave this movie.
