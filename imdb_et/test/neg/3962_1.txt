If you are like me and you have been watching Benji from afar, you will see the movie for the first time 30+ years later, you may be shocked to discover how truly terrible it is and what is more popular than ever before. <br /> <br /> My estimation is not entirely objective, because I have a tendency to encourage children's movies and consequently cut them significantly. On the other hand, I've always hated this dog, "Petticoat Junction" for the last few seasons. It is never a great show that dogs have not been early episodes of at least beautiful actors about beautiful actors and the introduction of a dog for the duration of the screen. <br /> <br /> Benji is a 86-minute mega-dose dog, watching him through several days round through McKinney, Texas. If it seems boring, we recommend giving "Benj" a big birth and never let your Benji fan in your hand (if there is one). Unlike "My Dog Skip", "Monkey Business" or "Winn-Dixie", cast human actors are extremely weak. "Big Valley's" Peter Breck plays his usual stern father and just seems like an embarrassing idea to appear in this flat. <br /> <br /> If one of your children (of all ages) seems to have found Benji entertainment, you should consider reducing your medication. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
