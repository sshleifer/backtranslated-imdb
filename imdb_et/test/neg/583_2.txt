OUR GANG got one chance in a feature film in its 22-year history, and it was the best thing to do? It's boring, forced, and pointless, and I have to honor this movie with another poster; The 1994 LITTLE RASCALS remake was better. Almost everything is. Children are subject to civil war proceedings; It does not recognize our GANG movie at all, but like the humoorless second level Shirley Temple clone.
