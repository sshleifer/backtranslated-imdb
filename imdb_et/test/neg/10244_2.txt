I'm not a movie snob. I liked a lot of movies that critics hate, and I've hated movies that critics love. However, I have to agree with the critics here - "Galaxina" is just inferior. It is clear that this is a comedy, but only a few scattered laughs. "Galaxinal" is bad photography; it has bad special effects; it has some pretty bad performance; and output values ​​... well, kits can also be made of cardboard. "After a long journey (and some very convincing battles in space), the team arrives at their destination, a kind of wild west alien world, with a painfully unforgettable cantata scene (clearly designed to violate the famous" Star Wars "scenes), chase-racing and final holiday <br /> <br /> Casting tries but can't breathe this turkey Stephen Macht and Avery Schreiber have done a better job in other movies James David Hinton is a member of the space ship team, and the recent Dorothy Stratten stands for the title robot , his role does not give him many opportunities to act. <br /> <br /> You can catch this movie to see Dorothy Stratten, but if you are looking for a good movie, you probably want to miss it.
