You know, I was very surprised to watch this movie. It appeared in one day when I was sick, and I had nothing else to do, I kept watching. This is by far ALL FILM EVER! But to my surprise I watched. I was sitting there saying it was terrible, but still didn't change the channel because I was so amused how bad it was. Perhaps it was the man who saw the Big Tom or the fearsome mustache and mohawk that kept those faces from the surviving people. But the girls were not half bad, but if that is what you want, it is much better. Oh, and there is "NINJAS" and "PAJAMA BOYS!" <br /> <br /> So if you like the ninja, the bad actor, the fun (and terrible) dialogue and the two twins who are five feet tall and kill all their eyesight, this movie is for you. It's so bad that it's good. But I just had to give it one out of ten. I couldn't have put it with the Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> ENJOY !!!!!!!!! :)
