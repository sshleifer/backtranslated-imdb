I found this movie in the XXX store for VHS for $ 1. Interestingly, Camp Video acquired rights and created a 1986 credit card. Anyway, strange facts are enough. <br /> <br /> This movie is not absolutely scary. Even naming this fear or "thriller" is ridiculous. More than five minutes was what you would call an 80-minute movie, and it consisted of an example because it was HORRORible! All the stoppers were left aside, writing this film was also an absolute rubbish, just as special effects and makeup were ridiculous. No wonder it is such a hidden film, probably the director has spent the last 35 years in the country for all the existing copies and burned them with one big pile so no one else could do it.
