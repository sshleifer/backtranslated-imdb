OK, so I know better than watching a movie on SciFi. . . er, sorry. . . SyFy. Or shifafa. Or whatever it is now. So dig me. I spent my entire Saturday doing the idea of ​​a non-profit advisory board. I can be forgiven for my chair and want to watch a movie that I never saw, instead of reading Proust in the original or learning how to play. <br /> <br /> Which means I didn't deserve open graves. I didn't see that, by the way. Were they there? Did I sleep? Why is it called? <br /> <br /> Some icky images. Not much fears. As with too many movies of modern horror films, there is no reason to take care of any humanity - apart from shared humanity - for that reason. Half a point, but a walking entrepreneur who had clichés but had one good scene. <br /> <br /> It all plays like a gallery that has been delivered through a board game. This game has no intriguing picture and it includes one of my favorite parents. I'll give it so much. The drawback is that the game had more personality than most characters. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you didn't see it, I think you slept. Somewhere back to the genre around the dawn.
