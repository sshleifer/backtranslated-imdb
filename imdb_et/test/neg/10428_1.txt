The journalist Bob Woodward's bubbles, scatterhot, and sometimes suspected actresses of John Belush's rise and fall will get a totally wrong-priced movie that is a nervous "fantasy" led by Larry Peerce, as if he had done something nervous and vital. Michael Chiklis (years before his breakthrough "The Shield") puts Belush in a viable position for portrayal, making a post-mortem journey through his life, creating those "Saturday Night Live" sketches that are now part of TV history. It's like watching someone Lucy Lucille Ballist - you can't do that. The reason why there was such sadness at Belush's death was that he was kind. Chiklis makes a commendable part of the search and is funny in the early scene, trying to escape from the grudge. However, it is uphill and no actor - no matter how talented - could have saved it. * from ****
