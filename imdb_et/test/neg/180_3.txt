This film seems to be the current trend of globalization and homogenization of the wine industry. Wines all over the world are increasingly joining large conglomerates (American producer, Mondavi, for this film) or paying high-quality experts to help them "perfect wine" - and so the wines are very standard and predictable. For some it is good (especially since few can afford to pay $ 50 or more for daily wine) and for others it is terrible, because the uniqueness of smaller wine factories disappears. I really understand the concerns of both sides and do not believe that this business is a villain or a hero. Of course, good and cheaper wine is a nice thing, but like what happened to beer (like giants like Unibrew and Anheiser-Busch), food (McDonalds), shopping malls (European shopping centers are almost indistinguishable from American ones) and mega stores (like Walmart / Asda) take a lot of "small boys" uniqueness. So I was definitely ready and ready to listen to these filmmakers. However, for a product that is almost two and a half hours long and a general lack of focus, the film simply turned into a great arrangement and I lost interest. A 80-90-minute focused film would have been much more effective - especially because the average viewer is NOT an oenophilic (for the word "wine aficionado" with high rain). <br /> <br /> The very positive side is that filmmakers don't want to talk much at all - and just let people on both sides talk. In addition, the topic is both relevant and timely. Even though a good documentary style is chosen, the film just goes down the road, is too long and ends with a very dull film.
