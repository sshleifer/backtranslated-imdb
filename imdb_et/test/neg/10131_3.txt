QUESTION is a very bad television film of the 1970s, starring a team of wife and wife of Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood as hesitant lovers. He has polio and leads exclusive existence as a pop music writer. He is an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and absolutely defeated. Their thing, as it is, is doomed from the beginning and knows it, but goes with it. Two things to look at when you are trapped while watching it: Wood Jane Fonda's hairstyle that has never been mixed, whatever she's doing, and the tune she sings at the beginning of this terrible flick. She sings it in four or five or six minutes, so you know it's between classical upholstery. It is also one of the worst songs ever written, and the woman who had made the voice of Wood had to shoot and put her out of misery. Also observe all peasant tops and dresses. For comparison, Wagner sees classic, suitably timeless, tightly cut hair and sports suits.
