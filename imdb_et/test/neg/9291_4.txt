Barricade finds Alice Faye without any songs trying to escape from China and without a passport. He's puzzled, I don't say exactly, and even American extraterritoriality doesn't help him out. <br /> <br /> I mention this because one of the complaints that China, including the bandits attacking the American mission in the wild that was deep in the Chinese interior, was this particular institution where American citizens who have committed crimes The American Courts created by our consulates tried. We were by far the only country that did it. <br /> <br /> In any case, the story opens with a train where Shanghai tries to use the hokey Russian accent. The fall of Warner Baxter, who has been pretty plastered. The bands break the journey and two of them are looking for refuge at the US Consulate, led by Charles Winninger. She's the best in the movie and I just want a better story because I liked her character. She is a widow and proud member of the consular service, named William McKinley in 1900. Ten years later he asked for a transfer and he heard it. As Assistant Secretary of State Jonathan Hale, he is a true forgotten man. <br /> <br /> Baxter does all it can to make someone like Clark Gable sleep in MGM. Heroes would be more natural to Gable than Baxter, because the mission is barred and protected from bandits. <br /> <br /> Alice Faye had one song for singing. Why Alice's song was cut off, God and Zanuck only know. One thing I still try to think of is when the missionaries take the final shelter to the basement, where there is a trap door, just who stood up to pull the carpet over the basement floor? Barricade had the potential to be much better than it was. However, sloppy editing and lost faith in the project put the 20th century Fox project into action. Watching barricade is like eating badly cooked meals.
