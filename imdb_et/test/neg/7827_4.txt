Asia Argento is a sexy beautiful woman who loves to travel around naked, which is not in itself bad, but when her character talks about all the boys she served, and see her with the current effort of Michael Madsen and the Asian guy, it made me feel I needed watch this movie on a condom like this disease had me or something rubbed. <br /> <br /> The film felt it was going to be a love triangle / drama / action / ??? The plot, it just seemed to go everywhere and at the same time. The action was great, the plot, not so big. The director must at least choose the genre and practice, the practice, the practice, before trying to do something so complicated, because they are probably not very good.
