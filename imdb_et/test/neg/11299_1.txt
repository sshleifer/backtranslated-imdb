Summary: Following the silence of the recognized sheep, Hannibal has a large budget that cannot fully achieve; it is not only smart as its predecessor, it is not even a sprayer or a temporary or horror film, but a totally boring time-out. Don't be fooled by the media hype, and especially the stories that talk about the cinema and who have been intimidated by the scenes of eating the brain throughout their lives: in the film, it's just ridiculously bad SFX. Why so many people in this forum claim that H is "not all bad" and "worth a look at the big screen", etc., is beyond me; and it's not "so bad it's good", it's just boring. I usually respect the opinions of other people, but in that case I have to say that they cannot obviously say Shine - Ola ****. Maybe they have fallen victim to media hype, maybe they have never seen Ridley Scott's movie and were impressed by his excessive backlight, smoke and the use of widespread AC fans. H is not a full tension; Instead, we get an endless scene from Lecter that travels through English-speaking Florence, an incredible and enthralling plot with more holes than a fishing net (after Hi, I have to wake up half a night, trying to find all the holes in the plot and when I drop them I wrote, I quickly filled 6 pages with a small type before I forced myself to stop). Instead of wasting your time and money on seeing it on the big screen, I would advise you to wait until it reaches the TV in a couple of years; and then fall asleep early. <br /> <br /> 1 / 10. <br /> <br /> Below are a couple of additional bones that I have to choose with Hannibal: <br /> <br /> - H _ is a sequel to SOTL, regardless of what some people in this forum claim. And although SOTL was a very difficult act to follow, there are the followings that _are_ en par with its predecessors (SOTL itself was a Michael Manhunter based on "Red Dragon" by Thomas Harris and although the first episode was a very enjoyable movie, SOTL it was even better, another example would be an alien series initiated by Hi director Ridley Scot - so much about the theory of dwindling lakes. In any case, leaving the sequel is not an excuse for the complete torture of the film. <br /> <br /> it is based on the same author as SOTL's novel A list, excellent cinematography, big budget, first-rate scriptwriters, yadda, yadda, yadda, and the end result is just in church church. So what's wrong? is my interpretation: DDL produced "Manhunter" which, despite all its features, was a commercial flop. alive, allowing Jonathan Demmel to make SOTL and the rest is cinema history. Then DDL had to wait another ten years (now it is 81) until Thomas Harris finally came to the end. I think DDL had lost all interest in making a good movie right now and was desperate to finally get his piece out of the cake before he jumps into his cap. <br /> <br /> - Another aspect I am deeply disturbed by this flick is that it gives him so much unearned leap; I mean, it's boring but one of the biggest gross productions, so there's no need to publicize it freely. And while most reviewers talk about how Dantesque's scenes in Florence are and why Jodie Foster did not participate, the mere fact that this movie is ultimate is perfect for the UTTER flop. But there is more: not only Hannibal jumping through the roof, but also that it is used as a media program counter for a number of documentary films (usually left behind SOTL-like productions) on serial numbers. , cannibalism and profiling. But not only does H pretend to be realistic; The lecturer is no longer a serial killer (now he kills only for necessity or to help Clarice Starling), profiling hasn't even been mentioned (because we already know HL, so there is no need to create a profile) also lack of cannibalism: Lecter feeds stunning Paul Krendler's brain, so it makes (erm) unknown - auto-cannibalism. Try to make a documentary about it. <br /> <br /> - Much has been said about action: mainly whether Julianne Moore can replace Jodie Foster, and Anthony Hopkins (who plays the leading Hannibal Lecter) usually has a lot of praise. I think all these discussions are debatable. There are many of my favorite actors in this movie (namely Liotta, Oldman and Moore), but the script just doesn't give them anything to do. Same to Hopkins: his character has no development and is not challenged. And by the way, he plays almost identical characters in all his films, only in H he has to make an odd murder a bit and pay $ 11 million at a time.
