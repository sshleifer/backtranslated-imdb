Title: Dracula AD 1972 <br /> <br /> Director: Alan Gibson <br /> <br /> Cast: Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Stephanie Beacham <br /> <br /> Review: Sometimes movies can be time capsules that will take you back at any point in time. In this case ... our Hammers Dracula AD 1972, which brings us back to the time Austin Powers felt at home. <br /> <br /> The story is from a group of children (not a group!) who love to relax in the caf√© shop "The Cavern". One day, Johnny Alucard (hmm strange surname ... wait ... it will show Dracula back!), The new member of the group will give the group a new chance to get their hit. He offers them a black mass and black magic. To whom they say "sure why the hell is not, it can be fun!". So, at some point in time, he is not sure that he will return Dracula, the Count. <br /> <br /> This movie opens with a flourishing party in a wealthy home. He knows who is not his party among the people, but they are all trying to stay in their house. Drug Making, Typing Tables and Dancing. The filmmakers assured that this sequence would be fully involved with any young people who were cool at that time. Everyone says words like "way out" and "groovy" and they stop with many of these sentences, saying "everything that jazz". So yes, it's pretty obvious it's 70s. First of all, this is a band that sounds like "Jefferson Airplane" ... I mean you are drowning in all the 70s. And when I looked at it, I asked myself, "How the hell is Dracula with his black and rise to all this?" And that's what happens. Old Dracula feels on the ground at all parties and rocks and rolls and drugs. Many movie scenes are great ... but unfortunately, the music that they decided to add to the process is not at all appropriate and takes you completely out of the mood of things. There's something terrible or frightening on the screen, and suddenly the powerful trumpets and congos start to beat and you just took out the fear. It ventured me out of this movie into the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> But just pulling off the 70's music (a disease that was also hit by satanic rituals) was pretty good. But I mention that. The story was just what we saw before Drakula's blood taste. In fact, this story is almost the same. Let's see ... a young boy inhibits Draculas round and ashes ... check. He then decides to bring Drakula to life with the help of some people who don't know what they're going to get ... to check. Black mass to bring Dracula back to the consecrated church ... check. The list of similarities continues and continues. So this movie is not very original when you ask me. <br /> <br /> There are some things that make this movie worthwhile. For example, the fact that the film is a historic master in London in the early 1970s makes the movie fun. I had to laugh and smile every time someone spoke 70 in jargon. I couldn't believe some of the clothes that these people wore and the cars they drove! It made me a movie fun, but we are here to see that Drac kills some virgins and revenge in Van Helsinki. Did we get something? Well. There are some good sequences that squeeze the old school hammer fans. First of all, there is the Black Mass sequence, which was primarily satanic! They call the names of many demons and a lot of blood flows. This sequence was fantastic, but the music was confused by its most important moment. Then the actual resurrection of Dracula, which Ill admitted, was great from a visual point of view. Draculas grave and slowly but surely Christopher Lees silhouette and face appears in fog. Cool shot! I love it! We have Cushing and Lee at the end. And I couldn't laugh at a moment when Dracula sheds the furniture through the air. I laugh because he's done it every movie since the dracula's horror. This is the Hammer tradition where characters start throwing candles and chairs at each other. And I think it is a bad guy who puts our hero on a candle to see their exciting things. Anyway, Draculas dies in it, is very similar to any other Hammer Dracula before that, the vampire slips and then cut into a series of frames until there is only ash. <br /> <br /> All All, inadvertently funny Hammer Dracula movie. It was trapped in the 1970s and although it makes it fun (and it is not as terrible as the dracula satanic rituals), it is still not very successful with the Drakula universe we were waiting for from Hammer. <br /> <br Rating 3 of 1/2 of 5
