This 3-hour mini-TV set came with us at Blockbuster this weekend. The production company spent a lot of money on collecting money, on a costume (especially Bridget Fonda) and on special effects (including the big Jim Henson, who talks about the polar bear and the reindeer). They should have spent a little more money to get a single script. The story was so loose that it never came together. The Germans emphasized in Ireland cannot be forgotten, but not the sensational narration. With meaningless open ends that contained devilish hospitality, it is certainly not meant for Christmas. It is a shame that two female leaders gave good results.
