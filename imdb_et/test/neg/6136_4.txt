Jumpin Butterballs, this movie stinks! It's a boring and innumerable drag that never lets. It is a miracle that someone even bothered to make Grouchot's odd brands of eyebrows and mustache because he has nothing to do with it or to ward off and say no about this hole. Chico must be so interested that he forgot to use his Italian accent. <br /> <br /> Only Harpo offers a gift or two, and there's little time to go here. Imagine a hotel manager and another messy comic for Frank Albertson, and the road becomes even smoother. <br /> <br /> Real failure.
