You're dead, an indescribably terrible attempt at a British gangster movie. It has no original ideas as it is a scary copy of a variety of Lock Stock and two smoking pins, conventional suspects and cellulose fiction. Action and dialogue are absolutely frightening, the plot is ridiculous and completely predictable, despite the constant plots of plot twists, and it contains nothing more than the characters and clich√©s of one dimensional stock. It has some good actors, but they're in shape and can't do anything with the terrible material they work with. It is an absolute torture to sit through this generation.
