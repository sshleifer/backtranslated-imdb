I had been waiting for this release for several months. Previews looked good, early reports on the net were encouraging, and the golden eye and time planners were great shooters (by the same people). It turns out I was very mistaken! Haze had the potential to be there with Call of Duty 4 and the following gen shooters, but it looks, plays and feels 5 years ago. I played Haze on 1080 TV and was initially disappointed that the game developers limited the graphics to 720. There is no detail and atmosphere in the Haze universe, the feeling that "they have to be fast to stop" at all times. <Br /> <br /> Controls are slow and cumbersome and I haven't yet found the x / y axis sensitivity adjustment. In a single game, there are many parts that are very dark (visually) to the point where you don't really see where you are going. Why not add a flashlight function like Halo? or even better, night vision? The use of "nectar" drugs to increase performance is interesting, but as you get used to, you turn the sides and don't use it again! why bother? I could go on with many other Haze bugs, but I just say DON'T! wait killzone 2 or play 4 and try to open gold in AK!
