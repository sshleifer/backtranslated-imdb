I love bad movies: Showgirls, Outspace Plan 9, so on. And this movie fits well. Don't believe that someone who tells you is a good movie. This is absolutely terrible. Tim Curry's accent moves from German to Portuguese into Hungarian. In the Gorilla suit, there is a person who should be able to communicate using a glove that translates the monkey sign language. There's a scene with a killer hippo that moves around the river like a big white shark. There are people who jump up and down Mt. Kilimanjaro, as if there were escalators. This thing is ridiculously ridiculous. As ridiculous as I ran to the floor. This is absolutely incredible. I loved it every minute.
