Fear of comedy fans like this. Others may quickly get angry and shut down. It is a kind of movie with extreme violence and gore, intentional stereotypical characters and a lot of crazy. <br /> <br /> It seems to have made about $ 100 in budget, with a number of brothers boys after a big beer pot party. There's a driver who is frustrated with nerd, and his loudmouth's nonsense buddy who hits him about 30 times per second. There's a cool monster truck behind driving those hundreds of miles that are featured in the film. If this thing and its gnarly-mask wear a driver, this is a great scene. There's a mysterious girl who accidentally gets into their back seat and a lot of giant boys hanging on a red neck. Nerd's friend does not turn their uprising and sends them one after the other. Their claims came to my nerves, but other aspects of the film make it. <br /> <br /> Vision hooks that are fun against several "psycho-tormenting and trying to beat someone" are everywhere. Take your choice of which one is the most: Hills Have Eyes, Saw and Jeepers Creepers were some of what I felt. <br /> <br /> This is an enjoyable madness when you are in the right mind. Sensual dulling brewskies with friends can look at it more fun; it is a good contribution, which is the condition of filmmakers when they put together this thing.
