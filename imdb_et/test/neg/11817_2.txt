This is one heck of a bad movie. Like many "women's chains" movies, it's full of lesbian. Unlike most of the earlier films that were expected to do so, BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA shows a terrible amount of skin as a horny female prison guard for women when they shower, as well as having sex with one prisoner. In the early 1970s this is definitely a pornographic film - such as GIRLS GONE WILD GOE PRISON! It is also a bad mess of DEFIANT ONES, though in this case there are two hot women hating each other who are in the chain of escape. If the original text is considered classic, it can only be considered a classic example of bad taste. This is because there is no fineness and the film is just cheap - cheap excitement, cheap writing and very cheap action. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier is a "black prisoner attitude" - a woman who was assigned and sent to jail for this hellish island prison. Margaret Markov is revolutionary. When they flee, they can't stand each other and have opposite goals. However, because it is based on clich√©s, it really is no surprise how the film ends - both of them become (gag me) friends.
