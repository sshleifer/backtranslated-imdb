The action was flat (at least none of the participants who just got a script in the morning) and the film and sound quality made me think about the 70s of the week's bombs. The only thing that told me that it wasn't really a 70's movie was a reference to DNA testing. But for me, being an Eastern Orthodox, this is the toughest thing about this ... movie ... was the complete romance of religion. Romania is 88% Orthodox, but you never know this movie: Father Soren is Irish. And I would have known it even when I didn't see the actor playing Irish Pub, Michael Sullivan in Star Trek: Voyager's "Fairhaven" episodes. The bishop wore Roman clothes (and not even the Orthodox bishops wore their garments unless they say the liturgy, especially when they live in a monastery). The only non-Roman artifacts I saw was that the church door had a 3-bar cross, and even then I had to see it. The first reviewer said the manufacturers had done their research. Well, if this is true, they were mixed with the religious aspect of the film.
