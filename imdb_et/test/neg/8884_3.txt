I made this movie was good from different people. In addition, I like Natalie Portman and Javier Bardem and director Milos Forman. But after watching this movie, I had nothing to admire. <br /> <br /> For the first time it worked very much below average. The performances were simply not powerful enough to really feel shocked by the Inquisition. Javier Bardem gave a solid result and was probably the only one who actually had a Spanish accent. It is quite obvious why this Bardem was the only one. Natalie Portman, who I think is a very good and upcoming actor, didn't hurt me to be tortured. Like the film, there was nothing to admire about his admiration. Stellan Skarsgaard, who I like, gave a very average result, like other actors who gave me boredom. This movie was essentially about him because he plays Goya. But he didn't get what he had to do to make this movie. What about Randy Quaid? You just have to joke me. He plays King Carlos IV. Look, he's great in comedies, but he's a king who just describes the whole movie for you. <br /> <br /> Leadership was just terrible in this movie. When a movie is confusing, two people are usually guilty: director and writer. I feel that Milos Forman did not really want his actors to put Spain in the accent. Of the very few battle scenes they were all terribly shown. Also, as a director, he must give you a sense of shock that the Inquisition did. After this movie, I felt that I could neglect the event. All in all, he barely missed the scenes and the participants were wrong. <br /> <br /> Writing by Milos Forman was just as bad or perhaps even worse than the driver. There was really nothing memorable about the movie, except what we saw where Bardem had received the same treatment that Portman had received. In addition, the film did not recognize the timing of the film and at least it could have been quoted by quotation or two. <br /> <br /> After finishing the movie, I just watched my TV thinking why I should care about it. I care and are very interested in history, but when such films occur, it seems that the producers have robbed you of something that could have been removed from the movie. If the movies are bad, we will highlight a lot of technical mistakes in the film if it were good. Like accents. I'm not sure people would have emphasized the lack of Spanish accents if this film was good.
