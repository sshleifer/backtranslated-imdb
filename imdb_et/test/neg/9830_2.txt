If you've ever wanted to know more about cab drivers, it's a great movie that can only be viewed for information. I just hear it now, "Wait, wait a bit! Why don't we have to head to the cab all day long? Cabbies is funny and so are the people they meet and they talk to each other in just a few minutes so other actors should be Harry, you take care of the production, Joan, you have the materials, Brian, you go around some of the actors and we all meet here tomorrow to film! "<br /> <br /> The first 90% of the movie couldn't be worse if it happened. At least without planning, there is always a surprising element. Some of Jim Carrey's films have been added because they go along and they always make a good box. The problem is that the first 90% are pretty well written and pretty much sucks. Paul Dillon plays a cab driver in Chicago who works all day. We see pretty much what he sees. People enter and leave the car and drive around the city. He speaks to these people for a few seconds and then we get more people. I testify that here and there were a couple of funny bits. A religious family tries to talk to a cab driver about going to church, she takes a pregnant woman and her husband to the hospital, breaks a rich businessman from her girlfriend, a poor girlfriend, and takes home a rape victim. I think the moral of the film is that the cab driver is more than a cab driver and has more power over the life of his passengers than I originally thought. For some people, it is simply an opportunity to get there, but for others, his very common words help change the direction of his life. the rest of the movie and a little success. It had a little bit of the fact that repentance of death fever seemed to him, where most of the film sucks and then eventually tries to make it better in just one or two changes. I was not surprised at the film as a whole, but some bits and pieces were worth again. As for the participants, Paul Dillon is it. John Cusack, Gillian Anderson, and Julianne Moore are all in about 30 seconds, but don't look at any of them or be sure to be disappointed. I give other people some credit for not being your usual movie, but it wasn't very good either. There was not enough material to keep it for one and a half hours. It was a good effort, but it didn't work.
