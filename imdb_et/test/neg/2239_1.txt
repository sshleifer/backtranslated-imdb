Little Quentin seems to have got the art of making a cake and eating it. Of course, Mr Tarantino. Violence is Baaa. Sadism is Baaa. It is worth doing so. How very brilliant. <br /> <br /> A minor part of the audience may not be smart enough to track all the intelligent references to a higher level of consciousness, but I'm sure they will see the daylight. <br /> <br /> Thank you for making a little better in our world. You deserve a medal.
