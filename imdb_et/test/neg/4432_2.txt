Ramsay ?? the comedy kings (or the horror, whatever) woke up after years of hibernation. And yes, I scared. Not because it is a horror element (of course I am not so stupid), but because the rats danced in the khatmal-chaap theater by constantly training their feet (where other films are running elsewhere). content. Man is repeatedly put down, pushed to death, filled with plastic and placed under the pool. But he returns to revenge. Now was the movie a thriller or a horror? It's also a stop for you. And finally, it turns out to be another secret of the mask. Remember these secret agents of the brand Ramsay? men who wear some stupid horrormaske. Only here is the mask person. I don't think you need more details to skip this flick. <br /> <br /> Amarr Upadhyay tends to become too dramatic and theatrical, forgetting the difference between cinema and TV soaps. Cheap and skimpily dressed Aditi Gowitrikar looks like a typical pink lipstick that looks like .. .. (Uh! You know what). No movie department, be it technical or creative, is not worth commenting on. Novelty is absent in both story and performance. <br /> <br /> Dhund is definitely a mist of your senses.
