An alien is a film by Steven Seagal that was originally intended for theater performance in March 2003, which was said to be the opposite of Seagall's previous film (Half Past Dead) in a dense box. According to some reports, the film had a very large budget of $ 20 million, including taking up a seat in Warsaw and Paris, and was terminated as part of the studio's commitment to a double agreement negotiated after the relative success of exit wounds. that Seagal still had a strong track record. <br /> <br /> In spite of the size of their investments, Sony Screen Gems probably changed the shelf of this movie. It's almost incomprehensible. What am I saying? That's incomprehensible. I don't think I understood what was going on, except very widely. <br /> <br /> Seagal works with a mysterious man to deliver a mysterious package to another mysterious man. Other mysterious boys are trying to stop him. Other very mysterious boys are trying to kill moderately mysterious boys trying to stop him. Other really mysterious boys are doing very mysterious things that were all too mysterious for me. The proposed recipient's mysterious woman tries to take the package out before it can be delivered to her husband. As a self-proclaimed "perfect professional" who is hired to deliver a package to her husband only, Seagal first breaks a woman, then participates in protecting her and her daughter with other mysterious men who have unexplained agendas, as well as her husband. <br /> <br /> Many people have a mysterious and secret conversation. Many people blow each other's brain out. Some boys seem to die more than once, while in other scenes, gunfights end without a clear view of the result, so the audience sees someone dying, but not sure which gunslinger is at the end of the threshold. Creeds often travel by adding additional secrets. Or should I say confusion? <br /> <br /> I don't know who was or from whom someone really wanted, and the resolution was as good as the exposure. At the end of the movie I just sat down to think, "Is that the end? What ...?" <br /> <br /> I couldn't even think of credit. IMDb says that Aussie actor Kate Fischer ("Sirens") was in this movie, but I'm fucking when I know where. Did he stay on the floor of the cutting room or he wisely abandoned the project. He could have found some activities that would be more useful for his career, such as unnecessary surgery, the removal of extra irritating maps from the press, or some community college courses in animal husbandry. <br /> <br /> Seagal was a pretty fair-handed fighter, but the action did not redeem this movie at all. Seagal is now in his 50s and is a very big man, so he is reduced to the minimum level of physical exertion and even when he is in the knee-length mantra to hide his dark Brandoesque circle. He may even bring out a little to remove the wraps from the candy, although it's understandable if you appreciate how many of them have to eat to maintain their current circumference. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal seemed to be returning to the wound exit, but when his last movie was dead, it must be close to the other side.
