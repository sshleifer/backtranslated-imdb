It is a very strange film that has a name on the web and virtually nothing. It uses an approach that is familiar to those who have looked at Creepshow like, because it introduces "horror" short trilogys and connects them together as a connecting narrative of people who have participated in the departure of the bus. There is a narrator who talks about the relationship, but talking is not at all confusing and just adds confusion. Like the stories themselves, well. I swear I have no idea why this movie got 18 certificates in the UK that would bring it into the Nightmare On Elm Street and Exorcist. Nothing here is far from scary. There is no gore, sex, nudity, or even a swearing word to liven up things, this is the kind of thing you could put on children on television and no one's eyes on the eyelid. I can only think if he had received the assessment he actually earned (PG), it would not have had any serious horror blower so that the distributor was likely to get into the BBFC until they were released. Anyway, here's a summary of three stories: 1. The man becomes dangerous with his telematic car to dispose of his bride. 2. A person living in a dirty apartment is understandably puzzled when the living organism has evolved from its six-month tuna casserole. 3. A woman thinks she has found a perfect person through a computer-based dating service. This is until he starts acting strange. And there it is. Some of them are quite fun because of these extreme spaces (my favorite is number 2), but you get the feeling that they were a) frightening and b) moral games, unfortunately they can't both hope unhappy. In conclusion, this flick is a hidden curiosity .. for very good reasons.
