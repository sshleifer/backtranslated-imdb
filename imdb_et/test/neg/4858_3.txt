This 22-minute short from the previous "Rock and Rule" predecessor, contains two folk song mice that don't go anywhere. The female mouse, Jan, writes an agreement with the devil to hit the rock star. So Daniel Mouse has to save his soul. At the end of the 70s, all these decades were made (crap music, hair style, terrible folk songs). This comic is the second disc of the 2-chain Rock & Rule magazine edition, along with making it run for almost as long as the display itself. <br /> <br /> My class: D +
