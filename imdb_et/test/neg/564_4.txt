Made in a glimpse of documentary style, arrests of the late 60's and supposed losers of the mainstream government are given a choice. It is possible to choose a prison for 7 years of life for wrong deeds, or spend three days and two nights in Punishment Park, California's Southern California Desert. In 100-degree heat, prisoners hold fifty miles of American flag for freedom. The US and state law enforcement agencies follow two hours. When dissidents are caught, it means prison. <br /> <br /> This pseudo-documentary features Carmen Argenziano, Katherine Quittner, Mary Ellen Kleinhall, Stan Armsted, Scott Turner, Patrick Boland, and Kent Foreman.
