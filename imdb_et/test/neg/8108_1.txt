There's no need for a spoiler to drive ... well, weird movie. Canada becomes part of the US. OKAY. So, I think I'm unusual, but I was expecting something about Canada's consequences for the US. Foolish myself. Continue on with this movie and you are a coconut cloud. The presumption of opening has nothing to do with the rest of the film in which you (do you trust) do not care about any symbols. Slings and arrows and southern lunches must be one of the most imaginative series. But in this case, Paul Gross was not so sorry to say that he had no idea about making a single film and a lot of talented players in the wasted process. Real disappointment.
