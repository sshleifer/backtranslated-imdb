You have to see it. I couldn't laugh at the stupidity I saw in this movie even late after the event. There may be a million single errors and fools in this movie. Operation is bad. The story is so predictable and flat. The effect is like 50 years old. The expected thriller is nowhere. You can't enjoy the movie, but you laugh at it and enjoy it for a long time afterwards. We had a lot of time after the movie. Really. I and my friend spent all this 40-minute bus journey from home to talk about this movie as we have seen the next Oscar winner. Unfortunately, we talked about all the bad things we just saw.
