Alain Resnais manages three parallel stories related to the fantasy and imaginative world of adults. One of them has a kind of operative bordello story, where the rejected architect tries to manipulate a group of people fortunately - only his attempt is missed, the only true target, the woman he pins after. At the same unfinished ch√¢teau he built, the group looked for teachers in a more modern story of love, because one woman believes that the role of romance is irrelevant and the cynical anthropist is trying to learn by putting her up with the greatest jerk. group. Meanwhile, a number of children are fantasizing about a princess similar to George Melies, who rescues a girl in trouble from sex beings and then kills the evil king, bringing the kingdom of love. Two main topics? Life is a fairy tale and life is not a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> What sounds better than the movie really is. Resnais is a type of driver, where the term is often good or bad, but exposure is important; Here the concept is great, but the film is completely painful to look at. Properly tune the songs, the signs of the bubble color without the ounce of dimensions, the deteriorating pastel background - instead of giving your inner child an ice cream cone, Resnais drops it into the cake hat. Add some French philosophy and you will get a strange witch brew that will not revolutionize the bubble attack and problems, but just sit a little on your stomach until you want to take it back. <br /> <br /> Resnais is a risk manager, and even in his worst case, you see that he is trying to do something that may not work with full clarity. When I want to go home, he succeeds in pulling past tedious signs and dark objects, showing some real changes and taking a moment of silence to catch the breath. Here he is directly subordinate to fantasy, which does not really reflect the fantasy, but the wallpaper of the baby's room. The biggest problem is that he managed to have a more luminous film than the 80's pop-videos and more than the musicals of the Golden Era Hollywood. The fantasies are beyond childish and naive, but the film (nudity and embarrassment) is definitely aimed at adults, a target that he decisively failed. If this is something, this film is impressive simply because it is unpopular. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
