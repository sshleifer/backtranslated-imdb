I saw this movie at Temple University. I can't take a picture of anyone seeing it in a movie theater. The procedure is similar to the recorded sound (TV show). The plot is simple and unimaginable. Sound recorder likes wind sound and DP needs light meter. Vampires, vampires, vampires. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money.
