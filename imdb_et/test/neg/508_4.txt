The recent death of one producer, HEAVEN'S GATE, Stephen Bach, has raised at least the partial resurrection of the image of the damned movie. In addition, a recent release of the "long version" published in TCM, which has probably been released to a larger audience, was recently shown. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie when he first came out of the third Avenue cinema over Bloomingdales. I think it was published on Friday and canceled next Wednesday. Maybe it wasn't a fair release, but it was and is a terrible movie. In a full-length version, a recent decision and about thirty years more experience in watching and writing movies can better explain why. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is a terrible phrase "mise-en-scene" whose definition is so simple at the same time, but so amorphous that it is even thought after definition. Basically, it's all about the camera. For example, a crowd appendix is ​​given by saying that the sidewalks are walking on the sidewalk and start on the ground. When the assistant's assistant screams, she goes extra on her own. If there is one more, go back to the starting point and go again to "action". All the extras do it. Then tell me that the cab drives to the sidewalk and the letter goes out and covers the other principal, while crowd supplements do their thing. See is a mise-en scene. In a theater they call blocking, but the cinema is much more multidimensional. <br /> <br /> The importance of defining the Mass scene is that when the French critics developed their theoretical author, the opposite of the author was the métier-en-scene, which was further called "traffic turn". The author was closely related to the meaning of the film and the topic or topics highlighted by the director's duties. The Metier-en scene was basically the company that made the film that was delivered to him on paper. That's the difference between John Ford and Sam Wood. The second point is how the director Michael Cimino got into the film management. Cimino for the first time highlighted the first million dollar TV ad. It depicted Chevrolet, which swam on the great canals of Venice. This commercial use never appears on the lists of the biggest TV commercials of all time and is only noticeable because it was expensive and how superfluous it was. The effect is similar to a three-year-old girl who brought to the company a company that gets her biggest response when she dresses up her dress. Lovely three years old, embarrassed thirty years old. That's how Cimino came out early to spend a huge amount of money on the top picture and he learned. <br /> <br /> His first film, THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT (1974), is a scene where Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges are passengers traveling in enemy cars that drive back and forth until it leaves the road and the driver opens the rabbits full of trunk he continues one by one. I had the feeling that if the manufacturer, Eastwood, hadn't stepped in, that the scene would last until every rabbit was killed. <br /> <br /> What brings us to South Gate. I think if a movie is watching a DVD like a mini series, it can be impressive. This is because the scenes are focused on such a dense scene that every scene is like an encyclopedia, it is just common to sit for almost four hours. It's like sex, at some point it becomes whipping. There are 40 minutes that take place in Harvard. It is perfectly photographed in Oxford, nothing more. Personally, I am in favor of the artistic way of opening a story rather than a van. "Now I'll tell you what I'm telling you about most movies. But the whole preface adds only one line - Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt went with Harvard. Now twenty years later? All this time, money and effort, not to mention all viewers' attention And it's just that virtually useless to transmit information about energy. <br /> <br /> Then there is a street between Kristofferson and Masur, which continues and continues with a city and horsepower vehicles with a constantly moving background to provide little displaying information. This is the one after the second scene. It's like trying to eat thirty pounds. Then there are those long conversations about incomplete details and incomprehensible, pointless dialogue that continues and continues and is exhausting and boring. <br /> <br /> In general, this rich piece is a spin of commendable articles. It can be seen that it is hidden when possible This is possible when it is possible to whip the scene. But don't let anyone say it's a good movie. When I saw it in 1980, a man was sitting in front of me, commenting on the scene where Kris Kristofferson is on his horse and he turns one and then the other and does it about six times. "It's symbolic," he said, "he doesn't know where to go." Basically, its kernel is the basis for any Pro Heaven gateway criticism. <br /> <br /> Look at this when you need to, but be careful, it's not a movie that's time to come, it's a stinker that smells all the time. <br /> <br /> HEAVEN'S GATE is extremely inaccurate. I recommend Asa Mercer's book BANDITTI OF THE PLAINS from Johnson County War.
