I logged in immediately after watching this movie, feeling it was so terrible that at least its reviews could be entertaining. But everything you are wrong seems to be of this type. And so, because I want the job done ... <br /> <br /> The film shows its contempt for the audience's attention, showing a completely irrelevant picture of the irrelevant bridge for a long time. for a long time. Then it goes to some slow roller skating, which is at least a bit cool, but then sets off the sound of excitement that coincides with the most repulsive soundtrack I have ever heard. Some girls who speak pink in French that sounds like plywood leaves that bump. Whoever decided to be there has never traveled. It seemed to exist to control the limits of the audience's patience. <br /> <br /> The film is about 50% slow. You know what's worse than free slow motion? * Nothing will happen. * Here's the guy who walked the way. Here's the man who's sitting. Here's the guy who looks around. Here's a man who looks at another man. After a while, I started watching the movie at twice the speed, bringing it back when people appeared on the screen that was part of a real dialogue that was rare. Once, surprisingly, I slowed down the movie to find out what the girl was saying to find the camera showed her, but the sound was another terrible, horrible song and her real voice was not audible. br /> It reminds me of some great tips I've heard in writing - if you have nothing to say, don't use fancy tricks to pretend you do. Go back to work and think something to say. All these camera girls, such as slow motion and strange lighting and lenses and freaky music, are lacking in content. Many people have apparently bought it and perceived emotional gravity and deep meaning, but I think they are projecting this film that did not do any of the work related to it.
