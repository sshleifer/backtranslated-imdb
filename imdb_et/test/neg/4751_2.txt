There was a time when the alien series was successful even in the third installment of Alien 3, showing a promise under a fresh and young David Fincher guild. The first Predator was a post office whose main reason was his story, the "top" star Arnold Schwarzenegger and director John McTiernan (Die Hard). The films Alien, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator were all very successful and they create such huge successes among the fans of the overall film as well as the fans of science fiction. Supposedly, Predator 2 and the resurrection of the alien would have had to signal the end of both franchises, but the studios were empty and saw the chance to hear the fans' rumors and connect the two. Step by Paul W.S Anderson, Alien Vs Predator and now Brothers Strauss (Visual Effect Graduates, not even Directors or Writers). The problem was that by allowing the Sci-Fi genre in such deep and revolutionary creations, first of all, to the mediocre director and now the director's novice, there is nothing unlikely, but incompetence. As a witness to Alien Vs Predator Requiem (AVPR), he feels tired of having a hard stomach so that the series could have become worse. <br /> <br /> One example of this franchise's cinematographic deterioration is the open scene and can cause nausea among fans. The film begins with an alien on the Predator's ship, reaching for the predators' chest, growing into an adult Predaliene and lowering the Predator's craft (which seems to have much less Predators than it had ended Alien Vs Predator) and all this happens when the ship is still in the Earth's atmosphere. When a ship has discovered AVPR quickly, it offers cheap plot methods and basic narrative conventions, there is no reason to use twist or subversion in two original films. The tiring plot is progressing at a tedious pace that is only the result of conflicting conflicts between Alien and Predator, and if it is a threat to us being bored, we will be treated with a charming blonde in a bikini or a quick fire. AVPR is plagued by infinite number of continuity errors and plot holes with little or no narrative explanation, i.e. members of the public who pass through an elite military unit or Predator who does not follow the laws of previous editions. It is a film that completely ignores its predecessors, it violates some of the most important rules of the sequel, and in doing so it feels like trying to set itself as an independent function. Regardless of the fact that the film has no hearts, no conviction, no soul, and no other film, even the most basic consistency. This is illustrated by the overflowing narrative of the film, as it undermines the premise of the first alien. Because the species had previously been exposed, they would have been more sensitive to the first foreign film and not as poorly prepared as they were. <br /> <br /> In filmmaking, the film is almost terrible, I urged that at some points the flashlight would shake, the illumination was so bad. Using such gloomy and dark effects can the audience feel as if they are disappointed with some of the activities? which is ironically its purpose and also shows the absence of films from the budget. As with all scientific literature, one scene is usually the most memorable scene, in which case it is likely to be a hospital impregnation scene because it is always so quietly original Alien themes, writing it. Management is bad, the performances are weak and the script rotten. AVPR is a film production conveyor belt system where ideas and techniques are gathered by inefficient people and then a finished product distributed between cinemas. It is characterized by the absence of nervous death scenes and the withdrawal of blood battles because certification does not allow it? lower certification to reach a larger audience. AVPR was a purely business activity and nothing else.
