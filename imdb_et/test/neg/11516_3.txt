"Be With Me" is almost the ultimate wallpaper. Just leave it in the background. Chat with each other and return to it whenever you want, and at some point ends. Unfortunately, when I looked at it alone, and so I felt like I was almost looking at the worst, longest and most painfully sentimental, commercial time of the world, when I almost managed to keep my eyes open; and then I managed (just a) a few moments of awake to acknowledge the film sponsors "Thank you", which included the Asia Pacific breweries. Aha! Methought: How surprising is that * - considering all the Tiger beer shots, which is the most forgotten fall of the whole movie? In the meantime, there is a dialogue between individuals who occasionally have recesses, but not too often talk and recognize the overall story of the film. It would be as if it could be turned off at any moment and later returned, and you would have really forgotten something that would have been an unnecessary situation or part of the plot of the film's overall progress. So the ultimate "wallpaper movie"! <br /> <br /> Well I don't know ... What movie were those who looked at it positively? I don't know and don't know ... It wouldn't have been an artificial Singapore excuse to roll the camera. It is supposed to be "love, tragedy, and redemption" related to "with me". But everything I admit was boredom, a semi-baked scenario with endless textless messages, and the only salvation was what happened when this totally useless movie ended. What a slow waste of time! It was also said that the characters in this film were fictitious, except Theresa Chan, a "remarkable woman who has won accidents ..." Well, disrespect to Mrs Chani, but because she was so wonderful and amazing, why at all was the scenario involved with other characters without the weakest attempt to unite your life? Yet it was almost unlikely to be a boring film highlighted by the run of credit. Instead of associating the fate of all the characters, I really felt that the film was almost impossible and apparently fell between the feces if some viewer involvement could be worried. <br /> <br /> I am generally a fan of the art film and usually do not accept a slow pace (which is missing here, believe me !!). I hate movies like 300, Transformers, Fight Club, but I think, for example, Eric Rohmer is a great filmmaker. So I hope this will put my criticism in some perspective. However, the whole concept and delivery of the film did not have any redeemable function that could prevent its eyelids from falling down slowly when every minute "Be With Me" dropped in a minute. Watch this movie if you need to waste time. Otherwise your life would not have been richer. 3/10
