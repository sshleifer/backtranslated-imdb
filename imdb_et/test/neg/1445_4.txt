For the first time, I rented this movie on the infamous day of September 11th. Since then, I've seen it many times. My only complaint is that it is too short. "Strangeland" would have been two hours of complete horror. Currently, the running time is only one and a half hours. <br /> <br /> Ex-Twisted Sister Dee Snider wrote, produced and celebrates a small town in Colorado in 1998. He plays Carleton Hendricks, a mad sadist who has psychotic ideologies on human development and love for death-close experiences. Hendricks is not a thrust, it is pumped into a six-foot "modern primitive". Someone who has been very tattooed and pierced by his body. When he first appears in the film, it is a truly frightening vision. She visits internet chat rooms under the name "Captain Howdy" and then calls people to her house. They believe they're going to the party. Instead, they find themselves in a house of pain and suffering. Hendricks sows its eyes and mouth and tortures them on the blades and hooks in many parts of the body. If it sounds sick, it's because it is. <br /> <br /> One of Hendrick's victims is Genevieve, the daughter of a detective Michael Gage. Gage can not only save her, but also arrests Hendrick. Four years later, Hendricks is released from a psychiatric institution that has been completely restored by the community. Groups led by Freddy Krueger himself, actor Robert Englund decided to kill him. They fail and Hendricks returns to their old self. Except for Snider, it doesn't work well, but it is usable. The direction is also fine. "Strangeland" has some humorous parts and they are very funny. I also loved the soundtrack, it's fantastic and worth buying if you love rock. In general, this is a movie that you should watch. If you love low budget horror movies with a sense of humor, check it out. Probably like this.
