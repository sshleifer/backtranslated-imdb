This movie is very bad. You can say that all the actors are embarrassed that they associate with such a really horrible movie. There are obvious budget constraints, but little thought and attention to detail that the film could have been so much better. For example, look at the scene where Mickey goes to the graveyard for the first time and tells his friend about the pathologist, while the murdered taxi driver is on the plate. You can actually see the body breathing! What, can they afford to hire a clean decent extra that could hold the soul in a 2-minute scene?
