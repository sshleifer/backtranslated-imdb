It was agreed that this movie was well photographed, but it doesn't make sense and there is no use in how they did 2 hours, out of 3 little little love story, <br /> <br /> it could have been bold and beautiful or ok, please don't look at this movie, because every 5 minutes there is a song that you dreamed to give this movie a 1/10 reason that was the lowest and not based entirely on a real story, more than half of it is done. I repeat photography in the direction of 7 or 8 out of 10, but the film is a bit too much, the actress's nose voice just makes me want to go to her nose to strike. If you are not real to her mesh fan this film is a big no-no.
