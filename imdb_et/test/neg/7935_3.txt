OK, here's the thing. I love action films and there is no problem at all to stop a lot of beliefs about plot holes or other unlikely acts. But this movie went a long way from minor mistakes and went straight to ridiculous. Let me get this straight. The police send a notorious gangster and police (along with many other prisoners) on a bus with two guards together. They are then forced to stop in a safe place where two police officers work, one of which is a day away from retirement and the other is burning. Apparently, the building was soon closed, so the police decided that everyone else who was in the area had a night before the New Year. Right. But wait, it gets better. Gabriel Byrne shows that he takes Fishburne before he can rob him and the other dirty police. (although we never find anything in their relationship or transactions). Interestingly, the attacking policemen are in full swat, with night vision goggles, attack rifles, all nine meters. Later, they even bring a helicopter with more people in full equipment. I'm not a cop, but I'm pretty sure you can't just roll out of the station when the whole swat line is equipped, without asking what you do. And police helicopter ?? The alleged terrible storm ??? Also, does it happen that nobody would hear or see the great constraint that comes with the flash grenades and heavy rifles? I mean seriously, come on. I know it was set in Detroit, but even there would be a suspicion of a supposedly highly secret mission. I also love the fact that they find a Tommy weapon in the room and somehow the gun is working and still has balls that are healthy and usable. <br /> <br /> I could live with these problems if there were no other outstanding issues. First, a couple of minutes of the movie's opening are shot very amazingly and hyperactively, and I thought I was going to set the tone for the rest of the movie. Unfortunately I was wrong. The rest of the film does not have any pace or tension or drama. The "characters" are not in any way related to one another, which is probably due to the fact that they are not particularly interesting. An interesting action is not enough to make it a good action film, and there is not enough character development / narration to make it a satisfying thriller / drama. The "relationship" between Hawke / Fishburn is the only thing the director is trying to do even interesting or intense. Oh and by the way, the last scene in the desert? I thought it was in the middle of the industrial part of Detroit and maybe we're in the woods? Working in this film is not terrible, but leadership and writing are cruel. I really have some Hawkes, Fishburne, Byrne, Dennehy other movies, but it's terrible.
