Regardless of which committee the PC performer is responsible for, this film has achieved something that I never thought about: take some really talented actors (Davis, Hardin and Taylor) and want to make sure you never find them in a closed room. The feelings underlying the scenario are both jejeune and idiotic, it is impossible to understand or imagine which audience would be more attractive, much less funny. Architecture students may be? <br /> <br /> Only one scene is visually clever: Marcia Gay Hardin sashaying, all prisoners and rhythm, bar, succeeds in bringing out more style and energy in ten seconds than the rest of the movie boosting the tenth power. For the other majority members, obviously, they do not want to resume it again.
