Skeletons In The Closet takes the father-teen son to the new low levels of the genre. This is a film that has no purpose. The plot is placed within the first few minutes, there is no intercourse, the characters are clich√©s, and despite the confusion and confusion, everything plays out just as you think. Halfway through the film, I couldn't stand the pace of the snail anymore and I started moving forward quickly. The movie ended exactly as I expected. Linda Hamilton is excellent as always and other participants are above average, considering that it seems to be completely inadequate. If you really believe that you need this uninspired quiet wannabe whodunit, look at it further.
