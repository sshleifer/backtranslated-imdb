Ohhhh MAN this movie is terrible !! <br /> <br /> This kind of hit is what gives the bad name or name of the Canadian cinema. To be fair, I think most Canadian films give the Canadian cinema a bad name. movie editing and pace. It's like a drunken snail that makes its death. <br /> <br /> Thank you for the goodness Melanie Doane has a nice look. He's the only thing that watched me. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie had to be interrupted. <br /> <br /> Good laugh if you have a bad Canadian movie night. Doane? The only good point (too bad that they didn't make sense to keep the camera more than one at a time).
