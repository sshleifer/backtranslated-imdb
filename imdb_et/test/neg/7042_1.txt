Oh my God, which must be one of the most used brushes in comedies! What has happened to Subhash Ghai, even for the money of Apna Sapna that was worth watching <br /> <br /> Eww! GOD This movie smells <br /> <br /> Don't look at it Save your money Bad Movie Bad Cast Bad Jokes Bad Acting, even this movie is an example of shoe grinding on the face <br /> <br /> Trust me This movie even makes smile, vulgar jokes, cheap jokes, really stupid movie without thought <br /> <br /> Rating 0 10 im never back ... <br /> <br /> Pakistani Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi
