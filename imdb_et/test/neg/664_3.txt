Another movie with an asterisk star. So far, I've noticed .... wrestlers can't act on the screen. This movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> Action is terrible. It makes you laugh at what they say, and they can't be serious, they're trying to scare, but they can't and can't look stupid. Action is terrible, maybe a bad director. <br /> <br /> The plot was stupid .... Just a few people are placed in the hotel because they are criminals and they are killed at random. The movie is stupid all the time, making it one of the worst I've ever seen. The only thing I think, and that's why I give it to 3 and not 1 because Jacob Goodnight dies. Half through the head and his stories dropping were fantastic. <br /> <br /> In general, this is really a horrible movie and you should not waste time on it.
