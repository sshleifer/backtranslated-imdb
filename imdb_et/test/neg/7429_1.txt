This is my first review of IMDb and I'm glad that the standard rating is 10 because I don't have to change anything ... <br /> <br /> First of all, there are terrible movies. Movies to laugh like Island City, Battlefield Earth or Conan The Destroyer. This is perfectly acceptable. They make a big favor. Then the film is still the worst. I can't believe how this steaming dog crab was very stupid. like this one. Everything in the art of the box was very promising. Then I quickly downloaded the tape when I got home and the first thing I noticed was ... WHAT? Maybe 10 minutes (or more) between the current clips and setbacks with a very annoying blue effect with sounds that make you dress. And it will continue over and over again. Then some "work" will begin and you will not know why you have ever been born in a world where torture of humanity actually exists ... And then I realized there were actually twenty twenty. I didn't think about it first, but the title says "3" ... And I was terrible. But as I really look at the great pain and embarrassment, I thought nothing could ever make me worse and worse about this universe ... But then a small text appeared, saying "Next ..." and ... NEMESIS 4 ?!?!?! NOT NOT !!!!!!!!
