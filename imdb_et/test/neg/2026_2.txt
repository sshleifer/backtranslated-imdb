The original voice sounds like "Wind" can be quite intriguing, but as the story opened, I knew it was downhill. The main things in this movie that blew were terribly bad things that all the main characters did (except for some scenes involving Mic's internal instability), lacking the full character of the character and absolutely no point on the plot - What were the writers? <br /> <br /> Michael Mongillo won 2 'horror / sci fi' awards for 'Wind'. AH? What was so scary about this movie? NO! With the exception of the evil 2 video images of the inhabitants, the rest was more "made for the thriller" - it would not even need to be changed. If you want a much better movie about "renting your friends" instead of "Shallow Grave" instead. <br /> <br /> Wind * / *****
