If you don't want to see a 2-hour scenic mountain material that contains hysterical characters, many histrionics, and cheap 70's gore (and not that), I would recommend avoiding this movie. It is long-lasting, too long and has a rather annoying amateur feel. Masterpiece? No, the average thriller, photographed in an average fashionable, beautiful Italian landscape. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of the 1970s slow paced movies when I have a joyful and entertaining plot. In that case, it didn't work for me. The plot is tritized, interwoven with superficial and stereotypical characters, backed by fun angry mobs and your typical Italian widow dressed in black, robbing. <br /> <br /> If you don't know and know the Italian land, the movie may be worth seeing because the landscape itself is remarkable and amazing. However, this movie is not something ordinary, there are much better Italian horror waves. Not much more than a spider fest. 5/10
