I'm going to give 1 instead of this nonsense 2 because there's a worse show called Haunted Homes. But this boy and his buddies are conducting their investigations like idiots. They assume the ghosts are on the move and if they find rational explanations about the experience they have to have in drug-taking and shouting to receive it. But after that, the entire format of the exhibition is incredibly annoying. Although much seems to have been written, college educated children who make up the pain hardly speak English, but still require them to try to use "big" words that they probably don't understand. And the heady Ryan's ridiculously important voice calls make me just throw through the TV window. (and he stays stoned all the time). In short, this group makes TAPS guys out of Ghost Hunters like MIT scientists!
