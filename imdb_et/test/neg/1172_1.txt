Ed Ge's story is a disturbing and terrible story. Ed was a really confusing character and his legacy was inspired by such "fears" as Tooth Fairy, Norman Bates and Leatherface. How then has such an exciting man inspired such a boring melodramatic piece? Ed Gein made straps of nipples, bowls of flasks, leather pins, dancing human skin during the month. None of this made it a movie because they had to give us a fictional story of a ridiculously terrible deputy and her pretty home, sex-hungry girl. This film seemed to be a way of falsifying its history. What disturbs me is that most movies mislead the truth to exaggerate history; it seems to do so to minimize it. I just can't get it.
