Start with the premise that you are doing something to replace your lost love with a similar look. Throw your scientific knowledge about a deformable disease (is this not what Leo G. Carroll concluded with the "Tarantula" spider moth)? Throw away the fact that the main character, instead of finding something tough to attract a young woman, deals with heavy paws until she draws attention and has to hatch this mad plot: if she can make the girl's father sick, help her recover, she will marry her . The problem is that most of the events are random and unpredictable. Anyone with a half brain would have seen things. There's a third person, a woman whom the doctor, J. Carroll Naish, played with great sensitivity. You know he's a factor. There is also a gorilla, which is kept in a cage used from time to time in the sky. Oh well. There is so little point in that, who is playing it and people just get their desserts.
