The only reason I give this movie 4 is that it's made for the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode. The scary direction is only overshadowed by a few characters who are unable to act. Lead is an actor I have never seen or shown. No one loves love and so cute you almost don't care about what happens to him. Dick Sargent was not convincing because all the guy he was for was supposedly super evil ... he was more annoying than anything. Peter Graves was the only person who was not terrible in the film, his part was small, and even he could not compensate for his lack of talent. In 2004, somebody again tried to call this crap an island ... I personally didn't see this movie, but what I understand about the same movie. If you want to laugh at this movie, get the MST3k episode of its really funny ... full of strokes and biography that will make this movie finally traceable
