Ed Wood, perhaps the worst filmmaker of all time, left us dear, so bad, they are joyful, inadvertently funny and so charming and innocent. <br /> <br /> James Lay and his financial supporters (Mom and Dad) seem to have made credit in the Dreamland movie as badly as any Ed Wood movie, but it has no charm or innocence. Dreamland just stinks and the only good thing about this 90-minute waste of time is to know that James Lay and his companions will never make another picture. <br /> <br /> I have to mention some dramatic some teams took to avoid being associated with this terrible picture. I am sure that the production processor, having seen the film, has demanded to change its name to the accounts of Donna Snartlebutt and Brutus. One can imagine that Brutus has his 5-dollar bill roll that will pay the crew at the end of the shooting day. <br /> <br /> I don't mention a lot of technical problems with a little video tape, but I have to mention some comments that compare it with the work of David Lynch. You know that you have shown a real stink on IMDb when you signed in to your mother and posted such an amazing BS - no one can save violent mental patients, or-what-a-mistake with "dream land" all that Lynch produced. What a terrible lack of Mr Lynch and his work. Go back to the film school, Mr. Lay.
