I was glad to see this example when I started seeing A&E ads. I have been with spirits and paranormal impressions because I was a child, and I love to grab "Ghost Hunters" when it is (SciFi Channel). I have tried to look at three "Paranormal State" episodes and only use their time commenting on it, because it is so bad and confirms the perception that anyone who believes in paranormal is a gullible freak. "Paranormal country" is outside the cheese. Cheesy's "Director's Log" voice commands that will leave you with Captain Kirk. Cheesy teasers go into business cuts that are completely out of context. All paranormal at this exhibition is automatically assumed to be the work of "evil" and demonic spirit. Then exorcists, demonologists, psychics ... like "Poltergeist", you almost have to wait for the team to leave and say, "This house is clear." I highly appreciate the "Ghost Hunters" approach, where they enter to refute the claims, then take away what they get ... and they almost always reassure the client (if they find something) that he is haunted by evil equality. "Paranormal country" is not "so bad it's good" ... it's just bad. Wasn't A&E "Arts & Entertainment"? The artwork has long since disappeared and the entertainment factor is now shrinking.
