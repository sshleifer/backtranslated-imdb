Pretty liked Flesh and waiting for the Heat, but couldn't but Morrissey seriously took advantage of most of the "performers" featured here. Nudging with narcotic stupor seems to be all Dallesandro capable of this function - a great and heart-breaking contraction of muscle. His semi-installation with some scenes is the only sign that he can act; in most cases he seems to have done something about buying drugs. Woodlawn is a revelation that is right - it is the embodiment of the Lower East Side. But she's one woman - she rarely deals with other performers, but she has to say that her sexual scene in a beer bottle definitely leaves Halle Berry in the dark when it comes to cinematic raw passion. If he smiles at the young, it is a vampire wild. Two female speakers, Andrea and Jane, have such annoying voices that you need to silence your scenes. The fact that several of these performers have committed suicide or have been murdered in a few years, adds air to exploitation. But they were probably desperate in front of Morrissey's camera. It is probably not spent on Saturday night, but at least it brings a specific time and place to life alive.
