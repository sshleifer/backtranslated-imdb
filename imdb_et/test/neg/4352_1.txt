It's the slowest movie I've ever seen. The very weak script gives Jack Palance and Rod Steiger the opportunity to offer exceptionally good features for the show. Palance and Steiger affirm that they are really serious actors who can play their role by power, emotion and drama. The story itself moves at an incredibly slow pace, mostly in the living room. The director moved the actors around in the rhythmic circles because they gave tiringly long lines to keep the slow pace steadily noticeable. The action will not last until the last ten minutes of the movie. If you're the one who is looking deeper into the drama of crime, it's not for you!
