This month, Netflix Instantis has been viewed and reviewed. <br /> <br /> Let me say that most other comments are very accurate. This movie was bad writing, bad behavior and bad leadership. I also liked Russell and Pare in "old times" and were very hopeful for them. In my Netflix review, I mentioned that I lost interest in the movie and started washing dishes and seals, but I still look at the kitchen film. When I returned to the living room, I was very confused because the last 5 minutes of the movie opened. I even repeated it to make sure I was missing something. This film completely outlined how to end the "twist". I suspect the idea sounded good, maybe the script was intriguing, but the budget was so non-existent that the collections were really missing. And yes, I think all these "bad kits" were trying to give the viewer a clue. All I was told was a "small budget." , believe me, Shutter Island is the same deal, only 50-60 times more! (Actually, I have no idea how much Dark World pays, but I hope they didn't spend more than 1 million!) A little, got a bigger budget for a better "look" (whether it meant a better scenic designer or better painting, but someone who had vision), they could make Dark World a satisfying product. Now it seems that Shutter Island is doing it. Looks like they got the vision right, but scripting can still be turned off. Money can't buy everything, but it should be in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> PS My 2 star rating is Russell and Pare.
