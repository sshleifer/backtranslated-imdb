Mod Squad is not a movie, it is trivial. This is the most exciting thing and the thing that watched me? I would never have seen a movie that didn't offer anything before. This is a movie without any reason, seemingly seemingly developed to address someone as if they were just a contractual obligation to someone who really doesn't like the studio. There is no graph, no characterization, no piece scene action, no scenes as such, but progression of empty frames 24 frames per second. I'm not talking empty, like a fool snowball, but empty like "We haven't got any pages yet, just point the camera and stop if you have 90 minutes worth." It makes you appreciate Charlie's Angels and S.W.A.T. "Artistic achievements". much more. What she offers is too big Giovanni Ribis's most annoying condemnation, making the sons of a thousand mores who call for the Marlon Brando method, which works routinely, Michael Lerner dances with Omar Epps and ?? no, that's it. Oh, Clare Danes has a nice smile on one picture. And Dennis Farina feels like he's gonna die early. The truly most meaningless film ever made is like L'Humanite without jokes, but you know the kids.
