I think it would have been a more suitable title for this movie because it is cushioned in hell and back with various bugs and animals. I recently found Prey in his original VHS 'big box' and was very excited. I just love finding VHS old slasher movies because the cover design is fantastic. Usually, however, it turns out that the film itself is not fantastic. Prey is one of those films. <br /> <br /> To be fair, it began with OK, the killer pursued a clich√© in the teenage forest. The used heartbeat sounds are a great effect that makes you struggle when you look. This movie is basically a great fat cliche, and when campfires roll, the film takes a new direction and spends almost half of the running time on the back of the killer. I thought it was a very original idea. Nonetheless, the story ends sharply and shows us some material about the burning forest (the budget deficit really is starting to show up). After that, we will be returned to the foolish young people who will be taken off the forest. The killer himself is not shown to the end, which is a disgrace, because he actually kills an effective face. Like Cropsy from The Burning, but better. As far as gore is concerned, there is not too much, though finally the face is OK. In general, I wouldn't want to recommend this movie to anyone other than slasher graduates - it's really a big mess.
