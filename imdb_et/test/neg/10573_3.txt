I thought it would be funny. I did. I don't know what happened. But I think a lot of the problem is down. I don't know who this kid is, he can be a very nice person, but he wasn't right for this movie. And the supportive majority was great, which makes it more obvious. For example, she and her love-loving scene would be, and your mind would just start to wander, but Keith David would start talking, or Leslie Nielsen or Marion Ross, and that's like someone turning to the light and maybe you can pay attention again and you think it might not be so bad. But when they return to the main characters, the lights go out again. <br /> <br /> The junk material available in the Superhero genre is abundant, so the fact that most of the fun was basically fun makes you wonder who wrote this thing. I mean, it had a few funny bits because I remember a few times to laugh, but now I don't remember why and it was only a few days ago. <br /> <br /> Really I'm gonna take it or leave this rating, but I think most people should just leave.
