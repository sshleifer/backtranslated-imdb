It is unfortunate that between this film, sheep in the valley of Ela and the brave home seem to be all common stereotypes about the war veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan. Booming, fighting, short fuses, broken marriages, boys attacking and digging foxes in their front yard when they're drunk, etc etc. <br /> <br /> Is this happening - yes, but not as often as any of these films watched. I think it is regrettable that these directors / producers / writers decide to polish their ax against a political body, depicting soldiers so atypically. In this particular film, Kimberly Peirce did not even throw us at the bone, as shown by new children born at the time of the posting of a family member, or a boy who grew up in a ghetto who, thanks to GI Bill, can afford a college or a couple who can afford or start a house new business, earn your citizenship, etc. etc. Instead, we are treated with stereotypes because the people who made the film want to show you only bad things. /> <br /> A couple of problems with the film itself: 1) Someone who is screwed, putting Phillippe on the V-Bronze, after he drove his team's tight track after the army accused him of taxi. Pretty stupid, but yes, it happens. 2) The humewater did not have tower rings, so we should believe that this is the beginning of the war, but every soldier and their brother have ACOG and all possible attachments to their M4? Sorry, don't think so 3) Timothy Olyphant as Lieutenant Colonel? It's hard to believe, but I just checked that he turned to May 40, so the timing isn't too big. 4) He strikes two soldiers to escape from prison, saying he is not returning to Iraq (when he has learned he was stopped). So he's a refugee. When he finally ends up and they take him back, he keeps his rank and puts him in the same unit? Sorry not to think so. <br /> <br /> I can only describe it as a giant stereotype of only one army and infantry. Do some of the events in this movie happen to some soldiers, yes. However, in this movie you can get virtually every stereotype in about 100 minutes, and really not most of the soldiers who come back. I wish the director had done some better research instead of starting my agenda and then making a movie. is probably Lions for Lambs, which is more of a comment on the generation of Y + sadness when it comes to wars in Iraq or Afghanistan or the Bush administration. If you really want to see this movie waiting for a cable or Netflix, don't pay this rent directly.
