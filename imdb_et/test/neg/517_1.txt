There is a part of one sequence where some water penetrates into a sunken plane, everything else that is going on in this movie is the 77th film. In some shots you can even make Jack Lemmon and Christopher Lee. Hanging all over? Well almost by definition. There may be more material in this film than in space 9 from space. <br /> <br /> All new materials, actors on the plane, are talking, are boring and terrible at every level. Dennis Weaver is in the quarry of a low-profile film, although it is true for all other filmmaker Fred Olen Ray, who uses one of these many fake names needed to continue working. <br /> <br /> The low level of professionalism that makes this movie a waste of time would actually be better for someone with no technical knowledge at all, because Ray has enough knowledge of how to put together a scene the worst old school. in a way that this film, like most of his films, is completely without life. The worst craft. The worst movie. This type of movie is a waste of money, a thing where the team at all levels are ghosts who are hoping to get any little wage control and no one sees or knows they appeared / participated in this rip off. There are so many people who want to make movies, it is nasty if Ray sees the money that is given to do more, but to spend time. <br /> <br /> His commentary track is interesting because he has to start by explaining that he is really Fred Ray because he is not credited to the film himself. It was trying to see me not letting it trick you.
