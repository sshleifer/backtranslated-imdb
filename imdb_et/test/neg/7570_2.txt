It must be one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen. It's basically a remake of "The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms" (1953), but done with your standard snake-doll monster instead of creating a clever Ray Harryhausen. Combine this classic monster film plot with production process features and the level of The Creeping Terror, and you have an idea of ​​what this movie is about. <br /> <br /> The movie is dubbed, although the original actors (I think the movie was originally called in Italian for the audience in this country, then reused to release the US), which just makes the movie strange ... sounds like Japanese monster movie just don't fit the action on the screen even if the actors' lips move properly. <br /> <br /> Poor Ray Milland ... he's definitely lost over the weekend or murdering or M numerous great movies he had turned on. Add it to your other sci-fi travesties (panic zero, X-man with X-ray eyes) and you'll see once a good actor who fell into the Boris Karloff syndrome ... stuck doing really bad horror films abroad for work.
