Look, don't get me wrong I love independent movies, but HERE! I could hardly sit down without trying to kill myself. the director had no talent and he turned to something that might have been good for F *** ing Nightmare. I am a punk enthusiast and even music is sucked. I was acting nonsense. <br /> <br /> I am usually the bleeding heart of these low budget films, but it didn't even try. Please do not waste your valuable time and money. I'm sorry I'm so tough, but come on! it pulled on and on and on. Remember when the kids got into this party with strange cakes and watermelon Martini? how do they just mix? It disappointed me how they could go anywhere they wanted, and get into trouble and have sex and a "meaningful conversation" with whom they wanted. I know im blathering, but my mind is just buzzing everything I hated about this movie.
