Alien Express is one of the worst films I've experienced. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable. Aliens look like rubber sock dolls. In the 1970s, the effect would have been mediocre, but today's standards are simply bad. Could they not take a real train instead of an obvious model? <br /> <br /> Action is not great, but actually the dialogue is the worst. It's going to go wrong. "Don't you die with me. Not now." If you have managed to stop the disbelief long enough to be absorbed into the movie, foreigners, the model train or the clich√© dialogue will quickly recover painfully. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't give this movie "1" is that it doesn't deserve to be so badly appreciated that some poor suckers might look at it for the joy of a real bad movie.
