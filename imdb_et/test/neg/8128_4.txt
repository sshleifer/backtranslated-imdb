Sebastian Cabot is a rich jerk who wants to buy all the land because there is oil - although none of the local people is aware of oil. With the help of the blind weapon guard, all black people are killed and terrorized. When the son of the murdered person arrives, he refuses and stays in front of the forces of darkness. <br /> <br /> Wow. When I looked at TERROR'S SINGLE HOUR, I felt that I saw this movie several times before and I would probably see something like that. The reason for this is that, in addition to some novelty (such as Sterling Hayden, who uses a bad harpoon), it has a plot that is too familiar. Once again, we have a rich man who tries to get all the farmers out to get across the country. And for this, he has brought hired weapons to force people to sell or kill them. I was there, done it in too many films. <br /> <br /> I love Sterling Hayden in movies, but I just couldn't recommend it as anything other than the passing of poor time.
