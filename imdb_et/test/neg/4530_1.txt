The audience was quietly sitting almost through the film, with a few, rare, and random laughs. Maxwell's Smart character was so inconsistent, I felt whipped. If it's convenient for the plot, Smart behaves like a captain. At other times he acts like an imbec. They raise a lot of classic lines from the TV series, but they don't work in this version. The classic "lost a lot" is funny when it comes to a braggadocio event, if someone is a clear failure - but it loses all humor when someone who is qualified talks. To a lesser extent, many other characters move in qualified and cartoon incompetent. Siegfried, the main villain, seems to be smart, but he makes decisions that don't care at all. However, no movie characters are as incompetent as its crap writers. I'm totally depressed that so many IMDb users think it was good.
