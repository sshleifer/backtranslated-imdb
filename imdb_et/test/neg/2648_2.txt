I went to see Random Hearts with 3 friends and at first I thought it was just me who didn't enjoy the movie. After all, I didn't like as good as it can and this movie won all kinds of prizes. Well, it wasn't just me ... none of my friends liked it. It was incredible slow, much like the teeth pulling. The only action in the movie is preview. We didn't walk out of the theater because we all thought something would happen. We were not as smart as 7 or 8 people who walked out. I've never gone out of the movie in my life, but I should definitely. It's hard to write for me, given that I'm pretty easy with the film. It seems to me a lot to think that the film is fantastic, but I don't just like it. This movie wasn't even in a similar category. The film was not only about 2 hours too long, but it was like two separate trite songs, but they were not sewn smoothly together. Plus, a "soundtrack" if you could even call it so annoying. Like Seinfeld has the same reef that is played over and over again (the difference is that I like Seinfeld) .. this movie was the jazz raffle he played, which at times seemed very inappropriate, especially when people were involved in a fatal aircraft failure. It's hard to explain what I mean, but trust me that it was terrible. I can't say enough that people don't waste their money. When I left the theater, I wanted to honestly write to the film company and claim my $ 7 back because I could have bowling or something for that money.
