The exhibition is at least partly Faked (so it's not a reality, but pretending it's a reality) that makes me believe that at least every face that is cloudy is a Fake episode. <br /> <br /> The proof of an episode in which he pretends to have put a boat already has the camera staff before he gets there to see it as an approach to his boat. <br /> <br /> Participants who play ambulance officers did not remove their shirts or reveal any wounded, so they work with what wouldn't happen. <br /> <br /> They also parked the ambulance in the car park and did not drive to the emergency entrance (which makes no sense if it is fake and they are not allowed to go there)
