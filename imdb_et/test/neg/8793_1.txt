I just realized why "Sakuran" colors and kits were so cool and tough and just painful. The story is a high-class prostitute known in Japanese as the oiran. Their kimonos were always brighter and giggers than the other kimonos, so the stomach stood out. But director Mika Ninagawa had to make sure the director looked even more than the main character or even the story. <br /> <br /> What Anna Tsuchiya did in the film just gave me creeps. You couldn't call it. It was nothing but a base of its mirrored, high school girls. Hey Anna, good luck at this age. Yeah, okay, I'm like crude and vulgar, prone to violence, a biker chick. Didn't we see you depicting this character in a more appropriate movie? <br /> <br /> The story was painfully boring and predictable. What is the story of "Sakuran"? The scary little bitch is still with her, which is just this: unpleasant bitch. He finds the men inexplicably attracting him and that he has an inexplicable ability to manipulate men and become a successful, high-level prostitute, even though he speaks and acts like a female biker member. We talk about this so-called networking ability, but we never see it in action, probably because of the inaccuracy of the main, pretend-fake-biker chick. <br /> <br /> The main character of the movie makes a wealthy and powerful man hate him because he is waiting for him when he serves a much lower customer. Isn't it very symptom-like? How could such a woman ever become a symptom? Oh, because the previous symptom got killed and the house needed a whore, which might require a high price. Who would pay a cheap bitch for a high price? Rumors go. How could it not have any effect on what he powerful boy did? Because scriptwriters are bucks. They just made a lot of mess. <br /> <br /> Then he gets a more prosperous and powerful man (why?) And he throws him over to pee a guy who is generally cold and far from him, but respects who he really is (which is not reasonable) How can anyone respect someone who is so worthless?). <br /> <br /> Speaking of nonsense, it is like a director in a bundle and took on a huge, psychedelic landfill site for aesthetics, culture and society in the Edo period. What are things like sabi, mono unknown, wabi, fineness, elegance, rigid hierarchical society? The whole director is a director who comes out as meaningless, nouveau-riche parvenu. The amazing thing is that so many other Japanese, watching this movie, shook the director and took a steamed spoonful of this stinking color of smelly crap and shouted how delicious it was. <br /> <br /> Violin and Bandoneon Background for the Edo Period, when Japan was completely isolated from the international world (except 3.7 hectares of Dejima)? Why not just Anna, a bad-ass-biker, I would answer her cell phone, and the rich and powerful driving of the daimyo character in the elevator fits her red Ferrari? The music we had to listen to was jarring and anachronistic (the same as the artwork). Near the end of the ride, I liked that the shrine of the shrine had only two or three small flowers. But earlier the second said that he would leave the quarter when it flourished, we all knew exactly what would happen. How boring that the telegraph will end so clearly. But what is an old tree lake? This rich and powerful man has already made joy centers with blooming cherries such as the Yoshino Mountains in the spring. It doesn't impress her at all? No, of course not. I already know about whores. The boys who treat them become balls. Maybe these mistakes whores that people are ideal for them when they themselves know the truth about who they are: just cheap and worthless. <br /> <br /> Considering the director's obsession with goldfish, the second to last scene should have been accidentally knocked on the goldfish bowl porch. Two fish roll in a stream that carries them out to escape outside the walls of the amusement halls, so that the goldfish is stuck in its bowl and cannot survive (just like the denizen relationship with the amusement rooms). Otherwise, the story of goldfish fate has no meaning. <br /> <br /> In the last scene, cherry trees were bloomed, but the shortness of flowering is one of the special cherry blossoms. I couldn't think that all soft pink color and warmth would soon be enough to wipe the darkness. Heaven quickly went from the hints to the ever-deepening darkness and night. It would be cold, very cold. And dark. It wasn't really a happy ending, was it? Romantic Love (Edo Period?) Can survive awful poverty and be placed around as long as these cherry trees flourished. Maybe a couple of days if you didn't fall before. But the unseen romantic love here? This is incomprehensible to the existence of this period. Anna Tsuchiya went to the Oiran shoes? He couldn't do it. Literally. Check your "promenade" scene, where she seems to be the right footwear, but she has to hold on to some man's shoulder to keep her leg off. <br /> <br /> I made two stars of this film in the direction of art, but then I realized what it was like: the dominance of the director's ill. These colors and kits are just like the director shouts: "I am the most important here! I! It's all about me !!!!"
