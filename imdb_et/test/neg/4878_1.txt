After seeing the movie, I didn't want my money back. I wanted my time back. I wanted it one and a half hours ago in my life - it was the most amazing thing to find out that I was the dear minutes of this partner. I've been hurt for life and ever since, this "movie" has come to my life, I have had sleep disorders. I'm trying to suppress memories, I'm really. . . but they want me to burn things. <br /> <br />
