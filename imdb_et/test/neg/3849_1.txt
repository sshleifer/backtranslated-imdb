I was happy enough to see this movie in my friends house. What is a waste of time. What is the full and complete piece of the movie! There is absolutely nothing funny about it, a shower from the scene to an insulting and humiliating depiction of the Germans. There's no plot, wrapped up in me, and finally I was trying to beat John Leguizam. I thought John Woo's films were bad ..... this movie is officially the worst film I've ever seen.
