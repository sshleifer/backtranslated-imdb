I'm not worried about mentioning any plot - it's a strictly B-film that is on the road to vagueness. For me, the shock is seeing what has changed in some of the film's participants. Erika Eleniak, which is never something you would call, seems to have come to Anna Nicole Smith (during her great period). Daniel Bernhardt - I was almost tearful. She has always been my favorite because of my martial arts ability, as seen in the Bloodsport series (including B-movies, but if you like martial arts, it's extremely observable). Here he is his former self-confident shell, he's older, but he does the mercenary thing, and not even interesting ... I just can't get it. Don't these people invest? William Forsythe is another "hard" I've always liked, but his latest roles are what you call it "posting". I'm not even talking about Mr Reynolds - his concert is empty here, nothing more. The only winner is Andrew Divoff, as usual with horrible, evil, repelled frog and sandpaper that can saturate the milk - the best! This is the movie you look to laugh at. There's nothing else about it.
