It is painfully clear that all the efforts of this film were aimed at cinematography and very little attention to all others. The most obvious mistake is the whole female cast. Many of them are very experienced and capable, but they all seemed inappropriate and certainly didn't help the creation of an amateur director. The story is a very common story of Geisha and the characters behaved very inconsistently, making it very difficult for me to connect to the heroine. <br /> <br /> The theme of this movie is "modern prostitution", but it was still annoying how Tsuchijaa Anna's manager was talking as a female motorcycle gang member, while all others spoke in this device in old Japanese. This film has very beautiful colors that resemble Zhang Yimou's "hero", but viewers can just film it inexpensively, in detail. <br /> <br /> Two sequences with the songs entered by Shiina Ringo were really nice in the middle of the movie. In fact, he didn't like music before, but they're perfect for this movie. Although Ninagawa Mika is a complete failure of film director, he has great potential in producing PV (music video). <br /> <br /> I think this story seemed very clear, because the director did not focus on character development, and because Tsuchiya Anna is not convincing Oiran. If this film had been directed by a well-known Jidaigek director with another well-known actor in Japan, he would have become a masterpiece.
