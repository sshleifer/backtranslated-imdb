Oh man! This series has to be the worst possible anime I've seen for a while. <br /> <br /> It started new, exciting and fresh. And I really liked it. Kagome was a good example of a woman for the show. And Inu-Yasha was funny and hot. <br /> <br /> Then it had to go down all the time as the series moved on ... and I'll tell you the reasons why. (Warning: SPOILER ALERT !!) <br /> <br /> Okay, they are basically destroying Inu-Yasha's relationship with Kagome early, restoring his 50-year-old dead girlfriend, who is dirty, cute and a waste of time. > <br /> They introduce a pervert called Miroku, who should be a kind of religious figure for the exhibition. (What's really wrong with me because it was inappropriate and foolish.) Then they introduce the demon killer named Sango, whose only purpose in life is to try (and leave) to save his brainwashed brother. <br /> <br /> The big bad of the show, Naraku, when a really good bad guy started, disappeared after a while. (She got pretty outdated pretty quickly. And I was struggling to be the only baddie who did something.) <br /> <br /> All the characters became wood and non-sensitive. And then ending this terrible series was a disappointment for any anime fan. Nothing happened. Naraku could never be killed or beaten. Kagome and Inu-Yasha never fell in love (as he was still in love with his 50-year-old dead chick.) Plot-holes remained open. Animation deteriorated and deteriorated as the series progressed. And nothing changed on the plot. (I mean, they dragged it over 150 episodes and nothing changed in the plot ... at all.) And they were waiting for me (just like other fans of the show)? I was disappointed, disgusting and angry. I had at least great hopes for a good end to the series. Instead, I got all the mango commercial. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you want to see an anime like a nice sword, I strongly recommend Rurouni Kenshin. This exhibition is progressing and going somewhere, plus it's a very good animation. <br /> <br /> But stay away from this unpleasant excuse for anime as best you can.
