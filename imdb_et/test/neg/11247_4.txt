The first film was pretty clean and had fun moments, this film doesn't have exactly the same standard. Calvin Palmer (ice cube) is still trying to keep his hair salon, but it's not just a stylist Gina (Queen Latifah), but soon a big hair salon, Nappy Cutz, opens up across the street. Calvin with colleagues and friends with Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer), Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas), Terri (Eve) and Isaac Rosenberg (Troy Garity) will do their best to make regular customers come and end up competing against them. Also starring Michael Ealy as Ricky Nash, Leonard Earl Howze as Dinka, Harry Lennix as Quentin Leroux, Robert Wisdom as Alderman Brown, Jazmin Lewis Jennifer, Kenan Thompson Kenardina, and Bad Company Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon Lorettana. I didn't like this movie as much as the first, because there were unnecessary setbacks for Eddie, and it's not that funny, I miss it easily. Okay!
