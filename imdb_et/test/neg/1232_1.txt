Please don't waste six hours watching your life as I did. The fact that I did is not a very good debate for me. The only redeeming act in this clunk was Wes Studi. How a prequel with similar roots can't even be in the same universe as Lonesome Dove is farther away from me! It was an inseparable, bright and inconsistent story. The drawing lines were not developed, the action scenes were almost ridiculous and the big end (disappointment) was the end of this mini-series. Val Kilmer, whom I thought was a reputable actor, played one of the strangest roles I've ever seen. I've read these comments for years and this exhibition made me sign up !!!
