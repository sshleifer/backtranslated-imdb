As a native of New Orleans, I can say that almost everyone in this movie, from the cruel N'Awlin break to the very creative manipulation of Crescent City's geography, is terrible. This is one of those great Hollywood films that decide on the New Orleans stereotype: the first city full of French idiots. 2. The city is full of people who sound like they are the City of Runners, who have just returned from Blanche Dubois's summer home, where every day is Mardi Gras. 4. A city with a deep mystery, where almost everyone is practicing or being a voodoo victim (I admit that maybe we are a city of drinkers, though NOT Mardi Gras every day). "The Big Easy" is one of the worst films about New Orleans. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
