First of all, I would like to apologize for your assessment of "1". The only reason I give such a movie is that I can't get into negative integers. Everything "It's a Fraud" deviates, and although I've certainly tried to consider it enough, I've left a certain concept, namely; "It's probably the worst movie." Qualitative measurement at any level and with reliable quantification ... Seriously, I tried, I'm like any indie born cult-video distribution movie, like the next buff, but seriously that this film sucks rhino balls ... <br / > <br /> Frankly, if I had directed this "movie", I would have seen it as a legitimate cause of suicide.
