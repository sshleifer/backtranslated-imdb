How's that bad story done. It's not a question. This is a statement. <br /> <br /> Here are the problems with my movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Much of the story's development was predictable and boring. My emotions ran flat. The movie is not really much drawn to the viewer. <br /> <br /> 2) The characters were decisively uneven. One was lunatic, the other was confused and the third was pretty boring. For these people, there was absolutely zero reason. Even if I knew it wouldn't happen, I hoped they would get somebody else, more interesting. <br /> <br /> 3) The physical environment was awkward for me. Trailer ??? Desert ?? Desert is the place most people don't want to visit. How is it that these three people reach the desert ??? <br /> <br /> 4) And in the same desert. Did the writer assume I believed that the last three people on Earth could find each other within a few weeks in this desert? <br /> <br /> 5) Was it really a pr. Ryan must have two scenes that needed a swimsuit? Hey, he looks good, but it was pretty free. <br /> <br /> All right, so if I thought it was so bad, why did I give it to 3? I'm trying to be as objective as possible. Although I found Alan annoying, I have to say that David Arnott did a very reliable job of portraying neurotic nerd (this sign reminded me of some of Albert Brooks's more annoying roles). Jeri Ryan tried to do something with Sarah, but it wasn't very well written. Okay, so she had to be a confused, dysfunctional woman. But why? What did this story complement? His mood disturbances felt to me in one way and another (hard!) I started. <br /> <br /> I don't often go to movies, but it was a lot of times for me. Strong, predictable, boring. Continue at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My 2 cents.
