Although the striking and overall use of the game-like format is in full scale throughout the film, this image is not let down. Rather, it is a convincing female performance and a rather annoying script, which the film has so much supported too little. The idea of ​​having a potential will, on a simple plot, reduce Graham's inability to truly express the destructive experience of his character. Using improvised scenes for all participants would not be such a bad idea if only two leading ladies could benefit from this privilege. As Downey Jr proves as usual what he has gifted, he conceals these two actors together, which is constantly noticeable. The meaningless but intense sex scene seems to exist only to prevent the film from being too verbal, giving the actors a much-deserved break. The dissatisfied conclusion is that the two girls and the boy have very little to recommend, apart from Downey Jr.
