What are about mathematical geniuses that get the juices of critics flowing? I didn't think so much about me (FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserves an Oscar this year), while the goodwill gave him many awards that he earned so much <br /> <br /> First of all, there is a script. When I went to a film school, I was told that good intentions are a good example of how not to start a script and the tutorial was right. This film lacks any opening hook and is usually very slow. If you wrote this unwanted script, the script reader would have given up 15 pages. <br /> <br /> The structure abandons the idea that an American subclass member is some kind of intellectual god. true. Ask yourself this: If he is the smartest character of a movie, how has he passed his short life without anyone noticing his abilities? Didn't any childhood teacher notice your gift? It is very unlikely, as it is, that he reads so much in his mind-expanding litrate. And if Will is so smart, how is he so forgotten that what happens to young boys in good-looking boys in American prisons? <br /> <br /> But it's a pain that shoots a lot of movie. Do you want to get a couple of players who play harsh Irish gang members? We get Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, like playing Russell Crowe in a pacifist or Charles Bronson play liberally. I couldn't convince Damon and Affleck of the unpleasant mouth because they tried to break people in their careers and couldn't think that even though they wrote the script, the parts should have been shared with different participants. written scripts for films that he has not released, and the same criteria should have been applied here <br /> <br /> There are some good points in the movie. Robin Williams is great as a man who is trying to show Is his potential and also very good is Stellan Skarsgard, who is just one of the biggest actors who walked outside of Europe and despite my previous criticism of the script, is a fairly moving dialogue in the park when Williams characterizes Will what he has seen in life. <br /> <br /> But I have to repeat that there are fewer plus points than negative for this movie and I have to agree with people who say that good will is boring and convincing
