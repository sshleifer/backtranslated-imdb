My friends and I are often on the movies in real time. But this movie is really ... They literally show a 4-minute strait, but not just a man digging dirt with his hand. It has no plot and incredible amount of free shouting. I do not believe honestly that it won this alleged arbitration award. If you are like me and saw the first movie and loved it because it is a terrible act, a randomly lined one liner and all the low budget is nervous, it doesn't matter; it is so bad that bad memories can even rub and destroy the good memories of the original. You would be more entertaining when you looked at the blank screen.
