If you have never read classical science fiction, it is based on the mini series, it can actually be good. Unfortunately, if you are a fan of a book, you probably can't watch more than the first hour or two. The whole political intrigue has been taken out of the film, the most important scenes in the book have been taken out, the motifs of the characters have changed completely, and the words from the wrong characters to the mouth. When Paul Atredies was a teenage boy with incredible political skill and a great understanding of how the world worked, he is hot and disappointed in this film. Avoid this movie at all costs.
