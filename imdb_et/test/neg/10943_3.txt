This movie is missing in everything. Except for Bobby deol, who is mediocre in his standards, no one in this movie has started acting on one scene. Kangana is completely fake in its behavior. <br /> <br /> Great Anupam Kher is the appearance of the guests and is better in this 2 minute than bobby in the whole movie. Music doesn't fit well in the movie <br /> <br /> well. The contrast between the music of Bobby and Upen is not well emphasized. The big concept went completely wrong. The film does not have the right end. Please don't waste your time doing this movie
