Ever notice how many really bad sounds attract really bad movies? Not much about Riddle, how it happens, but it's not much of a movie. On Sunday, we have two options to view this email. <br /> <br /> 1. It's free, so you can't complain about it. 2. It's free, so it can't be much good. <br /> <br /> My voice is number 2. The free paper for Sunday papers is a recent trend and some great old movies have been released. They are the ones who have gone through the ages and made the most of the money they will ever make, so this is something else that is a bonus. This is the last stop for old movies, not the first for new ones, so you might think how bad it is to skip TV and DVD rentals. Plus points are that Vinnie Jones is trying hard and Derek Jacobi is good than Dickens. Negative points are a longer list. Trying is not the same as the poor Vinnie's success and Jacob's second tramp is a talkative ham that has disappeared. The story is very weak. Dickens' story has nothing to do with the murders of the film and feels that another movie is captured by the script, so people would think it is British Dan Brown without religions. Supporting cast is either for money (Vanessa Redgrave must be really hard) or because they are friends or girlfriends of filmmakers. It's also very, very long, what it is. <br /> <br /> Vinnie, who takes her priceless Dickens story with her pocket pocket, is good for a couple of laughs, but that's it. Not funny and very free.
