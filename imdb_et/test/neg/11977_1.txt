It was a disgraceful game FarCry I had a lot of expectations but everything ended in a nightmare. In addition to the bad visual effect, the stunts on the plot even used the humor in the film was an absolute flop. The film is not worth it at all. The more fun part was when the girl arrived and kisses Jack to give him the cuffs. Guess he's got handcuffs all the time. I hope some good director will turn this fantastic game into one day. And I invest some good money to get the right visual effects and scenarios as well as ACTING right. But don't waste time trying to watch this movie because it will definitely make you crazy if you are a FarCry lover.
