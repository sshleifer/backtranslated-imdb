This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen, it didn't miss any clich√© that could be imagined about Hollywood-nn-Thriller. The character is a loving father and a private investigator who has a special task: to find out if the suspect "snuff" is real. <br /> <br /> He's definitely involved in deeper, deeper, smoother pornhops (managed by Mexicans), and sex theaters are his research field as he searches women for murderers in a "snuff" movie. "Intelligent" (she read a book) sexshop worker helps her murderous slave film producer and her personal pervers who are responsible for the film ... ... and what are you waiting for? They are depicted as simple evil, no need for explanation, background, history: they are bad and he is a purifier. Poom. Killer killer. End of the movie. Is that so bad? Yeah, I'm afraid so. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the "machine" (the mega-pervert who killed) is even ridiculous: in the last scene, our hero's power to "machine" leave his skin mask (of course, he's wearing one) and admits The "machine" looks like a normal 08/15 man on the street. Then the "machine" says, "blablabla I'm not a monster, my parents didn't abuse me, I had a nice childhood, I just love doing what I do!" <br /> <br /> I just love to kill people. Yes, sure, "everyone loves killing people" (Bender). It's not just a complete lack of character that made this movie so boring, but it's ugly "I have to kill these people" that makes you sick. In one scene, our hero has tied one killer and tries to shoot him ... but he can't. So what does he do? He calls the mother of the murdered woman, says her child is being killed and asks if she loved her child so much that she wants the killers dead. Mother shouts, she loves her baby, she goes back to the killed killer and kills her. <br /> <br /> Reaching the point: This film breathes the unpleasant air of the loser supporters (certainly the police will not play any role in this), moralizes against ridiculous pornography, does not take this sign seriously and wastes its time with the fool. Probably the only good thing about this film is that it does not seek pseudo-psychoanalysis ... even this would be too much plot. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with it. /> <br />
