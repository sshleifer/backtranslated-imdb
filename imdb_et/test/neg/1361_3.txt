This film shows, through its protagonist, that the world is essentially a sadness and pain, and those who ignore it are blinds. One can argue whether this is true or not. But even if you agree with this, the film will either contest A), saying that in tragic situations it may be good or B) forgets it and uses the piano assembly to leave the audience feeling up. <br /> It appears in the film that he introduces his main character, giving him a sympathetic character, despite the fact that this sympathy proves disdain for supporters who were the most important in the film. <br /> <br /> This movie has a script that is not consistent with its theme and direction, which does not complete the synchronization with the rest of the movie. Especially great performances are given by all cast members, especially Spacey, Olin, Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson. It is a shame that the better writer / director did not support them.
