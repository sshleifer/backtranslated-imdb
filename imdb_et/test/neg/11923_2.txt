I felt ÆON in the early 90s through television and I loved it ... <br /> <br /> What did you like about it? Tough drawing style? What about sound artistic activities? Is absurd and dead communication between characters? The layout of the world around the future? No matter what you loved it ... <br /> <br /> At the end of 2005, Aeon Flux has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> Karyn Kusama, the so-called "director" of the film, was hopelessly redundant when the original content was transferred to a new movie. If you don't know the original series, you won't understand anything in the first 60 minutes of the movie. The story is incomprehensible and steam stars do not pose during the film. <br /> <br /> In Kusama, try to improve the story by applying some rather weak explanatory conversations between the main characters, not just a flat attempt to cover up your mistakes as a storyteller, it is just worthy of the original ÆON concept. <br /> <br /> Charlize Theron can be an attractive woman, but she can't induce ÆON's character. Although he was involved in scenarios that make operational states, his lack of talent for physical movement simply destroys the sequences of action in the film. The result is a huge hectic image cut to cover the flatness of your body. <br /> <br /> Forget about the rest, it's not worth talking ... <br /> <br /> I'll give Ms.Theron 1 point, showing her breasts and a 1-point movie for nice architecture photography. That's it.
