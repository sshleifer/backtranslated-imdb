So I got this one afternoon, "What lies above" and I actually looked at it, because the start was somewhat promising. The heroine Diana Pennington is a climbing expert, but it doesn't help her when her fiancée Brian gets climbed. When he leaves for help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never again. <br /> <br /> Two years later, Diana is still a climber ... but she's not going to go to the snowmen to deliver. This means that until Curt Seaver appears and tells him he can find his missing fiancé body with a new satellite program. He agrees and they take the hill with two Curt's assistants: His "bodyguard" with Hugo and the computer who is angry with Tyler. You know from the beginning that there are some rear motifs, but unfortunately, the twists are not good and lead to a ridiculous bad chase that makes the film the last 20 or 30 minutes. > The main disappointments are the red herring, most of which have supernatural letters that never reach. An object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which is not so supernatural), the story of how the snowman has gone, and the most memorable of all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the film. But what most deceived me was where they dropped the ball. Most of the film revolves around searching for Brian, so I can't understand for my life why it wasn't what happened to him and where he was, during the film. That was the main plot. That's how the movie started! How to DO NOT wrap it? <br /> <br /> I don't tell too many people that it will bother me ...
