Is Cannes an undeniably moderate esoteric, or is it that the Americans are so harsh and cynical that we can hardly read between the lines? So be it, "Falscher Bekenner" will never be able to carefully analyze that it will never be able to meet the hypothetical disputes that Cannes allegedly brought in 2005, an astonishingly drastic and purposeful film that lives on its ugly American. -title ("Low Profile"). <br /> <br /> Based on the familiar topics of Bourgeoise's anger and subsequent sexual liberation, it is really a film that does not contain the interests of that level. It starts with a looter, because the haunted shooter of the empty terrain focuses on the teenage swell, who ultimately walks in a car that allegedly has been brutally hit and run by a dead delicate mess of the driver. He was stunned, he didn't do anything, but took up the remnants of the remaining engine. <br /> <br /> Just out of school, it turns out that drift is Armin Steebe, a German suburban product that has minimal ambition. His caring, but somewhat nervous, at the pressure of his parents to find a good job constantly suffers from an interview after an interview with him, each with the same fruitless result. It is possible that the collision of the abovementioned highways will soon lead to his first rebellion: responsibility for the crime he did not do. <br /> <br /> Assuming you complete more applications and get strangled by job interviews at sunrise, he will take part in sexual fantasies and small vandalism on the road after sunset. When the days are shorter and the nights become much hotter, he lives in the neighborhood of his suburban area, as he does nothing. <br /> <br /> If you feel confused about what's going on, don't worry about being the only one: it's as far and coherent as the story gets. The plot seems easy enough, and maybe due to its seemingly direct purpose, "Falscher Bekenner" therefore becomes a senseless twist, becoming calm with endless false conclusions, dreamy situations and graphic sexual scenes to explain a story that has no clear logic for an already vague argument (supposedly a modern suburban the soul-anesthetic effect of the body, or something about admiring young people with crime. It spends a lot of time creating both tangible and surreal allegorical symbols, but they don't seem to be a really interesting symbol. The most deadly mistake, however, is how the filmmakers paint all the characters in the vanilla karate tone. There is virtually no distinctive feature to understand their purpose, and how secondary characters (especially the confusing relationships between Armin and his rather normal family) will ever catalyze the "situation" of already underdeveloped guides without focus. How should we identify with this young adult's rebellion, with the little worldview he lives, or the prominent people around him? <br /> <br /> Many people leave and out of the movie (including Armin's peculiar girlfriend Katja and a strange prosperous visitor who, for some reason, finds joy in eating brownies with the protagonist) and there seems to be no reason. Ultimately, such a long-lasting upholstery is like a thin story where pointless subpages prove that the film pulls empty around where to go. especially in the case of Armin's night exploitation), it ends literally, almost in moral head-scratching, which seems to stop the "story" of issues that makes little, but makes this viewer meaningless in an exhaustive situation. <br /> <br /> Without any color, nothing is important.
