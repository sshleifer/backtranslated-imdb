Like a terrible cancer that fell out of the sky, I went to a movie channel the other night. Being a fan of bad movies and active participation in buying and watching a bad movie, I was interested in the idea of ​​a really horrifying film that comes from modern times. After that I wore off, I found my hands inexplicably against me, grabbing something in between and worshiping my head and neck. Something embarrassing in this tape ... an error ... where I was ... anyway, this is one of the most embarrassing bad films I've ever gone through. William Forsythe can't play more than one character and this character is always a joke. Even if it is a comic background and the things to do and say it should be funny (Deuce Bigalo area), it is ridiculous in the wrong direction. Erika Eleniak is much the same, having seen terrible movies in her fair sharing and doing all these terrible jobs, she doesn't help it alone. The classic b-film villain Andrew Divoff is doing an honorable job, but hardly even has anything to chew. Even a dependable standby mode for making b-movie Daniel Bernhardt does not offer anything to do with entertainment. As to the peculiarity of the film, the plot is flat, the script, like the act and the movement of the plot, is both dull and ... well, stupid, due to the lack of a better adjective (the lord knows they didn't put any effort into why should I? ). <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen enough movies has seen some bad things, and anyone who has seen enough bad can learn to rate them, but here's nothing to enjoy if you're not one of the worst movies and you just feel so prone to test your thoughts. Before you do this, take it away from me, it is not even terrible to enjoy it (to say differently ... some of the more ridiculous Italian zombie films). A fan of B-film action would be much better at checking out Bernhardt's other films, or much more that has ever been filmed on this topic. America is simply not the place to act, especially not now. If you have the craving, then look at something over the seas, movies like a heroic duo or a little less normal Hakaider (along with something else in the fantastic Keita Amemiya cannon) gives you much more fun and better action than yours to find elsewhere, especially here.
