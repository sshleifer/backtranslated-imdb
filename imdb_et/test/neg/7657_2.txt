This film has more goofe than any other movie I've seen in my life. Special effects are horrible. For example, to the end, when Concorde falls after the tear is released, the thing turns like a toy. The special effects of the airport (1970) are better than that. The Concorde, which opens at a height and speed, also essentially turns outward. (That's when it opens at all) But the film has good points. Mostly when it ends. It's also cheese. For example, Thing landed loosely on the bank of a bank when he did, splits it into a million pieces. Generally 2 out of 10. Instant flop. Great smile.
