The writers and creators of this movie should actually be sued ... for the contamination of the world with this mess! "Man in the mirror" is really terrible! Make it, so, beyond! <br /> <br /> ... and people, I'm not just saying this because I'm a Michael Jackson fan! Or because it's really one of the slowest images of my life I've ever encountered! I say this because it's a waste of time, money and celluloid! I feel ashamed when I saw it all! It's 1 hour and 26 minutes of my life, I'll never get back! I'll tell you; Watching grass grow is literally more fun than this movie! Think of warning yourself!
