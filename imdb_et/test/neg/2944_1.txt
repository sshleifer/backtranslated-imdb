Detecting this film as a vampire film would be technically correct. Just because it sucks your life out. <br /> <br /> Vampire Effect is an insult to filmmakers everywhere. The plot is almost non-existent. Make-up is just terrible. And the actor isn't just there. <br /> <br /> I have to think about whether Jackie Chan owes much to someone to make sure he appears in this movie. <br /> <br /> My wife picked up a movie rental because she had a picture of Jackie Chan (as if she was in the lead) and thought a good JC flick would be nice to watch. This movie was interesting to look the same as you can't help to break the cars when you drive. You realize very quickly that the film is not improving, but you look at the wonder how bad it is.
