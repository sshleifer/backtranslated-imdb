It was my first "Bollywood" movie and I found it just like many other recent viewers through "Ghost World". Having done a bit of reading about the Bollywood film industry this week, I understand somewhat why the horror film seems to be related to musical numbers and romance and comedy. But "Something for All" is not always a single product. <br /> <br /> Ultra-groovy musical dance number "Jaan Pehechaan Ho" has experienced the world as it probably wouldn't have been in 1965. It is now all over the internet, many people scrambling for good English translation. Laxmi Chhaya is doing an amazing job of dancing after it's all fresh, new and fun even if every ordinary person is exhausted! She rules! <br /> <br /> Miss Kitty at the beach is a light fun and amazing completely opposite horror site. However, I find that I sing it in Hindi a week later. I found a rough translation: <br /> <br /> if you want to live in this life, listen to what I say, leave your sorrows and join the party, take my tips <br /> <br /> to those who want to live with laughter and singing, let your hair down and relax from the people of the world you know? come to me and i will explain whoever is who sees me, will stop worrying about this world, the fish will swim freely here and there <br /> <br /> My second favorite number in the movie is Butler's dream, where Mehmod worships Miss Kitty dance . Electric tiki-like idols are simply stunningly sticky like the whole set of numbers. Online, I saw it described as what would happen if "Liberace kicked up"! Way fun. <br /> <br /> Gumnaam is not a good movie in its entirety. That's why I gave him a rating of 3. It's a real movie joke with some fun, kitschy music pictures that have nothing to do with the murder.
