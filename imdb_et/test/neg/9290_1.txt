To paraphrase previous reviewer's comments, if you are a Stooges fan, keep it at all costs! My main question is that I was an experienced comedian soldier, Moe and Larry, why did they insist that they continue to act when it was so obvious that their home studio, Columbia, was not so obviously interested in giving them serious writers and veteran comedy leaders? This movie plays like someone who gives a light imitation of the trio and you see how hard Moe and Larry work to make every bit terrible. Joe De Rita, despite his background in vaudeville, is not just a task to replace Curly, Shemp or even Joe Besser. If Moe and Larry had left it, they would have had to close the shop and enjoy their retirement age. We leave us with fans with better memories of the much better movies they did before. Always leave they laugh at the comedy motto and always give up when you are on top. This time Seinfeld leaves sitcom when he is up there instead of sticking to this inevitable reduction.
