Have you ever seen the movie "Marathon Man"? What part of a dentist? I would like this to happen to me as I sit back through "random hearts". It wasn't just uninteresting or uneventful-- It was terribly, painfully and agonizing BORING. At one point I lost consciousness for a moment. I can sleep for an average layman, but other film patrons knowingly knew I was actually out of Bordom. I thought I'd die. When the movie finally ended (I think it was twelve hours, but I'm not sure), I gave the outstanding "Thank you Jesus, it's over!" To which all the other movie visitors rejoiced. If I had to listen to Harrison Ford's drone for another second, I would have been forced to look for something to point out to me. It's 136 minutes of my life, which I never get back.
