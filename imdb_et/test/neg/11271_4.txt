Director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps best known in his home country for his Japanese gangster films, where this film shares several qualities. Violence and political intrigue are topics in both Shogun samurai and fighting without honor and humanity, and both have a leader who believes his loyalty is betrayed. Both films also have a large number of characters that seem to have little goals but die, and as little is being done to develop them, their deaths have little effect when they come. This film also has other errors. Makeup, costumes and sound design are distractingly poor, and the battle scenes were also non-standard, lower than those of the previous samurai films (remember seven samurai). <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba plays Sonny Chiba's character in Shogun's samurai, a meaningless captain who moves through the film, desperately threatening. What a man; he can even wear an eye patch. If you wanted to see the legendary Toshiro Mifune, you might be disappointed; his appearance is a bit more than a kame, and just as his character seems to make something interesting, he disappears good. In general, the film's strengths are its story that is infinitely more comprehensible than the gangster films and challenges that have emerged from traditional good and evil concepts. The two brothers have recently left their father's throne in front of a challenge who might have gone out of their help. Early it seems that we are faced with a couple of characters who are obviously not good and evil; After all, older brothers harass and have a birthmark, a sure sign of the offender. However, it finally turns out that there are no heroes and villains in the struggle for victory and power, but winners and losers.
