Some movies are so badly made that they can be seen as a pure factor. The disciples made me feel so much that it was uncomfortable. I looked at everyone not believing what I was looking at, no one knew how bad it was during filming? Mixing the hardest of the most dramatic performances of wooden actors, the Abysmal Script was every comment from all "participants" who seemed to have the same character and the fastest editing that attempted (and failed bigtime) to make the film compulsive. All of them joined a movie that robs you of a few hours of your life and does nothing in return. Avoid at all costs.
