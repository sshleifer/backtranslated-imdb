It must be the worst case of a quiet era. Not just one or two participants, but practically all cast. Lee Majors and Bo Svenson were good, but the rest looked like the first time. <br /> <br /> So the budget was not huge. Much of the costumes and kits were plausible, but there were many things in the viewer that told us that they couldn't double-check or get all the props to fit the period. <br /> <br /> I can't think of one aspect of the movie that I liked or shook my head. Your time is spent by burning better, which is collected in your belly.
