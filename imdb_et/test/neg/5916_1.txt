It takes place in the 1920s in Harlem. The black-owned nightclub has to deal with gangsters and corrupt policemen. <br /> <br /> A terrible vanity project for Eddie Murphy. He tries to mix comedy and drama and both fail. Comedy is just not funny and drama is boring and badly acted. You think the three comedy legends - Eddie Murphy, Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor - would be great, but it is not. There's a consistent rubbing and the OPEN scene has a young boy who takes a man to death (it is shown as OK). We also have a beautiful Della Reese, who has got bad. One of the "comedy" highlights between him and Murphy is long, uncomfortable and terrible. Bored, insulting and silly confusion. Not the worst Murphy movie, but pretty close. 1 all the way.
