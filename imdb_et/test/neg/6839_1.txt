Ridiculously terrible. It can be thought that all the big names involved in this film would make it at least plausible, but they do not - it is smelly. <br /> <br /> Signs either sprint around without good reason to know where they are going, or they are around where they should look at their constipation during their lifetime. <br /> <br /> Check your higher brain function at the door if you plan to watch this movie. Or collect your brightest friends and give it a "Mystery Science Theater 3000" treatment. That's what I did on the other side of this turkey. <br /> <br /> And don't confuse it with the great "Jackal Day" movie, which is a much better thriller at the age of 30.
