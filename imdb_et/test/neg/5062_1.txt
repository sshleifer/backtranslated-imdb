This is a really terrible show. In fact, this is an example of how low TV has fallen because "reality" has become a style. Tanya is beautiful, but she is also extremely rude and has a terrible taste. Does the house show a sex dispute? Probably some men like the show because they find Tanya attractive. The other boss is not quite nice, but he is completely rude and has a terrible taste. It is unfortunate that so many houses have to be shown when someone lives in them. Most people who allegedly look at these houses before making changes should move to completely new houses or completely empty so that they don't offend anyone. Most of them ... like a "team" must be taught. I can imagine the British exhibition being terrible because the British reality shows it is even worse in terms of customs and taste. <br /> <br /> What happened to the arts and entertainment channel? When it started (and a few years later) it was fulfilled. Now it's one big trash.
