This movie is so boring that I spent half of the IMDb when it was open on some Netflix tabs, trying to find out if anyone thought it was one of the most boring, meaningful, tricky movies they've ever seen. Warning: I actually couldn't finish it, so these are my impressions up to 54 minutes. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightly gets a lot of time on the screen. As others have mentioned, his mother wrote a script (perhaps during some drug-induced stupor, where emotional feelings and emotional expressions sounded like an interesting dialogue) and the film seems to be a letter for Knightly. Sorry! Although I agree that he is cute (his teeth are illuminated ... he seized the teeth with anxiety and fear) I found his reactions forced and poorly timed. Like William, or Dylan does something cute ... pause ... HAHAHA K, swords and playful hand teeth. Like me too late. What? And he can't match the intensity of Cillian Murphy. He somehow can really look at him and feel that he is admired and loved by him, while he feels completely open, almost as he interacts with mirrors. It must be torture, on the contrary, someone who does not support the same energy level as you. Know what else is torture? This movie. <br /> <br /> Knightly sees her cyclical stunning: "I have a string of 1940s and a hot dress. Look at me sing!" shots, but what is it? Is he an altar or an actor? When he speaks, it's odd, "Ooow, Mehster Deelan. It makes me confused because the accent is so confusing and unreliable, but sometimes it's so thick that I have no idea what he says (or maybe fall asleep) If anyone doesn't know who Vera was or cares about, or a few, whether it was so important for him to get this Welsh accent? This will distract all the rest of the actions (just joking). <br /> <br /> This movie seems like somebody dreamed of a movie, maybe after reading a little Dylan Thomas before going to bed, but instead of adjusting to the world of waking, it was "Man, this dream was so interesting" and tried to repeat it. Your script needs a job. Nothing that happens to the story or creates the necessity "and the writer is all," But that's how I dreamed it! "It's like a child's amazing fantasy, one of those wild and curving yarns they turn to pay attention to. went to William's war and then Vera had a baby and then some blond chicks drank too much and had so many planes and pins and all had ruby-red lips and ... Dylan Thomas's character (so it's boring what I call him), why did he not have any signs of this stupid biopsy? Everything he does is drink beer and smoke cigarettes and roll with Sienna Miller, who is both wild and artistic, that he is making a public wheel of the public! you are a crazy poet! (I understand that he is not a poet, but he and Thomas are such crazy insane entities as the lukewarm sailor and Lula from the wild heart.) Someone asks if they should buy this movie. Leave it on the shelf and use it only as a weapon to use drugs for children, the elderly, or the guests of a permanent house. <br /> <br /> P.S. Murphy's character ... if anyone asks if you're "sh **", you can say "yes" because your war scenes seem to have landfilled.
