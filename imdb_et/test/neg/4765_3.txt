Bob Clampett's '' Hep Cat '' is clearly an average comic that is really remarkable because it was the first color of Looney Tune (previously Looney Tunes were all black and white, while the Merrie melodies were colored). Singing, attempting a dance cat to chew a cat and trying to catch a cat with a cat, "Hep Catil" lacks the shorts for most of Clampetti. To be fair, Clampett doesn't have much work to do. Warren Foster's manuscript is embarrassingly thin, and although he's sewn with gold with other cartoons, Clampett doesn't manage it with The Hep Cat. Clampetti has often said that you can't mistake your cartoons to anyone else and that is generally true, but Hep Cat is an exception. The Clampetti gene flashes like a chase where the cat stops to ask the dog: "Hey, are you pursuing me?" If the dog confirms that he is, the cat simply says "Oh" and the pursuit continues immediately. Unfortunately, there is very little such shine here. Knowing who drove it, the Hep Cat is a bitter disappointment. We all have days off and this was clearly one of Clampett's!
