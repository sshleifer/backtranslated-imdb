This is one of the best films of recent years. The fact that it was done on virtual heroes ($ 1.8 million or as they say on the DVD: they conclude that they even had less funding) makes it even bigger. Not just photography, but design and especially locations (East Montana) that are right in America and elsewhere in the world. <br /> <br /> Too bad to have no cohesive movie. The last 48 hours of cleaning up the countryside in 1955, before it floods the dam, are put in a very promising place, trying to frighten the mumbo jumbo, which refers to the angels and the dead child. And what is presented as a "real world" is hopelessly an arc. Note for Polish brothers: Coen Brothers is funny - you are not. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that many of the acquaintances will find Northfork's rich symbolism and vagueness as a sign of some size. complex types wrestle in cafes in the evening, while braindead masses look at "Charlie's Angels" or something. (Sigh) If you demand ... <br /> <br /> In the meantime, only the filmmakers' case study suggested this impeccable technical credit and photographic beauty.
