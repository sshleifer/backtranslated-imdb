I've been trying for a long time to understand why people like Shakespeare so much and every few years I give him one more. I was hoping that this game / film (my 6th different Shakespeare game) would open a happy cage and marry me with the wealth of this literary Demigod. Bah, I picked the wrong key clearly. <br /> <br /> When the phrase "meat pound" was announced for the film 10 minutes, the main parts of the plot were transparent, grinding with a hard script and inanimate action. At each stage, two scenes are placed on the plot. The notion that a deadly aristocrat convinced his daughter to choose his future husband with a lottery is incredible. Not surprisingly, who wins the marriage jackpot because Bassanio is the main protagonist in the game .... and he is the third person to try ... and there are three quails to choose ... and his friend risks paying his life dowry. The only real surprise I've been watching for this movie is that it didn't stop right after the case was resolved. But as soon as the betrayal of the circle began, it appeared immediately. <br /> <br /> OK, I know millions of you love Shakespeare not by surprisingly known stories, but by the depth and passion for characters. But I didn't know anything about the characters. Instead of getting over and admiring during the trial, I was surprised to sit there hoping it was soon over, please. <br /> <br /> One day I can just find a Shakespeare performance that will do nothing but missing me.
