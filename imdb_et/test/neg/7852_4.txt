Paul Muni and Bette Davis overact monstrously while incomplete studio hack Archie Mayo seems confused and overlooked in this racially provocative film, resulting from his "bittersweet ending" by segregationist attitudes. Heavy and poorly designed film collapses with its weight in the first fifteen minutes with an out-of-court courtroom that it never recovers, as Mr Muni begins to chew the landscape when yard hollering and almost unevenly modifying <br /> <br /> tracks that reach a legal degree in the shop with decision and grit. In his first major incident involving a car accident, he only appears unsuccessfully and he does that he sees a fool out of his well-off opponents and an impatient judge who recommends getting rid of him. Because of the devastated rebound, angry Johnny is working on a gambling joint where he is friendly with Charlie Roark (Eugene Palette), who owns this style. The owner cuts him in, but problems arise with Mrs Roark (Davis) who also wants Johnny's piece. He kills Charlie, grabs Johnny and slowly gets mad before he is right and free with the high society Wasp, who explains to him that they come from "different tribes, wild" and it never works. When he flees to escape his rage, he drives the car and kills. Ramirez sells the casino and moves back to his poor neighborhoods, rationalizing his best to stay with himself. <br /> <br /> In addition to this terrible condemnation, Bordertown has a number of bad performances to compliment the whole story. . Unfair, if his situation may be, Muni Ramirez is both abrasive and arrogant that it is difficult to show compassion to such a bull. Davis is no better than less than a loyal woman who fits with the same adolescent emotions. His Lady Macbeth mad scenes do not suggest that he has become the best actor of his era. Margaret Lindsay as Muni American Dream is cold, far and flat. <br /> <br /> Bad as Bordertown (and it is very much) is an interesting indicator of times and acceptable attitudes. The rest is just an unpleasant place for bad behavior and forced action.
