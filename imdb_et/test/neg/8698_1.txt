This movie was a 3 hour my precious time. In the first 10 minutes I was already annoyed because I was dealing with a real version of a acquaintance (Deuteronomy 5) ... but I decided to watch my money be worth and see how bad it was. Well, it's a miracle ... more than I thought it would be. First and foremost, you can start with the script and the characters that make up the body of the movie. If you ever learned the raw, you see that the story is wrong here, there are some unpleasant mistakes: Moses does not do slavery because he was spread in the tribe, Moses did not kill anyone on Mount Sinai. but the movie depicts jams that are whipped and aaron and kills people ... never! When Moses speaks with a burning bush, he knows who also speaks, but the film makes Moses look like an idiot, he says he doesn't know who the bush is ... whatever | their distance increases, the aaron was known for its peaceful, peaceful nature, but he is angry and arrogant in this film. Moses sees Jesus in this film. How ridiculous ... the real faroah was in fact and the ugly dwarf who sat on the staircase of the pyramid that he might feel bigger than he was and Moses was more than 10 feet and the pharoah in the film is longer than he and is hot with hot eyes. Am an Israeli woman (the people of Israel) covered herself with her hair and body, and they did not dance or sing in front of men, they did not participate in the golden, so they certainly would not dance publicly with men. in the film depicted. Moses' husband Tzipora was married to Moses and therefore he covered himself and was as humble as they had not retaliated or held their hands openly. The daughter of Batia Pharoahs (who receives her and saves her from the water) is a real transformed Judaism, and therefore she would be proud of Moses when she said she would be free for her people. time with two sets of tablets ... writing about it ... at least write a holy language, Hebrew or English and put it on one tablet, not two. The bottom line is the movie is terribly written, directed and characters are all wrong ... basically everything is wrong about the movie ... The old is also inaccurate but its more realistic and they are plausible. I am Israel Chai!
