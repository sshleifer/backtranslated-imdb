For football fans everywhere - away from this movie. It was so baaaaddd! Flat acting, flat script, flat football and no redirection! I rented this movie in Asia and it was terrible that it was considered one of the best Singapore films. It was just pointless and boring. There are thousands of rich and exciting stories in Asia. Why write a bad story about top and stereotypical Singapore?
