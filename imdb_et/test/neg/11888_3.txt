Computer Skill John Light (when John Elias) goes to Stanford for a successful young Dotcom disaster. But Mr Light's terrible success can be short-lived, with partners like the ambitious Jeffrey Donovan (Robert Jennings). Mr. Donovan used Light's girlfriend Megan Dodds (like Lisa Forrester). Donovan wants Light to know that drinking and casual sex do not have to end in college. After reading the naughty internet sex session, Dodds looks like light. He can also lose the Digital Dreams Empire! Veterans who failed to borrow dramatic gravity include Mia Farrow (Anna Simmons) and fast drawing, computer-hating Hal Holbrook (like Tom Walker) for red fooling. Mrs Farrow looks sweet with her fools. <br /> <br /> *** Goal (2/21/02) Alan Lazar ~ John Light, Jeffrey Donovan, Mia Farrow
