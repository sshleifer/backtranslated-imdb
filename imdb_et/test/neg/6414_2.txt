Obviously, the massive head wound is the tendency of killing the treatment, making the murderous sociologist lovable and oafish a dog catcher. Also (this is for women) it seems that the front gate of a psychiatric hospital is a remarkable place to meet potential companions. These are just two of the about 23 absurdities that we should accept for the film to have any meaning. I love movies and I believed because I assume that many Americans (forgive me when I'm wrong) make Hollywood the best product. I've come to learn how sad I was naive and brainwashed, and 2) how much more complex the Europe / Asia cinema is compared to my American counterpart. <br /> <br /> I was watching this allegedly disturbing psychological "thriller" at night after watching the Japanese movie "Suicide Club". As the camera disappears for Walter Sparrow's happy family who enjoyed some quality time at the prison room (not to mention the patronizing voice that proclaimed the "right thing"), I suddenly had a trench. I had just finished watching a movie that I felt like I was just a glass of water when I really wanted beer. My thirst for thirst, but it was strictly utilitarian. The assumption was somewhat interesting, but the story itself, with countless "coincidences" (How do we explain how to find his book? We say something like, "... Or did the book find it?" I buy it), the plot holes open (why did the woman take the skeleton? ), predictability and a mandatory happy ending, just turned out to be another Hollywood cache. In addition, Jim Carrey's casting was just wrong. At any moment, I felt that he was able to break some of his stupid comedy or In Living Color. Jim Carrey as a tattooed hard-boiled police detective who enjoys bondage and tough sex? You didn't buy this other one. <br /> <br /> Do you want to disturb? Deeply disturbing? See a suicide club. The story surrounds the mysterious mass suicide of 54 schoolgirls. The film opens with a group of giggling colleges that shake the subway train platform. We then watch horror when they line up, their hands shut and happily throw themselves in front of a fast moving train. Needless to say, there is a lot of chaos. This is as much as I go to the story because I encourage the reader to watch the movie. Actually, I'm not sure if I could sketch the plot even when I wanted to. That which begins as a direct mystery quickly falls on the madhouse of the grotesque image. Did I understand the movie? No? Not originally? Like many foreign films, my girlfriend has introduced me. So of course I thought it was "bad." But it was in my mind. I went to think about the movie and woke up the next morning and watched it on IMDb. I read some of the viewer's comments and was surprised to see 1) other knowledge from the movie and 2) the fact that I was so thoroughly absent from the entire movie. I realized that I was so accustomed to being spoon-fed by a Hollywood message that faced a movie that really needed a viewer? It would be sort of conditioned to "check your brain door at the door". <br /> <br /> Do I say Suicide Club is the biggest movie ever made? Of course not. It has its drawbacks, many of which have been adroitly reported by IMDb reviewers. Do I say that all American films are bad and all foreign films are good? Again, of course not. My idea is that in Hollywood there is a whole world of film making outside the world that includes the viewer; forcing them to think and ask for films that do not telegraph plot twists, follow a strict linear sequence, and above all do not offend the intelligence of the observer. I look forward to seeing a new film about the world that doesn't make me think.
