This is one of Shakespeare's joy that there are no final shows - no performance can be right, but some may be wrong and that is. There are at least two things in the hamlet that cannot be abandoned: 1. His indecision and inability to take any action. For God's sake, it is the game that plays as long as it does. If you had Othello instead of Hamlet, Claudius would have died at the end of one law. Every production must try to explain why Hamlet's delays, why he can't act. 2. His sexual nasty. His complete rebellion of thought about what his mother and uncle pulls up in bed fills him with everything sexual and that means that any relationship with Ophelia is impossible. For the smallest sex, Hamlet throws up. What does Mel Gibson give us? Lusty action guy. You couldn't go beyond Hamlet's character when you tried. You can play hamlet a lot, but it's not one of them! What I do not understand is that they managed to get such good actors for other parts - Claudius, Polonius, and so on, why they couldn't find Hamlet to play. Mark Rylance in this regard would have made this great movie. This Mel Gibson, no matter who he is, will let the rest of the story down. And lets face, Hamlet really doesn't work without a prince.
