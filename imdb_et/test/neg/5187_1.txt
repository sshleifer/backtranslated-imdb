I think if you like a snowboard, you can look at the nice landscape and some nice tricks. but this is all the movie that is offered. the story does not exist, and all the jokes that may be in the movie were not funny even at the level of sympathy. I didn't want the characters, the main actor (Adam Grimes) tried his best and for a comedy that didn't have to be much, but if it was surrounded by so many other bad actors, he had no hope of making this movie. but I shouldn't be too harsh, because I know they can have a great skill, but with a script I could have written in ten minutes, what skills they had run and hidden in the fear of appearing in this movie. my suggestion doesn't look at it, i wish i never did it!
