This movie was really funny though it wasn't meant to be! Action was stupid and so voices. It was pretty much the guy who walked the corn maze for about an hour and a half. They threw this foolish natural thing that made it even sad. It wasn't even like a regular movie, this strange creepy music played almost all the way to the movie. What is it with the horror movies of the corn maze? The children of the corn were really scary, and I thought it would be something, but in fact it was just stupid. The main character of the man just walked out of these two little girls yelling. And finally he loves to kill someone or something. It's worth seeing if you're with friends because it's really funny how bad it is, but if you're looking for a horror movie, don't waste your time
