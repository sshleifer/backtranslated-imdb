Talk about the wrong ad! What was it in the comedy section of my video field? I think there was perhaps one ridiculous part in the film. I appreciate black comedy, but it was just dirt without comedy. The film was generally annoying and funny. Yes, Kevin Spacey was good when Buddy and the rest were good, but in general, this film falls because we don't see a good reason for Guy (Whaley) to lose his mind so badly. There was also disappointment at the end. What would Buddy's motivation be for Guy to get away with what he did? This is not really explained at AT ALL. Why should Buddy go to such a plan? Wouldn't it be more like a Buddy to have someone screw the Guy by turning him into the police? The end didn't make much sense to me, no matter how I looked at it. <br /> <br /> In general, despite the good deeds, the film didn't like it. Spacey looks at the landscape for most movies, but in the end he gives the Buddha a little needed humanity. The story was just not as good as cast.
