This is a hard movie that is appreciated. Although it really deserves its 3 (or even two), it is exceptional for Al Adamson's movie - and practically the best for Adamson. This is because, unlike many of Adamson's films, it's time for NURSE SHERRI to look almost competent. But if you're an Adamson movie, you know that sooner or later Crappiness will have to keep your ugly head! <br /> <br /> The film begins with the strange cult leader of some great congregation (six) who is trying to restore a dead boy who looks like blue cheese. But this process has a heart attack on the cult bride and was taken to the hospital. Obviously he dies, but it also seems that many of these hospital scenes are missing and some of them appear in the movie later. In other words, when you see a movie, it seems that he is likely to have recovered - only when you hear later that he died. Because man is b.f.f. But Satan cannot die of his evil soul, and he comes back to worship one of his revenge and own a sister Sherri. <br /> <br /> Sherri is now a very disturbed lady - demonic possession or not. Sometimes he acts like a zombie and others are violently killed. So I'm asking ... "why didn't his boyfriend (doctor) seem to be problematic?" "In other words, if he has tried to kill the patient, he will not get an exorcist and will not commit him to the hatchet of horses !!! Oh, and talking about boobies ... this film is not a breast-filled sex romp with its title and the posters would show. some bare breasts, they are not important for the plot and they are only very brief (1/2 second) in everything except one scene. So, if you are perverted, this movie is not for you - though some movie spots (like Sister to get rid of the patient) see that film MIGHT is created at the same time If you are a bad movie fan, there is enough that your appetite would be. Some examples of incompetence are the inability of many participants to provide non-zombie lines - and I'm not even talking about Sherry. One of the very latest scenes is especially noticeable - I've never seen and heard any stylish acting and dialogue in my life - and it includes Ed Wood movies! stuff "bad animation, the doctor found a murdered sister who continues to research the house where the walls are covered with blood. even better, the police army). <br /> <br /> So, despite these problems, why do I think it's good for Adamson? Well, the story is not all bad and he was able to build up the tension very well. Many false alarms early put my heart race a bit. The car accident, though irrelevant, came pretty well and was a big budget for Adamson. <br /> <br /> Generally, a good movie and one of the majority of people wouldn't be bored watching. But Adamson fans or inert films like it - it gives some fun in a cheesy way that gives some laughs.
