The genres of junk gambling that have been missing for some time now are again without talent. It makes no sense, no fun, no originality; just some cheap bucks for filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It takes more than just referring to some recent movies and giving characters a double meaning; to make people laugh. Any clip can get the camera and have some buddies with bad costumes. Since the genre targeted at this time is an inspiring film of sport, some flat references have been put on these types of films: jokes are so weak that characters need to emphasize in different ways to get a hysterical laugh. It does not work. <br /> <br /> It's not comedy. At the same time, all the old sophomorphic "jokes" that have been worn out are out of the school's laundry room (which has been made even sharper than usual). If that's not enough, the current bus is the current "gag". So funny, right? It also makes one pathetically bad scene more productive than Michael Bay; again with the same inaccurate results. A bit of a musical flop unhappy. The damage to Carl Weathers, when Apollo Creed is in the Rocky series, is now in these roles. <br /> <br /> High for words. Watching a snail run marathon would be less annoying than watching this movie. Probably also a lot more fun.
