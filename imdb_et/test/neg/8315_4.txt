Hi, All, Oh, Boy ... That's lulu. It really has bad background music if they can push it in. They beat people and cut people up and attack people and bulldozers. Ordinary things. <br /> <br /> A woman who sends them in her role cannot speak her mouth when she speaks. It's like a bad ventriloquist who is his own mannequin. He walks as he balances the egg with his head. The wardrobe is a free style of the 70's for men and blah for a woman's lead who should be a good sister. A bad novocain mouth woman is wearing red. Maybe there is a silk frock, or maybe just a big poplin windshield. <br /> <br /> I liked this end, although it didn't make much sense. This gives us the opportunity to see what happened in the movie before. <br /> <br /> Police officers are fine. Some bad, some good, all fool except two. Two bright ones would have worked in Hollywood again. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an interesting and endless surprise. Sucks in the middle. A man in Diner who gives a free hamburger to the star is doing a good job. He's like an actor of the 1940s character. Great voice. <br /> <br /> It's a little too long. An oral marble lady could have had a couple of lines and the rest could have said a parrot. The bird would have been easier to understand. <br /> <br /> His sword scene could have been handled by a trained daughter. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
