The worst movie I've seen in the last 12 months. The story of the story was uninteresting, the movie ended when he became a gingesh khan, always thought that something very interesting happened after that. I knew Mongolia and all the areas where the film had a beautiful landscape, but the film didn't benefit from it. Jokes, where really poor. The narrator, gingesh himself, could have spoken a little more about Mongolian history, traditions, and so on. My co-viewer didn't know anything about it, so he was a little lost. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but I was very disappointed. It was one of the three movies I've ever seen in the cinema where I had to leave before the end.
