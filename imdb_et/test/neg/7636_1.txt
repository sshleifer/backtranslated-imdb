To decide on a movie just for landscapes, interior design, costumes .... it's not just right, you are missing the core: STORY <br /> <br /> The film has to tell something, tell the story it impresses you. Yes, I liked the sea, the rocks, the clean water and all that, but ... Is there a plot? <br /> <br /> They are more interesting movies with crazy people like: FLIGHT OVER THE CUCKOO "S NEST ... etc ... this is about a crazy woman more involved with dogs than her kids or her husband, but a clear psychiatric case !!!! Nothing is extraordinary. Unfortunately, the waste of time is all the rage that comes from? Fish smell?
