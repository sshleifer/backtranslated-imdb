I checked this at the Vancouver International Film Festival and I wasn't impressed. <br /> <br /> The only film area I enjoyed was commenting on making a movie. Mostly, this film seemed random and somewhat fantastic (I wouldn't say it for free) and just stupid. Just as he would interfere with the fantasy of everyday life, which may seem intriguing in some movies, but the fantasy just seemed unnecessarily perverted. <br /> <br /> My criticism of this film is not the actors, but the story itself. I found it to be boring and narcissistic. I wanted my money back, but given that it's a movie festival, it wasn't.
