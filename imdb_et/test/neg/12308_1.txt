Spend your time in other ways, even housework is better than this movie. Jokes are not funny, fun rhymes that are Dr. Seus, not there. A very bad way to waste the evening. My kids 4-16 laughed a little at first, the younger ones got it forever, and they left ps2 to play Barbies and parents and surf the net. My wife went and made dishes. So I finished it alone. It was the worst "children's" movie I saw. If you want to watch fun children's movies, see Shrek 2, this movie is fun for kids and their parents. OUT OF THIS MOVIE. It's not funny, not cute, cat makeup is the only good thing in it and you can see it on the plate label.
