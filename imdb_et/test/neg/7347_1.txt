When I looked at this example in Cartoon Network, I found it interesting. Then I read a lot of good messages about this show and decided to watch it. The exhibition was so boring. Each episode was predictable. Moreover, this exhibition has no logic. Hypersmart girls who go to school and sometimes do such stupid things start with 99% of the episodes with Monster, who attacks Townswille, then the mayor (he's a real stupid, he's not funny, he's so stupid that I can't imagine how he became a mayor). Professor, yes, should be the smartest person in the show, but actually ... He didn't even find any difference between the monster and his brother. Narrator comments make this exhibition boring. Because they also have similar lines at the beginning and end of each episode. The animation is also very strange. All except the main heroes are shown in a ugly way. In every show, this exhibition also gives you some sense of life, and that means it is oriented to young children, but when you look closer you will see that there is a lot of violence and even blood (!!!) during the battles.
