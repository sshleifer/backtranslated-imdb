Even if you are not a fan of "Star Trek" movies or exhibitions and books in the universe, I still find some old cast and "First Contact" pictures. . It was, however, a sad look ... it seemed to want to be so much, but it didn't manage to be one of the worst Star Trek movies on so many levels. The plot is very far removed when it seems to want to combine three or four stories into one of the top trek adventures, but it gets ununny when it tries to be, not tense if it wants to be, not an action packed as it tries to be confusion of contradictions. The whole movie that takes the phrase from Spock is illogical. Impacts are not special because I have seen next generation episodes that are just as good, that is, it is good for a TV show, but not a big movie. The plot is ridiculous, because at the beginning of the gang is trying to stop the brother of Spock, then he joins in his quest to find God, yes, you read it right. Klingons make a look that actually creates a much better undiscovered country movie. All in all, you know it's bad when the best part of the movie is Kirk, Bones and Spock singing line with your boat, well Spock did not sing, but rather interviewed lyrics.
