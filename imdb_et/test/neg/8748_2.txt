If you've ever visited Shenandoah Acres as a child and wondered if there might be a worse resting place in the world? Well, you should have seen this movie and answer it. Flavia (a.k.a.a.a.a.f. Fistula) Macintyre is often visited by business casual Gordon, at least since Jessica lived a water witch 13. But Jessica can find much more than fresh spring water when this divine rod is? buried "salve-shure", lost jewelry, corpses, even a talisman who keeps him dressed like a bitch and raises drinks with a fake victory and the appearance of Suzanne Pleshette, while he hypnotizes the abandoned head. Evil, evil evil.
