It is the first recorded effort to play sound with the film and the oldest that is probably still there. This historical film is part of the natural archive "More Treasures of Natural Archives" that opens on DVD. <br /> <br /> This is just a 15 second clip that plays a violin in front of a huge storage cylinder. There are two men next to him. After all, another man walks on stage. William Dickson, director of this experiment, is a violin player. This "film" was several titles over the years, but the sound experiment was not really successful. From that moment on, synchronization and sound took over 30 years, until the public could be entertained. But this was the beginning, no matter how primitive it was. <br /> <br /> For technical information and history on this film process, see the Boba Fett1138 here.
