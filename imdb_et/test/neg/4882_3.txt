I think I won this movie at a "low-cost" competition because I got it as part of the "Martial Arts Movie Classics" DVD collection with 50 movies for 20 bucks, which means I paid something 50 cents to see the "Black Fist" version from a movie that appeared in "Bogard". <br /> <br /> For the main "revenge" flick, "black fist" is not too bad, although it is clearly hampered by low budget. One of my unofficial "thumb rule" to watch a movie is that if the leader actor is better than his production and scenario, the movie will automatically receive at least three stars. This is certainly the case; Lawson has some presence and some charisma and apparently earned a better film career than he did. The anti-street choreography (the visible cause of the film) really does not affect anyone who has ever won a martial arts school or even a schoolhouse fight. I spent only about two years basic kung fu learning, but even I wouldn't fall for the "temple" strikes, hand-drops and round houses on the front. But the atmosphere is good - dust and blood, and screaming crowds and actors feel like fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot is less plausible. The Dawson character "Leroy Fisk" depicts a street-wise, sharp young man who is looking for a desktop for illegal, impunity. But he is surprised and outraged when he has to pay the police? Excuse me, but I was grown up in a small town in Iowa and even * I knew (from looking at "Hard Times" with Charles Bronson) that police officers have to pay for such activities and that guys who fight need fixers to get their games and that fixers would be worth the money. So you have to watch this movie by deliberately suspending your critical faculties to accept it as a "black brother who is reproduced". (Most other black fighters who are stable start to see the same deal, yes?). <br /> <br /> The film is short of attention. Obviously, the director did not need to spend some of the scenes needed, so he had to fill the gaps with somewhat ridiculous scenes of scenes ("I won him, I ate him and then I killed him" with the scene) just not working) with voice commands and cumbersome and convincing assemblies. This is especially true of the whole romance angle, which seems to have been filmed as if it were a follow-up. It's a bit shameful if you think the death of "Fiski" woman should help her revenge. <br /> <br /> But when the film changes completely "the young winner who rises out is a" revenge issue ", it picks up a little steam and plays a bit more conviction. I am not sure that the final profit is worth the accumulation - Roger Ebert calls such a thing "for a long trip on the beach for a long day", but it ties things in a reasonably satisfying way. <br /> <br /> If Sylvester Stallone had made this movie with real budget and the same cast, slicing kits and costumes, and himself as a hero, people have mentioned it under the name "Rocky", which is going to show you how circumstances and opportunities can destroy the dreams of filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing how many different decent shots and lines can be seen, and see how Dabney Coleman himself despises his role.
