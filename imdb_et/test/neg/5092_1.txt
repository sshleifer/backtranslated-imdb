Wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ..... WHAT! This movie is terrible, totally terrible. 1. The only reason Kiefer Sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to Kiefer fans so that their hearts are broken. He kills one boy, shoots and dies before half of the movie is over, not to mention he was only the first 10 minutes and then disappeared to the point he died ... WHY put him on the cover when his character BLOWS. 2. Where are the EPIC battle scenes allowed in the back cover preview? 3. It was too confusing, I mean whats with the girl? He had to tell the movie TRY to get our attention, he failed! 4. When Kiefer dies in the movie ..... it fails. Now I'm going to watch 24 ..... THIS MOVIE FILE!
