After reading a lot of good things, I finally watched "clearing." When casting big actors like Redford and Dafoe, one would at least expect a decent movie. After closing the credit was rolled I was still shocked at how bad and inconsistent this movie actually was. <br /> <br /> Should this be an "art" movie? I don't think it would be too melodramatic for it. The bad thing is that drama seems to be over-forced and unrealistic. The truth is that the script doesn't make any sense. First of all, it never explains the motives of the characters but simply surpassed their so-called. personal issues ".What is so bad about the life of a Redford character that he needs to" erase "? The fact that he is cheating on his wife from time to time is a millionaire who has had a good life, a big son and a big daughter, a woman who loves her (and a girlfriend, who also seems to be above a general mistress of a woman) o and a newborn grandchild. The only problem seems to be that she ... has worked hard to be a successful person all her life. It seems that her hard work has really paid off and she really has no real problems with her life. /> <br /> Then we come to the character of Dafoe: there is someone who was the head of one of Redford's business and fired. It looks like he has to have some kind of good education to get a job like what he had first, and it seems to have been a man who has solid ideas about his job (as evidenced by his feedback about the conversation he had with Redford working with him) Why e i can a man work properly with such a person and have a decent life? Because he was fired once? Absolutely unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The film really tries to portray these men as "tortured souls" or something and it becomes truly cheesy. In fact, I would say that if the creators of this film try to dream about the dream of America If they were unhappy happily. <br /> <br /> As for the actual events that happen during the movie, they don't make any sense. In fact, the last 20 minutes of the movie will be an insult to the viewer. intelligence because there is no thing that actually makes sense.Redford seems to have about 1,000 options to escape, but he is not. At one point he is ready to flee and he still can't afford his excuse for his kidnapping and he doesn't want to hurt him! Then Dafoe will pick up his weapon from the water and sludge, which should be useless (if you shoot with a gun after the gun has been in the water and it can blow in your face) and the gun is in good condition !!! As unemployed, useless (as depicted in this film) and mentally unstable, the whole FBI can easily bring this film into the "twilight zone" of this film. to turn off the viewer. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like nothing, it's not (ie a high-quality, experienced psychological thriller). Unfortunately, it is not so difficult that it becomes a disaster and it is the word that describes this film as the best: A DISASTER.
