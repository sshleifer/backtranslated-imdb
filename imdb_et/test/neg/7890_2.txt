The dog of Richard Haydn is given a dog by Joanna Fontaine. However, if Virg (Bing Crosby) arrives to the emperor to sell the grammar record player, his dog Johanna will attack. After a revenge attack on which Virgil is left out of town, a psychoanalyst requires that Johanna's dog must resist Virgil's dog so that he can overcome his dog's fears. It's organized and the dogs fall in love. So Virgil and Johanna. The rest of the film goes through romance and finally Johanna is born. But who is the father .......? <br /> <br /> Dog's story is a very weak vehicle used to create a human story. This is a terrible story. There are 3 main music all of which are garbage - bad songs and terrible choreography. Its the only boring film - Bing has too many words in every sentence and they are delivered in an almost nervous and irritating way. He's not funny ............ EVER .......... but its purpose was to be. Bing and Joan have done much better.
