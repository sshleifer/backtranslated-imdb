4 Oscar winners, Karl Malden, Sally Field, Shirley Jones, Michael Caine. Big characters from actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle. 1 hour 54 minutes alone for tedium, melodrama and terrible activities, knowledge of the scenario and poor well-being you were thinking? <br /> <br /> Irwin Allen was just trying to get the money from the original classical catastrophe popularity with the help of a Class D minus script, the actors were obviously paying for it, ... horror, horror! <br /> <br /> How crazy are those characters playing Caine, Savala, Malden and Field? Go to a potentially deadly drowning ship, the first fire 2. Hot steam. 3. Water and oil slippery, 4. every 5 minutes exploding boilers, etc. Greed? 5. They have very little equipment, not even a pair of gloves or work boots on the horizon, a much less gripping hook, a rope, and so on. <br /> <br /> Foolishness! do they think? <br /> <br /> Peter Boyle goes so far as to just want to smell him! Stop! And what is bad toupee? It is also not possible to believe that his character was a WW2 veteran. <br /> <br /> Caine, Field and Malden will find all this gold and money and they will be happy. We are rich! (We may not live to spend it, but hey ...) <br /> <br /> And this is a great character Slim Pickens! <br /> <br /> Survivors rich! Jack Warden and Shirley Knight too! <br /> <br /> The final dramatic sub-block of this scary plutonium that never went away, as they forgot? There are many holes in the script. <br /> <br /> This film has a disease that the strongest pill could not cure. I'm surprised that Alan J. Smithee's name was not in the script, I would be embarrassed to have done it! <br /> <br /> Oh madness, Oh Humanity! Oy Vey! <br /> <br /> Horror, horror! <br /> <br /> It's like a bad two-hour TV movie. <br /> <br /> At least the kits were made from the first film of recycled material. <br /> <br /> The script needed to be a bunch of compost ...
