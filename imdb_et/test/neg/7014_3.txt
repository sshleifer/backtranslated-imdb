Some good designs. Good songs, though, as the other man said, they are not filled with much energy. Bea Arthur, who was trying to make his own material, occasionally had a good lining on Mame's friend Vera and helped move the song "Bosom Buddies". Besides, there's nothing that is worth your time. Slow pace, incredibly bad cinematography, not a very good song (except Robert Preston), a terrible script, a bad actor (except Bea) and a terrible head actress. Who thought Lucille Ball would be good as a stylish, life-loving Mame? The leaders of Warner Bros. were undoubtedly broke when they decided not to use Angela Lansburi, who had done so well on Broadway, and instead Ball, who was not nearly as funny as he had been 20 years ago, was unable to take part. use the "right way" at all and used a painful choke as a pretext for singing. Even if (maybe because of) the making of the film was painful for him, and even if he financed it, he is not just a mame. Aunt Mame is such a better movie and the Broadway music soundtrack from Lansbury sounds good. In most cases, there is nothing here that is wonderful, interesting or interesting at all. Forget it, if you're not a big Lucy fan who thinks he can't do anything wrong. Hopefully you will see after you realize that he was just a human being.
