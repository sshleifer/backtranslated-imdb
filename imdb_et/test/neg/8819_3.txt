This early film by Bob Clark ("Porky", "Black Christmas", "Christmas Story") did not pump my little as I thought. In fact, it's disturbing me. It is related to a theater troupe who drives to a burial ground of criminals, where they intend to force some evil and regenerate some corpses ... The leader of their group, an imaginable black-magic enthusiast and a potential homosexual, are trying to call Satan's help back to the animated body that fails that they take the body to a nearby, abandoned caretaker and play it ... Nothing interesting happens only in the last fifteen minutes or when the undead ends in the spring of their graves and go after the desecrater's. Make-up effects are okay, gore is very minimal (PG rating), and extremely irritating characters are focused a lot on what really came to my nerves. I think a group of terrible actors who beat an hour is equal to a "comedic" state, but I didn't find any humor in it. The whole concept is just ridiculous - how are these children ready to dig and with a monkey body as long as they did. The characters are stereotypical and nice and the movie is just boring ... Don't waste your time with it ...
