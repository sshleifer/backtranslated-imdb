I should have felt better .. Hints were all over IMDB.com. This flick was written and directed by the same man who has no results. There are a number of unknowns except Joe Estevez, who seems to specialize in bad movies. Etc. Suffice it to say, I see no reason why anyone would want to see this terrible, amateur movie making experiment. Turn on every broadcast at 3 and you will see better movies. Sufficiently said.
