ALERT: This review includes larger SPOILERS. Don't read when you plan to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Judging by the number of votes it got (my voice was fifth), very few people know what Mimi Lesseos is. In the late 1980s, professional wrestling was quite decent. The women's women's federation called Ladies Professional Wrestling Association was open. It was a great league and Mimi Lesseos was one of the names on the list. I always thought he was one of the best people who had the skill and the ability to act with LPWA. Unfortunately, LPWA closed down in the early 90s, so it seemed natural that someone with as much talent as Mimi started his career as an actor, right? But was there an alternative to such things? This movie is really bad. As it passed, I compared it with the undervalued "Survivor Quest", only this film lacks everything that made Survivor Quest enjoyable. <br /> <br /> When I started the tape, I went through the tape preview to get the tape meat. First of all, he didn't pay much attention, but then I realized that the preview was for a film starring Mimi Lesseos. "Oh," I thought there was another movie containing Mimi to look for. "But when the preview was pulled out, I found out it's a preview? You know you're in trouble when the only preview starts with the movie you're watching! The plot is pretty common. he is concentrating on his second career, which he shares with his friend Sammy: being a guide in the desert. In this particular case, he gets three pairs: two pairs are just taking up space. halfway between the movie, but it is ignored for the reindeer jokes that consistently frighten a Korean woman. The joke is funny when you first hear it, but it is definitely not the ninth time. and Ms. They trade insults back and forth and Mr. Page uses his video camera for voyeurism art when he is not engaged in playing cruel jokes with his portly Before hiking, Mr. Page tells two two stupid boys and their prostitute. One of them kills the prostitute inadvertently and discovers the man on the page. So the danger begins, because two men are watching the group on their trip and are we waiting? And wait ?? and wait ?? and wait until they finally do something. If they do, it is a fiasco. <br /> <br /> You can't blame. They try as hard as possible with the material they work with. The main culprit is director Robert F. Lyons, who has to go back to play some parts and stay out of the board of directors. Lyons starts and stops scenes in such a sloppy, sudden issue that he thinks he is suffering from dyspepsia throughout his shooting. There is even one incompetent moment when some night scenes slip into a wide daylight scene with a blow. Then there is the sound department. Music and background noise go beyond dialogue, so you need to move your ear directly to the TV speaker. Don't hit your head on the screen! It's not worth it to hear badly written lines. Speaking of poor writing, Lesseos gets some credits as a passenger. Some interesting developments between characters are often left behind by rogue or bad practical jokes. Early on, Lesseos knocks out a bunch of knives so they never think they are dangerous with two fools. When the strokes are finally struck by Lesseos and long struggles, our cast is all together, despite being shot and bleeding everywhere. Yes, everyone is happy. Everybody except the poor souls who see the movie want good old prizes when Mimi was in the round. Zantara score: 4 out of 10
