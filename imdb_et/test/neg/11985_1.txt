Obviously, it would have been potential in more capable hands, but it would have been surprising if Uwe Boll had any value for that farce. <br /> <br /> The first 5 minutes are the classic madness of the monster movie - even the terrible disposable liners offered by GI Joe-type soldiers feel they are being moved from the other venture to the same genre. <br /> <br /> You make yourself an advantage when you leave this movie. You have already gone through all the highlighted topics and you have saved yourself from the worst of past history. <br /> <br /> Then enter the absolute garbage talent. The leading person has the same amount of charisma you find in the flesh. <br /> <br /> It is uncomfortable with a little busy romance that has come into play - it seems so wrong that you can only speculate about why this scene was hidden. Typically, the genre uses romance and nudity to inject some humanity and compassion into otherwise cut-out characters from cartons - this is a setback for all cylinders. <br /> <br /> The effect is bad and the action is incredibly boring. While other classics show originality and imagination over budget constraints, it just seems that everything was spent on catering. <br /> <br /> There are really no redemption functions here - not even "it's so bad almost good". It's just bad and bad. <br /> <br /> Our hero is asking the leading star for the night they spent together and appreciating him. He gives him 2 out of 10. I'll give the whole thing 1 (I'd be 0 if it were possible). <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this drift, there's a lot of crap cinema out there that goes beyond the ridiculous rumble in the jungle. <br /> <br /> Oh, and finally the movie has nothing to do with the popular Far Cry game (at best it is extremely loosely based). <br /> <br /> Terrible, go along!
