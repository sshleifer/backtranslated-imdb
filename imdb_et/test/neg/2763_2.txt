When this movie is an exact display of J. Smith's experience, I think he made a big mistake by leaving the television. Hasn't he been watching movies in "starring" with David Caruso, especially with "cold around the heart"? But Mary-Louise, she's done a lot, much better than acting on her abilities. Yes, it is a terrible scenario that has been wrongly edited and is not constantly available, but skilled workers have and have overcome similar obstacles. Very disappointing.
