I started when I heard the first canned laughing corner in the first few seconds, but I gave him a chance. You know if someone offers a line that is just a little amusing and you obviously hear a fake corner that explodes with a terrifying laugh that this is an exhibition aimed at the moored, "yes, it's funny, go and laugh." /> <br /> Ugh. I couldn't stand this example when it showed itself. I can't speak for everyone - after some people actually have such an IDIOTIC exhibition "Stacked" (which makes me vomit). I can imagine that those who like "Stacked" might actually like this kind of fire. Some people can still "pull my ring" out of the old. For me, this exhibition is almost as funny - and almost the same. <br /> <br /> Themes were old and tired. The jokes were flat and hackneyed. The characters were the ones we have seen everywhere - and the worst of anything you could imagine. <br /> <br /> So ... if you like things that tell words and neighbors who say "pull my finger" .. you could really like this example. Otherwise. It's stupid - and not wisely or original. It is about as old and tired as every exhibition has ever been its premiere.
