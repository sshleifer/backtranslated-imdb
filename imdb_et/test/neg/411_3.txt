COMPLETE Fast pace, exhilarating, interesting, detailed rich book. It is a great shame that the film did not have any of these features. not only Tom Hanks' mild imagination, nor Robert Langdon's ridiculous, but the name became the main characters, big deviations from the original line and poor Irish / Italian accents from Carmaleng played by Ewan Mcgregor. EVER. <br /> <br /> A great fan of A&A, I had great hopes to book a more exclusive, true book for a detailed movie where it would start and end like a book - so I'll leave more <br /> <br /> All the film was really frustrating for the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> What was impressive was how ... sorry! I couldn't even finish this sentence without laughing. In short - Vittoria was a symbol of the hottie, the very second Audrey Tatou and there was a very nice Alfa Romeos. <br /> <br /> I would recommend reading the book to understand that if Ron Howard had to ask you to make another movie, I'd be happy to save you for my 6.40 KFC zinger meal and some chicken wings - a lot more fun and more profoundly satisfactory!
