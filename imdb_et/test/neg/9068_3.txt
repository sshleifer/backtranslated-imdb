Don't worry - there's no spoiler here, just saying it's a very predictable plot. The couple decides to live in their father's love nest so they can write a book / article / newsletter with the famous tragic Hollywood star. This whole production ran like a high school troupe who made the Murder She Wrote episode. The only commitment I sold was the old difference with which they interviewed sources. Apparently, the directors thought the film was too long, so they finally ended up moving their camera to some horrible picture and brought up the slice-ups to break that thing up. Don't waste your time - even a tried and true horror / intrigue classic will fail in this movie.
