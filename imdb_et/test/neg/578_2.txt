Divorced single mother in a picturesque seaside town finds an anonymous love letter and allows her to force her standing love into life. A pet project for an actor / co-producer, Kate Capshaw, who gives a warm, nicely modulated lead, but this story is so thin and the direction and editing are so uncertain that weak dissatisfaction slips. friends who read her love letter (an interesting visual joke), but the first person she does is Ellen DeGeneres, who doesn't play lesbian but who comes out of this trick. The different ideas are hidden in the hope that one should stick, and consistency is extremely unpleasant. Support (including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott, who mostly turn off their shirt) is very good, but they can't save the final act, which is disappointing. Low key, peculiar and pleasant way, but it's strangely good-natured, nothing more. ** 1/2 from ****
