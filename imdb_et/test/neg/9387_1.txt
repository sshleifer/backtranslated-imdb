With NBC "Thanks to God Here", the network tries to try ABC's better sitcom success, "Who's that anyway?" where the host Drew Carey would decide to perform some of the performances of a handful of people asked to improvise the scenes in some way. At the NBC show, Dave Foley and co-host Dave Alan Grier watch a handful of remarkable comedies who have to improvise their way through the various scenes that all begin with "Thanks to God." It takes itself too seriously (why viewers need to be reminded repeatedly that actors have never seen these sets before), both co-hosts seem less enthusiastic. After constantly looking at the sub-para, ununny trials that the participants would like to laugh at, I don't know if the live audience is ridiculous, what's happening, or whether they're improvising. Expect this time slot filler to be very short-lived.
