We have to disagree with people who say it is a terrifying film with a good actor and camera work - I would say it is an amazing horror shock that the HIGH is shockingly exhausting acting and bad camera work - look instead at Ju-on: The Grudge wastes his time with this waste. The main idea of ​​the film is the original idea, given the abundance of killer-puppy-based intimidation that has been against us over the years; Unfortunately, this story is about the nuances of the latest Michael Bay makers, who are equally unlikely to be played by actors with precise perfect horror, likely to be driven by Korean day-to-day soap operas. It's not scary and only succeeds in reducing your expectations with the next Korean horror movie to make a call. Oh well.
