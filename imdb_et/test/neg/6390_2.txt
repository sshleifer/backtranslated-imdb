This movie just came to Mexico and as I read very good comments on it, I decided to watch it with my friends and girlfriend, but I was very disappointed, I don't understand how people appreciate it 10/10. and the management was beautiful, but the big overall movie needs a good story, which this flick was missing at all. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed a number of dramatic Asian and European films, but they had a good story of watching this film at risk unless you were Eastern European or Orthodox, I don't think you like it. <br /> <br /> Half of the people in the theater, including my 4 friends, who were waiting outside because they were really bored, so I was looking forward to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> In the movie, it was a very slow pace with lots of time-consuming scenes, the whole story could have been shown for no more than 40 minutes, but they made it longer if you sent a monk to the monk, which is 15 minutes a lengthy movie plus panoramic views and so on until they made this full-length movie really boring. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you listen to me when you look back and appreciate this comment to help people avoid this waste of money after the palace.
