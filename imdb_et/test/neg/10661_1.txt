This movie must be the worst movie of 2007, it was just very bad and I don't think I've ever seen a movie that's just so bad, I mean, don't really make bad Hollywood movies? Hamish really should stay in action instead of singing because he just can't act at all, God, he was just so bad, I mean he was so bad in the movie that he made Mallika Sherawat like a better actor than his performance, he plays the same role in every movie, God is just so boring looking at him, i mean what men in this woman see ?, yes he has a body, but where is this talent ???? I haven't seen it yet and at this speed I don't think I ever want it. <br /> <br /> In any case, Hamish Ria, the 15-year-old girl, can act, my god she was the best actor in the movie and she doesn't look at 15, she's about 21, but her performance was great in the movie. bless her, she was really good, I hope to see her more in the future. So Ria falls in love with Himash, but her father wants her to marry someone else's typical Bollywood movie, which in any case has hiccups (can only happen on Bollywood) and both marry eventually. Well I would give the music the 10/10, it was great, which made the movie hit, the songs were really amazing and brilliant. Anyway, the only thing I can say is to go and buy music and watch a movie.
