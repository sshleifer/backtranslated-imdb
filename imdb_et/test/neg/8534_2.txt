Let's just go to the first paragraph. "Messengers" is the latest film by Pang Brothers (Danny and Oxide) as a horror film, deeply bad. And like the film in general, there is great disappointment. This is nothing more than a redesigned "Sixth Sense" and as long as this image is still available, Earth has no reason to pay money to see this turkey. <br /> <br /> Recently, horror / movies like "Final Destination" series "Wrong Turn", "Boogie Man", "Ring 2" and "The Grudge" are increasingly dependent on big shocks without payouts jumps on the screen, gives the audience a boost, but turns out to be a cat or a crow or something.) A little goes to make it a really frightening experience like "Sixth Sense" or "Signs" or some classic horror films from the 1940s, 50s and 60s. <br /> <br /> "Messengers" rely on the same old, tired clich√©s as these newer, inferior movies and are thus old, tired and - to my surprise - ended up as one of the most boring films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot has another silly family run by Father Roy (Dylan McDermott, "The Practice"), Mother Denise (Penel ope Ann Miller, "Awakenings", "Kindergarten Cop", TV series "Desperate Housewives "), the big internal Jess (Kristen Stewart," Zathura: Space Adventure ") and the toddler Ben (Evan Turner) who move to North Dakota in Chicago. <br /> <br /> The reason for this movement has never been outlined here, but it has nothing to do with the father's inability to find a job and drive to Jessi. We know there is trouble right now because they are moving in the middle of a big gothic house; a permanent residence that looks at Munster's summer home. Oh, and during the first five minutes of the movie, something really terrible happened there. <br /> <br /> Jess hates this place (hey who could blame her), but the optimistic pop hopes to raise the sunset (despite the unusually large number of crows). But when he meets Burwell (John Corbet, "Raising Helen" and looks like Kevin Costner from the "My Name Is Earl" movie version), the traveling drifter and sunflower cultivator, things are getting faster. <br /> But then strange things happen; Jess is terrorized by the violent invisible force of the house (of course, someone else, but two-year-old Ben sees it so that she is labeled with flake) and crows are left over. Ben can also detect vague beings, but since he is two, he cannot formulate it. Scene after a scene where a little boy was told he could see what he saw, I had the impression that I wanted to scream on the screen: "He can't tell you! He's two - freaking" - years old! "Yes, is the only protagonist capable of solving all these things, is a quiet toddler, is a real wise. <br /> <br /> Anyway, we have been thinking about Jess's sensibility; when and when Ben ever describes parametric visions, what he sees, when the father makes the sunflower work, how high plains are a good man or bad, what is a real estate agent with a view of George Plimpton, how can a bite in the butt be only a wound of the flesh, what is the role of the mother in the family; br /> <br /> All of this is waiting and thinking something - something - would happen, and the conclusion is pretty flat, and once again the question of how a spirit with no physical body can harm a living person. and the most terrible, not scary. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there are many crows in this movie.
