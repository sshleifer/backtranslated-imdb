This series is formal and boring. Episodes are the same thing every week, just with the settings. Some of the purely evil characters are doing a nice thing, Walker goes after him and ends with Karate. Crooks are super-cliché super-stereotypical evil crooks, good guys are all clean, honest, and holy, and the story is simple and unreal. After about 2 episodes, all but the least familiar fans are totally unobtrusive. Norris is certainly not the best job. His second job can be a cliché, but usually it won't take weeks. If you like formal, boring, repetitive clichés, that's for you.
