It was a modest test of the film, although it seemed like an extended TV pilot. <br /> <br /> Some may find this unfair, but it seems that someone saw "The Brothers" and "Save the Last Dance" and thought "Hey, I can do it." Well, not quite. <br /> <br /> Although I personally found the film to be predictable, somewhat ill-acted, and well-established (see cookies), Carl Payne shows that he can take the lead and come back on TV. The leading lady (not remembering her name, sorry) was also credible, but you're thinking of Julia Stiles (she was one of the "Save The Last Dance", right?), Because it was a "white girl" mode.
