Lame. Lame. Lame. Ultralame. Should I go further? Here's one, I repeat * one * funny scene in this movie, drawn, amusing Amateur Hour Special Movie: Fares Fares's fatty father knocks someone over his beer with salt. That's it. The rest of this shockingly mediocre emptiness heap consists of a traditional brand of eternal "actresses" from Sweden who give a dialogue that goes to one ear and the other, a banal story, a sloppy direction and well, little else worth it. Nepotistically cast Fares Fares is as charismatic as the chartered accountant and his nasal rivals, even for Adrien Brody, which is completely ridiculous. Torkel Petersson should only work with Lasse Spang Olsen. Luckily the rest of the majority is easily forgotten, while Fares humongous, titanic nose haunts me in dreams forever. <br /> <br /> Josef Fares will help destroy Swedish cinema. Don't support him and his mess. Jalla Jalla is a comedy featured by Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kopps would have been much more respectable if it had been a non-budget Youtube video, and Zozo was just the most pretentious, pseudo-related garbage that the Swedish director had ever fired. Wake up and smell the roses: Swedish films can be so much better, so stop pretending Fareside flicks are worth it because they are "good to be in Sweden". Please.
