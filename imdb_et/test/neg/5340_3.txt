Well, this is a monogram of the 40's frightened period, when the line-of-poverty studios put out many good films that are almost unimaginably dull ... So I was expecting the worst. The story is related to a doctor who has worked in a way to restore life to life using a room full of useful electrical devices that glow nicely. Under the hunting of the clock is the heart of the dog, which proves that its method is perfect. We know his method is perfect. <br /> <br /> A brief discussion of the metaphysical consequences and the important plot point is preceded by the inevitable death of a young man who is revived in a rather undramatic order - even with sparks. An important test piece is that the convicted person is executed just at midnight, which proves exactly when a young man revives. Not surprisingly, the young man is very different after his experience; apparently amnesia and a strange desire to visit the ghosts of the underworld and get to know some gangsters ... <br /> <br /> It's hard to explain why it's not all traceable, but maybe enough to say it's a little interesting and contains several murders and a couple of interesting characters. After all, it even starts moving with a little bit of real tension and confrontation, which is completely Hitchcockian. SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have to warn you very badly. Labeled with pain when it is in the ass. After solving the plot quite effectively ... <br /> <br /> You know what it is ... It's all a dream. Never happened.
