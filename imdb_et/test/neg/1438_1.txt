Wow ... This movie really sucks ... 'Nuff said. <br /> <br /> Story: Psychopathic Internet predator stems and attracts young men and women into distressing traps ... It goes like this, robs people, they find it, it turns into a changed man and frees up the world, returns to its old ways and torture starts again .... The story is stupid, it's incredible. The characters are stupid, they are incredible ... Or at least at least. It has some very violent pictures, and if you have a week's stomach, you might just stay away ... But if again, even if you don't have a week's stomach, you might stay away ... It's stupid. <br /> <br /> Cast: Dee Snider, Kevin Gage ... If you are a deadly fan of Twisted Sister and Dee Snider, you may find it interesting because he is a writer and star of this movie. His action is ridiculously bad and you can say that he is the one who wrote God's terrible script. Kevin Gage ... Well they say he's been in many other movies I've seen, but I don't remember him any of them ... And you don't remember him ... These two sorrows, make a movie ... They do not like it to you ... They just do it ... <br /> <br /> One to five scales: 1 It's bad ... It's very bad. ..It is so bad that this movie should come with a clip loading gun to play Russian roller ...
