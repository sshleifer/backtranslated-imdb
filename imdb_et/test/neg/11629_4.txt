Let's get things straight. I was raised with a Catholic and very religious family and spent so much time in the congregation and talking to the priests at home. It was useful for two things: to make convincing atheist of me and to give me a deep, informed knowledge of the church and its dogmas. And I say, if the Catholic priest knows the murder and sees the killer's face clearly, he can report it to the police, even if the murderer has later recognized him. He cannot reveal what he has acknowledged, but he can talk about everything he sees outside, and confession is useless for keeping his mouth shut. So, here's a movie that's completely lied. And another lie is that there is no release for murder. According to the Catholic Church, there is the release of all sins until there is sincere repentance. So far, this weak thriller has the biggest plot gardens. <br /> <br /> As people often say, this movie would have improved if Bob Hoskins and Alan Bates had changed roles. Hoskins is naturally suitable for playing gangsters (I will never lose enough to lose Al Capone's one of De Niro's "The Untouchables") and Bates's characteristics would have been perfect for the priest with a gray past. But, I think the film would have been much better than actually Ulster's mother-in-law Liam Neeson (mostly to an unknown big audience) played a part of Mickey Rourke. Not only is his face perfect for playing tortured characters, but he would make us believe the character as something Rourke just can't. In the 1980s, Rourke was not a bad actor (after that he seemed to lose his talent with his appearance), but he was one of those performers, like Brad Dourif, as good as the director. And as a former IRA terrorist, Rourke acts more than a pimp. Sad to think that if this film was only made three to six years later (when Neeson achieved a moderate fame status in 1990 with Sam Raim's "Darkman" and superstardom "Schindler's List", Rourke got pretty much forgotten), would be Liam and Mickey could have benefited some more (Rourke would have been effective in Docherty's supporting role, but just can't bring this movie along). Another forgotten opportunity and another film that has the potential to be classic was instantly a forgotten price. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the often criticized score (underestimated by Bill Conti, composer) worked for me. I didn't find it too melodramatic, but suitably sharp and beautiful. It reminded me of Howard Shore's score "The Silence of Lambs". Here's the talent of Mike Hodges who made "Get Carter", yes, but don't forget that he is also the back of "Flash Gordon" ... <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a masked cutting room (this shows, because some parts are really tiny and confusing and others just don't glue) and the director's cutting is waiting for the light. OK, but I doubt it makes it a great movie because we still have bad casting and false assumptions. 4/10.
