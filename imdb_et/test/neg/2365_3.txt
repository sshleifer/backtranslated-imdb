"TNT Jackson" is not completely traceable. But the DVD I saw on the DVD was edited with weed control, or the scenario itself is the lowest level of grinding / blaxploitation sausage. Or maybe both. <br /> <br /> Jeanne Bell should have his career at one point with Playmate and the movie will make the most contact by displaying his breasts at least twice as much as was really necessary (including a fun topless fighting scene that I'm pretty sure was meant for funny ). I admit they're pretty nice. However, he is a kind of medium-sized and has no career with Foxy Brown, even Cleopatra Jones. He has moments of film director as an actor, but it would have been nice if the director had pushed him a little harder or if the scenario had given him the opportunity to do more than "attitude" and let people. br /> <br /> Talking about people, fighting scenes (another supposed reason to watch such a movie) is pretty bad. There is no real choreography here, but people who are posing and keeping their opponents in the general direction. One small exception is a nice moment when the opponent is equipped with butterfly folding. the other is the sequence close to the tip where Bell (and perhaps Stan Shaw) obviously doubles the stunt and do some decent sweeps and bases a few minutes or two before Bell / "Jackson" strikes his enemy's liver, Shaw collapses and the scenario just stops. (Again, I testify that this is the tradition of Shaw Brother, which has been fast since time immemorial). thinking of "Joe" and a companion who plays a drug master's right hand). There's a semi-neat funk laden soundtrack that complements the screen's action and adds its star rating. There is semi-vigorous sex music that can be almost self-effective. <br /> <br /> This is strictly for blaxploitation fans. I just saw it because of curiosity, and I'm not sorry I took the time. But I can't imagine wanting to see this time again if I don't decide to write a dissertation on the "Kung Fu Theater" and "Foxy Brown" pop culture intersections.
