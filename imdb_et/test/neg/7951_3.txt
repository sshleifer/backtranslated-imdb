Have you ever watched a movie when, after its end, your left hand contemplates what it was in the world? Well, say hello to "Scream, Baby, Scream". It's not that the story is complicated or something like that, it's just that it plays in three completely different modes ... 1. A funny 60s drug movie ... 2. A lot of over-the-counter soap opera ... and a 3rd nightmare ( very little "Scream" about). To my surprise, I've discovered that it was written by one of my all-time favorites, Larry Cohen. Well, I think even the best is to learn through the test and the mistake. <br /> <br /> Plays a lot like something H.G. Lewist (with a smaller fx only), this "bad" movie has it. For most of the short running times, you will hear a pretty cool jazz score and a few memorable scenes ... one of those kids where a group of kids decides to experiment with acid and take a nice long motorcycle ride at the zoo. The camera tricks that the director uses to show his hallucination are just plain but fun. Trust me when I tell you, it is not necessary to take this house to get it!
