This film was one of the longest-running experiences in my life. Though I like how Chan-wook Park director revenge revenge, the movement as a whole was TERRIBLE. Oldboy has been billed for only 1 hour and 55 minutes, but it seems that speaking at least 3 and a half hours. I say that copying English was very good and the film was easy to understand. I felt that some scenes were unnecessarily long and a lot of repetition. Also, if you are reluctant to interfering with disturbing voices, do not listen to listening to Hye-jeong Kang (he plays Mi-do). If you are looking for time to kill time and make yourself feel morally better with others, take a look. If you don't want to watch a movie full of incest, bad dialogue, unnecessary fighting scenes, torture and confusing scenes, it's not a movie for you.
