Ivan The Terrible is a more filmed stage than "big-screen-opus". Citizen Kane - a similar job in many ways - is the exact opposite (as we expect such a ticket) because it has many on-site shots. <br /> <br /> Action is intended for character motivation and thinking for the audience; if it manages to understand this character, what is it important, how did it happen? Given the small activity, how would you otherwise express the events that affect the story, and consequently, the machinations of the characters and other decisions beyond the exaggerated movements? <br /> <br /> There is also a historic level why you shouldn't be surprised by the exemplary style. The rise of totalitarian regimes in Germany and the USSR forced the filmmakers behind them to make films as they knew. As they had access to more modern works that showed cinema development and techniques, they only used what they knew. <br /> <br /> Control of the Nazi government in Germany destroyed the great German film industry of the 1920s through their complete control over the film industry. And the propaganda film will only become so much "troop entertainment"; for example, popular German silent films of the 1920s are needed. So many of Ivan Terrible's film techniques would have been obtained from such German films (as mentioned in other comments). <br /> <br /> There was no confusion somewhere, and although it was personally found it is by no means a bad cinematic experience - and certainly it is never among the worst films. Action is good, and some of the cinematography is excellent (even according to today's standards; more below). There is certainly no popcorn; none of them can leave their door. Maybe still and very symbolic - just look at the big screen if no one can watch movies at home with light, because many of the cinematic arts disappear with their black and white experience. It all depends on what your expectations are ... <br /> <br /> WARNING - SPOILERS: Do not read the following comments if they affect your personal movie (s) view. <br /> <br /> ... and if nobody remembers the obvious communist propaganda (unlike capitalist propaganda). Because Ivan is how Stalin saw himself - obviously under his influence on the direction of the film (see other comments) - and anyone who has a world-wide historical awareness outside the US certainly understands it. Maybe Ivan used to be Stalin's or not; it is more about using Stalin and his motivations, decisions, loneliness, lack of promotion, etc. - than Ivan's personality - as any Ivan's real historical record. Also note the obvious use of certain colors in the queue: red (for USSR) banquet. And maybe blue (for the US) during certain frames when a usurper carries a crown? <br /> <br /> But it has many great visual features, such as deep use of shadows or coming of begging. Ivan returns to Moscow.
