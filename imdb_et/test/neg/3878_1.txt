It was a Hindi film. Hindi = terrible. reasons: cheap dialogs, cheap special effects, cheap referral + 2 hour movie extension for 3 hours. <br /> <br />% ^^^^^^ spoiler ... bit %%%%%%%% <br /> <br /> Especially for this movie: 1. Dialogs are not funny. they are cheesy and cheap. Although akshay tried his best action that I admire him, comedy was not funny at all! I laughed at this movie only 3 times. The first half of the movie was useless for the second half. The second half was the actual story / film. the first half was the passage of time. 3. Characters are not developed properly at all. paresh rawal is smart in the first half, idiot on the other side of the movie / the rest. we do not really develop axhay and govinda feelings or care. their characters are no longer fools. they do not seem to be in difficulty in their difficulties. Jokes are funny, but they're not funny in a very serious scene. Gang and drug dealers are cheeses and have been used for the last 20 films. there is nothing new in these notes. Again it is shown that they are funny. but stupid = funny when the stupid is the norm for the whole movie. the only thing that was logical was lara dutta's actual story. 4. Special effects were crap. At the end, the fire truck is off the ladder. you notice that they are not really on the ladder in the air. secondly, ppl will fly when the ladder starts moving. ppl does not move off the ladder when it moves ... they fall directly on the ground, called gravity. 5. The whole movie was copied. all dialogs were saved after the movie. The lips of the actors were barely synchronizing with the dialogues. <br /> <br /> There are probably many other reasons why this movie was nasty, but I don't remember them. check out this masterpiece that is smart Indian movies that are not intelligent, even stupid, the director himself and you agree with my review. ppl, who likes Hindi movies, please raise your expectations for the quality of prestigious films. Let me say that not all Hindi films are bad. I like some. I didn't like it. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 (1.5 times for axhay and lara efforts)
