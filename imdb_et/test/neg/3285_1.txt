It's just the worst and most offensive TV. I would like to completely ignore it, but Fox is stuck in this Sunday's lineup, forcing me to find something else to look at American Dad and Family Guy. The Dink-head male is almost the least developed, pathetic apology to the person I've ever seen on television. Nothing at the shows is funny and pretty much everything else has been done by other exhibitions. <br /> <br /> It is clear that their strategy is to force it deep and hard on Sunday and hope someone will like it ... but I have to break it, Fox, this is the wrong hole. Fraud didn't work for me - I'm just looking elsewhere - but come on, you'll see a terrifying stick, it's amazing SUCKS, and it sucks even worse than the rest of Fox's Sunday set. <br /> <br /> RETURNED DEVELOPED DEVELOPMENT IN A PERFECT CAUSATION PICTURE?
