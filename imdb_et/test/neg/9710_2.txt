This movie is just bad. First of all, the story is just strange and it is not good. This leaves you with questions when you are finished. Sometimes it is OK, but not in this case. <br /> <br /> Operation is nothing to write home. Adults do a good job, but children who are children are not a good job. I thought the leading role, Ian Costello as Mickey, was the worst. Frankly, I am not sure that this was the leading role. Never thought who the film was. Mickey or Pete. <br /> <br /> There were some shots that looked out, but there was nothing in cinematography. However, the sound was better. There was a nice score. A little adventurous score, though it didn't show me an adventure movie. It had some elements of the adventure film, but it was more of a drama. However, it was difficult to tell who the film was meant to be. Children? Hardly. There is too much language and violence to do this. Adults? I do not know. It had to contain many elements of children's films. It was like an adult film packing children's films. <br /> <br /> The story was just strange. I have no idea what it really was. You were thrown to it, without knowing anything, but all the time you were referring to what you felt you should know. For example, the fact that the parents of the children were dead and that Mickey accused Petet of this. You expected to know what happened, but you never got. <br /> <br /> All this film was bad and a waste of time. There was no car in it. Something that really moves the story. It's not what you spend on your Saturday night.
