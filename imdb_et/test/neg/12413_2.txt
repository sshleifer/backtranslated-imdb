This movie is not really so much ... whether a racket driver or a racing car racer has a flame dispenser at the beginning of a movie, goes to a bar, approaches a biker-gang who destroys his chances with a very cute lady Offer him a job, he goes back, refuses, the police ask receive it! What is playing is a very annoying little movie that sees the hero not doing so much and a bicycle ride that can kill and for some reason the police cannot take them to a crime. I'm not sure why a female biker did what he did at the end, but hey this is a bad movie, you always get scenes that make little sense. I still try to find out if I fail if they said that the hero of this hero was a stunt driver. They may have a stock driver, because why would a stunt racer race and I don't think it would be all that is rare when a stunt car crash. The actors are bad and all the cyclists are quite annoying and the hero is kind of incompetent ... really this movie is not full of strokes, but it's wells.
