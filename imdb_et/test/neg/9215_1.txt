In my opinion, the end is what completely destroyed the whole thing. The original idea that someone suddenly realizes that they were the son of God and the second coming was somewhat clever. People began to believe him and his friends became new disciples. People went nutty, demons possessed people, all kinds of fun. Of course then everything went wrong. It was bad enough that they had to take the impossible task of reviewing a large number of writings to find the "third will" within five days, but eventually it became a ridiculous humanistic fantasy. I do not break it, but I say it comes out as if it had been written by a teenager with very little knowledge of theology. I hear that they are making an American version of this story, I hope they will change the end of the eye.
