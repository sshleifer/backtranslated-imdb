Someone commented that Charlie Sheen's character should be to judge what he wants. You may be right, but that's what SEAL really is. I served for several months with the SEAL team in Norfolk, VA. In fact, I would like to say that they used their ship for a couple of months in Europe. I was an officer on board who tried to get my mail daily. Since only one person was allowed to post every day, we gave one person a passport. Every day there would be a different SEAL who pretends to be someone else. Well, after the third time I didn't tell them until I had evidence of who they were. They went to NUTS !!! I thought they were going through my cage, dragging me and stealing the mail. Fortunately, I was not only the president beside me (navy) but the federal government (US Mail). It was the only time I saw that SEALs stopped what they wanted. They were allowed to leave the shore unlimited, where we had to return to the ship for a certain period of time. They killed and tortured a woman in France, and two SEALs received only one week of detention on board, while sailors had been trying to steal a bottle of wine from a French wine shop and got a court fight. Isn't there any wonder why the SEAL retention rate is over 85%? SEALina you're God. So this film does a pretty precise job of depicting how SEAL works and thinks ... unfortunately, it is unbelievable for normal people that it is fake.
