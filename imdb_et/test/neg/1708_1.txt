As an Indie filmmaker, I try to make a decent movie at least. This ____ piece was from a low budget. It was shot at video and not at 24P mini-DV at least. The look and feel of it was just a baaat. I met the director a couple of years ago at ShowBiz Expo in LA and he talked about this book, "Making Movies for Dummies", which he produced. I thought this little video was something, but I think I was wrong. He could have brought the value up a little by shooting a 16mm film instead of this terrible video. The plot was stupid, as well as active, with all the fake green screen and sound, and all nine meters. I had a choice to rent a movie and do it wrong tonight. Damn !!!!! I bought JoyRide, which was a movie hell. Maybe the director should read the actual movie lyrics about making the film and not try to cut the flick of a low budget. Perhaps he should learn from the masters who did, the night of the living dead and the evil dead, and the chain saw the massacre. just to name some of the occasional low budgets. This is one video that was supposed to be dead. I can't call it a movie because he didn't use the movie.
