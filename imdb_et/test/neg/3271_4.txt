Perhaps, like most of the people who have seen this movie long after the premiere of television, I wanted to see many of my favorite actors in the old and hidden form, which is exactly what "slow burning" is. Except for the nostalgic value, the film itself is not very good. <br /> <br /> Eric Roberts is a former reporter, Jacob Ash, hired by a rich artist Gerald McMurty (Raymond J. Barry). his alien son, Brian, who lived with his mother Laine (Beverly D'Angelo) in recent years. In Phillip Marlowe-esquire's fashion, Jacob Ash talks about what would become more than just studying the location of Brian. But when Jacob pursues Laine, his discoveries open up to a wide range of trouble. Perhaps because the events in the film are moving too slowly, there is never much tension for this little thriller, not even after all, by exposing the offenders and their motives. <br /> <br /> But as mentioned earlier, this movie is probably one that points out that it is a relatively unknown circle of actors that includes both the very young Eric Roberts and the divine Johnny Deppi who plays Laine stepson, Donnie. This may be a good reason to try it out ... if it is possible.
