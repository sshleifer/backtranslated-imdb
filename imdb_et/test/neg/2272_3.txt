The Lord. Poor Jane must have done the old roll-over-in-the-grave thing. This is even a baaaa even if you allow time (1971) and format (some mini-series). Whatever you do with Austen, the dialogue should be bright (even in this, perhaps its most serious work), and the melodrama should be strictly limited. Unfortunately, this is not the case with this production. By the time you reach Anne 'Frederick, Frederick, Frederick', you laugh or cry. If you just don't want to "collect" all of Austen's works visually, you can leave it. However, if you look at it, there are little consolations: the acting actors of Anne's Anne do a great job with their tasks.
