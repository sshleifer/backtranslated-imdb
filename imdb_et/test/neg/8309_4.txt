I'm from Texas, so I thought I knew great hair, but the female villain of this movie was humongous hair. When she was on the screen, I couldn't focus on anything other than her hair. Turn to the stage! It also seemed that there were many hearing problems in this film. There was a traffic manager who wrote a parking ticket that somehow did not notice that the owner was dropping towards the car, which cried at the top of the lungs until he hit the car. Then there was a man in the telephone booth who couldn't hear the huge bulldozer that came to him until it was 5 meters away. All the men who hit this movie seemed a bit deaf, no one had to snatch them. The hero of this movie with one hand was so funny and ineffective that it was funny. The bar-fight was pretty funny. There is an invaluable scene where the hero and his girlfriend had sex and decided on their expressions, neither was good for either. It made me laugh out loud. This movie is a set of 50 movie martial arts if you want to see a lot of bad movies (some decent).
