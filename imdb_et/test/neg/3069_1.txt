I'm big, acting, writing and directing, but it's not famous yet. My friends and I often rent bad movies, just have fun and laugh, but when we went to the local family video and found a movie called Biker Zombies from Detroit, we knew it was the worst movie all the time and it was! Biker Zombies Detroit is no script! They can say they have one, but they are liars! There was a 4-minute scene where there were only two men who rifled women and sexuality, and you could say it was improvised. And if they are going to fix it, it should be at least decent, but it wasn't, and you can say that both actors who pull the rings and say they don't even make sense. <br /> <br /> To give you an idea of ​​how this movie is terrible and slowed down, here's the beginning: the girl flocks a man, she hits her face and wins her, then rapes her. Then we see the zombies who attack and both become zombies. <br /> <br /> It's the beginning of the movie! Not to mention the leading zombie voice that carries the whole movie, trying to be embarrassing and thoughtlessly provocative, but sounds like Marylin Manson, who has clinging. <br /> <br /> The worst film. Bottom line, people. But look at it if you like movies without script, primer, bad effect, poor editing, bad music, and the word used in over 100 F. <br /> <br /> When it comes to video stores, my future movies won the Oscar.
