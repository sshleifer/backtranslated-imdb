Robert Downey Jr. The 17th century wig and dress was enough to shake me, but I couldn't believe that a big actor like Sam Neill was involved in this movie. The whole thing was incredible. I particularly like Merivel's "treat" for crazy. They are dancing ... and hey presto! Everyone is happy and they are all better! I think I just didn't like too much Merivel. Thus, watching the entire film for its expected transition from whipworm to a great doctor was exhausting. Also, I am not entirely sure, but I did not think that both the plague and the famous fire in London occurred simultaneously.
