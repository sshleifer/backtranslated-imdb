New Year 2006 and I'm looking at Glimmer Man again. Say what you like, I find Steven Seagal having fun with movies. Like many comments, good fight sequences were liked - I especially liked to have answered the phone in the restaurant, saying how long this recovery would be closed. Bit like the humor of Schwarzenegger in earlier film films - though it is painful to be self-expressive. <br /> <br /> But I like Brian Cox here. One of the most versatile actors. Damage to his hand and legs, but so much to withstand the extended interrogation - the "farm" of this class must be dirty. <br /> <br /> As the movies went on, I just thought about how the sea area's ever-thickening circle was affected. his movement? Never, it's entertainment!
