This movie was terrible. To get to the end of this movie, you couldn't move fast enough. It dropped in the last 20 minutes of the movie and I literally hit the shutdown button right in the middle of the scene. It was one of the worst films I've ever experienced. Worse than all Dean Cain movies. It was terrible to get started. I understand that the main participants were the survivors of the light, but believe that every TV experience would have given them a little more talent. Movies other major issues were campy visual effects and poor film quality. In the film, the theme of the exhibition was good and the story was fine.
