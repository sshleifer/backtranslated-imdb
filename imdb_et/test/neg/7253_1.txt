And I'm afraid I can't imagine why. This is a really horrible and extremely boring film. In some ways, it resembles early science fiction when each set was knocked at the back of Hollywood, whatever it was. Small and incredible set (snipers seem to be about ten meters), apparently made of plaster, for actors who are probably made of plaster with "amusing" stereotypes painted thinly on top of a cold cave in a frozen cave when cast is not damaged when average artillery shells open a few meters away, and finally a terrible script that is more than a movie handbook. I can't really tell you how clever it is. Even being able to see if the young James Dean survived was not enough to keep me for more than an hour. It is really all that EVERY cost to avoid.
