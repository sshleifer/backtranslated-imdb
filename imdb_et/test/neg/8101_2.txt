I think I have to blame myself, but I'm sure more hell is expected to go to the "Black Dragons" title and revolve around the secret World War II conspiracy, Nazi plastic surgeons and revenge. This movie is a boring mistake with an incomprehensible structure. The actual plot (which is basically quite brilliant and intriguing) becomes clear only at the end of the approximation, but the problem is that you stop caring for a long time before. We see the horror icon Bela Lugosi penetrates the society of outstanding American politicians and kills them one by one. The story is timed before World War II and? especially after the end? this is certainly a prerequisite with many options, so it is quite a shame that it is not specified. However, there is one big dialogue that I can't share! The man toward the woman, "Do you want to marry me?" "Why?" "So can I beat you? This is the only way you leave this place!" This is the only emphasis in the overall very boring movie. Bela Lugosi is cute? as usual ?? but his spooky presentation alone is hardly a movie to buy. If you are interested in seeing ghoulish performances from other (guaranteed scenarios) films, see Invisible Ghost, The Corpse Vanishes, White Zombie and of course the 1931 Dracula version.
