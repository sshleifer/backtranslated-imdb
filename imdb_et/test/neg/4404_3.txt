I was very worried about this movie, it was planned to play at a Jewish film festival and it was reported to be very hostile to Israel using smart humor and irony. <br /> <br /> I was released that the movie wasn't a diatribe, but it was a very disappointing movie. The film was full of casual events, some of which were eventually connected, most of which were not. Some events were very clever and funny, but some were just casual and pointless. <br /> <br /> Between two love, there are repeating scenes where they sit in the car, literally and play some handle. Maybe it is erotic in some cultures, but it's like thumb-wrestling. After the third time it really became tiring. <br /> <br /> I've always found that David Lynch is terribly odd, using strange stories and pictures to make the audience think he's so complicated that they don't understand his work; there is really nothing to understand. The same is true here, nothing is added to the stories, and there are not many political points yet (in one scene, the Israeli soldier lowers the Palestinian driver at the checkpoint. Is this news?) I do not understand why this film has caused contradictions and why he has attracted attention. It's a worse job and seeing it was a waste of time.
