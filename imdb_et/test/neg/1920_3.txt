Rich vs bad. Big city vs small town. White collar and blue collar. These things are not the original themes in the movies. So, if these themes are chosen to be involved, the situation would be better to be very original or very good. This one was not. I never believed in the romance of two young lovers of this film. Not convincing or convincing, it just fell. Don't worry, even with a video opportunity.
