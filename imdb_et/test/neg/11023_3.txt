Since I bought a DVD, I looked at it as much as I did for my wallet. secretary, falls in love and marries. The resulting complications. <br /> <br /> Douglas is usually considered an intense actor, given to very dramatic roles, sometimes a hero, sometimes a rat. He's not bad in this comic. The problem is that some are not very comical and nothing else. <br /> <br /> Plot Rambles. A dozen "peculiar" characters come and go - most notably Keenan Wynn as a friend of Douglas, who does nothing but makes bold comments. Thelma Ritter was better off in such a case. <br /> <br /> Well, if the plot is weak, it would have saved some sparkle in the dialogue, but there's nothing to talk about. Some gags are stupid. Others do not delete this bar. Here's what I thought of as a fun line. Douglas has just hired a day and wants to get her to the beach house and seduce her. The day is disturbed and notes that he has never heard of a writer working on the beach. Wynn asks if he liked Douglas's previous book "Love of the Last Year". Yes, of course he did. "Well, most of" Last year's love "was made in a beach house." Ha ha. <br /> <br /> Nice cast, including support, but failed comedy. Television has had better sitcoms.
