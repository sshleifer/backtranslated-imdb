I'm a great fan of this, though sometimes it's quite boring, but the 3rd season has made some terrible drawings. Episode HERO is an example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> The story that it does not talk about is that Cylons deliberately allow the bulldog - a pilot caught several years before black operations - to escape, steal a Cylon ship, and return to Galactica. The plan is that when the Bulldog comes back, it turns out that Adama left him to his fate and is so furious that he kills Adama, which he almost does. <br /> <br /> Now the problem is - Cylons put it up so that the bulldog thinks he has escaped himself. That means the bulldog goes from Cylon's ship without help. So he kills Cylon and walks out of his possession - so much we see. Then we have to assume that he walks in the airlock, manages to get on the Cylon battleship and learn how to use it, take off and fly to Galactica. Just like it is. <br /> <br /> Now Starbuck managed to work one of them in the first season, which was hardly believable in itself, but he had to run it out of orbit before contacting Galactica. The Bulldog has to program his ship so that it makes hyper-space through several jumps and manages to reach Galactica somewhere in the thousands of years away, in an unknown direction. How can he program a ship that contains entirely foreign technology? Cylinders connect to their computers by touching, no visual console or keyboards. And how did he manage this strange thing, how does he know where Galactica is, keeping in mind that Galactica rose about 3 years ago and is trying to evade Cylon ever since - it doesn't leave the beacons behind? This episode does not make any sense even if you allow all the sci-fi to show that disbelief is stopped.
