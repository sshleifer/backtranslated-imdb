The plot is very basic, but acceptable: a young US soldier who has studied Asian martial arts is using it well to protect her daughter and falls in love with her. Unfortunately, the three main players (soldier, girl, rebel) combined IQ 3: one point for a soldier, one for a girl, a large number of Ninja fighters have to share their third point so that they can lose against the former two.
