All dogs go to heaven with a unique, funny movie; The well-known talent who gave the voices gave the familiar figure to the adults mainly to the children. It was just interesting that adults would like to miss something children could watch. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ADGTH2 is a precious sequel that strives to make some cash by driving first. Charlie Sheen is a satisfying replacement for Burt Reynolds in this second film and Sheena Easton's voice in some movies that are cute, but forgotten songs make her to celebrate it together. Add Dom DeLuise in the first movie and you think it would be a decent mix to make this sequel at least relatively decent compared to the first one. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even with the addition of other good players like Bebe Neuwirth in Anabelle's terrible role, this movie cannot be saved due to the cruel production values ​​and animation skills (or lack of them) in the film. Terrible editing, voice synchronization, and flat spaces where the characters' mouth should move to the dialoug, but not combined to make this film an animation project for college trainees instead of a decent level that could have been. All in all, if you were a very big fan of the first movie, I'd give it a very big PASS.
