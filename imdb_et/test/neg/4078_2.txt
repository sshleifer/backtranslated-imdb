This movie is definitely there with the worst movies I've ever seen, probably in the top ten of my worst movies. I laughed once and it was when: <br /> <br /> EVAN: "im building something" Evan's secretary: "I hope it's a hairdresser" <br /> <br /> It was a word in the sense of the only time I laughed at this "comedy", terribly, compared to Bruce's omnipotence, which, as a great fan of Jim Carrey, was not so great! <br /> <br /> This film lacked humor in bearing God's power and touched more on family tying. Id class for this only family movie, certainly not for family comedy. <br /> <br /> Seeing that someone's shirt is on the tape is not fun, nor is it a beard that grows right back! <br /> <br /> I didn't even think the special effects were great, the animals seemed really stuck, it was like watching a movie that wasn't properly glued. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Movie - Avoid!
