I didn't expect much from the movie, so I'm not disappointed. Carrie looked ugly, Mr.. Big was eyebrow dyed and Samantha didn't say f ***. <br /> <br /> Charlotte's boyfriend was annoying to watch because he was in too many scenes - the title would have been easily "SATC: Older Night Out". The corners of the camera were not so good, especially on Carrie's face. <br /> <br /> There was a symbolic black woman whose character didn't have the right way out and there were too few opportunities for gay men who seemed to be thrown in some way. Samantha went back and forth from LA, capturing the story, especially when she came to Fashion Week and nothing happened. <br /> <br /> The film seems to have been done in a hurry because it might have been good, but the scenes were simply thrown out on different equipment or offered to viewers without a jump. movie story.
