Scanning through the comments does not seem like much love for this movie, and it's not very difficult to see why it's a garbage. <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that in the aftermath of finished Donald Pleasance's death (Dr Loomis), the product hurt somehow. It demanded the return of the movie summary to the Creator who bought the farm, and took away what was supposed to be a double twist with the mysterious "black" michael swaps and I don't mean Johnny Cash. /> <br /> Now the story. The fifth film ended up quite unsatisfactorily with Micheal Myers, who escaped from prison with mysterious black. It turns out (agh) that this man knows Michea's evil origin and is also Dr. Loom's colleague named Dr Wynn. They also kidnapped Jamie Lloyd (played by Danielle Harris in the 4th and 5th parts, but JC Brandy played here). Pregnant, Jamie escapes from Dr. Wynn's nest and so Micheal follows her and kills her. But he had a boy, so now he has to watch the child so he can kill his great nephew. <br /> <br /> We hear a ridiculous explanation of Michael's evil associated with Gaelic languages ​​and mysterious symbols. For some reason, the radio show is sent from Michelle's home, which gives Micheal some unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film, as this review is vague, confusing, and outrageous, has a very endless end. <br /> <br /> Some sexual scenes and nudity. Poor plot, penetrating effect, which is some good factory defeat, but lack of motivation. Because what had to explain everything was just a few new questions, Parts 4 and 5 made sense and was a painstaking opportunity for a great actor in Pleasance to end his life and career.
