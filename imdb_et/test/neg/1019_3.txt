This movie is really DIFFICULT, with no appealing or worthy comment, except for beautiful settings: Chilean landscape. I know I have to make four lines to comment on this movie, but the thing is that it is such a bad film that I can only say it's actually BAD. Michael Ironside is the only one who saves money on film.
