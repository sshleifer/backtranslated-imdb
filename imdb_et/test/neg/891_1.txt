I am also a House Party Fan ... House Party I is my favorite movie of all time. House Party 4 is a disgrace to all HP and Kid n Play ... It was supposed to be part of the series. playing boy n was probably too old to be a home party movie b / c focused on teenagers. But the boy's play could have at least made the cube look ... you can tell how good it was in b / c it didn't even bring to cinemas. The immature was in House Party 3, so they had the idea of ​​continuing the legacy ... but they should have represented it right ... they should have left this House Party 3. I'm 27 years old and I've been looking at House I because I was 11 when he came out in 1990 (16 years ago) and I've been a fan ever since. When I first saw House Party 4, I was like they were actually thinking ... There was nothing familiar about this movie that was compared to the previous 3 films. I thought it was black Ferris Bueller holidays.
