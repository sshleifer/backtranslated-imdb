Combining a serious drama with enough comedy is difficult at the best times. THE EXCHANGE OF CULTURE IN THE Muslim World drew it thanks to the current topic and fantastic script; not to mention the excellent nature of Albert Brooks. However, the HOUSE OF THE YEAR cannot be compared. This is a dirty message that has been put together with forced jokes and a twisted love story that is absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> Initially, the assumption seemed very promising. Put a comedy news guy like Jon Stewart to the President of the United States and see what happens. This independent runner is Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams, RV), a successful television personality who has put pressure on his audience. With him comes his leader Jack (Christopher Walken, CLICK) and his writer Eddie (Lewis Black). Tom Dobbs seems to be able to successfully drive very little. <br /> <br /> But was he? Eleanor Green (Laura Linney, EMILY ROSE EXORCIST) is a computer that has chosen new software for electronic voting in polling stations. He finds that there is a malfunction in the system that the business owner and his dark lawyer Alan (Jeff Goldblum, INDEPENDENCE DAY) are hitting down quickly. Being ready to lose billions of dollars, the company's evil men decided to fail and / or kill Eleanor to never tell anyone. But Eleanor is able to become President-elect Dobbs and finally beans (this is where the incredible love story begins to bloom). Dobbs goes on Saturday night and explains everything in the world, eliminating himself as a newly elected president and ending his career as a computer company ... oh, and saving Mrs. Green's life. <br /> <br /> Does it sound funny? Comedy is definitely a story and often uncomfortable. Robin Williams shines for a few moments during the debate, but has quickly used it when he becomes a president. <br /> <br /> The film's message is interesting and controversial: the presidential candidates have a special interest. I'm sure there is a significant truth in it and if you wanted to make a movie about it. If you wanted to do comedy, you could do it. But the man of the year is not it.
