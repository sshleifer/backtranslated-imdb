Last week I got it on the IFC and thought it was a typical short short film: hard in style, with little content and originality. Surprisingly, the upcoming movies will mark an unusually attractive (and blonde) boy with 70s shag hair and too cool-school-clothes? Plus, this movie is gathering in the late 1970s chic, which works for some (Sofia Coppola's "Virgin Suicides" to remember), but not for its director. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer compared it to Harmony Korine's work and I agree. However, I do not see this as a positive thing (which has been done recently by HE?). "Bobbycrush" is really just a waste of time and energy for everyone involved. If you happen to see it on a cable night late at night, turn off the channel and see something else.
