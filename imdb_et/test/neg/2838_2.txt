Now, let me see if I have this right, the deadly serum killer goes around the murders of real estate agents ... okay, which is wrong with this scenario, I can live with it. <br /> <br /> What Next Did Tax Inspectors Slip? Are traffic managers killed? Should we feel any sympathy for an empty head and a low financial obsession with people? Er ... no. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, aside from joking, it's not just a very well made film that has poor performance and a crude product, weather conditions are particularly stupid. The screaming of the director can almost be seen in the "window work" when he falls through the window glass. <br /> <br /> When another reviewer rightly said after "The Fog's", this was a lower career for Adrienne Barbeau. That's why I was glad he had revived it by becoming Catman's voice in Batman's animated series, watching the Catwoman movie apps of the live action. NB! Of course, this is not an amazing film that has been made. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie, I think "Kojak" or "San Francisco Streets" is a bad episode and you get an insight into what is offered here.
