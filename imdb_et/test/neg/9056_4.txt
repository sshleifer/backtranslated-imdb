Personally, I didn't really get much from one eye alone. I've noticed a lot of really appreciated reviews for the film here and I'm surprised. Maybe I missed something that other reviewers "knew", but found the movie quite annoying and basically pointless. <br /> <br /> The "action" movie is a series of autopsy filmed in "art-house" style - many extreme close-ups, strange editing, and more. and without sound or dialogue. <br /> <br /> I think seeing one's own eyes can be a study of human anatomy, or perhaps (if you really want to dig a little) some comment on human uncertainty or any place - but I found it personally semi-interesting, but in the end of eternal departure. If that's your thing, it's a winner for you. As for me - I've seen interesting ER materials. It's not a "bad" movie because it's not really a "movie" in any traditional sense - I found something really significant about it - 4/10.
