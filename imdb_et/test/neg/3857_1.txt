I can't believe there are people who voted 10 for this garbage! Did anyone of you get access to the madhouse computer where you have undoubtedly survived, or is there a special colony where secretly secret people are being imprisoned, which I don't know? <br /> <br /> When I was saying what I was really thinking about this movie, none of it would come out. <br /> <br /> First of all, this "star" has no talented idiot acting like a bad impersonator by Jim Carrey. Angel dust his nose to restore the Sahara Desert. Her name is a complete guarantee that I will not watch her upcoming movie - even if she plays a crowd of hidden rocks. <br /> <br /> Concerning the 'plot'. Another crime we can accept the Nazis is that they were so terrible that they could be considered a fair game, like baddies, as it is; criminals and murderers alone would be a trick to the audience. <br /> <br /> For filmmakers - stop making movies and if not, limit your ads to making your efforts at least in the short term. <br /> <br /> Finally, IMDB is criticized - why don't you have the chance to vote for a Zero movie? Or maybe not. To express my contempt for this fear, I must then vote double with zero or something.
