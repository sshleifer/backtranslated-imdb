It might have been a great flick. But as many others think this is the case, it has been badly done due to language transmission. If the whole movie is to be read, it takes away from the movie and becomes something else. I think this is a very good rating and I couldn't rent it. But when I did, it was a real shoot. Oh, here in Boardman, Ohio, there was nothing like English. This movie was also compared to Dark Hours and we can't see it in Boardman, Ohio. It's not available. So I think we never know how good a movie really was.
