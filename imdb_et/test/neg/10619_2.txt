Now this is a bad movie when I've ever seen it. One of the biggest years of the film in 1999, Detroit Rock City claims to be in junkies with the Runaway Bride and Wild Wild West. The plot is masterful. Four butterfly high school students finally have the chance to see the KISS Stage Theater for the third year in a row. So, when their tickets are attacked by a clergyman, a chain smoker, the boys are screaming at Detroit and I'm sure you can find out. <br /> <br /> Well, not exactly; the film goes into extreme action, explaining how four band members (not, not Gene, Paul, Ace, and Peter) go to get these tickets: lose their virginity in confession; rescuing smoked stools and mother Volvo (from Stran Schirripa of Soprano); to prevent abduction in the middle of a 12-year debt; and, of course, removing MC Ron Jeremy from his bare basic principles with a complete mixer with bourbon remnants. Sounds funny, isn't it? Perhaps, in Detroit Rock City, this is the reason why in extreme cases these fans can go. And we understand that this movie is comedy; it should be inflated. But is Detroit Rock City's target for the right audience? It's rated R, which is the only way predecessors - the audience, as I see it, which many eventually end up raging this classic voyeur under illegal conditions. <br /> <br /> Detroit Rock City also fails to touch the late 1970s. The quality of the camera's texture is too clear and too bright; there are no such films as Spine Tap and Sid & Nancy. This would have allowed the audience to feel more at home at times. Just in costumes for kids before the 90s wear and other disco infernos not do the trick. Environment means something you know; I doubt Detroit saw it as beautiful in the 78's. If there is something positive about this film, it is a stone of the late 70s in the early 1970s. Van Halen, AC / DC, you name it, it's all here. Of course, we cannot forget KISS, a band that is subtly subordinated. <br /> <br /> What the film is not able to do is to ask why the knights of serving Satin (this is really just KISS) were so frightened to moms around the nation. Of course it can be a loud stone and a damn makeup; young people also encourage themselves to explore and investigate on time. But what does KISS say in the music that we hear in this movie for the ultimate rebel group? What separates these anthems from "night and roll" all night and everyday life from the rest of the music? These questions are likely to remain in the music communication class, not in the movies that should respond to them, just because it is KISS and they are rocks and we have to do everything our God has forgiven to see. 1.5 / 5 stars
