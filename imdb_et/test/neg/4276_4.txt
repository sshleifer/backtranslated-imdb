All the action is pointless. Why make a movie at all? The lighting is strange, but the sound is just a joke. Like high school production. Anyone who puts the budget for this movie should be pulled out and released quarterly so that it can be made available without a suitable budget for the speakers without suitable devices. <br /> <br /> So many conversations are incomprehensible due to echo or echo. lack of microphone proximity. The economy should have happened elsewhere. The whole production is inanimate and just LAME with such an amateur semi-production. It has no heat, no clarity and no design.
