I adore Hedy Lamarrat. I think he was very little appreciated as an actor in the 40s. He was the Nastass and Kinski of this era, and the critics didn't take him seriously. Having said this movie is BORE. When I first looked at it, I was not only a story but a makeup and costume for the lack of shocked continuity. Hedy makeup becomes a picture. So hair length and style. Reason: There were so many writers and so many stops and it starts to be amazing that they have released it at all. His "Trop Lady" started filming after it started, but it appeared before "I take this woman." In fact, it was known in Hollywood as "I'll take this woman again." It should tell you something. I am also a fan of Spencer Tracy, but he is absolutely sharp here. I have read about a different film history that he absolutely made Hedy Lamarr bad, and it looks quite obvious on the film. No one chemically. The story rolls around after the reel and eventually rolls very strangely. I can't recommend it at all.
