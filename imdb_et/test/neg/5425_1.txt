I can't say I was surprised at this cruelty when I looked at it a couple of months or weeks ago (don't remember). I saw it as a two-part episode of Zoey 101 because they just showed it in Canada. <br /> <br /> I was incredibly annoyed by Makeover Nerd, this is just an example of how unacceptable, ignorant superficial, negative, biased, and stereotypical people in the entertainment industry are, and frankly, extremely annoyed. It wasn't funny at all. Nerd is a stereotype and it makes people very insulted. Secondly, Zoey 101 people have no real problems. Logan has a big house, he has a famous father, he has everything and Zoey is also rich. They will never have to deal with the things that modern twins and teenagers have to deal with, such as mutual pressure and stereotypical problems. Participants are also terrible. Jamie Lynn Spears does not deserve to be as successful on television as Zoey 101 (which is wrong in the world?), She has no talent as an actor. In fact, he's worse than Britney! Chase and Zoey's thing was incredibly predictable, I mean, how could you go ahead with Zoey and Chase dating? What other problems could they have? Except that Chase can't get the girl she wants, everything is perfect! Absolute worse 48 minutes watching my TV. Never. 0/10 (and it's generous)
