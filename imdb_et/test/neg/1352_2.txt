To say I was disappointed is an understatement. Professional Amateur Movie. I had left the theater two or three times (something I never did) Cloris Leachman really stopped. He's really speaking, the only thing I should say. These new women are less modern than those of the 30's George Cukor. These are "acting", that we try to be with it, but their "conflict" is exactly the same as always in the movies. The fun of the original was a crisp, vitriotic and very funny script. Mastery and unique casting. Everything here is missing elements. TV actors who mix with models and Oscar nominees / winners. There was nothing organic there. The whole thing seemed to be erected at the improvised moment without a clear purpose. 2/10
