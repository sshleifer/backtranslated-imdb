Okay, I'm sorry for this review for me and the team, but this movie is by far the worst I've ever seen ... First, the actor was okay. It may be better (especially in some parts) but it was "okay". Then there was the cheapest camcorder they used. The violence was pretty good. If it were faster, it would be fantastic, but they wouldn't be forced to (* sigh) ... Scare. The fears were well written (script), but not well done. For example ... (SPOILER HERE!) On the floor there is a girl half way and the other half is in the barn house at the bottom, then she gets it. Monster puts him down and you hear someone encourages you. Fears could have been better if the music was not ripped from a cheap horror audio CD. The blood effect was pretty good, but the blood was like "Kill Bill". K.B. pulled it off because it had to resemble old kung-fu movies, but if the team can't distinguish red pink .... it's sad. The ripped bodies of the film were good, but the costumes of the peacocks were something you would see at $ 25 in a Halloween shop. Don't let the cover fool, the costumes suck! My overall rating is 3/10. If you are interested in independent movies, you are easily satisfied or just pay 3 bucks in your pocket, go to Blockbuster and see the horror of horror.
