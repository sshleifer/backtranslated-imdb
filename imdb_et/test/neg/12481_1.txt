This last day of the Fulci Schlocker is a completely exhausting game about the incurable player (Brett Halsey), who decides to pay his ever-growing debts in the style of a regular ring, discouraging some of the toughest women you will ever see and who are just wealthy widows! Fulci-penned also wrote some black comedy elements, which resulted in just a few inconvenient business activities, which include a dead body that does not survive, an opera singer who does not let the song, etc. The Doppelganger theme directly from PRAGI STUDENT - although in this case two people communicate via pre-recorded radio messages !! Finally, I cannot say that I am surprised that this film does not indicate the complexity of Mario Bava HATCHET's HONEYMOON (1970), which is similar in many ways, and that it is only satisfied with tougher (but not overly convincing) broken limbs and the effect of split or melting faces that, unfortunately, Fulci had been fully associated with.
