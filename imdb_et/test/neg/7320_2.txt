I had great hopes for this hope after reading the DVD: "In the spirit of American Pie and Animal House ..." After I suffered it, I realized I was just flying for $ 2.50. This movie started slowly and just slower ... the short and short moments of the moments proved that it was in the spirit of American Pie when you think of "dead" as a dead thing. not very fun or fun! Don't be fooled as I was and wait for something hard to watch because this movie will reduce you more than entertainment. "You have to fill three more lines for this stupid movie that doesn't deserve the effort ... what a stupid piece of ignorant sloppy. This movie set up, even a short nudity to suck!
