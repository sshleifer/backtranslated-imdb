I think this movie was made upside down, first they shoot a lot of scenes and action and explosions, and then the story writers worked to find a story that links all the scenes together. this movie is undoubtedly the worst film I've ever seen, your average porn movie is equipped with a much better written and much more coherent script. There's no point in the movie. Seriously, even if you are a Segal fan, there is no reason why you should never see this movie unless you are one of those people who want to stare at accidents because it is a terrible accident and should never be released to this world . <br /> <br /> Boran.
