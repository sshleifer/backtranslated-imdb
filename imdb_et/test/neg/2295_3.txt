This Swedish film tries to parody / imitate American horror films like "The Evil Dead", "Gremlins" and others. Writer / director / actor / operator Anders Jacobsson and writer / producer / actor / make-up director Göran Lundström (what did I not know?) Is obviously inspired by Sam Raim. However, camera work is a bad copy of what can be seen in "Evil Dead" and elsewhere. Some other users have written that they enjoyed the humor of this movie, but I didn't. <br /> <br /> Film rather than disturbed me. It tries to combine arbitration and comedy, and the final product just left me in oppression, although it wasn't scary or shocking at all. The combination of different genre elements made this movie very strange. I was never sure if it was to be scary or funny. <br /> <br /> The story is quite inventive, except for the showdowns in the hospital, but I didn't like how it was staged for the reasons mentioned above. Gore & make up effects are remarkably good and at least "Loose Limbs" sequences were quite fun, because in these scenes, the filmmakers did not try to interfere with fears and jokes. <br /> <br /> All the strange movie you hate or love. Rest on the pieces, Evil Ed. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 3/10 (put me on American productions)
