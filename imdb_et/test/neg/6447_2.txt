I appreciated it better than terribly because I liked to see Jonathon Buffy again - even if it had the same role. <br /> <br /> First of all, the concept is cute for the short, but not for the whole film. Writing was forced and animated. I have the feeling that the film has suffered most during the editorial. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Amanda Bynes always looks like her eyes cross - even if she doesn't try to do it. He's not just funny. She always plays some misfit girl who triumphs with herself - ironic, given that Amanda always seems to be a caricature. I would like to see him serious. I really want to give him a chance, but he's always cast into those trickling roles where he laughs and makes a face and somehow it's good? <br /> <br /> Finally, the whole "I'm Dork" segment hanging from Nerds' revenge. There was nothing unpredictable in this movie. <br /> <br /> Shame, shame, shame.
