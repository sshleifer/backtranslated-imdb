As a professional poker reseller, I've found this movie very difficult to watch for over 25 years. Too unreal. It seems that the producers of this film had little or no research or just interest. Card tricks are something you will never see in a real poker game. Common sense is right? In addition, it was full of movie cuts during gimmicks. Who couldn't do it? Cheating was an amateur. Palming, labeled cards, etc. Would you sit up in the game where they use open deck cards? Would you sit in a game where players push their chips in the middle of the pot (constantly), then blending them just by verbalizing how much they bet? C'MON! I gave it to 4 because the turns may be interesting for some people, but for those who can play the game it is quite painful. Next time they should use real players and get an overview of how to do it right. OUCH !!!
