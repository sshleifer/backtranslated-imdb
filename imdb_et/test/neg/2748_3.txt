Before I saw this movie, I heard some negative comments on it. But looking at this, I found myself thinking "ok, it's a bit slow, but it's pretty interesting." In the end, it created a complex moral dilemma that led to a shocking, completely credible decision in the context of the film, with extremely powerful dramatic consequences. Had it been followed, it would have been a tremendously powerful ending and would have given me a very good impression of the film. <br /> <br /> But due to the ending, which not only fails to hold emotionally, it is an unnecessary happiness that ends without real emotional credibility, but there is absolutely no point in the film context as you can clearly see that one of them is engaged in activities that should end his life, but inexplicable. By the way, please tell me if I miss something here, and that's why he survives because I just didn't know how it would logically, and it shattered the whole movie for me. <br /> <br /> That said, all three alliances have entered powerful performances, although the transformation of Kevin McKidd's characters will go a little further if it is completely convincing and creates a very powerful ethical triangle. <br /> <br /> This movie is recommended when you are ready to walk when your mother and sister lie down. But don't look beyond that if you have not only salt but several mountains.
