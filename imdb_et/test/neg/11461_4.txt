This continuation above - and the final entry into the "Kharise" series is somewhat more enjoyable, but it is also more natural (hell, we even get the bar / hostess of the song!): Peter Coe is easily charismatic about a number of Egyptian high priests we saw in these films , and Martin Kosleck, if his henchman seems uninteresting in the proceedings; Kurt Katch is a ridiculous accent, because a man who discovered the newly redesigned Princess Ananka: the latter, Virginia Christine (later much used as an actor of the character), becomes her most important role and indeed her order of resurrection is not only the film but the whole. series highlighting. Unfortunately, here too, Chaney has little to do, because once again the emphasis is on Ananka, as I said; his mommy (whom he most often returned to alongside Universal, of course, the role of Wolf Man's signature) undoubtedly remains his most memorable studio monster.
