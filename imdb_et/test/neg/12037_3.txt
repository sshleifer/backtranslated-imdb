Some movies you watch and say, "Well, it didn't make sense." And you don't mean that. You just say things were too complicated or somewhat absurd. <br /> <br /> "Bread and Circus" makes no sense at all. And I mean it. And this is not because it is surreal. From the very beginning, it is quite clear that this is a weak excuse for breaking special effects. No script. No plot. There is no story. One event does not refer to the following - it is how bad the writing is. <br /> <br /> So what? I mean, there are movies that fall into this category. They want you to show gore, they give you gore. Why even talk about it? <br /> <br /> Because in this case "Bread and Circus" gave hope. Okay, there are some surreal elements. Vaginas, down - people climbing out of them. Earth, in space, two feet on each side. These images are wonderful, fun, bizarre and crazy. But the film does nothing with them. <br /> <br /> Things happen, the movie ends and it's all very happy. I suspect the script was compiled on the fly. Damage. If there was any kind of story, it would have made a much more fun movie. <br /> <br /> The film is very similar to the beautiful car you would like to own. Then you get up the hood and there's no engine. Just a little guy riding a bike. <br /> <br /> GRR!
