El Padrino: The Latin godfather - although it seems to be a direct DVD / video-type movie, my copy of the copy is obviously cut - so apparently this flick had some sort of performance. And the character of the title seems to be more Gringo than moi (I'm half Honduras). Pretty typical rise and fall of the drug film with the list of B-list participants - Robert Wagner (drug lawyer), Kathleen Quinlan (crusading judge), Tiny Lister (mob enforcer), Gary Busey (child attack), Brad Dourif (white power jailbird), Stacey Keach (Gun Governor), Joann Pacula (Dead Milf), Faye Dunaway (Attorney), and Galo Make Canote as a Non-Credited Party Visitor. This movie is pretty flat, I watched this only time to kill time Skins - the only thing rescued it, was Jennifer Tilly, who was a crazy Latina drug killer - she was up and sexy-skanky that was fun to watch her scenes.
