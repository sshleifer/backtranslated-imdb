Extremely slow movie. There are great performances from all parties, so over 5 scores.Surya and Jyo should be this ideal husband and wife and we'll show it until it reaches the point where you ask if there's a story. One day, Jyo Surya will find a diary to find the story of his failed college love. The love story of the college is absolutely convincing, because Surya is a lofty parent who always chooses Bhomika, wins her friend, punishes her openly and despite being frightened by her falling in love with her. have been able to understand the foolish character of Bhoomika, I do not believe that any self-respecting woman will fall into the real life of such breeds. Jyo decides to bring them together and what happens after that is a climax. The story is extremely weak in its characters. Extremely arrogant Surya Bhoomika is exactly the opposite of Jyo (and there is no reason for an unexpected change). From a very flat Bhoomika becomes a great extrovert when he returns. if he were so sure he didn't try to find his love because he wasn't afraid of anyone.
