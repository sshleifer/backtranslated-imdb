I keep this tongue so that here goes: 1. Very poorly written. 2. Trying to be like Resident Evil. 3. Zombies slow and obedient one minute next minute Raging lunatics. 4. Never saw blood so easy to clean! 5. Special effects are not as good as the original "living dead day". 6. Not as good as "bold and beautiful". 7. It seemed that it was written within one week and made next week. <br /> <br /> Basicaly Med team plus special forces will go to Zombie's infected university to find the first Zombie and extract serum to cure the plague. Everyone dies, except for the 2 main deadlines that are so predictable, even if they are armed and lurking with the 100th zombies they lived on. But the special forces (who were trained on the nursery school scouts) took only 1 zombie to kill them, even though they had weapons. Also a mandatory jerk at your fingertips to fill the gaps. Total load of garbage.
