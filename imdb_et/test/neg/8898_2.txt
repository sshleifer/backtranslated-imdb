Although I rarely agree with the film crown, I have to say that this movie is not terrible, but did not care for me at all ... and it all seemed inappropriate ... it was its moments ... three or four of them that made me beating ... but most of the time I just sat down and wondered why? Why did the characters do it? even the Hot Shot characters were more thoughtful and refined ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a nice Norrland movie, check out Punk. There were more than random ethnic groups who just knew each other's shooting at the Swedish tundra ... <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed ...
