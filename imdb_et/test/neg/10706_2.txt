They used the materials of some real protests related to some women who spoke of a society where there were no men to see how these people rejoice for the "gendercide" of men. The funny thing is that you see a man who wants his own death. <br /> <br /> OK, plot. Some women say there should be a society without men, and the crowd in front of him (which includes some men) thinks this is a great idea. Then all the men or something will be killed. So it is no longer. <br /> <br /> This blonde scientist then creates a human, but removes some chromosomes so that he cannot be violent. The man is growing very fast and soon he will be an adult man. Not long after, he takes a blonde beetle from Volkswagen and drives to the city where he discovered. Now you think a single man in a city with lesbians would be the happiest man, but not in any way. The police are pursuing him. <br /> <br /> I didn't look at the rest, but it probably ends up having to ride with the clock and some people, or probably something bad happens. Somehow, the man comes to another man who wants him to lead. These brave warriors, who hide in the stadium, may have had some kind of plan that provided details of how they freely release their hands from a planet full of women, but I didn't look. And not you shouldn't. <br /> <br /> If you're late and surfing the channels and it happens, don't look. Look at something besides that. Bowflex or women 's swimwear advertisements for women asking you to meet women like this in your area are your favorite entertainment. <br /> <br /> (Oh, there is this funny thing when they pull in their cars, I don't know what they did, they seem to have traveled really slowly and carefully, but then tried to compensate for the movie, but it just looks really weird.) <br /> <br /> The blonde girl was so cute and I'm generous, so ... 2/10.
