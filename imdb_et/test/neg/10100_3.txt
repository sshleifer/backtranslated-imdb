When Legends Die is a powerful, moving story of an orphaned Ute from India, who is going to become Tom Black Bull, a master champion. Raised in old ways, Tom is given the name of a white man and has to use the white man's language and ways to live in this world. For a meaningless role he is forced to do, Tom finds one thing to do, robbing horses, riding them in death, rodeos. The film features Richard Widmark, who is friendly with Tom and acts as his leader. Red is a drunk, who eventually dies, which is about where the movie ends. The real story is completely ignored, on the dark side of Tom Black Bull, who is developing as a horse killer in the rodeo arena. Oh, you should read the book, this movie doesn't come to a fair story.
