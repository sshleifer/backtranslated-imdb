A 10-year-old child in front of his parents claiming to drive a car and a surreal trip across America to find the maps of Motorama, a card station map game that if he can "Motorama", he has a chance to win $ 500 million . He meets several strangers along the way. No one can make a "fast culture", Joe Minion's previous "After Hours" achieved it with a merit and an amazing director, but it was not instant. But this movie is just odd to be strange. No rhyme or reason. The plot is at best random and seems to be present to show a variety of fires. It's not just a fun movie or a thoughtful one. It's just too much. I've heard many comparisons between this and David Lynch's films. It's a trick to heresy, even if Lynch's "worst" film (the worst in the quotes because he doesn't have bad movies) is still over that drecki. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Cynthia King is very short topless <br /> <br /> DVD accessories: Trailer for "Joe Dirt"
