(It may be a spoiler) <br /> <br /> When I first started this movie, I thought it was OK. The music was good and the bizarre dream I was willing to forgive, but the lack of the main character and all the other looks of this character made me watch the rest of this movie. (I know, totally useless.) At first, the music was nice and fit, I was thinking of some Gothic novels. But come on! Saxophone Music for the 19th Century Film? It didn't fit. This movie was completely boring and if you want to watch a good movie of the season or Austen doesn't rent a Northwest monastery! I'll give her 30%. 30% = unsuccessful grade!
