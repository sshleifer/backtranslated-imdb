I am usually a fan of Bruce Willis and despite having played a professional killer with a cold heart, I thought of him as the most attractive. This means that his character makes his professional activity so confusing, it is incredible that he has never been caught in the past. The plot is thin to pointless. The end was not less annoying and offensive to the fact that it could have been predicted about 20 minutes after the movie. <br /> <br /> ** Watch Spoilers ** In Hollywood morals, good guys always win some victims along the way, and bad guys die or are finally at least justice. The amazing insult of the film is the way our IRA terrorist, who has somehow become cozy, sensitive and sensitive, can walk into a new life. Like his former terrorist gambler (who is now a loving woman and mother). <br /> <br /> Who is the bigger villain? Former (and as many as we can say that he is not) a terrorist or hired assassin? I don't see much to choose between them - in real life or in the movie. <br /> <br /> This is the poorest film I saw this year.
