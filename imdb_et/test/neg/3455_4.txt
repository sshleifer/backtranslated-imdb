(Caution: several spoilers) <br /> <br /> One day, somewhere, it's a post-apocalyptic film that doesn't smell. Unfortunately, POSTMAN is not a movie, although I have to try to do it. <br /> <br /> Kevin Costner plays someone who is credited only with "postage". In fact, he is not a postman, but a traveler with a West American wasteland destroyed by an unspecified disaster. He trades in isolated villages, presenting Shakespeare. Suddenly, Costner's visit to the village visited by Costner and the leader of their evil Gen Bethlehem (Will Patton) descended into the Holbists, known as the Holnists, self-proclaimed Western warlords. After much misery and many efforts to break Costner's spirit, he escapes, ending with a long section of the film, which could have been said better three minutes ago. <br /> <br /> Now we finally come to the prime minister's premise: the escaped Costner finds an abandoned mail lift and sends letters to the nearest town, hoping to get food as a mailer. Several young villagers led by Ford (Larenz Tate) want to enter the postman that doesn't sit well with Bethlehem and his bandits, and Costner finds himself in a band of postmen between warlords and warlords. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​postmen and bad guys is not as ridiculous as it sounds. The Holnists depend on their livelihood for the fact that the villages they have come across are separated; The villagers could destroy one village but could not stand against all those victims. To connect, the villages have to communicate with each other and the mailing system would thus be a big step in the end of Holnists. So it really makes a lot of sense for Bethlehem to become medieval for our heroic posters. Unfortunately, the final defeat of Bethlehem is not due to the villages connecting him, but to the old waiting list, one-to-one blow between him and Costner. Similarly, communities have no real attempt to use posts together to solve these problems; all the letters seem to be the standard "Hi, Aunt Debbie" played for maximum sentimental value. <br /> <br /> POSTMAN is one of the most predictable films I've ever seen. Now, I am not purposefully trying to destroy movies to find out what happens next. But here we are talking about predictability that does not require effort; I just knew what would happen next, whether I wanted to know or not. After the lion has been prominently highlighted, the people, the Holnist bandit, who sought the escaped Costner's actions, are eating after the noise, and we are "shocked" when the lion eats for him. A large number of uninhabited villagers are rounded up and shot by a shooting group, and one of the villagers sings some famous last words before listening. The Covered Shape is shown to show exactly what everyone knew there will be: Bending the Costner to get the letter we got from the movie we saw earlier. One man tells Bethlehem that no, sir, you can't just take his wife; Bethlehem directs an unsuspecting rot, although he is the only person in the theater who is unsuspecting. <br /> <br /> But this is a rank, opposing sentimentality that actually overrides POSTMAN. Olevia Williams, who plays Costner's lover Abby, is the worst. She pours her heart material and gives her the best to make it natural and sincere. He's trying so hard, it's heart breaking. But no one could ever have drawn "I have a gift for you, Postimees ... You give hope, like it is in the pocket of candy," sounds like something, not the syrup they have. Another example is the scene where the installed Costner casts a small boy, ignoring his letter, but turning around, watching him seem to be five minutes, and then thunderstorms to get the letter. Why did Costner not take it for the first time? There is no real reason; it is just an artifice that tries and does not give us a feeling of elation, grabbing the child's hopes and then restoring them. <br /> <br /> Schmaltz and predictability connect at the end when Postman's shape appears. I sat down to think, "Please don't tell me they show shape and then cut the child's scene. Certainly it is too saccharin, even for this movie too clear." Then, unfortunately, the music swelled up and we really did tremble with a terrible little boy who smiled when his letter to the daughter of an adult adult, and I kept my head and thought, "Someone shoots me." It felt like I had 30 pounds of apple cake under the throat. <br /> <br /> Gen. Bethlehem is more of a decent villain than usual. Your standard apocalyptic villain is the most important, most difficult S.O.B. weather. Bethlehem has shown that it is not something of an inner man who tries to feel important when beaten by others. Although some of the threats are sacrificed, Bethlehem is believable so that most of the rogues are not. Unfortunately, Will Patton crosses. And while we are told early that Bethlehem completely destroyed his last challenger within five seconds of fighting, Bethlehem's actual fighting skills at the end of the film are completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> is otherwise pretty good. Costner has done better, but his Razzie was overreacting. As mentioned, Olivia Williams is very impressive. Larenz Tate when Ford does sincere and reliable work. The James Newton Howard score is competent, albeit short for epic standards that the film had taken. But this is not enough to record this movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 ****.
