Help, I've come to cinema hell! What is a totally stupid movie? Actually, there is nothing good about it. <br /> <br /> Let's spit out: <br /> <br /> 1) The story is incredibly far removed: the anti-EU terrorist group is driving a number of boys who travel through Western Europe, where they are full of xtc pills delivery of bags. The worst thing is: they are serious about it! <br /> <br /> 2) The level of action should be very embarrassing for all the faces involved. 3) Some money-eyed boys decided to let everyone speak English to keep the international market. Most ad ever! French and Dutch native speakers who speak intelligently do everything but make sense and the result is ridiculous. 4) The soundtrack is completely misplaced and incorrectly selected. <br /> <br /> 5) Camera, editing, and effects work should be in some way a style of film type, but hardly worth anything and it is not meant to accompany this story (read anti-story). <br /> <br /> 6) Hidde Maas. The Wildschut hero can never convince. Real actor. Normally I would give an extra point just because he is around. But no, sorry, not this time, I'm just not sorry for my self ...
