C'était complètement minable: à fuir absolument! <br /> <br /> It was an idiotic attempt to destroy the classic source material and succeed it! <br /> <br /> Don't look at this movie unless you want to break your ten euros and pull up your nostrils with a bunch of frighteningly sleepy signs. <br /> <br /> This type of film clearly illustrates the gap that still divides managers and audiences. If an individual (a heavenly ban in the sky could have imagined this thrill), it would have been attentive enough to look at the version currently being played in French cinemas, it would have had to suffer what I had to endure, and deliberately rewrite it or just demolish it at all. The vein of adult humor that is mined here is, in my opinion, back to Fritz's cat, but it lacks the avant-garde status of that movie, or even the social comment of that base. <br /> <br /> Upgrading and increasing dependence on existing source materials to finance storytelling these days, one could hope to have a snow-white pick and therefore don't have to worry about signs or a radically new story, would have allowed more time, oh I don't know interesting animation, smarter jokes, maybe a single movie that has something to say and doesn't open its gap in the opening frame? <br /> <br /> Obviously terrible production.
