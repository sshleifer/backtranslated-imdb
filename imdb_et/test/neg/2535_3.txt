I think the problem with some of the reactions in this movie is that, with a few exceptions, it doesn't focus on the main exit, so the main sharing is public. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, those who have visual design, are pretty costumes and different elements of the movie. Some of the fans of children's films love color and animation and all the scary "magic" effects, animals exchanging images, etc. Some of the cultures, such as complicated references, layers of different folklore elements, and the fact that they can watch Zhang Ziyi's singing and quasi mimic in two different languages, which were supposed to be children's comedy. On the other hand, there are those who say that there should still be a point in the children's film that the mixture of folklore is not a story at all and that it is easier to believe in magic how much thought and care are available. technical aspects so that it is real. <br /> <br /> In other words, ideas can be nice; but if you put them on stage, they must play. Not here. <br /> <br /> A good folktale - from any country - has a clear story, a point, and characters that interact strongly. That's all there is. Some overly complicated gestures for opera, west, and japanese are not a substitute for a particular theme. <br /> <br /> As a fantasy fan, I have to say that I've been sitting through some turkeys and loved some, but it really tries to do too many things - inexpensively. Zhang Ziyi's entry to try to add a little shine to the exotic flower syndrome. Another problem is that there is no plot there; there is half a plot, which means you keep yourself open, then fell again when another dance number that is too sharply executed starts. <br /> <br /> All the characters know they are starring in the movie. If you don't like watching other people's amateur videos, then that's not good. I would like to try this for real children; I think they would fall into the sky upright in about 20 minutes.
