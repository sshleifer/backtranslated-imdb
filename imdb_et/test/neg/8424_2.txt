Forget all the angry documentaries! This movie is really a comedy about a 40-year-old porn star whose goal in life is to sing junky circuit songs. The only problem? Colton Ford can't sing! And the film cuts off when it seems to be ready to break the song. But Ford and equally couched boyfriend Blake Harper are grieving and squirting and running around their tanks, deciding to make dreams come true. Even "funny" is Kyle, who seems to have I.Q. laughed and whose collagen injected lips look like a bee. How can adult men be so confident? Bwa ha ha! For documentaries, filmmakers do not seem to have any POVs and the film is poorly structured and wildly uneven. There is very little background information on the three wires. Such involvement could have made these three seem to be nothing more than outdated West Hollywood stereotypes.
