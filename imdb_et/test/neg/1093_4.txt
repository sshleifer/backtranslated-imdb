I don't know if this extraordinarily boring film was meant to be an informal continuation of the "French Community", but it has the same drawbacks: the script is so confusing that the viewer remains intact and feels out of the picture and the direction is so cold, so little energy, that even a big chase can't kick things up (* 1/2)
