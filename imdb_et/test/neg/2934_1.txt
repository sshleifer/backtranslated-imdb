In & Out made me vomit. I've never seen such a shameless movie! He was serious about saying that gay is something wonderful and joyful, but has no idea how to say it. For me, this comedy was not as cruel as sick joke is to laugh when the victim falls for it. <br /> <br /> What I saw, this film had four (4) major bugs starting with (A) Matt Dillion's character when he announces to a world that is a former teacher, Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) gay. Do not forget how incredible it is that the character of Matt Dillion was won by the Oscar for what seemed like a serious role on the brink of cracking. But why does he say that? After all, it was never a problem with Howard's students, his friends, his family, or his finace. Someone. Why does he say something like this when it wasn't true? What's more, why doesn't the film give us an answer as to why he said it? The reason is that there is no answer and there is no offer for the convenience of the plot. Another (B) mistake is that the film seems to have forgotten homosexuality - attractiveness and sexual relationship with the same sex members. In this film, it is said that gay music is pleasant for Barbara Streisand's music and passionate about literature. It's all based on stereotypes! <br /> <br /> Both of these shortcomings are again met when it must be visible to believe. Matt Dillion discovers torture in this small town and the film seems to be ready to let us know what made him say such a thing. When he arrives at the ceremony, he says nothing, and I was wondering why he was there at all. He didn't solve anything. When the whole audience had to say they were gay, I was so moved that I wanted to throw it! These people stood at Howard when they were gay, defending all these stereotypes. What the movie forgot was that they used these stereotypes to show why Howard was gay. The filmmakers just shot themselves on foot! But wait, there's more! <br /> <br /> During the ceremony (C), it seemed that Howard was in the process of losing a job as a teacher because people believed he was influencing his students gay. What the film was trying to say is that homosexuals NEVER be recruited and would not affect their students. But did we not see the endless pressure of Tom Sellec's character over and over for Howard, even when he suddenly kissed him to come out of the closet if I didn't think the cabinet would come out? This clearly shows that homosexuals are able to recruit. Again, the movie lets itself go. <br /> <br /> And (D) when Howard came out of the closet, did anyone notice how the scenario was closed for the rest of the movie? I only read three lines he had later: "Yes!" to his parents, "Hi there!" for the student and "Are you ready?" Tom Selleck before the last vomiting scene. I can be one, but the thing is, he's not allowed to tell us what made him decide he's gay. I wanted to know what was on his head, because I never thought he was gay. <br /> <br /> As with bonuses, the movie also includes a number of truly offensive scenes. One where Howard asks the priest for a confession to get advice on what to do to a friend (his) who is related and not yet a relative to his groom. "Does it make him gay?" he asks. The priest replied "Oh yes, he is definitely gay". Uh ah. Or in a scene when all the old women gather, telling Howard's mother she doesn't have to saddle her son's deep, dark secret because well ... all of them. Then one of the ladies admitted she had never seen "Madison County bridges". Funny? No! The film shows that it is insensitive and has no idea how one of its members can be gay. I know. I have several friends who are gay and none of their families took it at all. It was a bad way to dispel the whole situation. <br /> <br /> The last shoulder for me was the last scene that gave them the appearance that Tom and Kevin were married. The camera set off very slowly on the front of the church when ... It wasn't what you thought! I was very nasty about this point and I could never forgive this hurt joke. I have nothing about gay or homosexuality. "Philadelphia" and "Longtime Companion" were very honest and real what they had to say. "In & Out" is just screaming for political correctness, but it has no idea about corruption at its center. The movie is that if you're 99% straight and 1% gay, which means you have a pointless doubt, you're the final game. It's like gayness is becoming a dominant feature of genetics. In reality, if everyone were to tell you over and over again that you were worthless and stupid, you would believe it in the end, isn't it? It happened to Howard Brackett to be gay. I left the theater sad and angry. Angry all weekend, actually. It was a serious ill and cruel film, 1997.
