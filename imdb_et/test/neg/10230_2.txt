I loved the first movie, the other was okay, disappointed John Clees was no longer a jean bob because he's my favorite character. But the third ... what happened to the animation ??? Looks like a small budget like sitting in the morning for a comic! except for the setback taken from the first movie. They should have stopped after number 2, it would make the rest of the rest bad! Derek's voice has changed, but it's not as recognizable as Jean bob. I also don't understand where Rothbart came from. I thought he was dead! This movie made me want to turn it off, as much as I love the first one, I was very disappointed with this contribution. They never take the original! :)
