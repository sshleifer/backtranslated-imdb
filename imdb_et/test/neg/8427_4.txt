I was sitting last night to see this movie being played on Greek television because I was hosted by Olympic Games in my city. Since this is an American film, I had been waiting for it to focus more on American athletes. And I was really ready. But what I saw was ... too much! I mean, if the film has such a title ("First Olympics: Athens 1896"), even if it is of American origin, you wouldn't expect it to be so propagating and at the same time unknown to athletes and efforts in other countries. American athletes seem to be all gifts of nature (strength, cleverness, generosity, kindness, politeness ...), unlike their "patturists". Games that seem to be able to even ... think or express feelings. The last hymns that are played during the movie must be the record of all time in filmography. ridiculous Greek people like Greek citizens who serve foreign marathon athletes with wine to help win local competitions. So much for the Olympic spirit. <br /> <br /> Think about it. and putting a bad sign on a movie that also has a Greek title doesn't make me happy according to what I've seen, I can't give more than 4 out of 10 (actually quite generous).
