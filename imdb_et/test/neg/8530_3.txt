Special theft previews are always a good time. No matter what movie you see, the theater is always offered by people waiting for the movie, like free stuff, I thought it would be something to do or just disappeared. Either way, no matter how good a movie is or not, the audience makes it alone. Now that the movie is a PG-13 pseudhorror film (do you really get into horror when MPAA is censoring everything on your back?), Then you know there is a quarrel, a laugh and a hold of the soul. With Messengers, the crowd is not disappointed in giving numerous outbreaks and warnings to characters on the screen. As far as the actual film is concerned, I feel sorry for the parties involved, because it would have been much better if it was right-handed and allowed to stretch the legs after the scary / fade-to-black / show movie. Ultimately, we have shown a boring, perfect story that has no surprises and some moments of actual tension. <br /> <br /> The story is general. After a traumatic event, the family moves from a big city to a country to try and communicate with each other. When he settled down, the spirits of the house come out with a reformed child, whose past makes it incredible for the parents to say anything to them. Of course, the baby does not cry out and those who are around will only know if it is too late. I credit Pang Brothers (recognized by The Eye leaders who would like to see more than they can do without Hollywood intervention? It is allegedly restarted by Messengers, but the brothers were under the credit for shame is that we The studio system does this for foreigners, especially when it was a creative independence that made the films that bring them in and not from the bottom down) a little fresh with the keeping of a truly suitable style and a tired plot line. Unfortunately, however, I have to give them credit for almost unbearable slowdowns. Like why I didn't like what lies below, I couldn't pull out a stretched tension that was so ridiculous. When our heroine and his brother stand in the hallway with their ghost, the scene lasts for about eight minutes until the end of the static, strange composition of close-ups and depth of field change, which ends absolutely nothing. Only after 84 minutes, I think it would have worked better, even shorter. <br /> <br /> In addition to the very effective opening sequence that includes the fantastic Jodelle Ferland (strangely playing boy) and the great atmosphere of credit, the only thing that captures the movie from perfect rubbish is the actor. Except for Penelope Ann Miller, who first made me wonder what happened to her, and then after a few scenes I realized why I didn't ask this question in the years she was missing, and Dustin Milligan, who lacks credibility, is very strong. Dyan McDermott does a great job when his father tries to save his family with hard times. She has many small moments of light comedy to fight her serious and dramatic role. William B. Davis (Everyone's Favorite Cancerman) is effectively used as an almost unpredictable character, unfortunately unused. Our real stars are Kristen Stewart and John Corbett. Stewart plays the emotions very well and shows her and her CV on her and as an actor on the Panic Room. As far as Corbett is concerned, he would have completely disassembled the film if he did not take his role. I want him to be given more work because I have enjoyed it because of the discounted series "The Visitor"? I still need to look at my first role in Northern Exposure, which I have not yet shown to be able to catch up. It's a shame that he's probably the most recognizable overrated My Big Fat Greek wedding. <br /> <br /> If anything, Messengers gave me a pleasant introduction to Pang Brothers' work and revived his desire to look at his Chinese horror directory. There was mood and performances; it was just a simple and free story that needed too much padding to make a movie. If they would rather have more symbols, but just Stewart, it could have been more effective, but also something else to show up for ten minutes of scenes. If our protagonist is the only one being attacked, there is no tension over how far the creatures go to harm him. At times of danger, they had no difficulty and until the end they really just filled. But I'm excited about the free comic book that has been given after a special screening, because hopefully the environment will allow a faster pace story that will try before surprise.
