This is a stupid movie. Like many of these karate movies, it is poorly written, uncomfortable, and sometimes just stupid. The action is not really all there and the film generally leaves much to be desired. Everyone here is talking about jive, doing bad karate and doing a very bad job. <br /> <br /> Look at the small role of Scatman Crothers, generally good for this movie. Jim Kelly is good at karate, but he is a terrible actor. Gloria Hendry is really bad. All these are, this film has so many parts that make no sense. Supposed love / running scene with Hendry and Kelly, what the hell was that? They destroyed this man's guitar without any reason! <br /> <br /> Then the trampoline girls were mandatory girls !!! Now what was it? They were in the movie for five seconds, then you never heard them again! Then the whole racially charged element of the movie is cool and all but it's going to go anywhere in this movie. As I said, it's a laugh once, but don't look at it again.
