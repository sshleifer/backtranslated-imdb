If you are a fan of fans with terrible correspondence, terrible action and clich√© after it is right for you. <br /> <br /> There are too many reasons for breastfeeding this movie. In short, people with a combined 100 trip to New Mexico for $ 200 million. And yes, they are all probably super heroes because they can do a lot of things like jumping on trains that travel 80+ mph, live a number of car accidents and endless visions of a direct artist and coyote. <br /> <br /> If you are a teenager or you don't want to think about a movie, it's for you. No actor outside Lovitz is at all credible. Lovitz records the movie with 1 Hitler bit. <Br /> <br /> 2/10 (save 2 hours of pain and $ 4)
