Drug Runner Archie Moses introduces his friend Rock Keats to his boss, Frank Colton, the drug kingpin. Without knowing Moses, Keats is actually a secret policeman. At the time of the Colton factory, Moses accidentally shot Keats. He lives on the wound and later arrests Moses. When attacking the assassins hired by Colton, the duo must fight for their mutual hatred to survive. <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler's films are usually a hit-and-miss affair, his comedies whether his fans love or all hate. It's not as stupid as his other movies, but he still can't overcome the lazy script. This direction is incredibly uneven, with quick steps to slow down the exchange of comics between Sandler & Damon Wayans. Some action scenes? Flying planes without engines run the car through the forest at night? is completely absurd in life. The exhibition is a standard for this genre, Sandler & Wayans makes a good tie. In short, the movie is stupid but fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Rating: C + Review by M. K. Geist
