As you remember, I have seen all three trilogys of the trash and the first film is the only one far from being traceable. The second part was a low-grade sewer, and this installment is a bit better than two but another steaming heap that I removed from my backyard last Monday. The premise is not why the cubes died the poorer lady, and even in 1921 I think someone would notice a lot of oily boys, where the sweet little old lady lived. Secondly, this scarecrow is pathetic compared to how cool they saw in the first movie. It's just old clothes and a boat bag. Let's face it, the series is garbage and must be forgotten. NOOSE!
