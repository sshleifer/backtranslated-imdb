An American who would expect to know a lot about rugby would be OK, because it would be an amazing movie for them. First he got from the heart, good morals, a typical good trainer trying to change a bad boy. HOW we are from rugby, this is the number one sport, it's a lifestyle that is only played by brave and victorious like heroes, as if the Americans had their baseball / basketball stars. I'm not quite sure if it was a cheap budget, or maybe the director or actors knew very little about rugby, and as a fan of the rugby I see all my life when some of the actors didn't even know that rugby existed before the movie. All in all, this movie was terrible for me. When you look at it and thought it was great, take the time to go online and maybe Google "All Blacks" this is New Zealand's national team and those who made the haka famous. Believe me they make Highlands boys a schoolgirl.
