Family. When the show was broadcast for the first time, it was fresh, original and actually quite funny. Now, I've finished watching it. It has become one of the worst on television, combining funny jokes, repeated, drawn jokes and the hope that the word "bitch" can be included in every joke. Seth Macfarlane has a clear problem and is clearly in front of the audience of 13-year-old boys. <br /> <br /> I just don't understand how something so funny, so different from anything else, can get into the terrible confusion of the "comedy" show. I've seriously heard about a better liner bottle comic. Is Seth Macfarlane interrupted or he believes this exhibition is funny as it is. In both cases, God helps us. <br /> <br /> I hate this example and dance Irish Jazz once it is finally canceled.
