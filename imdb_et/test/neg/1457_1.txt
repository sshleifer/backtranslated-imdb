This is a film that has gained any interest or praise that it has just received from a lesbian interest. Performances are mostly emotional compared to better films in the genre of GLBT interests. The traceable value of the movie is collected through modest suspension over whether and when the family members of the partners say something that discourages their lesbian relationship. The best element of the movie is probably the beautiful New England landscape, although much of the movie is inside. It is hard to imagine how any viewer looking at this film who does not want to confirm their GLBT lifestyle or wants to see others show, even through poorly realized drama, could understand the significant impact of water bodies. It's a terrible movie.
