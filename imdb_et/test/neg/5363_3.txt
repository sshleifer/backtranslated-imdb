Even if Ryan wasn't such a tedious person, it would still be bad, I said even when we start? "Directors Log" You have the desire to hit your tape recorder and shoot it with a hammer or pound this lake, naturally a haunting lake. Oh, how I want "dead time" to be more literally different from what they call it, but unfortunately there is no death, maybe a couple out or "move noise" o wait, this is a cat. I expected to see some evidence, or at least something that would confirm their extracts, don't worry you won't see something you wouldn't see on a normal day. <br /> <br /> All season and what they have to show, something. In fact, they have less than nothing, they have a waste of time. They took my challenge, doing something for the paranormal challenge. Now you do it for paranormal, you can say to the camera and say, "I love paranormal so much that I draw ghosts" or "I love paranormal so much that I film hot eds pretending they are ghost forests", you are wasting but it's wasting on paranormal. Or you can say, "I fuck with the devil's spirit," but don't say that this name can hurt you, and you know that God doesn't like it, it would be a good thing for God, but he wouldn't want it to do it. So I asked them to waste time on paranormal and they followed suit, they went to the old building, looking for "mothman", it was a waste of time, it didn't make any difference, had no effect, we didn't learn anything new, it was waste of time and film. <br /> <br /> There's an amazing detective job just so unpleasant, "well we found your problem" that the cat died here, so they had to communicate with the cat psychologically and say it is moving, somewhat cat throw, and that's OK ...... directors log .... "Captain log deadline date 541.2 ... oh i mean" the directors' log, i just brought a couple of new researchers to have a couple of 8 and 9 but this stylish is 10 ... um yeah .... we have a new case ... strange things ... ....... focusing on one child ..... they started exploring .. "Now we are psychic, we have not told them, this is the TV trusts us
