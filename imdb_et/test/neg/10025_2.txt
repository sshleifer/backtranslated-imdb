Oh yes, it is definitely a strong candidate to win the questionable "worst 80s slasher ever made". "Prey" has got everything you normally want to avoid in the horror: a routine, a derivative that you have seen a thousand times before (and better), an unbearable character and terrible performances, a complete gore and break, fuzzy photography and unoriginal locations and ??? the most irritating of all? the biggest pointless stuffing you've ever encountered in your life (and it's not an exaggeration but a guarantee!). Beyond the seemingly infinite number of National Geographic films I will later expand, this film is shameless to add a complete banjo interlude (!) And twice where characters speak funny jokes that are not even far from funny! The setup is as rudimentary as it appears when intro shows images of devastating forest fires with intimidation by people with OTT voice. Fast forty years later, when elderly couples from camping in the same area start to worship something that breathes out of the screen. It should be enough information to tell you that someone is living a fire all these years ago and has stayed since then. Enter three unbearable twenty-something pairs that move into a danger area that has sex exclusively in their consciousness, of course, without knowing that they are sitting on the ducks to kill and kill the killer. "Prey" is an unredeemable boring movie. Apparently, it was shot in 1978, but nobody wanted to spread it until 1984, and it's not too hard to understand. If you filter all the content that is actually relevant, it would be just a short film with a working time of 30 minutes; maybe even less. The images of natural and natural nature are unimaginably large, sometimes animals I think do not even live in such an area, and they still look. In fact, the only thing that is typical of a National Geographic narrative that provides educational information about animal habits. The animals in their natural biotopes are arguably nice to look at, but not supposedly a whistle and a cheesy 80 slasher-film to pronounce. In the last fifteen minutes, it is finally somewhat useful for a few monsters with strong killing sequences and fine makeup (who turns out to be Lurch's "The Addams Family" movies), but still overwritten by stupidity? vultures scene is too stupid? and the last shot is just ridiculous. As mentioned above, "Prey" makes my personal list next to the worst 80s sliders with "Fear of meeting", "Berserker", "Deadly Games", "Don't Go in the Woods", "Hollow Gate," awake "and" revenge. "
