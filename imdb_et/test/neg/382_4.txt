Starting with Fulci, who plays his own version by writing some ideas about how people die. It is followed by a fake cat who eats what is probably the brain. The copy I watched was called in English, which I always hate, but I was particularly disappointed that I did not hear Fulcit with his voice. <br /> <br /> Fulci is a kind of fever, working on his last horror movie. When he sees things that resemble the effects of his film, he begins to turn up the stomach and he becomes more angry that he sees the deeds of horrors. He visits a psychiatrist who hypnotizes him and unfortunately he has not improved his mental health. I was reminded of a psychiatrist played by David Cronenberg's Clive Barker's Nightbreed (1990). David L. Thompson, who is quite bad, is playing this down. He's probably a true Fulci life friend when he kills people when he kills Fulci's black humor in work that I thought was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> The film is made up of many movies from Fulci movies, as Fulci is on the device that controls them, watches recordings on TVs, or sees actions. I've never been a fan of TV series clips, and I think things like Charles Band's Full Moon entertainment will cut their old movies down and make three such cuts for new anthologies pretty flat. I think they need to make money? <br /> <br /> The loss of cats in the brain suggests to the theory that violence in movies is a source of violence in real life. One of Fulc's co-workers says that the documentary team follows Fulci to see what his life is like. Lots of self-improvement things like this. <br /> <br /> Finally, some characters run on a boat called "Perversion".
