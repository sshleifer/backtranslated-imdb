So I turned to HBO, which I just thought he had some quality movies and I saw it. Carrot Top is so unusual that it is bad to look at. I've seen unprecedented movies, but I think it's so impossible to watch because Carrot Top seems to have fun. Watching this movie is really a nice movie for 5-year-olds, a top overreaction that is full of ultra-foolish jokes that only 4-year-olds would be great. talented participants who actually signed up for this project, such as Larry Miller and M Emmet Walsh. If you've ever seen Carrot Top's totally terrible MCI ads (or whatever they were), it's more the same, worse. It is bumpy, which is a waste of a big budget that could have done something, rescued the homeless ... nothing more than that. I'm not sure it is all the time in the 50's, but for the $ 10 million it's shameful.
