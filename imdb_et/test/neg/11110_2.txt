Extract from TV GUIDE: <br /> <br /> This week, at LOVE BOAT, Captain Stubing is full of hands when the cryptologic gets aboard! Join the captain, Isaac, Gopher and Julie in a fun Halloween special. A guest who gives Chupacabra a really bad lizard man. <br /> <br /> This is a typical, stupid Sci-Fi Channel cut price. The Navy cruise along the Mexican coast is headed by a cruise ship captain, once played by the venerable John Rhys-Davies. Her daughter is on the run and she serves her, being a kickboxing instructor on the ship. Pay attention to everyone that kickboxing is convenient later! It should be noted that the captain's daughter is rather uncoordinated and painful to look at. It would have been good if he could have tried a couple of kickboxing classes before playing the movie player. and in the dark, mysterious stranger in this 90-minute drive to boredom. <br /> <br /> That's right, I said cryptozoologist. He mentions that he brought some valuable cargo on board, which he has to look out for. Needless to say, the box contains Chupacabra that someone decides to let it out. From that moment onwards, the Chupacabra suit runs around the ship, killing people. Captain Stupid is unable to stop it. He decides to call the Navy, but tells them there are a number of terrorists on his ship. <br /> <br /> Marines react. They say everything that Marine is talking about, like "Hooya" and "Get Some". But these foolish marines are not suitable for Chupacabra. They won't tell anyone where they go, so there's no help. I think no one would lose a flat naval battalion lost. But don't forget ... Captain Stupid's daughter is fortunately a Kickbox teacher. Yay a little stupid! She arrives at the right time, she beats the bloodthirsty goat and saves the day. Chupacabra means goat meat. That's why Chupacabras suck. But Chupacabras has no chance of sucking anywhere as much as this movie.
