It's full water. If you take The Devil's Rejects and suck it all up and add lots of twisted, kinky bondage parts, some rape scenes and like one or two sincerely terrible scenes and you get this movie. People call it the 86-th The Hitcher ripoff, but I don't see it at all. Even the worst Hitcher ripoffs are even better. The main problem here is that there is really something other than the director's fetishes that are shown as circus exhibits. Are all the things you need in a movie about the girls that are abused and binding by girls, intimidating? Well, then rent this movie! <br /> <br /> But I'm just watching a good movie, which is definitely not. The sad thing is that here are some great excitement, but here are just a few. For example, an early mid-term check before the slaves began ... pretty damn good when you ask me. And the scene where a funny girl kills a nymph girl (doesn't remember names) is chilling, very cruel, even challenging Devil's Rejects for rampant rage. How can the rest of the film be so good? Ah? I really need to stop the fools of such fools. Closing message: let it die in the gutter and forget it forever. Not recommended.
