I heard a lot of bad things about this movie before I saw the film, but I thought that all the negative comments were probably on the low budget and bad performance of the movie - both I can deal with zombie films. But what I'm not hoping for is really a boring movie; if there is one thing that can be counted on low budget zombies, its gore and entertainment, but unfortunately this film has nothing. I'm quite surprised, because the previous two horror films I've seen from Bob Clark - Deathdream and Black Christmas - were both very resourceful and entertaining movies, but kids shouldn't play with dead things. The plot line follows a group of young adults traveling to the burial island to mix with rituals to bring the dead to life. However, they will soon realize that with the things they do not understand, it is really a foolish idea if their rituals bring the dead back to life and the bodies of the island will return to their blood! <br /> <br /> Plots sound like this can lead to a decent flick, but what I didn't mention is that the interesting parts don't start up until the last 20 minutes; and since it's a ninety minute movie, I'm sure you can think it's not good. The opening time and the ten minutes are padded with bad effects and even worse characters. I understand how to make the horror stronger than it comes; but please, if you spend so long, you are really interesting. All the characters on the film are up and annoying, and I personally wanted the zombies to hurry and eat them. However, the film is not without its substance, because the atmosphere is special. Lucio Fulci would show seven years later how an isolated island and meat eat zombies well; but Bob Clark did it with this movie. The direction is also not bad, but it is due to bad make-up effects and a special lack of blood that may not please fans of zombie films. In general, I can't really recommend this movie; but if you are a hardcore zombie fanatic, you can get out of it.
