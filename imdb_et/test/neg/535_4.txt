I had some great expectations for this movie. I've always thought that Tom Sellec's less well-known movies (ie Runaway and Coma) are much more than those he needed more. Perhaps the producers would have had to know a little more about the former big baseball players who received stars abroad. Most players were too good for a triple baseball but not a big league. I admire the idea of ​​putting this character in Japan compared to the clichés of playing minors. Sad to say, this movie, like the title of the post, is in third place with a film that seems to be on autopilot. I wouldn't want to see a sequel, and hopefully manufacturers learn from mistakes. The premise is just so unique to leave this uneven flick alone
