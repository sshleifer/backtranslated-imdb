<br /> <br /> Like a bad movie fan (and a MST3K and MFT3K member), I have to say I have seen some of them. But geez! Even the worst thing I've seen is the soundtrack. As George Lazenby was walking around Hong Kong, doing what he knows, you can guarantee that you will not disturb the background music that fills today's cinema. Or any music that fills the lifts. I don't think anyone in this movie even hums. <br /> <br /> It's not quite right now - there is a * sound track. when you listen carefully, you hear it one and a half times during the movie. Of course, the timing is totally inappropriate and it won't last very long, but something that can be classified as "music" occurs. However, your best bet is to sit with your toddler, armed with a wooden spoon in front of the TV, gathering pots and pans when you watch. The rhythm and flow would be better than anything the movie offers. <br /> <br /> Follow Sammo Hung as a small flash of this movie. Are we not all glad he found Jackie Chan working?
