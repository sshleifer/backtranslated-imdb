This is one of the so-called Hollywood social commentary films that want it in both ways. And believe me, in this film both ways are clich√©s and stereotypes. STOP-LOSS is a 21st-century John Wayne film about some anti-war feelings, but it ends up with a remark that "if you are a MAN in today's society, you will get your act together and drive war with your wars." In many ways the film was TAXI TO DARK A great continuation for SIDE, as it depicted the military men equally crazy and out of control, almost FRAT PARTY / ANIMAL HOUSE extravagant Texas Red Neck repressed homo-erotic proven masculinity. This movie had it all in one scenario that followed cliched images. And then the rebellious military desert Ryan Phillippe continues his best friend with Road Trip, doing it artificially to visit dead military families, soldiers kidnapped at military hospitals, and so on. . But the man of honor and patriotism will eventually win, like all freshly cleaned and beautiful, he will drive off the sunset on the bus with his friends back to Iraq and the world that a few minutes before he assured everyone that he will never be able to endure. FULL METAL JACKET corresponds to SANDS OF IWO JIMA. But finally, John Wayne is flying again! And Hollywood's Blockbuster can finally keep their audience in the palm of their hand on both sides, at least wanting to think about it. As for me / I'm worried, take me back to ELAH's garden.
