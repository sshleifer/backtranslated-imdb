Just a miserable Lana Turner-Ezio Pinza vehicle. Pinzal had a beautiful voice, but he rarely uses it in a movie that reminded me of "The Student Prince" with adults. Pinza is also not a leading man. He looks like an elderly man who is ready for social security and fishing. <br /> <br /> The piece is extremely thin and the light supporting Barry Sullivan, Marjorie Maine and Debbie Reynolds is given so little. Sir Cedric Hardwicke finally arrives to announce that our King Ezio was better for his people. As far as I am concerned, the sooner the better. Does this Lana Turner really sing with Pinz? It's not bad if it's her. The picture also reminds me of Marilyn Monroe and Laurence Olivier in the 1960s "Prints and Showgirl".
