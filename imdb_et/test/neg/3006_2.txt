If this film had a point that I never discovered. A very depressing film, allegedly consisting of the final evacuation of the inhabitants of the Montfork River area in the Montana River. The problem is that Montana doesn't have the actual Northfork River. There are a number of bottoms, but these are branches of other rivers that are divided into north and south forks. <br /> <br /> The film's opening square is the surface of the coffin that is on the surface of the lake, but the scene is never a related story and the viewer is left to speculate on its meaning. But much remains for the viewer to speculate in the film. Another example is the arrival of a team of dam workers responsible for the evacuation of fathers in the oak headquarters, leaving a second group of people. There are some almost unheard of remarks about these people, which have no meaning and is not explained in the film. <br /> <br /> The film is considered a series of stories and the film continues to return and continue between stories that are quite disturbing. And the stories are weird. In one of them, the inhabitants of one property refuse to evacuate because they live in a home built like Noah's Box. <br /> <br /> Another meaningless story focuses on a sick orphan who is dying and somehow sharing his presence with a ghost full-time and orphanage with a priest. If anyone can understand what the ghost story was, the author must explain it to them. <br /> <br /> The landscape was tough and the sun never shone. There are snowy mountains far. I think the goal was to bring the mood. The period is determined by the fact that all evacuators traveled with Ford sedans in 1946-48, although the events had to take place in 1955. Operation was mediocre. When I saw the billing of this movie, he said Darryl Hannah was in the picture. When he was, I didn't recognize him, but I think he was a ghost.
