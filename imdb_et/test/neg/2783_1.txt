This is one of the films you watch with a group of people. You have the best time. It's really bad, like Showgirls bad, but without Showgirls quality. <br /> <br /> You have the best combination of bad actors, a bad director and a bad script here. All that is possible can be wrong, which can make for an entertaining evening. The first is the tagline "Teenage Pile ..." These people are just as much "teens" as my grandmother. <br /> <br /> The director has zero thresholds or tensions. The 30-year-old "teens" are standing around and the "monster" comes out and attacks it, and it happens pretty much throughout the film when monsters appear. For that or surprise, or nothing to create any sort of intercession. It's more like when you were kids who pretended to be frightened by monsters and things like you did. And when I use the word "monsters", too much. More than a mate in Halloween masks bought in a 0.99-cent shop. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that this script has been turned off for a few days, does not overwrite it and I can only imagine how bad and badly formatted it was on the page because it was clearly written by an amateur who has no idea . This is another example of the bad things of this day and age: everyone can make a movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie's best bad act is actor. It's as bad as you can. There is not one person with the least ability to act and the driver is the absolute worst. He equips each line in this monotonous form without any expression, and you have to think about how anyone of this bad could become part of any movie, no matter who he knows. When he had to "fight" when his girlfriend was killed, this was one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in the movie. Watching these people in some terrible dialogue is very funny. But when the black man said, "tell him ... tell him ... I love him ..." before his death scene was a big laugh among our group. Funny, funny stuff. My only hope is that this movie gets bad enough to get to where it belongs: IMDb lowest rating of 100 movies. We can do it, people! <br /> <br /> PS. Is it a surprise that one of the "big" comments this movie received was from Virginia (who has one comment, only on this movie and nothing else). And guess where the film was made? Virginia. I have said that before and I say it again: people in the movie should not allow it to comment.
