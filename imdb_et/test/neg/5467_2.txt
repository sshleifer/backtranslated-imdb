There are many questions about making this movie. The first one is: Why make a movie that plays a bit more than uncomfortable female fantasy? One thing is to leave questions to the audience to discuss the intent of the film, something completely different to go into the script writing process, which is unable to deal with actual human issues until they appear on the screen. Why amazingly melodic and often comic strip? Why is there an excessive and often terrible dialogue? Why is a leader-character girlfriend a hooded robber? What purpose is the release of a leading character from kidnapping when he performs his "mission"? (This is a classic little Aussie movie time. Drink a peculiar comedy at the most inappropriate moment.) Why so many scenes where nothing happens? (It is about 15 minutes for a movie that is at least 30 minutes too long.) Why, if a man has been imprisoned for so many days, hasn't he tried to make a serious effort to escape? <br /> <br /> The director who wrote the script has not given a satisfactory story on many lists. <br /> <br /> Dave Garver, Australia.
