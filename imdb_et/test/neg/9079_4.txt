"The Evil That Men Do" begins with a truly repulsive torture, followed by a bit later of torturing methods that are equally disgusting with graphical verbal descriptions that the sadistic, heartless villain wants to use. But despite such a shocking effect, filmmakers cannot really cover the fact that it is just a boring, low-quality Bronson vehicle. Bronson himself is sure, but he should have chosen a better script.
