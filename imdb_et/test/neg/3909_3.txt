If you are one of those people who don't like Sci-fi because of their sometimes far-fetched ideas and surreal worldviews, then stay on the right as far as possible from Stuart Gordon's Space Truckers! This is a really absurd adventure of space filled with eccentric characters, colorful kitsch and ridiculous plots. Frankly, I would never have taken care of this movie if it wasn't Gordon's name credit. This guy comes close to being a brilliant horror musician with undeniable milestones like ?? From Beyond and? Apparently Stuart Gordon loves his humor as much as possible! He once went over the comedy-top (Re-Animator), but with a little difference that the odd humor was effective there. Something that is not really the case with Space Truckers in most cases does not happen anywhere, and a totally exaggerated atmosphere works only in small doses. Finally, all that remains is the occasional fun, but totally unnecessary confusion. Dennis Hopper and Charles Dance (or at least half of Charles Dance) are always happy to watch and still stunning Barbara Crampton has a small role at the end of the film. Crampton was Stuart Gordon's usual heroine in previous horror films. The Space Truckers story is as stupid as they come. Dennis Hopper plays a self-made loner who is tired of his work. Who wouldn't be if you transport pigs to a galaxy company called Interpork? She sees her change to flee, bringing her to the rest of the earth. They swim into space pirates and find that their cargo is destined to destroy half the universe! Stuart Gordon went wisely after that little revenge. When he made space movers, he already made the "King of the Ants", and the absolutely brilliant "Dagon".
