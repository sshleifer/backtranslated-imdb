Norman Wisdom's ultimate main vehicle was leaving his previous trips? bringing your unhappy milquette away, this is the Swinging Sixties product! The end result is an uncomfortable and occasionally embarrassing comedy that interferes with the typical (and sentimental) light sexuality and even the milder satire; the plot is linked to an executive on a trip to a bank conference that falls on teenage Sally Geeson (who doesn't mind him in dealing with him but doesn't take their relationship seriously); Sarah Atkinson appears as a friend of Geeson, who warns Norman of his brilliant character. <br /> <br /> The film is not as bad as Leonard Maltin's BOMB rating and, if anything, it is interesting in the midst of a life crisis (being in many ways similar to Hoffman [1970] and 10 [1979]? I watched only the newly watched); Finally, Norman even tries to bring his wife into his new way of thinking! Pretty things appear in the nightclub with a number of good stories and Norm himself sings a memorable track!
