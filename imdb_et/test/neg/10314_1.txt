The release of this movie DVD expects you to buy this movie for Sandra Bullock's name and face. His picture (years after this movie) is basically a cover design ... and a back cover art ... and an inner cover ... the same picture. His name is on the front panel, on all four edges and on the disk prominently displayed. It is the first name on the star list. His biography is printed inside the body. This movie must turn around its character, right? ERROR! It's her first film and she has a small role. After watching the movie, each role seems less important. The actual dog actually shows no personality. In less than an hour after viewing, I don't even remember the names of many characters. <br /> <br /> Maybe when I looked at it several times, I can actually figure out a plot, but I don't think it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Wait, I just remembered the funny bit! Shoot-em-up video game fans get out of "Doom-cam". It seems like the first human shooter game. Hands and gun in front of camera. <br /> <br /> I am not usually a critical person in the film, but it can be the worst film I've ever seen. I was still waiting for silhouettes to walk across the screen, sit back and start to entertain it. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad the money we spent on it (used) went to charity.
