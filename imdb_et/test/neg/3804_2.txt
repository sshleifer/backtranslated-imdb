... but besides, this sequel is not a redemption of social value for the original Poseidon adventure. When the hell are all the people from the original, including the rescue team? Michael Caine is still going through his most degrading results (although he later attacked his jaws 4). Slim Pickens is just as embarrassing as a stereotypical Texas, and generally you just have to think, "Why did they bother?" I think the last of Irwin Allen is going to be crazy about the disaster.
