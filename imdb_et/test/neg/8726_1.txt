I was looking forward to watching this movie because I loved David Lynch's version. In my first attempt, I fell asleep. Nothing happened. The next night I tried to look the rest, and again I was put to sleep! There was nothing in this film that could keep someone interested in life. The only time it was a little more exciting was when I tried it fast! The DVD had a second disc containing bonus material. Needless to say, I had no difficulty in torturing Dune (2000) more. Here are the low points: the performance was poor, the plot movement was slow, the kits were cheap and they looked cheap, the direction was pathetic and the CGI visual effects were childish. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch Dune, save your money or rent a 1984 version.
