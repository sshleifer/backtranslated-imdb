It was probably the worst film ever made ... the ketchup was the main role in this film and it would be the only candidate for the prize because the plot, the actors and all the things related to this farce were all terrible and ridiculous. I could have done two hours of dragging a better horror in my backyard with a hand held camera that used grass-filled dummies as actors, at least it would be better! Don't waste your time or money on it ... it's very exciting and terrible!
