"Nuts in May" can be one of the worst films I've ever seen. If Ed Wood was still alive, it would be the type of film he does. To make this film bad, would be a century's underestimation. But how bad is it really? Well, here are two bad levels. "it is so bad that it is good" or "it's so bad that it's godless". This movie belongs to the last section. What a little inadvertent humor does not tolerate slow, hard-to-understand and boring most of the film. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Hike in the countryside with R&R and camping, where they met Ray soon with Jim (I'll explain later) next to our main pair next to the tent. In the majority of the film, there are two leading beaches, a rock quarry and other exciting places. Between these adventures, they talk endlessly about the environment, vegetarianism, fossil collection, the duty of the right citizen and the proper nutrition I want to see in comedy. They wore someone listening to them. The dialogue is not only bad, but in some scenes it is so slow that sometimes I felt that the dose was turned off. Scenes would go on forever and just when it starts to build up, and the scene ends. One and a half movies I thought about: "There's nothing about this thing, it's really a movie about something." <br /> <br /> Characters are annoying and constantly repetitive things. On one side, I felt that the director played a cruel joke on his audience. The scene I refer to is "Sing Along" scene. In our two unfortunate British music for us, it was the same and the fourth was over and over again. The idea was to get Ray to sing with them, but Ray knew as well as we were the worst songwriters known to man. This scene was out of tedious, the fifth time the song was played, I began to question the existence of the merciful God. <br /> <br /> Words can't describe the horror of this movie. The first thing that strikes you is the unclear British accents most cast. Do you remember thick Scottish accents in Trainspotting? Time that is 10. <br /> <br /> After all, our tree, which is incompatible with each other, hugged some of Ray's friends who have completely ignored the camp rules. Our hero becomes so harsh that climate change is occurring between our hero and the main heroes. To solve their dispute, the two men participate in a lollipop. That's the right stick! Now it starts with intuitive humor. I laughed so hard that I thought it was another 80 minutes. After this hysterical battle, our hero travels behind some bushes to cry out his eyes and another man calls Ray, calling him to Jim for an unknown reason. and the character of the name change movie 3/4, Ed Wood would be proud. <br /> <br /> Although I was forced to endure the last 10 minutes with a long pig. . Why? who the hell knows. At one point, we see the grazing of pigs and the beginning of the next credit on the screen. One of the worst endings of one of the worst films of the time.
