Very poor quality and action is equally bad. This film is an excellent example of today's England and mindset. In this film, Jesus is not mentioned and the film does not have any type of scripture Christianity, as most people know. I am also very surprised that this film is a BBC program and the BBC is well known for its quality programming, but it seems that the BBC's attempt to compete with Hollywood psycho / drama films does not work well. Bad action, a bad plot, a bad culture that seems to be without faith. I don't even bother to buy it, but rather try to buy or buy this rent when it goes to a $ 2 trash.
