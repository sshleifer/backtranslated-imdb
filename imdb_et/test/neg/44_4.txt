Pretty flat servant from Brisbane. Although the plot depends on a fairly decent idea, writing is deeply flat and two of the three main teenagers are absurdly wood. The problem is that the kids have to go through their plan, but they have to be much more cautious than the ones shown, but if they were devil-caregivers, they might have a hard time being pleasant, so they're not really at all. In fact, I started to enjoy the movie only when I wanted to die. One of those films where in about thousands of places would be the most reasonable way to call the police. I understand we wouldn't have a movie if they did, but it would be nice if we could believe they really wouldn't. Avoid.
