Very strange, it seems to me a very average movie, if not a little less. It is perfectly shot, but with R. Lee's Ermey's performance, this is the only redeeming aspect found in the film, which consists of two separate parts. The first part includes basic sea training, which, as you look at it in 2007, rises like something I've seen zillion times before dozens of other films and series, and it's not particularly engaging. After 30 minutes I got the idea and wanted them to just go ahead with it. The sowing sergeant is about the only plausible character, while everyone else seems to be just cardboard cutouts. General action is fabulous and the scenario has nothing interesting and consists of a little bit more than a sergeant screaming. The boys do it through their training and end in Vietnam. Oh, and the strange fats threw a sergeant (which is a surprise ..), probably mistakenly, that it was actually a screenwriter. <br /> <br /> So one hour passed and nothing worth mentioning. Nothing ... <br /> <br /> Then we have a part of Vietnam. <br /> <br /> It opens up with a floor-scene where Stars and Stripes journalists are bored and make small conversations time. First of all, I thought they made scenes from the old movies again, it seemed pretty bad. But no, they really broke their script rows. Then the camp is demarcated. About 20 Vietcong enters the camp through the main gate. Too bad for them, they have fallen like flies, because they just walk into several manned gun posts without cover. Is this normal behavior? Were all suicides in Vietnam? If so, how did the US not win this war during the first two participation periods? The rest of the movie continues with completely illogical warriors. In addition, the whole plot is completely pointless. No character inspires much sympathy, and the story is, quite frankly, endless. It shows little more than some war journalists pulling together a group where some boys are shooting because they are disobedient moles and who also think that the hole in the wall somehow protects you from bullets. What was the message of this movie that people died in Vietnam? Are people animals in war? If you want to steal really stupid people, will you send them to the war zone? Or that in Vietnam somehow concrete can actually burn? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if this movie deserves 8.3, Apocalypse Now deserves 38.3 <br /> <br /> 5/10
