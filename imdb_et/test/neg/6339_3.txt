Funny comedy drama with a sentimental cover is ideally played by Michael J. Fox as a former child head who now runs a talent agency; Nathan Lane and Cyndi Lauper are his assistants. It sounds like it wouldn't miss, but too big a scenario will be handed over to the rhythm of Christina Vidal as the street to which Fox believes this is the next big deal. They quickly lock the locking heads and the tortuous dialogue brings them back and forth into the interesting, finishing touch of the formula. Fox and Lane are both tempting, but the energy of early scenes gives way to sugar. Slickly produced, but ultimately stale. * 1/2 from ****
