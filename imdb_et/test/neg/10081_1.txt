When I thought about it, I thought I liked the first two and thought they were very tense, so it should be good. ERROR! There is no tension and no explanation for the new dinosaurs! When I watched it, I had lost all respect for Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton, but it turned out that Spielberg and Michael Crichton did not manage it! This film went through "motions". I thought there was no plot on this film and I thought no one should see their money to see it.
