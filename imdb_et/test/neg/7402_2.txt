Dresden had great expectations for his grand theme and great budget. I was really looking forward to it and I really wanted it to be good ... but that's not. The only good thing is the special effects, which are very well done, but like the very bad Hollywood blocking, everything is missing. <br /> <br /> It's badly written, the scenario is trying to fill the genre rules with the usual temporary / love story elements, but there is no depth or originality at all. It's below average. The next thing: it's also badly targeted. This is an uninteresting teleconferencing style with lots of close-ups and quick-to-head editing, if you really don't have any action or relationship. The actors are not bad, but no action is taken. <br /> <br /> I don't know ... they're probably trying to make a typical TV movie, not a movie where this alway is good, it has some edges and a clear visual style. But why are they trying to comply with the usual commercial Hollywood rules? it really seems like the scriptwriter did some weekend class with some American manuscript writing guru and then gave it a mess. Isn't there a manufacturer responsible for a project that is interested in dramaturgy / visual style or simplicity in just those magical cinematic moments that make some TV movies great?!? Do they think the TV audience is stupid and do not need a high quality movie experience? The downturn was a very good example of a good TV movie, but it was probably a manager or producer who knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time, rent a "fall" instead ...
