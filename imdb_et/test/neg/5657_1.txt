First of all, I would like to say that I am a teenager so it is marketed to me and I can say for sure that iCarly is a very bad programming and that it is acceptable between both sexes. It contains some of the worst attempts in comedy I've seen with mediocre behavior. The supposed humor in the show is based on all the traces of someone with bad sarcasm, bad sarcasm, a bad lining, and a picture. I should also mention that I am still looking at Spongebob, which I know I will get a negative setback, but this is a good quality programming with some honestly funny moments, less forgetting something iCarly lost; WIT. The show is about a young girl, Carly, putting a web show with her friends, what I can say is undoubtedly a more beautiful version of the internet. It's nice, but the show is just ... not funny at all, as I said before. If this is what children's programs have reached today, parents will show them something that is funny; Spongebob or Rocco's modern life would work. <br /> <br /> Compared to this brother-in-law, Drake & Josh, this is terrible, which was implicit. Seriously, look something worthwhile. Even for the children, it's poor.
