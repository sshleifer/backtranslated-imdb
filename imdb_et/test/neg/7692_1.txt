This film revival is on the right march in the bad film industry and in Saudi Arabia, I want to know how the filmmaker was able to stand up against the people in the industry after making the film, the job was very bad, we don't know how cinema Saudi companies like Rutana and others don't support yang filmmakers KSA such as UAE. We hope that the film industry will flourish in Saudi Arabia in the future. But without such interference, foolish traders and idiots make us bad films that do not support Saudi Arabia's cinema's reputation as Roman and Iranian cinema At the same time ask Saudi Arabia for simple experimental films such as Abdullah alayaf And others to dream of a good film industry to participate in festivals in the world business interventions foolishly
