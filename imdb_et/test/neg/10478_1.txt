First of all, I have to admit that separate peace is my favorite book. So of course I have no bias against any attempt to adapt it to a feature film or TV show. But when I started watching this movie, I was more than willing to give him some doubts. The original version of the early 1970s, although Phillips was beaten at Exeter Academy, where the author of the book attended the school, and although it remained faithful as it was in the book, it lacked the depth of the feeling and could not capture the character of the characters. The original just looked through. When you read the movie's trivia, you will find that it is mostly cast with non-participants. So the original has this amateur feel and it eventually fails. <br /> <br /> This new version, although I give it a better look than the original, seems to have thrown the book all together. Scenes are relocated, characters they do not belong to, created characters that were not in the book, or attempted to deepen into deeper conflicts that make the book so convincing. And for all the cardinal sins: this tree is not considered to be an essential, almost central character, which is in this book. This is an indiscriminate supervision by filmmakers. How could they reduce the role of the tree? Why not use it right away? Why the dead poet at the beginning? And what was God's accent in the name of God? This movie is blunt, garbage. Separate peace should not be a complicated book to adapt to a stage or screen. John Knowles wrote it in a very fine, linear style. The filmmakers should have trusted the story as it was written; make changes, for sure; decorate here and there, for sure; take a firm dramatic license. But to destroy one of American pearls in this process? What did they mean? In nature's corruption, they cut through all the chances or drama. The whole movie falls to the plane and fails. <br /> <br /> If you are a high school or college student who is meant to read this book and think about skimping and just watching a movie ... don't even think about it. This movie doesn't help you. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we have to wait longer before the version of this story appears on the screen that really makes it fair.
