Well now, here's the thing - for this movie to work, you have to accept the following: a woman who has been murdered is alive at the end of the movie, the detective stops listening to the dead woman's bride because the newspaper reporter asked her not, and the same reporter who would look good The blonde, pulled out of court for suspicious behavior at night, blows a judge in return for her marriage, who gave her a hook. Are you following me on this? I can't tell you how many times I stopped and repeated the picture to repeat scenes that just didn't make sense. Finally, the blonde (Claudia Dell) and the reporter (Richard Hemingway) were married, but I have no idea how they came to this decision. In fact, I can't figure out how the filmmaker decided to do this flick. Oh, I think there are some entertaining values ​​here, that it would be just that hard, but it would have been nice if even a few pieces would fit. However, I'm not ready to add it to my Top Ten worst list. I think the nightclub scene with feathers could have saved it. But why was it in the movie? I just don't know.
