This is probably a cultural thing - somehow the natives of this country are conditioned to find that funny thing. I've been experiencing this phenomenon for the first time during an open-air cinema event where this movie was shown before. Most of the indigenous audiences laughed and didn't, it wasn't in a sanatorium or slowed-down clinic, it was in a good area and the audience was mostly from educated adults. So there must be some way to find this amusing but honest, I have no idea what it takes - maybe it is in the air or in the water, the long-term exposure that causes this condition. Something to do is, of course, the only thing I can say is that I'm pretty sure that doesn't cause it: the film itself. <br /> <br /> There is no joke here. It's brain dead, stupid, pointless, sleepless, flat. In short, a waste of time. Every Tom and Jerry are funny, even the funeral of fun is funnier. <br /> <br /> If you've never been happy to ever see any Stooges performance: It's three guys who act, run, even talk like slower babies, causing all kinds of uncomfortable chaos, no plot, no the real purpose and the real conclusion. It's like ugly Teletubbies without cute costumes. <br /> <br /> The people who look at this garbage in this country can be quite irritating because you feel you're at a party with a bunch of potheads and you're the only one who hasn't smoked. <br /> <br /> So if you are not ready to annoy yourself to make it tolerable or equipped with whatever it is, people will think that looking at the three ugly old men behaves morally. funny, my advice on this is: Make your way. Far.
