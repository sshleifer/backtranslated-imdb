I sat through 2 hours of pure boredom. I'm looking at IMDB, though it's not high on the list, it's 250's up. Although yes. I am very impressed by Robin and Matt's acting abilities, they still didn't record the movie. I'm not sure what the movie really did not like. Maybe it's because I'm putting math. Maybe I'm not talking too hard in 2 hours. Although I loved "American beauty", but it was so. I just want 2 hours ago. It was a great waste of time. If I have nothing in this movie, please send me an email. I'm curious as to why this is 250. And don't say, "Because it was a good movie". <br /> <br /> 2/10
