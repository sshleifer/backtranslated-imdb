Wow. As soon as I saw this film cover, I just wanted to look at it right now, because it seemed so bad. Sometimes I watch Bollywood movies just because they're so bad that it's fun (like Koi Mil Gaya). This movie had all the elements of the terrifying movie: "local gang", a totally harmless, badly made motorcycle scene, a terrible dialouge ("Happy boy, I'm very proud to be a bad boy"), actors playing basketball as if they were they are good, cruel songs ("I'm bad, bad for me, bad guy bad for me"), unexplained plot lines like why is a good boy and bad boy friends? And why is a hot girl in love in love? I've never seen such a terrifying story of such a fearsome story. Some scenes actually took 30 seconds, like the one where good and bad guys went over the "gangli" poker game. Congratulations to Ashwin Chaudry, you're a bad driver. If you want to watch a good movie, look at Guru if you want to watch such a bad movie that it's really fun, then look at a good boy, boy.
