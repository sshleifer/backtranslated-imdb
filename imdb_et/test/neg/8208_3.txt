This movie is trying to be more than it is. First, it is terrible. You have to go beyond the incredibly bad lines and terrible emotions. The plot is quite interesting. A ship accident occurs (probably because it was made of strings and balsa wood), and a couple of men get to the shore. If it wasn't bad enough, there would be a guy named Count de Sade. He is living out of the pirates' fear and has gone completely mad. Anyway, he has a big slave, a young woman and some dogs. There's another woman who doesn't speak, and her wife, who is a leper. Anyway, things get bad because these men have to deal with this nut case. She is arrogant and loves to draw and offer. The rest of the movie includes an attempt to escape. It has an ironic ending that I will not publish and will save the film. I wouldn't bother if I was you.
