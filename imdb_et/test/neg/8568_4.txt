I am a big horror fan, especially the Spanish horror. This film had so many opportunities to be good. This is a wonderful idea, a ghost of vigilants, because most of what has come out of Jaume Balangueró. Also visual and sound effects were pretty good. But everything was disgracefully damaged by bad direction, terrible pain and painfully bad (exposure, exposure!) Script. Damage. Perhaps Balangueró should write and direct himself ... <br /> <br /> Besides, I do not understand why actors who do not speak English can speak English (and if they do). they make it so bad that it makes their performances even more fake. If you look at modern Spanish horror films such as El Orfanato or Rec, the performances are completely in line with this type of stylish ghost story - and it is realistic, believable as someone like us, as real people, because it's the only way horror reaches that goal. Unfortunately, all La Monjas failed.
