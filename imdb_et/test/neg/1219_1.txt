This movie is beyond the limits. It's incredible - very bad for the jaws and other (better) shark films ripoff. Really bad - everything is very pathetic. The story is the purest mess, the actors are bad, the effect is very cheap, there is no creativity. It seems that some very weak children took the jaw script and placed it randomly, so his parents took an 8mm camera and filmed with his neighbors. Music is really inappropriate, but some "lift" music, fun and overly optimistic, if nothing happens, a little less optimistic if the shark is about or when children get depressed (again listening to LOUD's elevator music). Carlo Maria (author) should be so ashamed that she should ask her name to be deleted from the headlines !! The film acts as a perfect example of how horrible music destroys *** ALL *** the scene that should be exciting. However, there is one big difference to the jaws: at the beginning of the jaws there are comments about stupid people trying to kill the shark dynamite. Well, it's been trying to kill the shark dynamite. If it doesn't work, the boys will take the *** BIG LOAD *** dynamite and spend as a 1/4 movie, placing the explosives on some sunken ship. This is a truly original way to catch fish that I have to admit! They use as many dynamites as they try to kill the battleship (I think of Bismarck's battleship class) or dig another Panama channel. It's just incredible. I am pleased that they did not attempt to use a napalm or a tactical nuclear attack to eliminate this bad, bad about 2m sharks. Well, there is also a mysterious missing mother tongue of India (who looks like a German pensioner). It's not a movie, it's a deterrent to how bad movies are! This is useful as a warning. But the public should be protected from this mess. Most Italian movies are bad, but it ... it's really extraordinary in the worse sense of the word.
