Beware of the buyer. Alpha Video Edition uses off-specification printing. The film was painted, but you didn't know the first 25 minutes. The printing used is so faded that it seems almost sepia. After 30 minutes, the ink will come in color, but the color will come to the end. Remember, even if it's the best, the color is bright and washed. The printout appears to have been recorded on television that did not receive the best reception. Adding to this travest is the most memorable line I remember. Even chatting is stupor-inducing. Each line is delivered in this irritating behavior. I found that I want them to hurry and get the words out. For this reason, I couldn't wait until the movie ended. This is one of those bad films so bad, but I want someone to find half a decent print.
