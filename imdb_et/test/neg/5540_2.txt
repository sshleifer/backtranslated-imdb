I loved the original P.H. and was somewhat satisfied with Bloodwings (II) and Ashes to Ashes (III), then I saw part IV. Oh boy ..... As a pumpkinghead enthusiast, I did my best to give as much credit as I could to part 4, but it's pretty bad. Wedding reception fight right at the beginning of the movie is a terrible confusion for one thing. The story of Hatfield and McCoy is incomprehensibly stupid and clich√©. How did producers get the hostile story of this tired family? Wow, incredible. In addition to Henrickson, it is below average. Plot and script thinking. Actual editing and cinematography are average as well as referral. I mean, the movie is not a complete loss. As always: I really enjoy watching Pumpkinhead, I love how Haggit is a witch, and like watching Harley's ghost in action. But all three characters had too much screen time. I thought Haggis and Harley finished the dinner club to eat dinner and drink as they were a friend of their friend. The bottom line is .... Did I want all the holy characters in this plot to be dead within 20 minutes of the beginning of the picture. Where do Sci-Fi get these so-called "film production professionals"? I could do a better job by writing a script from a stone drunk. I'm sure the budget was limited and everything, but come on! Take a look at this when your three other fans are once. And then go back and hold on to the two original ones. Shame on you Sci-Fi !!!!
