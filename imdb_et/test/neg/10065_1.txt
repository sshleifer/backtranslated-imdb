The adventures of Hercules must be one of the flattering excuses for the film I am going through. You should look far and far to find something that approaches the level of failure on the screen of this movie. Acting? Bad. Editing? Bad. Direction ?? Bad. Special Effects ?? Bad and ridiculous. Süžee ?? Bad. Lighting? Bad. Cinematography? Bad. Costume Design? Bad and stupid. Everything else ?? Bad. Looking at Hercules adventures is about as enjoyable as the root canal. Even a bad movie fan is a true endurance test. It is one of both Masochists and Lou Ferrigno graduates (if available). <br /> <br /> Eight Things I Learned from Hercules Adventures: <br /> <br /> 1. If you do not have a budget for actual special effects, a rotoscope for the previous movie scene. It looks good - trust me. <br /> <br /> 2. Take the time to stop the body often when trying to restore the Zeus thunderstorms. It worked for Ferrigno and his two Amazon companions. <br /> <br /> 3. Every sword fight, the use of magic and almost all the other everyday activities in ancient Greece created a sound very similar to Pac Man or Asteroids. <br /> <br /> 4. Some ancient Greek gods are dressed up as Star Wars. <br /> <br /> 5. If you need to extend your crappy movie run time, add the title sequence by adding Star Trek-style credits and discard some grand music. It also helps if you have a previous movie that pulls scenes. <br /> <br /> 6. Fighting scenes move much smoother when bad guys attack Hercules one by one. <br /> <br /> 7. William Berger did something for money. <br /> <br /> 8. I didn't think it would be possible, but Hercules' adventures make the first movie, Hercules (1983) looks like an Academy Award winner.
