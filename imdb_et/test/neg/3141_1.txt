Looking for something shocking? All right ... the pictures are that. That's it. This film is trying to make the audience more diverse and easily annoying. I'm not quite sure if the director's goal was really to portray a deep message to his audience, or when he just tried to shock them with shock, sex and violence. I think it was probably the first one ... but in an unsuccessful attempt it was just an artistic garbage with lots of blood, some unpleasant characters, and a general reliance on religious symbolism. If you are looking for an independent movie to criticize the use of a metaphor, keep it. If you are looking for a gore flick that makes you uncomfortable and uncomfortable ... here you go ... If you are looking for a movie that will irritate you infinitely because you realize that at last the message was stupid ... the movie was stupid ... and you will never get those minutes back from me. This is definitely your movie!
