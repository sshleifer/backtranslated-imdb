I found this movie cheaper on the flea market. I was so psychological because I thought it was a roller film. I got home, the rules for previews and the opening scene, where the old man rolled up on the roll, was fantastic. At this point I realized that it was an apocalyptic film, but I still have great hopes. This movie was terrible. My friend was worshiped in his mind when we looked at it, and even when he thought it was terrible and overwhelmed. I fell asleep during the movie because it was so boring and the music was totally terrible. I don't know if all good music will be destroyed during the apocalypse, and all the music that is the only one funny will be destroyed and everyone will remember how to play it, it will be wiped clean, but I think I'd rather die than grab it. What the hell was in the TV studio? I can only assume that this movie is adapted to the old Greek game with names and headlines, but some games are not intended for futuristic sci-fi setup. Or at least not the people involved in this movie. If you are forced to watch this movie, I can only recommend bringing your hand to the gun and ending yourself before the end. It would be a good movie to kill yourself, everyone understands why.
