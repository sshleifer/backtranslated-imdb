Yes, it's a classic SBIF (so bad it's funny). What budget goes to tens of dollars, some of the most insecure acts you've ever seen, and absolutely NOT even far frightening moments - not even a nanosecond! The camera's work was at primary school - one house that was still outside the house was obviously hand-held and juggled crazy. Blood looked like dipped cherry Koolaid, someone made a trip to a local meat shop for "human" bones and Miss Witch was the cheapest mask for Wal-Mart. <br /> <br /> Was any involved? in the final paragraph and understand what the confusion was? Most credit names have to be pseudonyms, it would be a career suicide to get this CV. Take advantage of this and watch Eberti's colonoscopy video!
