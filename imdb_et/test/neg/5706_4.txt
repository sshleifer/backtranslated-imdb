Before I start, let me do something: I'm a big fan of John Eyres' first film PROJECT: SHADOWCHASER. The film, B Class Cross of both TERMINATOR & DIE HARD, may not be a cinematic work, but it is a hilarious action movie that became a cult position (& created two sequences and spin off). br /> <br /> The judge and jury start with Joseph Meeker, a convicted killer who was sent to Death Row after his capture after the so-called "bloody shootout" (which seems to be a bad name for the killer of the Meeker) when he kills three people trying to rob a store that was placed in an electric chair. There is a fun scene where Meeker talks to the priest to live for sex, but meets one of his true love (who was killed during the shootout), expressing his revenge for killing him? Michael Silvano, a washed soccer star who spends his day with his son Alex, with his high school team (and reaches his son's trainer harassment). But when executed, the Meeker returns as a revenant (or if Kelly Perine calls "potatoless hamburger") whose sole purpose is to get revenge, which means in principle the misery of Silvano's life. <br /> <br /> Let me point out that the judge and the jury are not a real horror film. This is a supernatural action film, where Meeker shared Silvano using her ability to change form (which means that David Keith dresses like everything from the Elvis impersonator, a French chef (whose accent is as bad as his mustache)., Clown and stand-up comedian), a shotgun that burns explosive circles and immortality (although this does not prevent Martin Kove from taking Keith with Desert Eagle), pay Silvano back to kill Meeker's wife. br /> <br /> Director John Eyres does not seem to be interested in characterization, but focuses only on action scenes that have a lot of film. But this is the main mistake of the movie because nothing can be combined together. The actor is surprisingly good because Keith gives the best result Kove supported, as well as Paul Koslo, who plays the hidden policeman quite well. Kelly Perine is annoying because she tries to help but makes the situation worse.
