If you have seen 1 from Atlantis, you would know that what made this movie really great was great animation and a good script. This movie was so slow and animated. The story is also brash. I was so disappointed at this half-baked party that I couldn't go for the first hour and MAN tried it! One thing that was on this film was that it extended the "mole" character, making it more sympathetic and three-dimensional. Take it from me, rate this spam video box cover. Kate is a badly drawn Disney schlock that obviously grabs the parents easily. If it were an independent flick, it wouldn't be so bad, but driving to Atlantis like the great pieces of coats makes it completely free.
