Where to start? Some men have some Indian pots that he cleans up, and suddenly bone attacks. He hits a woman's neck with an ax, he falls off, but then rises up and is apparently undamaged. She runs in the forest and turns out to be in the woods in the basement of a shopping mall. He will meet again with the utility and Skeletor attacks. Fortunately, he is like any good utility worker, a gun and a boy. Not working, everything starts with fire. <br /> <br /> Cut some people in the forest. Although they have been hiking for some time, they sit down and introduce themselves to each other. Wouldn't they probably have done this when they first met? Anyway, they are "secret" members of the Delta team (secret, I think, because they don't have to dress up for uniforms). Cute girls have a variety of things like a sniper school teacher, and oh, I can't remember the rest. It doesn't matter. Ultimately, they take out all of their weapons and start them instantly on different things. ? Anyway, they meet an old Indian sitting in the woods. He wants beans. You know, like pork and beans? He mumbles a few things, I can only assume that this is a prerequisite for the film. I supported the prerequisite for listening to the ad because you can't say what it says. <br /> <br /> So they walk a little more in the woods. The whole dialogue is a quasi-military, macho BS load. I mean everything like every word. Like "It reminds me when we were in Kabul" or "It reminds me when we were in Laos". Skeletor attacks again. Let me give you a basic attack. One of the female characters is bent over the tree, and she is catching her weapon towards the approaching boy. For some reason he does not come, but tends several times against someone else. When Skeletor approaches, he jumps out of the tree so Skeletor can hold him with his spear. Then everyone will shoot. The balls cause sparks to fly off the trees. Apparently, the people who made this movie never missed the ball. They don't sparkle. <br /> <br /> Then Casper Van Diem drove a semi-trailer, trying to ride the Skeletor. He can't, and the truck slips. Van Diem is injured, apparently he slips across the seat and struck his hip on the window or something so he climbs out of the truck and explodes. Later he dies in the forest and everyone says bunch-military, macho BS. They meet in a pair of forests and blow their "secret" status, instantly identifying themselves as military. They beat the boys for some reason, then they go away. <br /> <br /> Some other things happen, people get caught up, camera shakes, etc. <br /> <br /> I think it's finally ending my theory. <br /> <br /> My theory is that the Sci-Fi channel is a bit annoying that everyone will downgrade their movies so they remember it to remind us how bad movies really can be. Like you think our movies are bad? Well, you haven't seen bad. HERE IS OR !!! Okay, now that we've got it out, the rest of our movies are pretty good, right? Well, that's just theory.
