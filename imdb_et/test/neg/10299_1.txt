Undoubtedly, the year is the biggest waste of the film. This film is poorly structured, sadistic, cruel, and full of improbable signs. In addition to this and perhaps the worst crime it is interesting and predictable. As soon as Bill Pullman's character in the picture changed the word "evidence" to "violence," I had the whole plot. There is no surprise and there is no compelling reason to look at it in the trash. For me, the only salvation function is that I saw it for free on the HDNet cable and didn't waste any money. I would be really angry if I had paid for it in the theater. Terrible, terrible movie in every sense.
