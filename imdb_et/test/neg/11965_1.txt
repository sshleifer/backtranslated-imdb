First of all, I would like to say that I am back on retirement because I write well-deserved comments about terrible films. Only the film, titled "Scarecrow wild," can bring me back, so here I am. <br /> <br /> So I want to start with this comment. OUCH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was really terrible, I know I know it's bad. But I had no idea I would spend 60 minutes of a possible 90-minute movie that laughs, which I thought was a horror movie. is). Ken Shamrock. Now that memory serves me right, Shamrock is one of the most dangerous men in the world. Now that the memory serves me again, he was in this stupid movie that was a stupid comic relief (or how it looked to me). I mean, how else will you explain your lines. My all time my favorite line in this so-called movie was "It's been a long time coming". OKAY????????? The pointless point of this line was that no more than five minutes before he said he was sitting on the beach, telling the dead children soon how the dam scare could not kill. So, if he knows about it, why did he start to fight it on earth as soon as he sees it (scarecrow he does). As I said earlier, he must have a comic relief, unless I don't think his UFC buds are laughing. /> <br /> I admit that I don't remember a lot of scenes and it's not good considering that I watch the movie no more than 15 minutes ago. So, what I'm going to do is list the five wrong things in this movie. So why were almost all the people involved in this movie in this pathetic whistle. I thought I saw a face of peacemaking, and nothing said that he was a whistling type. <br /> <br /> 2. Why were the murders on the beach on the ground. Sorry, the removal of historic beaches is related to party time and vacation feelings. But I think this horror movie thought it was so successful that it would change. Plus it was me or the beach seemed to be the size of a person's dwelling. I mean, every time an actor or actor ran around the beach, they seemed to work in the same place. <br /> <br /> 3. Girl runs in gray sweat pants. It really disturbs the duration of the movie. I mean, he looks so ridiculous. In addition, he didn't help him to look younger than the whole group. I mean what he was twelve or something. There is no excuse that someone would be so thin with the camera. I mean, the camera doesn't add like ten pounds or anything, so what was his excuse. <br /> <br /> 4. People trying to make high scores with the camera. Just when I thought that the movie didn't get cheese, it comes to being Gorth Brooks and oh man was flat. I don't remember the whole scene, but what I remember was not pretty. This one man will start singing this song that has nothing, and I don't think of anything going on in the movie. The funniest part of the whole event is how everyone seems to enjoy it. I mean, the only person who really doesn't know how to answer is "a symbolic black man". And it is sad, because if I am not mistaken, he was the one who encourages this last addition to America. But here it is funny. Although this guy is all about his new song or whatever. Far and far we can see or scare the scarecrow. And the boy looks it up. I mean, there is actually a moment when she looks like she is very jealous of this guy. So what he does with this jealousy, I'm glad you ask. He waits for the man to finish his song, and then he finishes. I don't want to give away the death scene, but I can tell you that. If this scene doesn't make you laugh, there's nothing on this earth. <br /> <br /> 5. This movie was so long awaited. And it doesn't help them to try to pull some pathetic bullies ** t to push another 10 minutes out of this movie. I mean, I admit I didn't see twisting, but that had a lot to do with hoping the film was over and done. But they didn't have to do them when they wrestled s ** t. Needless to say, when I say I came, I just turned off T.V and said it didn't worship in any way. Thanks to my rather quick decision, I can say that I never know what happens next. But I promise I will not care !!!!!!!!!!!!! The whole and the whole movie is good to laugh, but please don't buy it. Just jump on it to your friends and see it there.
