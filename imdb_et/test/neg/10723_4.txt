I thought the film was sub-par. The action was good, but not great, the story was funny, but it didn't come that way. The director dropped this movie ball. It wasn't James (Jim) nor doing. IMHO killed this music. There's a scene where the mountains and the music of Jonny Cash play - the man was that depressing (not funny) killed my mood. After that, the movie could not recover. The scene of deportation had a potentially funny situation, a good structure with good action - I even smiled, but the music was again inappropriate for the scene. The music kept me caught on the film. <br /> <br /> I say it had a potential, but it was badly done, even saying that it was invading the final product. Certainly exorcist remembers prequel: start. The release of the theater was good, even after watching it, but exorcism of releasing the film: domination was much better. The same story is just a different director. The same should be done here.
