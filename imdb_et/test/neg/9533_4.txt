This film was so purposeful, funny and uneven that it was a whole thing. (In fact, I thought there might be some interesting elements of the plot.) It was nothing more than a thirty-generation "aging" film. Whole nonsense and I have no idea what Julianne Moore did in this area, because that was the only reason I picked it out of the shelf.
