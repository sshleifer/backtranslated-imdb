The Doll Master is an example of a terrible horror film that has fallen somewhere in the room with two not so well-established genres, horror films and emotional drama films. The Doll Master seems to be trying to be a very scary horror movie, but it won't work. The dolls' noise during the movement is like that taken from the Kayako blow of Ju-On, and the indexes are like a rainy esquire. Killer dolls will remember you from the "Chucky" cute version. However, compared to the child's play, this film is more excellent. But the story seems like nothing, brilliant camera shots and the show shine went off the ground for the reason. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it when you expect big shocks.
