I have to go with my son Allen (who also watched this movie) ... ZOMBIE GANGBANGERS (as my copy is right - I think they left the "NINJA" section after there is no "ninja" or refer to ninjas anywhere in the movie ...) is a waste of time. Honestly one of the most boring, slowed down "movies" I've ever seen is not happy. <br /> <br /> Two zombies rape (non-graphically) repeatedly and then with a policeman (again non-graphically) when the policeman doesn't believe his story. He meets a man who was told by zombies to beat, and two are trying to find a way to search for vengeance for the guilty of the dead ... <br /> <br /> First of all - "gangbanging" (or actually nothing else) "beating" at all), which was ZOMBIE NINJA GANGBANGERS. I was hoping that I got at least some kind of horror / porn hybrid, which is NOW, or RE-PENETRATOR, or maybe PERVERY STORIES - but no - there was no sex in this movie. At least a little o-out-out could have somehow redeemed this boring garbage, but without it we can get a lot of poorly captured scenes with full boredom at zero cost. I'm all about "trash" movies and most other scrambling, gore, porn and exploitation materials, but it's strangely odd in every sense. Save time, give it over ... 1/10 (and one is just a few short shots of some of the sub-parameters ...)
