Oh my ... bad dress, worse synthetic music and the worst: David Hasselhoff. The 80's is Witchery, an American-Italian co-production, with revenge led by the notorious Joe 'D'Amato production side and short-term director (thanks to heaven for small miracles) Fabrizio Laurenti. Marketed in a sort of queue for the Sam Raimi Evil Dead series in Italy ("La Casa"), Witchery offers some modest food items and bad action. <br /> <br /> Characteristics and witchcraft, the film bounces on events, with some serious wood actors and fun day and night blends slowly ending, adding some serious WTF surprise capitals. (I just love my face ...) Surprisingly, Laurent manages to collect a little bit of air on a very small scene. Unhappy with him, these little glances of light movie magic go fast and efficiently. <br /> <br /> Plus the sides are experienced when gore hits the fan. This department is quite effective and entertaining with the 80's Italo-gore classic latex and red style, when things were made 100% by hand and were as shocking and lively as the modest budgets. I can only look at the sadistic devil and a few laughing at all the general ways in which the nonsense (and the actors) confused and misused one after the other. I was just sorry for Linda Blair, who probably won't let her try some kind of other good old conquered girl / woman during her career, or she seems to be checking her filmography. <br /> <br /> Well, people - not much more to say and less to talk about. Don't expect too much when you spend this rain in the afternoon, and you will probably experience at least some light fun. This will also help if your rotten little hearts fall into the 80's gore of horror. Talking about the heart - every movie with David Hasselhoff, whom a big metal object hugs and bleeds around space and corridors MUST be in the right place. <br /> <br /> This is my truth - what is yours?
