Homecoming; what a great disappointment! After reading the plot summary (dead come to vote - against George W. Bush !!!!!) I couldn't wait. It started to interest and immediately attracted attention. Unfortunately, it was slowly falling on a boring political satire that I didn't have to see (I can just look at the good old Aussie comedy!). There was pretty much just one or two horror and they weren't even so scary. I couldn't believe it was coming from Joe Dante, who could have easily pulled out with equal balance and excitement. <br /> <br /> The worst episode so far. <br /> <br /> 2/5.
