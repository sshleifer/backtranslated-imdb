It really seemed like movies to children, except so much worse. The lawyer tries to save the offender who was convicted of killing his son. He fails. The lawyer's daughter then finds a doll that the killer was buried with her son and instantly attached to it. After several people are seriously injured, they find a little girl who secretly talks to the doll, saying she hasn't hurt anyone. During this movie, did I find myself looking at this cheeze? again and again. Finally, I was so bad that I went and looked immediately after Disney's comic book and slept with light.
