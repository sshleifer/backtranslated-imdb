Between 1936 and 1939, Peter Lorre made a number of successful Mr. Moto films. Although they are technically B-movies, they were much better than the typical movies of the genre. But Lorre was tired of making these very repetitive movies and told her friends she wanted out of the series. When it was canceled in 1939, Lorre was excited, but his plans for more complicated and satisfying roles didn't change when he moved to Columbia. DOOMED MEN ISLAND is one of these films and it is quite obvious that the studio does not put much effort into the film because I think the plot was written by penguins. Maybe talented penguins ... but the movie doesn't make any sense at all. <br /> <br /> It starts with a man who agrees to be a government secret. He must get into the US where something strange is wrong. Now they would just have the right to search to do it. But since the penguins wrote the film, the agent takes the rapeseed, which he did not and does not spend in prison. Apparently, he hopes he will go away to this island as much as he is sent to finish the session. <br /> <br /> There are problems with this idea. First, they only have one year before they are paralytic - but he was convicted in MURDER and he refused to disclose who he really was. In that case, they would never have agreed. Secondly, what if he didn't spoil the island? He would have spent the whole year in captivity! Third, why not only the divers, boatmasters and boat riders come to the island? Talk about a nice plot! <br /> <br /> When there is an island on the island, the agent discovers that evil Peter Lorre has created his own private prison and handed it over to men who are due to slavery. But do men have to report to their password officers? It was never explained, but Lorre used them for diamonds and was treated terribly. Now there was another question that when Lorre discovered great diamonds there, he was a very wealthy man. So, why not just pay people for diamonds for me?! Why set your Devil's Iceland version and beat and kill men ?! <br /> <br /> Finally, Lorre will get rid of what he and the island's slaves will be released. Unfortunately, I didn't really care. In general, it is traceable, but rather stupid. Lorre's career only improved when he moved to the Warner Brothers next year. With films like ISLAND OF DOOMED MEN, I can see why his stay in Columbia was short.
