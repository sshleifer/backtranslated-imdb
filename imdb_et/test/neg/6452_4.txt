The uneven, verbally abusive film studio master directs his male husband who has been looted with weak demands, keeping the young man firmly under his thumb with a constant risk of unemployment; After year-office-terror, working on rigid end cracks. The writer-director George Huang is likely to have put away more when he gets chewed here. His "Swim with Sharks" is not a Hollywood diatribe or a tribute to hard work ... instead, this stunt is making a movie with a twist, one trick pony tunnel. The neighborhood does not look and feel the city of Tinsel (perhaps due to a limited budget) and we never get such a stressful environment as a film making unit (it may be in a real estate agency valley, all of us know). Lead Kevin Spacey, who was also a film producer, provides a controlled and purposeful result as a power-crazy mogul whose ego is out of control; he does a good job, but the character doesn't talk. We learn so little about him and his acquaintances that his important position and high status cannot see what we see; to whom does this man answer? which drives him beyond the humiliating sport of others? What projects does he juggle with one script that we see next? The film is so emotionally strange and underfunded, it seems like a large-screen cushioned stage game and one more without signs or motivations without it. Maybe Huang wanted to keep things simple, but his film looks like a half-burned project that needed a lot more knowledge, humor and atmosphere. ** from ****
