From Troma (my favorite film company) Unspeaksble is a dirty horror movie that can be interesting but very dark and twisted. <br /> <br /> The unknown starts with the car by car, they get into an accident that gets into the accident, leaving the daughter dead and the mother deformed. The father finally gets crazy and cuts prostitutes. He sees his daughter in other people. He's killing him. Meanwhile, her correct rape is her now deformed woman. These are sick people! <br /> <br /> The unknown is trying to be sick and distracting and it can do it because it is not a good nightmare. Most Troma movies have a sense of humor, but that is not the case.
