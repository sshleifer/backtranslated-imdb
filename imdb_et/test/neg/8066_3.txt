This movie was quite confusing. There was really nothing there. The only character with an appeal was Bobbie Phillips' Maya and he wasn't even worth it. <br /> <br /> The plot has a standard, double double cross section. Too many with a double cross. Sometimes this means that "keeps you", that is, it "keeps you waiting". Finally, I just wanted everyone to be imprisoned or imprisoned.
