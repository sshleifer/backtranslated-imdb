Half Past Dead was unlike Steven Segal's movie I've ever seen. Very little Segal, acting by myself and I agree with the last reading I read, Nia Peeples steals the exhibition. <br /> <br /> I didn't see anything new here, just the same old things from other valves changed a little. The best action scenes were Nia when she beat her again. It was interesting to see him as a bad boy after he had been watching him for two seasons at Walker, Texas Ranger, who still strikes behind, but for good boys. <br /> <br />
