I heard good and scary good comments about this movie, but that's not. Obviously, the screenwriter wanted to make a scary horror film, but at the same time, some teen comedies injected for the target audience. Fear and comedy rarely result in good movies, the same applies to MONSTER MAN. <br /> <br /> Not really funny or scary, nor too fun on other levels. <br /> <br /> 39-year-olds have seen my part of horror movies. I've seen some good and terrible, but nowadays, the release of films that are released today is so scary to watch me. Receiving such bad movies these days is what is very disturbing to me. Let's face it, they're producing a lot of nonsense in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, but they were kept there. They are considered "good entertainment" today. - Bollocks!
