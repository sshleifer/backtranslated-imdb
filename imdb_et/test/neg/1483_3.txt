One of those movies where you take predictions that die first and survive. There was something about the film that put me in the zone. I think I'm still looking back and thinking, "Yep still in this tree ... looking at the water." Poor character development. I felt something when they were in danger. I voted for the crack. I found it hard to believe that croc is trying to carry the boat first and when it jumps on a boat, I find it really unlikely. Croc sometimes seems too supernatural ("everyone knows all the vision"). Even when croc attacks, this behavior seems very unrealistic. It is a deadly machine and does not allow victims to escape twice three times in a row, especially when they attack in the water.
