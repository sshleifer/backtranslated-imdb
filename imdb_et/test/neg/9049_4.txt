Eaten Alive plays as bad next year's Cannibal Ferox. The characters are universal, places are undervalued, no tension or tension is created, physical effects are either ridiculously bad or stupidly stolen from other films, and the scenes of tribal attack everywhere are hardly worthy of PG-13. Even animal "cruelty" scenes are more annoying than usual. Only a slightly shocking scene is crazy Jonas, running a little Goldfinger, using a blood-moistened dildo; a scene that is rather odd, not graphic. My beloved wife, her "Romeo and Julia Collector Edition", looked at this movie so it wouldn't be so nasty! And it calls itself a cannibal movie! An all-in-all, real flat strap that fully carries the cannibal tradition. Cannibal Ferox, Luc's follow-up, is a much better example for the genre.
