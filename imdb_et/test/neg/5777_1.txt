A group of teenage shower bags goes to the old mining town, hoping to find gold stings. One hair-cleaned scheme is that the ancient supernatural miner to whom gold belongs does not want to get so easily involved with his treasure, and so the fools begin to send. The literally clich√©-germinating dialogue, terrible action, some unpleasantly dreaded "southern breakthrough", and the lame unmemorable killer, reminiscent of Jeepers Creepers (without this being a natural predisposition for young boys), combine this smell almost invisible. Even the small role of the cult legend actor Karen Black cannot save this aberration. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elina Madison shows (poorly lit) R & D <br /> <br /> My degree: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: TMCX
