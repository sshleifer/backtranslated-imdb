I really would appreciate that "Sex is Comedy" is one of the worst pieces I've ever seen. The film inadvertently describes those that are the worst aspects of French, or at least how they are stereotypical, narcissistic, snobbery, and pseudo-intellectual. I myself am a French-Canadian and I feel a little shame that the creators of this film come from the same culture as me, which should give you an idea of ​​how bad this movie really was! This film is not seen as torture, it had a total lack of humor, and it seemed to me that the whole film would be a documentary that interviewed people who were not famous and talented, as if to celebrate something that had never happened. Rather than watch Auberge Espagnole, Happenstance or Je t'aime ... a la folie, three fantastic contemporary French films.
