Okay, last night, August 18, 2004, I had a clear dissatisfaction with meeting with Mr Van Bebble, showing "The Manson Family" at the Chicago The Underground Film Festival in three of Penny's Chicago. Here's what I say about that. First, the film is clearly hanging on every film by Kenneth Anger, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone and Terry Gilliam. Secondly, after a short Q&A session, Van Bebble said after an exhibition that he had never dealt with Manson's family members or Charli himself, calling them liars and saying he didn't want to do anything about them, the film was based on him (Van Bebble) a trial that saw it all over your living room with TV and news (and I expect from the autobiography and book Helter Skelter, which imitated the narrative directly). So I asked the questions a second time, asking if he was trying to present an external, Mtv, sex and rock zero version and not necessarily a real story. This question has obviously been tortured by a slider who has now slipped "f *** to you, closed f ***, this is the truth! All these other movies are bull **!" Anyway, I didn't even think how ridiculous it was until the next day I read the tag of the movie, "You've heard the story by law ... now you hear that story, as the Manson family says. "Excuse me if this man has never spoken to the family and considers them liars that he doesn't want to do anything, how can he tell them the story in the name of God?" This is the most ridiculous statement I've ever heard! The film was probably seen as the role of sexual narcotics and rock'n in the audience so that it had no difficulty in attracting a small, dimly lit theater, and this was even more evident in men's sexual drugs and rock's role. could not even watch his movie without getting up every ten minutes to get more beer or call some rocky horroresque speakers. This film is little more than just attracting the public's reputation for the real events (which helped shape the American state and much of the world) into some sort of Slasher / Comic Book / Porno / Rape fantasy, apparently dreamed of by a low person. br /> <br /> The film was definitely very impressive. The soundtrack was refreshing because it contained real examples of Charlie's work with a family who was out of her Lie album. Editing was nice and messy to simulate the nasty insecurity of the most advanced video films. All in all, this film would have made Mtv's catalogs a much better addition to the Underground Film Festival or, nevertheless, the ideas of intellectual observers. I felt like I was at Rocky Horror at night, watching the audience dressed and behaving (probably the best experience). The cast was very good, except for Charlie, who recalled some of the stones in the Dungeons and the Dragons enthusiast more than the real role he imagined. The images the film gave him as full of energy, ten things throwing at you, and all the time being very physical, did not at all respond to the slow, lethargic and obese presentation that was actually presented. <br /> <br In summary, the film basically explains itself to Sadie (or perhaps Linda), "says," You can write a bunch of bull ** books or make a bunch of bull ** movies, etc. " . "Example: Even a disclaimer based on" True Story "is a dead giveaway that shows that somewhere under this psychedelic trash is based on a real story that contains content that changes and has changed the world. , there is a bit of alchemy to separate the truth from crap or actually, maybe you could just keep it together and read the book. <br /> <br /> All I can say is when the movie ended, I got free beer, so I'm glad I went, but not so glad that I spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to tell you to close f *** to ask the director a question.
