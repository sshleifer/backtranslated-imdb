Playing children gave new fear, KILLER DOLLS, Some movies have not made too much money for this, but I think the only film that Chucky shades is that. video or directly to television, but Pinocchio is not real and the killer is a little girl. Children's imagination is too big and this movie plays it. The role is good and Candance Mckenzie is great. <br /> <br />
