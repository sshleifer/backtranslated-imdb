This film has language, style and attitude ... plus big rides in Occy (world champion) and great Jerry Lopez. John Philbin is surfing on Turtle and surfing is still the best. A real classic that can be seen several times. Nia Peeples is a babe and Laird Hamilton shows things early that have changed her from being the world's greatest surfer.
