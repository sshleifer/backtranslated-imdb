When Las Vegas came out, this review described, as quoted as "Harmless little fluff". Needless to say, after seeing a dozen episodes, this description is correct in money. The choice of boys and the types of models play a lot of paper stories, trying all the time to be serious businessmen. One-dimensional symbols, one-dimensional in shape, following one-dimensional stories. That's a lot of inhibiting Vegas. I look from time to time to see if the exhibition is trying to evolve and take a little serious, but unfortunately no results. So far.
