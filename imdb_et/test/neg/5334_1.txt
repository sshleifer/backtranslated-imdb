Try not to see it. I thought it was good because I'm a fan of 80's movies and I've enjoyed quite a bit of Linnea Quigley's work. I was wrong. I should have said "no" and looked at Gigl instead of what is probably a much better film. I think my biggest problem with this film was his sense of humor. Nothing about it was funny or funny. The actor is bad, even for the Queen of 80s. No story, just random clips. I don't think I should hate it because it was just a fun and silly piece, but I had no fun and I was not once entertained. I had to even get to the end to get the whole mess. I'm sorry, but I can't find zombies that make aerobics funny.
