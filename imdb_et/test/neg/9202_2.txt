First, this film was made in 1978. So it tells you that the movie is bad anyway. But I'm not saying all the old movies are bad. Secondly, the special effects that we even fear for this time. Eventually it was so bad, Bozo The Clown could have done better. It makes you think about how people get money to make this pesky movie. This movie sucks!
