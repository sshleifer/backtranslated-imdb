Like the other worst director films, Ed Wood, this movie is very bad, but that's why it's also very funny. Maybe not everyone, but I laughed a lot. It's a strange thing if you enjoy a bad movie. How to evaluate it? As the film is very low, the entertainment is at least a bit higher. <br /> <br /> The film tries to explain what the transvestite is, and it is done by a researcher (Bela Lugosi) and an inspector (Lyle Talbot) who talks to a doctor (Timothy Farrell) who knows these things. The doctor tells the detective two stories and we see it and probably the scientist. The doctor will draw these stories to read because there is a dead transvestite, suicide and the title of news journalism about gender change. The first and longest story is Glen (Ed Wood himself), who is in love and marries Barbara (Dolores Fuller), but he has never told him that he wants to dress as women when he is called Glend. The film speaks the same and again, especially the fact that transvestite is not necessarily homosexual. The film almost says that being transvestite is not a bad thing, but homosexual is because it tells us that transvestite is not homosexual. Another story is a transvestite who really wants to change sex and not only wants to dress as a woman, but it is much shorter and less interesting. <br /> <br /> A couple of things make this movie very bad and therefore ridiculous. The way the story is presented is the first thing the same things have been talked about over and over and the end result is others. This is not where it ends. The actor is very bad, especially Dolores Fuller seems to read his lines straight from the screen. Everything he says is funny. The whole dialogue hid me a lot of laughter. <br /> <br /> There is also a sequence where someone goes into space. The door stops in half and we see something hanging on the wall, not exactly straight. Then the door, which seems to be the same shot, although we know it is not, is a bit less open and suddenly stops on the wall. Ed Wood did not want to make any mistakes in his film in such a continuum. It may be good, because basically it's just a new smile for today's audience. I think you realize it's a bad movie and I think it's a good chance to laugh at ridiculous mistakes.
