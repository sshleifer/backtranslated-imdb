It is painfully clear that the people who made this "movie" have never seen such brilliant attacks as "Naked Gun" and "Hot Shots". This movie is terrible and so actors. They don't know they would act even when they hit the face, because I felt like doing it in the trash. <br /> <br /> The film is stupid and has no such humor. I'm sure I can make a better movie with my friends. It is amazing to me that the film can't do that much. No smart and funny lines. There is no trace behind it. This is a pathetic film and I would like to meet someone who really likes this movie. Yuck!
