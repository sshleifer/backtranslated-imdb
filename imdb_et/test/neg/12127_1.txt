This movie was terrible. The action was flat, but it is hard to say if anyone was doing well because writing was so bad. This is one of Johnny Depp's worst movies - I reject anyone watching it. <br /> <br /> If you still have to see Cry-Baby, I recommend silencing it and just shouting to Mr. Depp and the hour and half.
