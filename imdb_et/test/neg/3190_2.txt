I'll give this Hollywood Trash 1 out of 10! Seriously! I mean, I like comedy as much as the next man. I can just take foolish comedy and sit and laugh. But this film had nothing to laugh with OR. <br /> <br /> I like almost everyone in this movie. So I thought I would forget what many people told me about it (not to hear my fault). I was just dead when the stupid script was! Just ridiculous and not even funny. The only funny scenes were in the previews that everyone in the theater saw when watching other movies or on TV. I was very disappointed and I really would like to know why these otherwise fairly good actors would read this script and then log in! Bad decision about those parts ... <br /> <br /> ********************* MAJOR SPOILER *********** ************* <br /> <br /> Okay - here's my biggest question about this movie ....... .. how did Paul Reiser go to a therapist who remembers the past!?!?!?!? He dies in the last scene breaking the trash !!!! Can anyone answer me?!?!?!?!? Cinematographers' main players ..... Nobody noticed this?!?!?!?!?!?!
