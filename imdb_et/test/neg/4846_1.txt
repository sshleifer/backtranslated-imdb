I had never heard of Dead Man's Bounty when I saw it in a DVD shop a few weeks ago, and I thought I was descended from an unknown pearl because he had this unique role in Val Kilmer. Unfortunately, there were no more than ten or fifteen minutes in the film to realize that this was an epic proportion of a disaster. The first vision of how this movie is truly terrible begins when you have a bunch of dirtbags in the old salon that laughs like a set of hydrants on a scene that gets about five times too long. It's incredible how bad it is. And unfortunately it is not better. when a dead person is neglected to concentrate half-hearted clusters and the unique urban fiction that I have ever seen in the film. He has played with Boguslaw Linda, who is unable or unwilling to cover his Polish accent, making it impossible for the film to be held in the old western part of America. <br /> <br /> Does Poland have such a border region? I do not know. My knowledge of Polish history is not my strong point, but I can tell you that. Sheriff, as he is known in the movie, is the worst law enforcement I ever remember in the movie. She is introduced to a really ridiculous scene where she wears some kind of eye mirror and the spacious men take turns to take turns. Before they hit him, he explains that they can hit him every time, and then, after the first round, they will hit again each time and if he can identify who is throwing, they will lose. What the hell is that? I'm completely gone to explain why such a scene could ever be filmed. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the sheriff continues to appear in an unstoppable and crushed and drunken and shocked manner until eventually it does nothing but shows up from time to time, stumbling across the screen and knocking "not?" You see, there is a lot to talk and prepare for hanging, the details of which are just as meaningful as the rest of the movie. By the way, it takes place in a city that consists of no more than two ramshackle wooden buildings lying flat against one another, which is more like a road. It is my understanding that this is a part of Poland that should be viewed as acceptable enough, as in the southwestern part of America, where no one, except perhaps a dead man, could have come. <br /> <br /> I have heard that Val Kilmer took on this role because he was interested in his unique role, and also in the use of director Uklanski's minimal dialogue, supporting the comparison of smart timed images in unique visual assemblies. <br /> <br /> Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that Kilimer was unable to overcome what has been a truly satisfying feeling that he must have been given a role. Personally, I feel that I had reached a rather successful level when someone approached me and offered me a few hundred thousand dollars to come and put on for a while. I like to think that he didn't even read the script of this confusion, because when he did, I am completely sorry to understand why he accepted this role. <br /> <br /> The film will in any case open to a man who brings about the death of a man, played by Kilmer, looking for a reward. Soon he finds himself in admiration for a ridiculous love story that includes a city prostitute, an alcoholic sheriff, and many strokes associated with foolish foolish characters. <br /> <br /> There is also an extensive and superfluous understanding of American rituals. In one scene, a man cuts half a cherry tomato and splits half of Kilmer's eyes (for what reason I can't imagine) and then makes a short speech about Kilmer's body, where he explains that he was "one of the best men we ever had," and then he continues to shovel his head. What the hell ?? <br /> <br /> Not yet convinced? Here are a few more reasons not to look at it. In one scene, it seems that the sheriff is covered with ash, except for completely clean areas around his eyes, which can only be described as a bright red lipstick. One man gets a head wound that pulls the head and body into the blood. With blinding, he keeps it with gunpowder. Smart. As a result, the sheriff seems to have a broken hand. While sitting at the bar, he puts a rope around his neck and connects it with his injured hand and uses his good hand to pull the rope, lifting his shaky shoulder in his bad hand toward his mouth, not using his good hand to drink. Also smart. <br /> <br /> Why doesn't he just use his good hand? I have no clue. Like everything in the movie, it makes no sense, like the title. Summer love? Are you kidding? Avoid this confusion at all costs. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, is there something on IMDb Goofs? <br /> <br /> Characters made errors (possible mistakes by filmmakers): This movie has been made. HA!
