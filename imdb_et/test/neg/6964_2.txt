Bela Lugosi as God? Transvestites discussed the film in a straight line in the 1950s? It must be Ed Wood's film. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, I felt guilt, joy and nausea. The story is about Glen (Ed Wood himself) and his cross-dressing alter-ego Glenda. Somehow, when this movie was done, I saw Kevin Kline playing Glen / Glendat. Note how all crossover converters are versions of their man's name (Glen / Glenda, Robert / Roberta, etc.). He tries to portray it sympathetically as a mental disorder, which is a graphical perversion. <br /> <br /> Somehow, Wood will start slavery and S & M sequences on its original story Glen / Glenda. Along with these terrible scenes, Satan himself appears, probably the day of bad hair. There is no dialogue and pace at all, but the film is enjoyable in its context - the strange world of Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Sterno says he puts on his favorite lace panties.
