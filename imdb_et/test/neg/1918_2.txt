Life is too short to destroy two hours of Hollywood nonsense if you are not a married naive 16-year-old girl who has no reality and nothing better to do. Empty characters, bad action (artificial emotion), weak story, slow pace, and the most important misconception for this movie - no one cares about too dramatic relationships.
