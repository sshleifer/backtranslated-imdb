It opens - and half an hour - like the Old Testament educational program, though not without humor. Finally, the film begins to grow in the wings when the Biblical crowds out. In the multiple success scene, Martin Donovan (Jesus) decides to give up the apocalypse and the last quarter of the hour is a kind of humanist "what's all the noise?" play-out, gold-plated with an optimistic assumption against the long shooting of WTC twin towers (retrospectively, unhappy ironically). <br /> <br /> Apart from Donovan's power, it is divided. The rest of the cast is the melodrama: it is officially established for the biblical presentation, but it is suitable for today's paranoid comedy that Hartley wants. But I was also pleasantly surprised by PJ Harvey's contribution (to bear, and in danger, that there would be only a pop-star unit that he has, not just a record label that has been stored in a store and safely on an uneven soundtrack that helps). He was cool - a sort of insecure lack of focus - in the form of many pop icons that have come to the movie (I mean Jagger here), but I still maintained convincing integration with both the production and the project. <Br>> <br /> Ultimately affirmative, but this bittersweet essay is a bit too similar and relies more on commitment than its audience's imagination. 4/10
