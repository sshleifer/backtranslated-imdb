The real star of the last films of the last airport is the big supercar, whose French name is The Concorde. If you keep in mind that the whole movie is dedicated to showing what this needle-shifted plane can do in the sky, the whole film makes sense. <br /> <br /> But if you are looking for a serious drama here, with all the tools, Concorde's evading action will take you here when some nasty people try to hit him. Robert Wagner Industrial Library. One of Wagner's help just happens to tell him about some of Wagner's dirty business deals by selling weapons to people who are not friendly to the US. When the source, Macon McCalman, is killed in front of him and he is almost ready to hit the one he flees, he is facing Wagner with this information. And of course he denies it. But just before the Blakely boards Concorde, McCalman's widow Kathleen Maguire gives her the necessary documents. <br /> <br /> But in Paris, staying in Moscow, Wagner and his minions are trying to put down a big bird. But Alain Deloni, David Warner, and George Kennedy's fearless team are ahead of all their tricks. This is a full bag when you see if you want to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are an aviation enthusiast, you don't have to worry about this plot. It's like a movie with Le Mans Steve McQueen, who has legion auto-racing fans who have made it a cult object. Maybe Le Mans is better because they just didn't bother the story in any way. a child played by Cicely Tyson and Martha Raye, who has a weak bladder who spends the whole trip from Washington to Paris. In fact, he's the best here. /> <br /> I am sure that all those involved got a great payday from this movie, but it seems that he has killed the saga of airport movies.
