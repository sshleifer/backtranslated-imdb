Uuuuaaa! Barf! Yuk! Yuk! Nasty! Puke City! The worst junk that ever made. Sick. Weird. Terrible. That's enough. Keep your nose. Do not eat. After seeing this sick, demented and trashed movie from the movie, you can't eat your food for a week. But maybe that's good. The new food is invented. Go to see this vomiting film. Sick your stomach. And you will be confused by the confusion that you cannot eat for at least a week, and you will lose about 15 pounds. Me Me Lay! With such a name it is really amazing that he has no "cult" fans. He will ever appreciate the worst actor. His films make Ed Woods look like Gone With The Wind. The price of this movie is minus 10.
