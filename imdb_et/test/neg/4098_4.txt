While I enjoy Steve Carrell's work, Evan Almighty, like so many other redundant movies, turned out to be much worse than I expected it to be. <br /> <br /> It turned out to be a cheesy family movie, one that uses a famous comic to improve its image, but ultimately can't offer it. <br /> <br /> The usual humor of Carelli's dork has almost disappeared from the movie, and although he made me a couple of times, there was nothing fun about His three children, although they were probably somehow important for the Biblical character, they were really in the movie and terrible participants. quite useless. Even his wife had a somewhat simple story for the third leg. <br /> <br /> So much money was spent making comedy was a big mistake. Although Carelli's career can benefit from this film, there is no real reason to see it. <br /> <br /> If only a little less of his family, a little more Carelli, Molly Shannon and perhaps some other SNL cast, it could have been a lot more fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10 A few smiles here and there.
