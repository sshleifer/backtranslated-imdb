What's the point? Hasn't it been done before, better? And again? Why Werner Herzog wastes his good talents and time as junk? Shouldn't he be filming somewhere - I mean a real movie? It all seemed fake from the start. Werner Herzog would never have attempted to make a film about the Loch Ness myth - at least not so small as the losers - so that the plot was not credible from the beginning. The actors who should act as they did not act were obviously acting. The story was not interesting, "in everyday life", which was necessary in every memory, was invisible, the personalities were old, the jokes were not funny, the effects were not convincing and the end was not visible. <br /> <br /> I just can't see this point. This is a fake movie of a fake film. Ha, hah. Perhaps, if those who were thinking of such a film tried to make those who mocked people who had really found the real Nessie, there could have been potential now. But Herzog is not a believer and has never claimed. There would have been much more fuel for the crudeool crowd. <br /> <br /> It was gone.
