<br /> <br /> I was fascinated to read the different views of the "circus" between "fantastic, breathtaking, brilliant" and most of the "golden Turkish candidate". I find myself in the last camp. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers probably thought that if they interfered with a lot of overwhelming violence with a four-star strike, they would have another lock, a spare and two barrels to smoke. It is a pity that they forgot to add spirituality, style, charm and elegance. And it was definitely a mistake to visit Welles' classic "The Lady from Shanghai", which reminded us of how much better the cinema is. <br /> <br /> John Hannah gets his shirt everywhere, a huge American rides around in Mini Minor because Circus pathetically carries the status of culture and even the beautiful Amanda Donohoe can't add any class to this procedure. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good British movie try a sublime "Wonderland"
