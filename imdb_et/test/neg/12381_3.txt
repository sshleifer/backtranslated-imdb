Is it so cheesy as they come? The concept of massive and indestructible extraterrestrial birds is already too prominent for words, but wait until you get the burden of a wolf creature as it appears on the screen! I'm telling you that I smiled at this smile that I left out of some of the exposition dialogues? Again, the latter is often so difficult in scientific jargon and in the laws of physics and in such (where I have never been good, despite my love for sci-fi movies) that it is not really important! Lind ?? For the first time, it was simply a blurred form that bounces through the sky, but which was later shown in all its glorious glory? is so strange that it wouldn't be the wrong Looney Tunes comic book (witnessing a series of inter-series photos that begin with the creature at a distance and end up with extreme proximity to their faces)! <br /> <br /> Director Sears had a lot of fine on UARs with his second film EARTH VS. Flying Islands (1956)? with special effects from Captain Ray Harryhausen (of which I've just provided a copy of the latter, waiting for Columbia's recently released SE DVD); it also seems to me that some of the footage illustrating the kidnapping of New York City birds was lifted from the destruction of Washington, which was seen in the earlier sci-fi classic! Again, are games playing a genre regular? namely Jeff Morrow (this ISLAND EARTH [1955]) and Mara Corday (TARANTULA [1955]); Like the FLYING SAUCERS mentioned above, are these titles highly appreciated and loved by fans? consequently, they are much better than sci-fi flowering and after the wrong additions to the strangers / monster cycle (among other things, the FLYING SERPENT [1946], which I haven't watched, and the updating of Larry Cohen's language-in-cheek appeared the same Q : WINGED SERPENT [1982]). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, GIANT CLAW cannot even become a climax? which is so rushed to be "expulsion", citing the movie jetpilot, whose attacks on a missile bird prove to be completely ineffective (ie, before Morrow realizes that it is hidden by an invisible barrier and then has to find out how to go through it). Ultimately, besides the complicated (and honestly annoying) technical extraneous attributes, "so bad, it's good" looking at it: after all, it only takes 74 minutes? and in any case, the bird is so unforgettable a holy creation to always make a big smile for every smile!
