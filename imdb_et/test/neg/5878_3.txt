Technically speaking, this film sucks ... lol. But it is also fun. I don't know if it's deliberately funny. It is terrible in every aspect, this is the only movie I know is 1) a fat guy who plays a thin actor (very obvious) in a fat pants, 2) an attractive 30-something actor who plays a character who should watch out for him 60 at the end of the centuries and 3) the most praise of the plastic yard daisies ever. Don't take this movie seriously, just look at it laughâ€¦.
