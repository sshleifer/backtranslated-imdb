This is one of those "family" movies that I can't imagine that anyone over the age of 9 likes. One group of siblings will discover the "sand fairy" (yes, really), which is conveniently located in the secret passage of their non-eccentric uncle in their home country, where they have come from London. ... And that's all in one sentence. The story tells about the role of magic in childhood and the risk of fulfillment of desires, but neither of these issues has been studied in a way that would be interesting for adults or instructive for children (or vice versa!). The only reason I look at it is to see how boldly Freddie Highmore's outstanding talent differs from the rest of the mediocre performances.
