"Everything" returns with a good sense of humor to a "good burger" that resembles an old-fashioned fast food restaurant. Comedy is terrible, fun is non-stop, and while the clich√© is, the child and the family are passionate about comedy. <br /> <br /> The movie is for all ages, this movie is meant to enjoy, laugh and beautiful a lot of lazy movie on a rainy day, because that would be what I would record, a rainy day. The US gave it today and because I know "All this" is in it, I thought it might be a bit of a burner, but fun, like Keenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell (probably one of the best young duo of this time was terrible together, the pieces came together) and everything worked out and made it fun for some lazy days to get out of the bad day. <br /> <br /> Can I take your order?
