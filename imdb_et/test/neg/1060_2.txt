My Caddy Limo was destroyed !!! Well, I just had it - Drove hoi polloi and many of the selected people around Manhattan for a couple of years. <br /> <br /> It was much more entertaining than the movie I can tell you. Lordy, what a bomb - like a boom in RPG. I also drove a lot more stars in my white Cadd than appeared in such a shack. <br /> <br /> Robert Patrick is a very serious actor and worked hard on the mess he had to do. Unfortunately, Rutger Hauer played his role as a red nose circus clown. If he doesn't take it seriously, why should his audience? The director should have hit her ass in the first hour of the movie. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was written 10 years old by 8 years old. Surprisingly, the kit was no longer split much more. Oh, I'm a fan of the movie - ergo - you have to get bad to get good.
