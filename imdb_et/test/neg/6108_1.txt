As a writer and an outdated Orthodox Jewish woman, I was thrown down by this film. Dialogue is frightening and wasteful, characters who are also engaged in lines ranging from an outrageously prosaic to a stunning melodramate must not expand into truly textured individuals. The one-time musical score tries to make up for bliss by stepping into silence to share the viewer and script with the protracted catatonia. <br /> <br /> Like the revolutionary self-styled tirade of adolescents, it appears in the wisdom of his revelation - the patriarch is wrong - and wastes his energy thoroughly, grabbing at that point. The resulting artistic crime is the complete absence of imaginative development; Moral crime is the decline of people in cartoons: martyrs and grotesque.
