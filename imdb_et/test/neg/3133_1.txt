Great. Another foreign film that thinks it's Fellini. In addition, we need to have more propaganda about the murder of disabled people. <br /> <br /> I see no reason why we have to go through these thinly hidden euthanasia ads. <br /> <br /> I couldn't find anything to redeem this movie. What can be redeemed for a person without the courage to continue, despite some contradictions. It does not take suicide. This is the activity of the coward. Sharing this "desire" with his wife causes him the same illness. If it had been a movie man's courage to continue, despite his problems, similar to Jill Kinmont's story, it would have made a big film. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in seeing the courage, check out Jill Kinmont, a former skier who was turned off after a bad skiing accident.
