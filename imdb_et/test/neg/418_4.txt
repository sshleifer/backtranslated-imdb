Why they didn't follow this book ... I'm really sad and disappointed. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but if you have read the book (maybe recently), it may be very difficult to remain objective. My wife hadn't read the book and she loved the movie. <br /> <br /> The reasons for the disappointment are: 1) Cern's involvement ... gone with the wind, such a shame, a very small part at the beginning of the creation of the antimatter, but even this is not the fact (why not, the fact that Vittoria's father was burned with the first Illuminati brand, as Langdon participated, would have been the ideal start for Movie_ 2) The natural line (dead) between the Pope and Camerlegno, which has completely disappeared ... it completely screws the motive of theft of antimatter 3) Langdon and Vittoria Vetra The story-line is completely non-existent <br /> All-in-all, too flaky storyline, and doesn't understand that Dan Brown has allowed them to resist their name. Maybe I should review this movie again after 10 years if I can no longer remember that great book (fat opportunity to forget the book I'm afraid of) <br /> <br /> Really sorry for the negative assessment that was broken due to expectations
