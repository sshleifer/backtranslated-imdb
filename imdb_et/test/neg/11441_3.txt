Not as bad as the 1992 "Nails" (where Hopper plays "unstable" police), but pretty bad. How can such a big pain film go wrong? This movie can find the way. The story was pretty stupid and the direction of Hopper seemed like he never had before. All the long shots were annoying at first. Much pointless scenes with a lot of meaningless dialogue.
