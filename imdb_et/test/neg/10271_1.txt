Wow. What can I say? I was born in 1960. I love bad TV movies. Love them. I participate. Works. I want to participate. I'm spending this thing watching. I was watching TV last night. How in the world of infinity was the Empire Falls (great name) TV movie for any awards? It was a really great talent. Of course. And they tried great. But how can ANYONE pretend it was OK (for TV goodness)? OK Direction? You know, I wish everyone the best. Really. But I thought Hollywood was a very bad movie with so many honors. Awards? For me, it was a kind of alarm that Hollywood is such a small island population. Cynicism is not really my thing. But wow. - xptyngi
