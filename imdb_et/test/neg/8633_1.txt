* Spoiler Disorder! * It's just me nervous some people have to re-(and I use the word loosely here ..) good movies. In the American version of this Dutch thriller, someone decided that the original end was not sufficiently pasteurized for the American audience. what are they doing then? they create a new one! stupid, unlikely, i-pretending- I'm dead, but-fire-life-again-so-good-dude-can-kick-my-butt-a little more end. do yourself a favor and get original.
