Talk about the cage. This 3rd speed biker movie made me sleep as soon as the opening credits came on the screen. It is a shame that many good actors were cast, including George Kennedy, Karen Black, Leo Gordon, Richard Lynch, Lance Henrik and William Forsythe. This is basically the story of a former US Army Green Beret (Henriksen), who is trying to help someone get rid of one of the horses in the city of horrible bikers. <br /> <br /> Everyone is trying, but the script is at the class level. Sad to see the academic award winner Kennedy in a compromise that is within her reach at Cool Hand Luke. <br /> <br /> If you have difficulty sleeping at night, this would be the perfect movie video to rent .......... you sleep at some time!
