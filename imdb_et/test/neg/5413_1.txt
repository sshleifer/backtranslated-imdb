Wow where to start. Well, if you enjoy laughing at the complete failure of filmmakers, that's for you. I bought this movie for 5 bucks because I never gave a chance to laugh at B movie God Casper Van Dien's mistake and the boy was one of them. Perhaps it was that this film contained one of the most flat movie monsters. This thing, which should be a ghost of India, looks like a plastic candy bowl as a skeleton that you put on your Halloween. She dons cape, which is clearly a garbage bag, with what seems to be a bucket-shaped hood over the head. At some point, this is a costume, the other of which is clearly a plastic profile on a horse. In this monster, there is a surprising ability to see a "predator" vision, a clear hanging, and it can appear after breastfeeding. Sometimes the spear cuts into the spear, sometimes it is not. This thing also succeeds with a helicopter with an arrow. Wow, that makes a lot of sense when a child blows a spacecraft with "Critters". This creature is waterproof to the bullets, but somehow dies at the end of the film. At the end of his deadly fear, which we never know why he's turned on, he gets up. This is an incredible game because we had already seen this thing three times in the air. But I think the last time was charm. <br /> <br /> And I don't even start with the fools of other characters. First, what does Delta Force work for women? Last time I checked that the army would not let women continue to fight in situations. It is also a "secret" device. Why? What would be their cause? And they are not even good at this, I think no one would understand that they would be military if they had no uniforms. such as BB guns and others, canons). There is one part when a skeleton man throws off some of the construction workers, and you can clearly see the pillow they fall. In the second point. Michael Rooker falls down a hill that is clearly flat. They tilted the camera in a slightly inclined appearance, but it is clearly pushed out at this looooooonnnnnggggggg drop point. When he is helped up the hill, the rope is flat and when it shows the top of the woman's "hill", the rope goes up from its grip, not the way it would look when someone pulls up the hill. Rooker actually has a line that says, "I won't go after him, I'll go after that." What? It's quite likely what I've ever heard, and I look at these bad movies as a hobby. The saddest part about this quote is that you can say that all the people involved in writing / producing this movie thought it was so bad. Believe it or not, it is good compared to the rest of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> Functional, bad. Makeup, really bad. These characters had scars or wounds that wanted to change their faces. Perhaps the foreigners are scars that want to run around their faces. Yes, I think I'm going to make a movie about it, "an attack of strange scars that is moving on your face." This villain would be more scary than the skeleton man and the film would probably be scary.
