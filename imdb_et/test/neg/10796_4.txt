First of all, since I am one of those people who have never seen a broken version of this movie MST3K, I can't comment on it. <br /> <br /> But I see this original version of the movie on the Sci-Fi channel and I thought it was as good as anything else on this Channel. In fact, I thought it was one of their better deals. <br /> <br /> Based on the comments I have made here, people who write in detail about SOULTAKER with intelligence, thinking and maturity tend to have at least some things about this movie and right. In the original paragraph, I think the most reasonable people would think it would be at least 4 or 5 out of 10. Five is for me, and I think this movie is for an average Sci Fi picture. <br /> <br /> Unlike the above, I have also noticed that the reviewers, the dumb and the flip-flops, and the resulting arrivals I stand for, are the same as those who find nothing good about this movie and basically trash it without a reason, MOSTLY see, that it is chopped and breaks into MST3K. Or, if they have seen both cuts, it seems that at the beginning of the MST3K, it was greatly damaged.
