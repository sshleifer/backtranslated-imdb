The downstream casting (and direction) is more meaningless than inspired by this noir clunker, which is not able to get off the ground from the beginning. Robert Taylor's wooden style is almost instantaneous to Kate Hepburn and from the beginning to the poor chemistry. <br /> <br /> Naughty and innocent Ann Hamilton (Hepburn) falls on the beautiful aircraft manufacturer Alan Garroway (Taylor) and robs him to the altar. He will soon discover that there is a lot he does not know about him. As Alan gets farther away, she goes back to a debilitating past and Ann will soon live a nightmare instead of an American dream. <br /> <br /> The down stream is similar to some Hitchcock plots, but Vincent Minnelli quickly detects that he is not in intercourse. Hepburn is not a shrinking purple and it is hard to sell to a character that is more suitable for the modest styles of Teresa Wright or Joan Fontaine. Minnell will never succeed in letting Kate to desperately let Taylor act as a limited actor. His efforts have met so quiet Gish when Taylor's widespread descent goes back to Bela Lugos. Robert Mitchum ends up as a sensitive brother. Talk about the piling. <br /> <br /> Operator Karl Freund offers some highly styled noir interiors, but Minnell and Cast use a gentle atmosphere and tensions remain gentle. What Minnell is far from his forte (musicals) and the role of the Hebrew victim, which suits him as a bad suit Downhill drowns all involved.
