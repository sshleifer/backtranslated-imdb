Robin Williams is great in this movie and it is a pity that the material is not enough for him. It can work when you buy "U-S-A! Number One!" mentality, but the story wise that nothing happens. It is quite shameful that the film is really trying to say something and sincerely says it. It just doesn't offer enough emotional punch.
