Awful, terrible, terrible. The actors are bad, the music is ridiculous and filming is pathetic. I rented a DVD and had to force myself to finish it. <br /> <br /> My advice: read the book, it's much better, and you don't have to give all those stupid pictures and the ridiculous dreams Catherine has. <br /> <br /> I think I've never watched such a bad movie.
