It's 1 hour and 24 minutes of pure boredom! <br /> <br /> In this "Action" movie, even the Baldwin gun (HK G3A3) uses wonders. It was sent to the armed forces for recycling around the world in the mid-eighties and is now used only by terrorists, bank robbers and military museums. <br /> <br /> If I had known this movie, I'd better watch 10 MacGyver episodes that save the planet. <br /> <br /> There are no grooves, no rides or no feelings. See the Tupperware Channel? it is more of a departure than this unfortunate excuse for the movie. This movie does not deserve the scale "0". Good luck next time, Baldwin. So far, I'm sitting here to grow my toenails? it goes much more than "Target"?
