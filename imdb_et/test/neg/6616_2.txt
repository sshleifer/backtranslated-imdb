"Season on the Brink" is one of my favorite books of all time - an insightful uncertain look at Bob Knight and his Indiana Hoosiers. And Dennehy is one of my favorite supporters all the time. So I did look at this adaptation. <br /> <br /> It was disappointed at every level. Dennehy's performance was less than inspired, and it seemed he was not ready to play Knight - as he had played a role just before filming. The rest of the majority is not much better. <br /> <br /> And it was obvious that it was ESPN's first film. It was poorly managed, poorly filmed, and lack of budget was evident at any time in the simulation of games (smaller gyms, empty seats, etc.).
