Steven Seagal is back! Here's her third movie this year. Of course, as a one-time fan who's getting more and more satisfied, I can say it's not surprising that it's pretty flat. First, the film made headlines because Seagal caused obvious problems in production. He turned out late, changed the script, the team, etc., and usually causes problems for the director, Don E Faun Leroy (his lack of talents is enough!). It also happens in their second collaboration, a coming mercenary who promises to be as bad as this garbage. It is also a major turning point in Seagale's quarry, as this film is the first to really excavate the film material. Ticker was a bit, but this film takes a cookie. They borrow from The Order (Van Damme film, Seagals biggest rival in DTV films!) No Conduct, Undisputed, and also a whole sequence of activities known as the little known Peter Weller star of Top Of The World. Interestingly, the auto-chase stolen from Weller's epic, made almost 10 years ago and ironically probably cheaper than this garbage, is actually the best action of the film. I was quite shocked when Dolph Lundgren had a brief view of the stock-taking video world, which, fortunately, he escaped. However, Seagal is the leader in the DTV market, Van Damme and Snipes with its main competitors. Seagal still manages to sell movies and I don't know about my life. Certainly, fans of this terrible must go forever, longing to return to the law. The story here is completely flat. In fact, the film has so many holes in the plot that it doesn't mean. For example, at the end of the film, there is a little girl who probably knows at Seagal in the orphanage she is giving. Why I don't know, but we never see him in the rest of the movie or hear him. In this movie, Seagal has a girlfriend girl who is psychic at the beginning of the film and worships with visions that have never been explained at the end of the film and mean nothing. The film is so ridiculously glued to a series of senseless priesthood that becomes headache. That's far from the Seagull dumbs! Seagal himself is both wood and never before, but he can't duplicate his credit as much as I can. But Seagal feels the need to talk like he is a gangsta rapper, making me a long time when he put his Brooklyn / Italian-American accent in his classic early films. He also has a painfully double act with Treach, whom I assume is a rapper. It's funny how manufacturers think Seagal and the hip-hop combination seem to work because his team with DMX at Exit Wound was his most successful film after Siege. It is clear that if no one has heard of the rapper, it will not work. It is an action film and so must it act itself. Unfortunately, the activity created by the NU Image back directory is not strictly customary. There are some small fighting scenes with some classic Seagal Aikido, but when 90% of their stunt-double who have really worked in this movie are not really impressive. There are also some conventional weapons battles that really only have a nice violent and bloody squibbage. All in all, this is a painfully boring experience and again I have missed the same judgment: Seagal has lost it! I now ask the age-old question, "Why do people still watch their movies?" This is a very good and good question, but a sad bastard, which I continue to look at in the hope that his films can do something good. Unlike Seagall's ever-expanding waistline, the chances are small. * 1/2
