Clifton Webb is one of my favorites. But Mister Scoutmaster is not his best. His patented role-playing role seems to be forced and even unpleasant, not funny. The film itself is full of mawkish sentimentality. In addition, the viewer provides numerous references to religious beliefs and US patriotism, which are more respectful than genuine. Clifton Webb does its best with a bad script. Edmund Gwenn still plays a unified spiritual clergyman and is not allowed to do anything. The child's actor's leadership is played by a talentless child who shows the smooth effect of the entire film. His only requirement of fame as a performer is obviously an unusual owl that is unusual for someone of his age. When you have heard it, you have heard it and you don't have to hear it anymore. Unfortunately, he is in the scenes of most movies. I find this child so irritating that it accelerates when it appears. Because he has a lot of scenes on this film, it means I hurry a lot of movies. There were and there are so many talented babysitters; sorry that this movie has none of them. Yet Clifton Webb is a traditional wide-brimmed hat and shorts in the field of vision.
