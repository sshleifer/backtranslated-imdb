This film looked like it was captured by a videophone, it had a very small plot and unnecessary nudity. The film never came together and didn't make much sense, and of course, there were some unnecessary boob shots for this movie. The director apparently tried to make the film subjective and different, but it never provided enough information about what actually happened, even in the end I was angry and confused. Confusion about the lack of plot and anger because I wanted my two dollars to be blocked and 1.5 hours back from my life. They should have a payment program for people who rent this movie at random.
