LORD PROTECTOR is a childhood, but whose children? Obviously, it is shot on television or CTV that this amateur rehash of KRULL has something of stock characters - magician, assassin, warrior, scientist - on something or other path to defeat the dark forces that will conquer their planet. Poorly written, acted and staged in accessible California locations such as municipal parks and ranch, LORD PROTECTOR has nothing to suggest, not even a run of time. Jay Underwood is the only "name" actor and most people, especially as a five-year-old, do not remember the ancient price of Disney, which is NOT FOR PEOPLE. A non-named actor who plays a wizard in a wrong silver wig plays it at least with a tongue that is firmly seated in the cheek, while the actors around him act like a KING LEAR dinner production. I was hoping at least for a decent action or a series of special effects. Unfortunately, the sequences of action have been pathetically staged and the few special effects are the old-fashioned colored cartoons we saw on the fantasy flicks of the 1950s and 1960s, like Bert Gordon's THE MAGIC SWORD. The filmmakers planned a sequel that was never gracious. Often such cheap Hollywood back-lot productions use a combination of legitimate and pornographic characters. I kept myself in the seemingly intermittent time of the movie, trying to understand what it was like. I didn't have much luck.
