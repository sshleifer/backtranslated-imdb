When I wanted to, I couldn't mess it up. After seeing the dark harvest 1 I thought it should be the worst film ever made, then I looked at Dark Harvest 2 and it made 1 look a little better. Then I looked at Dark Harvest 3 or tried. The only thing I have to say is "when will it end?" Very bad performance and really bad special effects, the only good thing about this movie was the boob shot. Don't waste your money on this mess ... And now I have to write three more lines to present it. I started singing the song, but I can't think of it right now. But the movie finally ended (though it had an end, which could mean they're going to make one more of them)
