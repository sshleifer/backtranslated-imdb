Fortunately, a brief mystery about a telephone operator who has been discovered as a robbed daughter of a track. The discovery leads to a test of his life, which Charlie Ruggles is a "crime deflector". Things get dangerous when everyone reaches the title location and the second is done for girls. Your enjoyment of this movie depends on your tolerance to Rugggles and his nonsense. Usually Ruggle likes it, but this role had something that rubbed me wrong. In fact, I think it doesn't help that the mystery was not very good, so nothing went beyond the characters to keep you looking. yes, the train's final was exciting, but it didn't compensate for everything that went before. Don't pay for a search, but if you stumble, try it.
