This is a fair film for good single viewing. The plot has worked quite well for an image that is a pleasant surprise, as it works, which is a bit of a tooth, better than usual for this type of valve. <br /> <br /> "Special effects" are fun - a translucent giant and blatant polystyrene / papier mache hand that rolls in a convincing way. <br /> <br /> Be sure to look at the value of goat entertainment once. > <br /> 5/10.
