I just rented Blackwater Valley Exorcism because the cover and pictures seemed terrifying, and I usually don't watch movies that are automatically released on DVD, but it seemed so interesting and scary! I was very spirited for a good scary movie, and for me, mastery is one of the most frightening topics to watch or learn. Just look at Emily Rose's exorcist or exorcism, so amazing movies that made breakthroughs not only in horror, but also in the story. <br /> <br /> Blackwater Valley Exorcism is about a girl, Isabelle who comes from it goes automatically, so we can't even tell what person she started. But the former husband beater turned to the priest with a gardener ...? I know, I know. Then they went to the priest and the sister of Isabella to many other stories, and the priest struck the sister and confused Isabella? I'm not sure we'll get the story of Isabelle's father and his question about his wife's loyalty. <br /> <br /> I mean that the story goes too far and wasn't well developed at all. Not to mention that exorcism does not seem to be an authentic and a bit frightening of his pants in the type of film I didn't like at all, because I couldn't take it seriously. The person who directed and wrote it was obviously no idea where to go or how to direct the story so I wouldn't recommend it. <br /> <br /> 2/10
