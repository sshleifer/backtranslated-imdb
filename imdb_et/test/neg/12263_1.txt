I have no tendency to tempt and my expectations were small to start, but how did it seem like a good idea? Just because you have a camera, some big actor friends and talent confusion mean you should go and shoot. It should have been the cinematographic equivalent of singing in the shower, i.e. it should never have been visible in daylight. But somehow it was a garbage distributor that would help him escape the 3-foot four-foot cab. It gets worse off. Talking about a low budget, one scene of torture is made up of a boy who gets him the coffee he is thrown out when he's tied up in a chair. Obviously, it is very painful because a big child is going to torture the torment .... maybe he ordered caffeine !! Action is worse than wood (I could look 30 seconds before the tree bored, if you look at this garbage for a long time if you are a better man than me!) And the fight scenes would be a playground for the nursery at home. Don't touch this movie if you don't feel the pain (in this case, you should try lukewarm coffee on your own). I would like to say that it is so bad that it is good, but it is really terrible.
