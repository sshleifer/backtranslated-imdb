Undoubtedly, the least Spaghetti from the western countries I have recently watched: basically Leone THE GOOD, BAD and UGLY (1966) with a small crash that has three different characters that cross each other (and sometimes form shaky joints) in their search for hidden gold. Leonard Maltin rated it as BOMB; although it is safe enough, it is also completely routine and the three main roles of stereotypes are deadly, ie uninteresting: Eddie Byrnes is a bank employee who has ideas for transporting his shipment; Gilbert Roland is a "legendary" but aging Mexican bandit (his excitement to Spain is excited to be horny!), Who is probably still irresistible to women; George Hilton as an enigmatic ball hunter is trying too hard to mimic a Clint Eastwood man with no name. Director Castellari - whom I saw in the retrospective of the Italian B-film at the Venice Film Festival in 2004, where he came as the strangest leader of the cult films! - shows a little real feeling to the West (due to the strength of the superiority of the two genres Franco Nero's efforts, I ordered his cooperation with Castellari KEOMA [1976] ... I hold my fingers now!) and the language-in-cheek approach to the film is equally regrettable.
