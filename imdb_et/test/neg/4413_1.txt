I saw this movie once in my childhood at the North Park in Madrid in 1959 when it was released, and I was 11. It was one of the three features shown on that day. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen it, but I wanted to, because I am a movie buff and appreciate the terrible, cool and good movies. <br /> <br /> The most pleasant thing is that more sophisticated audience members, consisting of 8 to 15-year-olds, laughing at a wooden monster. <br /> <br /> The triple bill on the 3 adventure movie theater is something that 11-year-olds will not forget, but I don't remember the names of the other two films. (One made a star by George Montgomery and David Farrari.) <br /> <br /> UPDATE: The other two films on a triple bill were much better. They were Watus, 1959, starring George Montgomery and David Farrar and "The Angry Red Planet", 1959 with Gerald Mohr and Naura Hayden. Mrs Hayden has written a couple of books on health and fitness.
