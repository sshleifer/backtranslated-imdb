An excellent example of a disaster that occurs when you combine a complex scenario with two physical complainants. For me, the first time I watch the movie, I am aware that I act consciously, because I just try to go on the story and record the analysis for the second viewing. In "Full Ride" the actor was so weak that it was impossible to read the film; I was too busy (at first and only viewing) to alternate between laughter and nausea. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, most of the cast individual members are pretty much all in the band are weak, individual talent constraints are not the opposite of real competence. Riley Smith and Meredith Monroe are at least physically fit to find that their trusted age is too old to have a common basis. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the script requires extremely intense and convincing performances to portray the characters that simply reveal the flaw of Smith's and Monroe's fabulous talent. On the positive side, they know enough that they do not see the camera directly and do not turn. <br /> <br /> It is better to use a less attractive pair that could physically pass the correct age. The main story is not very original, but another variation of "Officer and Gentleman", but it would have given a nice presentation to a talented "teen" actor couple. <br /> <br /> I know? I'm just a kid.
