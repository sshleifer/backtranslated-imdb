This movie was terrible, especially with the work that was supposed to be in its production. Although it is not as bad as Ax 'Em, it is very terrible. Take into account the obvious hangings of the missing ship Gladiator and Raiders and what can you get? This terrifying makeup and wood-working master. <br /> <br /> The movie starts today when most zombie movies do. Editing the sections of interest and the current outbreak radio. We see our hero (Ryn, probably the most recent "zombie hunter" in the modern age, counting about four or five times when he scratched his head with the barrel of his pistol or looked down at the barrel), interrupting the fingers of zombies. Later we find out that these fingers are collected for bounties. <br /> <br /> Well, Ryn seems to be rebellious in the way zombies are released; so far to buy his French friend Hans (who is not really French, speaks of a strange Middle Eastern accent). When Ryn uses Chum to collect a rich ball from the lost Hills, all hell breaks open. <br /> <br /> And talk about the horror of the movie. Zombies are put together quite badly. I've seen comments that praise their make-up, but I think it was quite amateur. Zombies' face was used with obvious Halloween glues and there were points where one girl looked like she was a clown mask instead of a freshly peeled face. Oy Vey. For the next sixty minutes, a couple of lines will be summarized: Ryn is back with Hans (who was engaged in some other zombie hunter, Blythe is the leader), gives him another chance, Hans returns, then Hans and goes to Union City where he finds Blythe poisoning to make a profit for a bird. <br /> <br /> It's really a piece of land. When Ryn arrives at Union City, all the bad things come together in a house that is probably so big that Ryn's hours will reach the top floor. People die, Ryn lives and the movie ends with one of those cynical "does he intend to kill himself?" scenes. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILERS * I have to blame most of this confusion on Nott. The direction was terrible. Every character had a horse except Hans, who was the best "actor" in this MacBeth group. When they arrive at Union City, the zombies also attack the crew and the zombies were probably not given any tips or ideas on how to walk as if their impurities were rotting. One woman sucks as if she was walking in the air on Sunday. <br /> <br /> Some movies are terrible. This movie is one of them just because the logic to keep creativity seemed logical. It works from time to time, but this is not the case (where the story was already hidden). <br /> <br /> Avoid it if you do not want a good laugh.
