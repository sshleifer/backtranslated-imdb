The story is divorced and poorly written. We are given threads and one possible hook, just to disappear. When a writer is struggling to read his work diligently, it is obvious that the Madsden character's initial problem and encounter with a "bad" girl suggest that they try to join each other calmly to solve these problems. <br /> <br /> The problem doesn't go anywhere. The relationship goes somewhere. And there is no sexual tension in any relationship. No one complains and nobody is tempting. Writing and managing is ridiculous. You may feel that someone is struggling with confusion and moving the story to focus on catching some excitement. Missing. The writer / director is just a beginner whose confused efforts somehow became a film. Simple mistakes like "... they took the polaroids ..." - in Japan in 2007. this film represents an insult, such as nudity for eroticism. You can't make them much worse. <br /> <br /> And in the talent list "Madsden", the manufacturers thought they had some success. He's hardly acting. Asia is definitely ... and the result is a heroin-stylish bet. <br /> <br /> Give him a big draw.
