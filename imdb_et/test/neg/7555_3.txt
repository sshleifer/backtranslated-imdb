I've never seen a movie that betrayed me more than Lord of The Dance. Disappointed because it could have been fantastic. Disappointed because dancing could have been amazing. Disappointed because women could be proud. How would I know that ?! By the time your eyes have moved to the area of ​​interest and focused on the spot, the crazy editor has moved the picture! Here I agree with other comments on dirty lighting and terrible camera / editor work. It makes me nauseous, but I look at it for ten minutes to be an impressive film. <br /> <br /> Give me the chance to get to the live concert and I was shot there! <br /> <br /> Nicholas T
