When I first saw "Race Against Fear" (don't you just love LMN movie titles?), I had to scratch my head. Was it supposed to be serious? Why didn't the protagonist even work as normal, much less than the star? How did I know the coach was only 1 minute in the movie? All these questions and answers are missing. Then just let the unsuccessful script and the terrible leadership take me away ... it was easier not to resist ... then the movie was a bit more fun for a minute, and I'll do it now in my ten junk movies from LMN. Some have said here that Ariana Richards is really talented, but the material was faulty - I disagree with the heart. Not only can he convince me that he is an athlete, he walks through the rest of the story as he has just landed. Maybe the trainer broke from the prison and stopped at least ... I hope so.
