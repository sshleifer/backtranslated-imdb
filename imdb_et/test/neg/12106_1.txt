I don't even know where to start. It didn't like me. It didn't behave like a story and so much injection into the film (pot biscuits, son was gay (?), Murder was justified, what was the possible reason for Linda or Penelope's existence) that had ever explained. It was all the liquid spread on the table and fell off dropwise until it all became a big mess on the floor. Why did Diane Wiest use her bearings on Broadway character over the camp for fun? Why did Jane Birkin's lead start? The list is endless. The movie ended and we all watched each other - as you understood it? <br /> <br /> I say one thing when I looked at my long lost father being murdered Do not understand the murderer. Say another thing, when "Bob" broke "Bob" for what the son was hiding in the closet? Did Bob start sex with Bob in front of his son? How could the murderer get in touch with the boy so easily? <br /> <br /> If this review sounds confusing, it is because it was a waste of movies, talents and time. What the hell did the dead shrink something to do !! <br /> <br /> Jezz, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen because it should be / could have been better, stronger and it should have made no sense. In any sense. Instead, we are given "Diva" (70's film with murder) and tired performances that read boring words from scanned scripts. <br /> <br /> People through it. Or maybe I and the rest of the people who watched this movie are too stupid to understand all this - after all, I mean, it's a French movie.
