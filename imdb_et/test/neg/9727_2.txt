I feel very generous by giving this movie 10. Okay, he noted that the special effects are "okay" and Renny Harlin made one of my favorite genetically modified-shark-attack-a-research movie, which you know as the Deep Blue Sea. Opening credits are also made with WhiteZombie remix "for a more human person" and it goes well in the context of this "movie". But, thank you very much, allow this movie to suck so much. <br /> <br /> Not because Uwe Boll is alone in the dark when I ever felt that the special effects in the film have been completely wasted, and our story begins with four men who are the descendants of four different families, all of whom have never been fully explained power has ever been fully explained from a family background that has never fully explained the art of witchcraft. Oh and for some reason these descendants are all 17, everyone goes to the same school, everyone is swim team and all, for some reason or another, sit down in bed with their shirts, sweat and talk to each other, I have nothing against homosexual, gothic or thirteen years old, but this is what this movie is at ... 13-year-old goth who doubts their sexuality about who sits in their bed in their panties or whatever, but how do they take their shirts off? Hey the only fair one. <br /> <br /> In any case, the characters in this movie say that when they turn 18, they get up and get new deep, almost god-like powers. But before I go any further, I forgot to mention that when they use their power, they grow older and become more addicted. This explains why they got people at the end of their 20s to play for 17 years. Oh, and if something needs clarification, don't worry, someone explains it all in one big dialogue. God this movie sucks ... where was I? Oh yes, the resurrection part. Okay, apparently there was a super-secret-alpha family, some of whom forgot or some that I don't know i was at that point. But they were written about how and a new child with friends to communicate with is "secretly" one of the descendants of the fifth family. And I say "secretly" because anyone who has previewed this movie knows that this new man is a bad guy. He has more power than others because he is older, I think. Anyway, Bob Loblaw (say it out loud) things happen and we're going to the final battle of the movie. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I was a witch battle throughout the game. You know like Saurmon vs. Gandalf or something with a magical battle because you know it's about witches and things. Now that these two witches are dropping off, the more they like ... how do I get this ... very, very mad Dragonball Z type version of the battle. They throw things to each other, talk, throw things, talk, throw things, talk, and the like. When I say 'throw stuff', I only say that because I have no idea what F #% k is throwing each other. It looks like it's a big slippery water. God this film sucks in any case, when our main witch "rises", she does not get powerful at all. He just throws larger slippery water. Things happen and it ends so that you as a viewer know its end. Good witch beats bad witch loses. <br /> <br /> You know how a movie is when a bad guy says something so incredibly stupid as: "I put you on my Wiotch. I see it all while sitting ... <br /> <br /> Yes, I admit that thinking of battle battles, using today's powers doesn't sound cool, but if it is bad, I really wanted them not to movie. Maybe if it were an R-rating, chicks and more deaths, he might have worked ... could have worked. <br /> <br /> Buy or even rent. Wait until it reaches or lends it to your buyer who bought it. Don't waste your time hacking this movie. If you spend on it, it is a good opportunity to continue your efforts in what Uwe Boll does, "in Contract 2: Solitary in the Dark with the House of the Dead".
