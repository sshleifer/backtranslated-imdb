This movie is based on Stephen King's novel, where the mysterious new merchant Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow) offers every citizen of Castle Rock the most desire, but they have to pay a high price for these deals. Local sheriff Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) will soon be forced to deal with a number of brutal deaths and suspicious circumstances. <br /> <br /> Stephen King's cinema below average: I see some people think it's boring. It pulls away without genuine intimidation and forces the viewer to spend time (again) with a bunch of frightening losers whose anger is terrible. <br /> <br /> I enjoy this novel and do not think this incomplete film will make it fair. There are too many regrettable changes from the book to the screen. <br /> <br /> Von Sydow makes Gaunt much more charming. We have to be in time for SCuntunt Gaunt, he didn't care. I also hate that the sheriff's first deputy (Ray McKinnon) has written and depicted such a tedious, Barney Fife-type moron. The star Ed Harris looks like he would be forced by his agent to take that picture, but the professional that he has will pull his teeth into his dialogue. Bonnie Bedelia (Polly, for Pangborne's love) and Amanda Plummer (with her spiritually unbalanced roles) are the closest to the symbols that are pleasing. <br /> <br /> But it is also unpleasant and meaningful. <br /> <br /> Although I've dared not feel a little bit cathartic when looking at a lot of unlikely movie characters, there are tears. There are some good explosions at the peak. <br /> <br /> I often give the films a better rating than they probably deserve, but in that case I feel I should really be honest and just say: 3/10.
