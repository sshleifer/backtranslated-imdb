One of the worst films I've seen in 2009: the story hesitates between silly thriller or foolish comedy. <br /> <br /> When the comments happen, the gap is full of long, boring dialogues that make no sense! <br /> <br /> Cast is famous but does not bring emotions but play on! <br /> <br /> And it's happening in a seaside hotel that looks really grim. For comparison, one of the "Shining" is an amusement park! <br /> <br /> NB! Many users think it's located in the French Riviera! They're wrong! It is not in southern France (Nice, Cannes), but quite the opposite: Cabourg & Normandy to be a simple D-day beaches! That's why the sea is both gray and heaven and there is no sun!
