If I could give this film a negative opinion I would like. Humor is tougher than I've ever seen in a movie. Terrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered from their own fault. There are 2 plots, neither of which supports half the movie. Where's the "depth" of this movie? Isn't any good deed unpunished? Can only heartless be successful? The film starts well and black and white are very moody and well done. The actor is very good and the convincing witch makes the cruel humor even more terrible. If you think 3 Stooges are too nice for each other when you look at Bowie's knife being kidnapped on the victim, the real thigh blow, if you thought "Schindler's list" was fun, then this movie is for you.
