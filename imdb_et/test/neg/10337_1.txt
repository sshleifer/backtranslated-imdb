I hafta look at it all the time to see if there are any redeemable features that would justify its inclusion in the video libraries of its customers. Don't look at it, not even in a few minutes, if no one is able to get a gun with his head. Just like I did, I woke up and dropped at least 500 times and pray that one of the one-dimensional characters who would all play really bad actors would turn and shoot you dead. you are the world's biggest Sandra Bullock fan, it makes no sense to even look at two or three short scenes in which he appears. <br /> <br /> I want to hit the buggy distributor of people who put Sandra's huge picture in the form of this DVD box and are thrown into jail for me or something. I really wish I had the opportunity to read this movie before buying it. <br /> <br /> Please give me a call and I will pay you $ 10 to remove this movie immediately from my stock before stinking all over the place! (just funny - please don't call)
