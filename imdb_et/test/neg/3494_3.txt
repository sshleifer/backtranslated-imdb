Okay, that was very good ... but the best picture? Please, not even close. Munich was better, Capote was much better, Good Night and Good Luck was much better ... Brokeback Mountain - well, it could have won! Academy voters seem to be acting like the current democrats - please do little but dare not take any specific positions. That's why we have complete moral in the US. <br /> <br /> It's been a WORST AA presentation ... and forget about 1987 ... ever since. Hollywood is so terrible that it's not "straight". Many voters probably didn't even see Brokeback Mountain. Get real and get along with it. <br /> <br /> It was the most miserable year because I was in the mid-60s and I was just two. <br /> <br /> Wake up, whoever you are. Hollywood is the mainstream, and it happened to Box Office in 2005. King Kong, the latest Star Wars movie, the second Batman movie, the newest of Charlie and Chocolate Factory, or any other, and much more that will come in 2006. br /> <br /> At least there were original best pictures, Munich, but you heard it before, Capote - great; Katherine Keener could have won, though now we know that Reese can sing like Cash / Carter, etc., was a much better picture of Syriana than Crash. This film has been made since the early 1960s and we have to make it the best movie? What a terrible Oscar night and a terrible year ending in 2005 and another dull year in 2006. At least BAFTA for the best picture went to Brokeback and what a terrible song that won? Pathetic. I think we only have about 20 years in America or the United States before someone arrives and changes things a bit. Perhaps it is China because they own so much of this country ... or India because they have all the high-tech jobs and they are the largest democratic country in the world. <br /> <br /> America has become a fat land, pathetic and stupid. The trash can be found in more locations than Florida, West Virginia, South Dakota and West West. <br /> <br /> Drive through the local McDonaldi or Burger King for good interests. Order everything you want until you get a heart attack. Put yourself out of your misery.
