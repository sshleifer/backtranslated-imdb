Countless historical and cultural errors 0/10 <br /> <br /> Jewish boy named OMAR !!! Hahahaha (2) The brilliant detective was the least intelligent man in the film! (3) Jewish suicide attacks !! It was funny. (4) Hitler and his main weapons went to see the movie center in Paris !!! There are two guards at the doors. !! let me. (5) Brad Pitt crossed over and was painful to look at him. (6) Mr. QT re-writes history, "Hitler was really killed in the theater!" its a funny thing is that people "and i mean stupid people" believe in this piece of land. <br /> <br /> And finally, someone can tell me how this movie made 250 best movies all the time !!! Shame shame, but I wondered how someone likes this movie.
