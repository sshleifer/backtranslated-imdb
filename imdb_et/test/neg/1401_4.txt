Kinda funny how the comments of this movie consistently went downhill, now add me. I think the script could have been saved with better performance and a better script. Together, it was hard to see, and I am not talking about such a topic. <br /> <br /> Sigourney was the best part (I thought the relationship between him and his surviving son was the only new thing this movie was offered to his genre), but even he was left behind. He cannot be blamed for knowing what the driver and / or editor have left on the floor of the cutting room. The whole film had "okay, that's good enough, let's go ahead" to feel when I know that the actors and script were more mined, with good features and interesting topics. > <br /> I don't think it reads as a spoiler, but the perfect example is a scene where Sigourney marches to his son's supposed landlord and has that face on his face and I thought it was someone's face overpriced by to see that someone is living in a mobile home "and sure that the next shot, which is meant to shock us, is sure to be tempted to live in a trailer, not a nice house, like him. <br /> <br /> Like many other posters has noted there are so many better movies like airy scripts that similarly confused families who hit the notes better - "Celebration" is probably the best example I've seen.
