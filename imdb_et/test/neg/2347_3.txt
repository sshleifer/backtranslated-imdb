"Keldris" is an intolerably boring and overly friendly 80-year-old cheese paradise, directed by Kevin Tenney (creator of much better "Witchboard" and "Demon Night"), and is an incredibly unprecedented Patrick Kilpatrick, allegedly representing male feelings. Stimulation is really slow, the knowledge of the plot is too familiar, the monster effects are all but the tightening and the movie opens and ends with a tedious narrative that in some way does not seem to be related to the actual object of the film. Voting continues to frustrate the wind and wind creatures, but what the hell is there no wind? Like many of the 80's horror films, The Cellar deals with cursed mystical monsters hidden in Indian landscapes and cellars and hills. Mance Cashen and his family move into the house, based on what was once the home of Americans, but then white people came and turned to oil fields. Half the script is wasted to explain the monster's origin, but I can easily summarize it for you: the ancient Indian witchdoctor called the creature (which looks like a superfluous paper rat) to destroy the white people who were his land, but he was buried again because I quote, SOB also kills Indians. Mance's very annoying son wakes up randomly from the beast and cannot naturally convince his parents of a big hungry rat in the basement. The allegedly emotional family situation (the father constantly wants his son to love him) is very pathetic and redundant, and the film needs badly more bloodshed; children's film or not. The young hero (Chris Miller) is quite annoying, but we've certainly seen the worst boy actors in the 80's. The "basement" is not highly recommended unless you are, of course, a fan of cheese and usually 80s. A big tiring rat thing is real vision.
