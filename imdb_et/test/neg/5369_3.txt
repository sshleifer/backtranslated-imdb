"Paranormal State" is an interesting exhibition for the most paranormal believers. I like to see what the "team" has to say and what they "find", but I know that the whole performance with its structure and story is fully created. They go to real haunting places and I suspect they are talking to real witnesses. I usually feel that I look at not seeing a fiction, but a real movie that is against reality. Personally, I would not recommend or recommend anyone to look at this indication if you are not the main scare. <br /> <br /> An interesting show. Hold "Ghost Hunters"
