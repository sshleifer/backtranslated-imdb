I haven't been looking at something for a while, but after I have had an accident to sit in this garbage as entertainment, I had to give my thoughts. <br /> <br /> Usually, though bad, there is one redeeming part, be it an actor who was okay, a scene that was a satisfying, attractive cast member or a general sensitive moment. Unfortunately, this is not true here, because the film starts brutally, with a ridiculous shootout that was so poor, I thought it was a practice, and two half-breaks, otherwise known as boys blue conversations next to school. One of these idiots was Daniel Baldwin, who not only played it, but actually directed the garbage, and unlike his brothers, they can't act for the iris. Not that he was here because everything seemed to be an educated dance school. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I only looked at the hour when this DVD was not working, and probably the same fools who did it. So if you have nothing to do, but look at the color dry, look at it as it is just as boring, and it's ideal for getting rid of unwanted guests.
