This movie must be the worst film I've seen. There is a reason why it was MOW (movie of the week). Continuity was all wrong (palm trees in Chicago, although it was filmed in Toronto, Canada), had the desired effect for 2004. HELLO. "The Lord of the Rings" had a better CGI. But I think they also had money for that. The budget will certainly have an effect on the outcome, but anyone who calls this MOW more than 2 years must return to film and teleconference. Next time, keep in mind that care and time will make a classic non-rush hour for a TV cab or TV gateway. I find it hard to buy.
