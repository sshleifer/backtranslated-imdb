I like the CSI concept, but the exhibition has been damaged by some serious wood. The medical examiner has the best features and they convey them to the arc, aside from what the story is creating. Unfortunately, he has little time for the screen. <br /> <br /> Also, why does Jorja Fox always see and act so unhappy? I know that forensic examination is a very serious matter, but the characters seem to be confused with the humorlessness and the total absence of personality. I can't imagine getting to know Sarah Sidle or Catherine Willows; what would you say? I am waiting for an episode when Catherine comes to the remote control at the end of the shift, points to this Grissom, closes it down and rides her up to the next day in the closet.
