Imagine if you want to: Four teenage students have a task to spend the night in a haunted house, St.. Francisville, Louisiana to check for paranormal existence. If you look at it in the dark and late night; you may have hair on the back of the neck a few times. Otherwise, this documentary is a very lazy hang of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. The dialogue is very flat and the actors are nice enough, but they seem to have no real personality. It seems that it will take forever before something real horrors happen. This movie is perfect for sleeping even if you have both eyes open and everything is yak and snack.
