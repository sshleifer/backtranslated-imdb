This movie was one handful that caused me pain. It can be enjoyed by anyone who thinks it would be funny to see his mother in a crowded discotheque full of people who are full of their ridiculous dance, a totally false attempt to be "hip" (letter) of age). It was hard to see Ingrid Bergman's worship of such a deplorable performance on the discotheque floor. I was embarrassed. <br /> <br /> To make things worse, music in music wasn't realistic at all - it's a fake idea for some Hollywood directors about what pop music was like at that time. It is always embarrassing in most of the films of this era - ersatz's music is preserved and bears only painful, similar music that was popular in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Mathau is a hopelessly unsuccessful woman; he just looks harshly grotesque. Hawn's wide-eyed innocence is just too silly. The beautiful neighbor of her apartment is portrayed too seriously and seriously. It looks like Brady's boy who disappeared in this farce. Painful, bad confusion.
