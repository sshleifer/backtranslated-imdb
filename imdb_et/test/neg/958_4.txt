This review includes a partial spoiler. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, "D.O.A." at least it starts as it would be a slippery, fun nonsense piece like Fincher 'Game'. It is the central character (Dennis Quaid) who suffers from a horrible sequence of events that seem to be a twisted and cunning thriller. But the plot rattles moving at a too high pace, leading to a dramatic twist not half way when the character learns that he is poisoned and has only 1-2 days to live. And it just is too big a twist to add the story to the random. Once this is the case, the only way to succeed is to treat someone in this situation as their main psychology, but as their only subject: "D.O.A". it continues as if it were just a normal revelation like any other one you usually encounter in a thriller. The problem is twofold: first, Quaid's action is not convinced that what anyone's situation is likely to happen; and secondly, even if they are convincing, it is difficult to take care of what happens when the most important plot is already premature. The rest of the film is a normal price for such a movie, but it is more annoying than usual, which is characterized by a bit of tortuous contradiction that logically reduces the interesting events of the film. Not convinced that this is a burnt professor or a man who is destined to die: Meg Ryan is so often ditzy and annoying. Another negative feature is the ugly soundtrack of the 80s. Instead, look at the game "The Game", which remains close and characteristic of similar roots, while "D.O.A". drifts into developments that only undermine his own premise. Since the assumption itself is quite intriguing, it is a shame to see that it drowned in a burnt plot.
