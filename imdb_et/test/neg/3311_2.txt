The only reason someone remembers that the steaming load contained in the stool is from Pink Floyd. (Or as they were known, "The Pink Floyd.") Stefan, the really annoying Eurotrash hiker, hooks up with the American model Estelle and they continue to be high and naked on the film ... <br /> <br /> This is what exactly? Are the drugs bad? Or is it only heroin (horse)? The problem is that you don't signal to the characters and even Pink Floyd wasn't their best job. When Steffan overdoses at the end, you're almost happy to get rid of him because he was so annoying.
