There may be some SPOILERS AHEAD, but I doubt it. I have no idea how this scenario will make it go over the shredder. It's terrible. Completely secret. I hung there for 45 minutes (about half the time) and just couldn't keep it. I was a fan of Elijah Wood in the 90s (see "War") and I learned to enjoy Mandy Moore's shifts from bubble to serious (see "Chasing Liberty" which is surprisingly fun). I've seen "Run Lola Run" bits. So I liked it to have been good. It wasn't. No one came to good results. Woodi Jones was flat. He wasn't excited by an imaginative writer (his violent fantasies looked like they were "Christmas story" and his lust was - boring and worrying cross). Potentials are completely unlikely from the first second and I only know that he had to be a "girl" when reading the box. Speaking of the summary - everyone they used to do this work made the movie funny, original, romantic and quite enjoyable. Anyone who was this person should have rewritten this script. Halfway, I no longer care about the characters. Moore Lisa is an aspiring actor who is effervescent and somewhat confusing (for no reason at all), but his ridiculous time game (which should be funny in the presentation) is equal to the rest of the script. There is supposedly a happy, romantic comedy that ends with this turkey - given that they have to work, I can't imagine it. Save your money. Warn your friends. Don't look at this movie.
