I bought the DVD for this movie because I am a fan of William Devane and I was really disappointed with the "Christmas Visit". The movie story is so boring and slow in the development that you want your TV or DVD player to turn off after about half of it. The dialogues are really bad and belong to everyday soap opera, but not in TV. William Devane, for his part, was fine and did a good job, but he did so much better with other films and projects. Meredith Baxter was terrible and could not look at the mother with a warm heart. Instead, he played very cool and was no better than a middle class actor. I absolutely can't recommend this movie. Keep your time and money for it.
