This is one of the toughest cinema parts I've seen for a while. It's also my first review so you can tell me I have to hate that movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, I like my serious movies. I don't like Hollywood too much, I feel like French, Italian, offbeat in the US, or something that tries to communicate something reasonable. <br /> <br /> But it was terrible. Why? 1. The plot (as it was) was absolutely incredible, although the director seems to be a feeling of reality. <br /> <br /> 2. The main character has nothing to suggest to him. Does he smoke coolness or show us his anger? For the sake of prosperity, this guy is an ex-dodgy mafia lawyer. Do we want to take more care because it is also one of the most disadvantaged people you could ever meet? And he smokes ... so he must have deep personal problems. Pop psychology is the best. In the last moments I was almost happy when he was buried in cement. The best place. And I thought it was the only good scene. Or maybe it was because it was so close to the final credits. <br /> <br /> 3. Totally tired and incredible interest in the beautiful girl's main character. He was there just because beautiful girls always have strange sexual relationships with old, old and deep and meaningful persons (as smoking shows). It happens all the time. Really in bad movies that is. <br /> <br /> 4. This pace was so leading. I like slow, I like careful. But it was just deadly. <br /> <br /> A 5-50 set of other things I really can hardly write about. <br /> <br /> Awful.
