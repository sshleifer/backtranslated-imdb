Well Folks, this is another stereotypical portrayal of homosexual life, but the additional downside is bad action, a terrible script, a lack of budget, a terrible sound, and let's not forget the impossible story. <br /> <br /> Christmas is a new York City, and our story focuses on two men, probably some time lovers. One of them is not to let his parents (right, religious typefaces) know that he is gay (adding a story of caution, because this man is as ephemeral as gay boys are coming these days) and his parents come to beat him. They stay in their New York apartment, where he and his lover are decorated just for Christmas. <br /> <br /> The story is still evolving when the parents arrive, no one likes it anyway and - how only obvious and predictable ways - they come to learn there son is gay. The tears are thrown as it was my interest in this film. <br /> <br /> The quarry maker seemed like a local community theater. The lovers of this film are inappropriate and their union does not seem to have any cohesion. <br /> <br /> The landlord is flat and his attempt to be humanistic is malnourished and certainly did not help drag on. <br /> <br /> A draconian friend who enters one "love time" is stereotypical and gives a bad name to the unique art of dragging. <br /> <br /> Although some guys find one lover's nice body in the evening (again stereotypical images), this story doesn't help. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie, especially if you are considering buying. You shoot yourself when you do it!
