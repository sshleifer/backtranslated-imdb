I thought maybe ... it might be good. The early appearance of Re-Animator (Jeffery Combs); a lot of respect for old movies; Troma label front? this movie can be a pearl! I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Fear is a boring, overwhelming and half-hearted respect for fear films. The story is old, young people who penetrate into the house, drunk, love and manipulate things that shouldn't be changed. Most? this is where the recycled film selection is used, this time killing the dead actor Conrad Radzoff. In fact, the only redeeming quality of this film is the performance by Radzoff's actor Ferdy Mayne. The character of Dracula style makes it very well. But like children, it's not as good as combs have only a minimal part. <br /> <br /> The film has no entertaining value and contains only one cool character and one or two scenes that may draw your attention. I do not recommend this movie if you do not want to see anything, and this is the only movie left to block.
