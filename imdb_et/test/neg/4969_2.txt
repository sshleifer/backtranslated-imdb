I finished viewing Mandy Lane about an hour ago and felt that I wanted to come home and get up here to warn everyone who was going to spend money on DVD - DON'T <br /> <br /> low, the operation failure is higher than In Matthew McConaughey's films and up to the end, the plot is all but obvious. Ten out of ten will see the next scene 5 minutes before it starts. The whole film is more or less without a motive or message, and the discovery of the "murderer" simply explains what kills the little interest you left on this issue. What could have saved this low, tedious movie, is a decent sprayer or at least a gore "Slasher" worthy - it won't work out there either. <br /> <br /> If you need a background movie that you can jump on and without anything missing, I recommend buying all the guys in Love Mandy Lane. <br /> <br /> If you are looking to sit and focus your eyes on the screen for more than 15 seconds, I will not.
