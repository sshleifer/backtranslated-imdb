Okay, they'll tell you it's real. They do not list any scriptwriter or director, but viewing one of these films proves to anyone - it's not real how you hoped. Speaking rarely sounds like real natural talking ... but also no voice to be scripted. (maybe loosely written). It seemed to me that it sounded much more than they always tried ad-libi. (which they almost always did badly). Therefore, they knew they were making a film, not just a collection of real natural material. So I'm sure these people knew what was going on, they knew they had certain things that were looking for things that were created ... and they were just told that they surrounded it all. <br /> <br /> ************* 'Major Spoilers' **************** ********* ******** ************************ <br /> <br /> Okay, that's so flat. All people, places or things that may be strange or frightening have magically stumbled upon these people. Let me point out ridiculously obviously the things that happened that I remember. man. <br /> <br /> 2) They find that in the basement, this old medical bag is found with a bloody butcher *. <br /> <br /> 3) They hear the noise of the Armoire, so they open the door slowly - BAM - The cat happens there and jumps directly to the camera as he sinks. <br /> <br /> 4) Then it happens that there is a hole in the wall so that we let our hand ... wow, they pulled out the doll that is wrapped around the muzzle tape. <br /> <br /> 5) Let's go to the attic, uh-oh, it seems to be hard here .... BOOM - The chair moves across the room. <br /> <br /> 6) Time to eat. Oh no! The girl who was afraid of her mistakes had a sandwich ROACH! LOL! .... ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 7) Let's get out of Ouija's table ... oops one of the planet's feet fell off the side of the table. It can't be because people rejected it? (they find there is a ghost called Charles). <br /> <br /> 8) Wait! What was that noise in the chimney ... CLINK - oh my handles fell out. "I think he kept people here." <br /> <br /> 9) Now it's a witty girl who looks at the chimney shaft ... Oh, what she's seeing ... and asking people who aren't looking for a chimney, what it is. SWISH - it falls right on him. (perfect camera shot) It moves on time. It was more of a chain. <br /> <br /> 10) Now we have to separate and "clean" our designated spaces - wouldn't it be if things started to happen to these people one by one ... okay: <br /> <br /> CHICK # 1: Wow, suddenly his room shakes ... but nobody does it. <br /> <br /> DUDE # 1: Actually he says "Charles, is it you Charles ... it can't be you, because you're just my imagination, aren't you Charles. Well guess what he's Hitting over and dragging through the floor. Another happy camera shot. <br /> <br /> CHICK # 2: Hears things .. try to communicate ... and stand there to get abrasives or something. <br /> > DUDE # 2: He was in the attic reaching his hand through the floor and got a splinter .... I don't remember what else. <br /> <br /> 11) Dude # 2 runs, Chick # 2 ... they hear chick and the guy # 1 screams ... they find they are stuck to the wall and fixed to the table. (*) They're leaving. Cut to black. The final text tells us they got safely, they were processed for small cuts. besides they have had nightmares and insomnia, we also discover the next day when they made a 911 call called "Charles". <br /> <br /> ************ * 'Major Spoiler '**************** ****************** Over ********** ********** <br /> <br /> Okay if I heard this movie for the first time, I couldn't wait. I thought it would be real. Real, real. - And more professional, more professional types of people. I love the idea of ​​this type of thing, I would like to see a real haunting material. Before publishing this movie, I saw a couple of comments on the web. They both claimed how fake it was and how stupid people were .. the time passed forgot about the movie .... then I realized that it was never released in theaters. So I found out that it went straight to the video, rented it .... found that every brutal review was absolutely true. It's too bad, I really wanted it to be good. <br /> <br /> I thought randomly: the house didn't seem to be televisions, radios. one has lived there for a long time. Especially this house is really known to haunt ... im pretty sure nobody lives there. But it looks so clean and clean ... and what did the cat do there? There are no neighbors nearby. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, you only want to rent it if you and your friends want to sit there and have fun. or if you heard about it for a long time and it interested you. (You are disappointed if you are looking for a good movie ... or a real movie) <br /> <br /> I thought randomly: I think the producer says, "You see the real" footage. Well technically, is this a real film? Counterfeit Wolves Actual Film Material? Maybe it was his loophole. <br /> <br /> I give this movie one star - strictly speaking about Madame LaLaurie's story. The real story of New Orleans. The best performance was the man who taught participants the equipment of the ghost forest at first. He was probably a real ... or a good actor. <br /> <br />
