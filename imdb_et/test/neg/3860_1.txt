I just watched it to see Joe Morton's early role and honestly wanted me not to bother, he's got and has done a lot better ever since. Do not understand why somebody feels that such foolishness is funny, but everyone own; it is an absolute confusion and no less funny. Don't wait, the ONE line was just funny, with Mr. Kent (Joe) and his family having dinner with this nutty because he's been invited for dinner (only the Lord knows why). Pest to Mr. Kent: You know what it is like a dog, you're there madam Kent: Not recently, Joe's expression was funny, but that's one line that doesn't make great comedy and this dance is so far away that it would be funny to be sent the closest trash, it's just good. Joe Morton - Joy to see you no longer see such garbage; you are a much better and wonderful actress.
