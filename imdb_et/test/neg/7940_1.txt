Asincult's Precinct 13 is an absolute dumbest film I've seen since Charlie Angels 2. This shame lies in the fact that they had good casting and a good prerequisite for working. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ......................................... .................... I know they have said that this film is the successor of the Rio Bravo remake, but did the writers of this film actually look at Rio Bravo? In addition to being a western classic, Rio Bravo was presumed to have been released by the sheriff (John Wayne) from the murder of his brother and his gang. No one wants to release anyone in the 13th attack. They want ALL dead. So, my first question should be, WHY DO NOT EVERYTHING AFTER THE FOLLOWING: Why "attack" this place at all? I know that the plot of a well-established plot was expected to be smart and shocking, but it didn't make sense and / or it was presented correctly. When the veteran policeman was from the beginning, why do you need this whole movie? When the veteran keeper suddenly agreed on the back door during the siege ring, how did he even get a chance? As soon as he appeared on the door, he would have fired and they would have entered. It's all just FUBAR. <br /> <br /> Any part of the city that can be waged in a police area (with helicopters and massive explosions), but no one knows? But as soon as there is a fire, they "have to leave before the fire comes" ?????? How did they plan to cover the chaos that was outside? The police will issue walls, ball bodies, footprints, the use of equipment, and the fact that there was no body of "bishop men"? How about these police snipers? How often did they disappear so often? I like the fact that when two prisoners tried to drive, the snipers broke two small snowballs. As if it would not be possible to shoot high-power reefs using a snowball. <br /> <br /> The creatures were interesting, though ridiculous, but the film went off the shore when they decided to kill that particular character with a bullet, which has no reason at all. I know the filmmakers went into shock, but all they got was stupidity and public anger. Don't you think that part of the reason why this thing is being bombarded is that, by word of mouth, everyone has told friends and family that they're staying away? This particular scene must be a big part of it in the word of mouth (and the fact that the rotation of each plot is dirty, then dirt). The conclusion remains stupid when the villain stops to give Austin Powers a similar diatribe instead of killing the helpless people he has finally hit. I know many people have mentioned the closure plans (> snicker <) in the forests of the city of Detroit, but why did Ethan's character just go to the forest first? She doesn't even see if the SUV with the secretary and her friend? They just cut him slowly in the woods, with a gun. GACK. I could go, but no. All I can say is that you want to avoid this stupidity at all costs.
