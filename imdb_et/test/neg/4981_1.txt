I remember seeing the first Underdog trailer in March last year, I also remember that I smiled so little. Of course, this was a cheesy idea, but I was really wondering if the concept could work, hell can't it be worse than disappointing cats and dogs? Then I remembered by December and I suddenly remembered the movie I realized about the likelihood of sucking the film, the fact that it was postponed in the United Kingdom, that it seems inevitable, would be terrible, but terrible reviews made me realize that it was almost impossible to film it would be good. However, I swallowed my feelings and went with a friend today with a movie when I entered my screen, was moral, it was the first time I saw a movie with a friend and was the only two screens! Little did I know what I had to endure. Underdog, to put it blunt, is terrible, it's really. Imagine how bad you think this film is, and make yourself even worse for the movie, it's just when the film is pathetic. While its purpose is to amuse children it seems just an embarrassing mess that seems to offend children, not to allow them to enjoy the movie. The fact is that the story is farther than weak, the actor is generally bad and the film's feeling is too long, tired and even boring for a Saturday comic! After a short five minutes, when I thought the film might be satisfactory, it seems that the film is suddenly dying and then slips towards the already marked finale. I'm just surprised that the movie has actually been released, it is embarrassing for Disney, the hell side of your live videos is better than this! Even more frightening is that the ending leaves a sequel to space! <br /> <br /> This is how you can act (crack). Let's be honest that Jason Lee is decent, his voice fits the dogs, and if he had been given a proper script, he would have done the job. However, with such a malicious script, he seems to be floundering. In many cases, he reminded me of Bill Murray at Garfield, Murray did what he could, what he had, but what he had was not enough to satisfy it. Then we reach the human actors and most of the cruel ones. Alex Neuberger plays Jack's Underdog friend. My biggest concern is that someone could even take him seriously while listening. The scene in which he drives Underdog is perhaps the brightest scene in recent years because his behavior is so bad. He never believed he was a real person, but I still believe that he was a robot specially made for a movie! James Belushi seems to be half-dead in the film, has nothing to do with it, proper features, he just seems to be climbing around a set that looks for the plot's relevance, which the writers are trying to finish, but do it so badly ridiculous. Fortunately, Peter Dinklage's film redemption factor, he is a great Dr. Barsinister and seems to be ridiculous in his role. He steals every scene where he is, even though it is very difficult when he divides the screen time with extremely annoying Patrick Warburton. The rest is even worse, especially Taylor Momsen, he just has to stop his acting career right now! <br /> <br /> Underdog does not dramatically lose anything that is a funny scene. If a more fun scene involves banging the Underdog in a jar and causing a dog food explosion wherever you know, something is drastically wrong. This can easily be ignored if the film had a good action or a good story, but the film is even worse in both parts. The effects are so severe that every scene where Underdog flies just seems absurd and the dog uses his powers so little that you forget that he has great powers. What is the idea of ​​making a super dog when a fucking dog never looks super? The final struggle is also embarrassingly purely because of his ten minutes of anything, the flies of the dog, the other things happen, some things are being cut off, it is all irrelevant, because this thing happens for things. The script is inevitably annoyed and badly badly terrible. If someone says, "Look at your plane, not the birds, not its frog ..." then you read it right, I wanted tears. In fact, I wanted to step out to force you to see if it could be lower than this point, it would close, so it wouldn't be fortunate. <br /> <br /> General Underdog becomes the worst movie in 2008, this early period is actually as bad as the previous epic movie. Luckily for the Underdog, a meeting with the Spartans will soon come and I hope it will be even worse. So, if you didn't get my review point, avoid the movie at all costs, if you want to see a movie with your dog, check out the cats and dogs, buy a real dog if necessary, just don't see it!
