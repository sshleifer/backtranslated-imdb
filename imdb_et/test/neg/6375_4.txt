Don't get me wrong, boy is a successful dynamo, but he reached the top by selling overpriced plastic toys to impulsive brats. So I'm gonna get a little frustrated when he looks at comic book fans as an extension of the same market. <br /> <br /> Look, "Invincible Iron Man" would not be bad if it was spread on Saturday morning and targeted exclusively at small children. But it's not just for kids. Peripheral characters are killed every five minutes and there is enough bloodshed and a half body to make the network sensors tough, so it's not cut off completely on children's TV. <br /> <br /> What audience is this video that aims to? This is an audience who enjoys an almost understandable story about the revival of the tyrannical Chinese emperor with 5 arctic rings. And I think the audience is narrowly small. <br /> <br /> Many great writers have been through Marvel's skin for decades. So it's a shame that Marvel would risk their expensive animation investments in so many questionable storytellers and scribes who, like Mr Arad, are better used to act with figures on a Saturday morning. How many gentle receptions do Marvel have to endure before they start with a better strategy? <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> Animation: Easy Passage Disks, Some Segments Are Better Than Others, Low Budget Looks All - It's Not Bakshi (Ralph) And It's Not Bluth ( Don)! CG animation is okay, but far from impressive. <br /> <br /> Story: Litany of clans, all over the place, twisted, viable and intrusive. <br /> <br /> Characters: Why is Rhodes even here when everything he does adds Stark's sexual ambiguity? Hmmm ... his father is in a wheelchair ... Tony can't do his mom ... Asian chicks are hot and probably small; the lead of the woman is thoroughly objected by this function. <br /> <br /> Performances: Cannot blame competent voice artists for a bad script. <br /> <br /> Art: Very Western Muscle, very clean lines, faces are derivatives of very oriental art, very boring mats, very gentle CG. Conclusion: Not great, but it's worth watching fans and those who enjoy superhero myths. Collectors need to buy. A valuable "what not to do" course for younger animators.
