I am offended and angry with the idea that the "Winds Down" sequence will continue as it could have been. Having expressed this, I have no problem with the quality of the actors or participants in this film. Performers are talented people whose talents were wasted on this garbage. This book and the leap surrounding the film just happen to be useless. I think it goes down like Hollywood's wrong films. I do not believe that the beloved characters created by Margaret Mitchell should have been lubricated by the ideas and interpretations of another writer. The film and the book should be on the list of the worst ideas in the world of publishing and making films. The sad thing is that people really made money for this outflow.
