In a world where there are many movies, such as "You could serve" - ​​which blows your mind with a lot of mistakes, you never thought that there would be worse films. Ron Hall's "Vampire Assassins" does more than cheese. He knows you're crazy about it. First: there is no assassination in this movie. In fact, there is only one good man in the whole movie. Second: location ... is basically one location: some jackassi house (or basement. It's about you.). Third: special effects (explicitly mentioned) can kiss my ass. Fourth, "Plan 9 from Space" works in the worst performing category. Ron Hall can't save his life. Finally (and certainly not the smallest problem): CHANGING. The person who edited this film hopes to never find him. The cuts and shots are HORRENDOUS !!!! Other issues: Lighting (practically none), the fact that the cover is not even in the film, and the fact that this film is there. <br /> <br /> To summarize this movie, let us just say that I tortured a DVD before Hollywood video (don't worry! I used MVP membership, so it was free!). NEVER SEE THE FILM !!
