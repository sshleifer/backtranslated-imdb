For the first time I heard this movie "Behind the 2007 Weekend" in Chicago "Nightmare on Elm Street". Robert Englund really talked about the film and he was great at "Hatchet". The same can be said about Tony Todd. Knowing that this is a small budget for the first time with a director / writer, it offers as much a budget and a remake / transformation of "Holloween" (2007). <br /> <br /> Technically, this is a couple of places. Allocation attack was seen too dark. When this happened, the black allergy in the dark head turned black to black pants almost invisible. Music in music is too strong and preserved, like a bad sitcom. And like "Holloween" (2007), somebody is smart enough to have a weapon, but of course killing a killer is just a push of a killer. Finish, well, as soon as I saw where it goes, I knew what was going on, not very original. <br /> <br /> Movie Highlights are characters and their interactions. Unlike "Holloween" (2007), we were able to meet people and see what happened to them. Ben (Joel Moore, who is also the leader of "Spiral"), the lead lead and Marcus ("Not Another Teen Movie") as the best friend and funny man in the movie. Shapiro (Joel Murry's "Dharma & Greg"), Jenna (Joleigh Fioreavant) and Misty (Mercedes McNab "Buffy Vampire Slayer: Series", "Angel: The Series" and "Addams Family" films) provide a difficult cause for topless women. Mr. and Mrs Permatteo played television broadcasts (Richard Riehle's "Grounded Life", Patrick Darb's "Step by Step"), because the older couple you know do not miss the opportunity, even the travel guide Shawn (Parry Shen) is the perfect character. I hope I can see more of all the participants in this movie, but I think it's better to play home video than in the theater, sorry.
