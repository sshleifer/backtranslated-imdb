Every time I think about this movie, I feel physically ill. To read such an excellent book and later discover that this film was a great feeling. Years later and imagine that my joy of turning on the sci-fi channel and finding it starts in just 5 minutes !!! Go to headlines and then jump. When a couple of things had changed OK. Everything has changed. Several characters are removed from completely new trash bins. The main hero has diminished and outdated for about 30 years, and his girlfriend / husband is now a mother! Even the dog has reduced sub-lassie abilities. This is a truly terrible cinema in the absolute worst case. I would very much like to remove my toenails with the tongs, not to sit through another terrible look, and I invite someone who thinks about viewing it - please don't. If you have a copy, burn it right away, and now think how much better your life would have been on this celluloid insult ever.
