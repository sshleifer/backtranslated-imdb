All those involved in PC culture are astonished by the dogmatic Christian view of this film, claiming that it contains racist ideas and / or religious intolerance. <br /> <br /> Those who are not interested in this, but are oriented towards slippery product values ​​and competent actors are terrified of such a lack. <br /> <br /> Those who both worship are apoplectic, to make this production open to the public, as noted here. br /> <br /> What is an interesting assumption, which is not original, but is a combination of GHOST and BEYOND, is dealt with in this immature way, but has been happy to do so. What the team and participants lacked in sensitivity, professional skills, and technical experience is somewhat compensated by their published intensity. <br /> <br /> It is not nearly as bad as many people think, and it would have been a good thing for a mature person with a sense of common sense, and that is only enough to laugh and rush about mediocrity. But it opens up intense enough to keep all the interest, and is close to a parallel entry by Corman from his earliest working period or from Arkoff or Sam Katzman's material. If you get it for $ 2 (or less), like myself, you will not be disappointed, but want you to have said how it was done.
