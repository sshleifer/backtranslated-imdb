The Black Mama White Mother's Ground revolves around two female prisoners in a Filipino women's prison. One black and one white. These two women are being thrown into prison. Pam Grier is Lee Daniels Lee, imprisoned in women's jail, dancing Harem. <br /> <br /> Lee's boyfriend owes his share of his profits to his drug activities. Lee is mostly interested in breaking out of prison to get his beau drug money to leave Phillipines and take a better life. Margaret Markov plays Karen Brent, white women who have a privileged background and who are also revolutionary. Karen has joined the revolutionary groups who have decided to change the corrupt Phillipino political system. He has been detained by the Phillipino authorities and is being held as a political prisoner. <br /> <br /> The story will shrink when Karen and Lee left the prison where they were together. These two also happened in the chain chain. When they flee, they also fight against each other because they have different goals. Of course, they hate chaining together. But they also realize that they have to ignore their differences to help each other survive when they catch. <br /> <br /> If this film looks very similar to Big Bird Cage, it is because many of the two movies are the same, as well as their location in Phillipines. Roger Corman has always had the consistent stability of the actors he used in all of his 70's B-films. In addition to Pam Grier, Corman's AIP films often included Sid Haig, Roberta Collins, Claudia Jennings, Betty Anne Rees, and William Smith among many actors. <br /> <br /> Like Big Bird Cage, Black Mama White Mama relies on too much violence to be delicious. Pam Grier delivers her usual hard chick to her film and shows her female heroin competence. Margaret Markov is less powerful when she is a revolutionary Karen. He just seems fragile and well-knit to be a committed political guerrilla. Except Sid Haig, the colorful Ruben, the rest is forgotten. <br /> <br /> This movie is a little entertaining value if your thing is not excessive, terrible violence. Only Pam Grier's and Sig Haig's performances will do it to watch the movie.
