I saw it on the 9th race. I only remember a few scenes (those where Elle's main game lies in a masking man) and is afraid to spit. Looking at it now, my opinions have changed. This is a pathetic "horror film" of Gloria Grahame's (sad) guided opagrant, dealing with young, talented girl Elle, who is sent there with a hammer (graphically shown) after her mother, city tramp. The film has adolescents (in fact, their 20th participants) who are beaten, tortured, killed, starved, attacked by meat splits, raped, etc. The brutal hammer is the opening place and then it gets worse and worse. There is nothing to suggest about this mess. The plot is stupid, the whole dialogue is bad and the actor ... the less the better. How did this get a GP (now PG) rating? That would be R. One last thing ... a really disgusting twist that refers to the incest!
