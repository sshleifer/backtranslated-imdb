Seriously disappointing Brad Pitt and QT, the plot is very superficial and flat, and if it is not implied, this film respects the Nazis and depicts them as honest men and shows that the Jewish people are deceiving, keeping promises and bloody witches . ((FOLLOWING SPOILER)) Hitler, with the most famous Nazis, is on a foolish plot, less of a movie about killing 300 Italian soldiers at the Paris Cinema, is incredibly ridiculous. The Nazis are laughing and whipping in the movie any killing as if they were watching the Basketball STUPID. What's really terrible is that the movie made great comments and is among the 40's largest 250 movies. not surprised when it also collects a number of awards, including the Oscar. The film is just a kiss of the Jewish people in the ass, but hey again, it doesn't even do a great job. it indeed destroyed the entire Nazi - Jewish conflict and pure insult to all who fought and suffered from Nazi tyranny.
