I really wanted to like this movie, especially after I heard that I turned around. But unfortunately it just didn't work for me. The paranoid park suffers the same deception that Lost In Translation did - if you use very little dialogue, keep moving close and focus on the fabric on your device, then your story will magically adapt to both deep and thoughtful. <br /> <br /> A large part of the plot line when you find this movie has been created for this movie. I was not impressed that "writing everything down" witnesses how the protagonist is dealing with the accident - so what should we believe? He grew up happily and wrote a book about his experiences, so he was justified in this terrible incident. <br /> <br /> What, in my opinion, is a film that creates an empathy for a young man who is undirected and faced with an imperfect moral error instead of a portrait of a future sociopathic personality. He has no connection with him who is around him, and there is no real or false end of the film. He has no direction at home and knows nothing about his friends. What we have is a portrait of a non-person, a spirit that simply lives through life as he walks his way through his skateboard. I don't know him at all and I honestly want him to be caught. The entire film center may not necessarily be his guilt, but how he prevents punishment and / or responsibility for a bad decision. Not only does he get away with him, he finds a way to rationalize it consistently. A pretty scary, negative message that shows that so many of our young people are disconnected from both the better and the two, that they just make the rules as they go, earning themselves good or sick. I find it an offensive treatment for today's youngsters, and the filmmaker's pretentious arrogance with every drop, ascended step and shifting eye. <br /> <br /> (He murdered the guard, but when you blink It was a mercy or not, it's hard to say - it might have been so dead when he put him on his skateboard. The skateboard is painted blood.)
