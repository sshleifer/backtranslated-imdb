Maybe the Disney Channel TV movie is a target audience, but when a parent watches with the youth, they clearly see that all this production is written. Obviously no one had a dream to make this movie, but rather guilty of it somewhere in the boardroom, then produced with cold efficiency. There are some talents among the participants, but actors such as Dabney Coleman and Jay Thomas do not get much chance to show their talents. Impossible lovely Elisabeth Harnois is dealing with her first daughter, but Will Friedle has once again played another foolish character, although she is almost as moral and annoying as her "Boy Meets World" role. The background for this film is Washington, D.C. and the White House, but the film has no real "presidential election", and the secret service has been put out a little better than Keystone Kops when he starts to fulfill his duty. The Disney Channel offers many original TV movies and most of them are better.
