... but of course I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I never expected the first movie. I'm not sure what's going on with the Disney marketing group, but it seems that every trailer made for an animated film gets me too childish or stupid or stupid, but the films themselves are usually something else. And no film seemed worse to me than the new one, as I was quite surprised to find that movie when I finally broke and saw the movie. I entered zero expectations and came to the entertainment pleasantly. <br /> <br /> Although Disney's direct videos follow, I still hoped for a better experience with Kronk ... but finally I was nothing but disappointed (and unfortunately it wasn't that surprised). Almost no humor is directed at adults. The original songs are uninspired and sick. Animation, though not bad, is still not close to the emperor (which was not Lion King at first). <br /> <br /> The main plot as such is amazingly "small" and consists mainly of a mini-plot return series - in fact, it seemed like a Saturday morning comic book series as a pilot episode is a well-designed individual. <br /> <br /> David Spade gets about four rows of the whole movie and there's not much John Goodman yet, so in general we just got too much of Patrick Warburton's Kronk - who was fun because he was the first character in the first movie, but is completely inappropriate main Although here the kids can have some fun, the only thing Kronki's new Groove made for me is to make me want to go back and look far beyond the original.
