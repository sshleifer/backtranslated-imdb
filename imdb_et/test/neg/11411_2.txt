Wow. I just saw Demon Wind a little while ago and I don't think I'm ever the same. It has the ability to inspire a nightmare, but for all the wrong reasons, it has never been. Or so much bad zombie (?) Makeup that makes you hungry for their Halloween green marshmallows. <br /> <br /> So much naked old lady, that's why. But then there was "The Shining." <br /> <br /> The plot here is so amateur that it really has a bit of charm, just like the dialog. The last picture in the movie is just so stupid that it goes beyond the description. It's like some drunken college students with some palettes and decided to throw Bruce Willis-type dialogue together (I guess?) With a Teenybopper dialogue from some of Elm Street's movies. The result is jarring, and it would be really funny if it was intended. <br /> <br /> Ah, hey. I laugh anyway. <br /> <br /> Hell, meet your friends and see it. But make sure you are drunk for the first time. Or you can go crazy. Especially if you're a college movie student. <br /> <br /> Greetings.
