I can't believe they even gave out such a movie. The only good action came from the film's water. It must be one of the worst (if not the worst) movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only frightening part of the movie is bad behavior, giving me this film a 1, this film deserves 0. <br /> <br /> Style, and if you can call it a movie, it seems to have written high school child. Ofcaurse you have to ask yourself if it could have been better with better players. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, wait for it to appear on the TV. <br /> <br /> AND ATTENTION IS NEEDED.
