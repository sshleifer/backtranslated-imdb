Foolish hikers travel in the Utah Mountains to get into murder, a hidden Roma. <br /> <br /> Prey is a real film of a milled film that mostly suffers from a lack of imagination. The victim's characters are all too familiar with idiot's teens, which means that none of them really care, we just don't know when they will die! Not to mention this, there are too many cheesy moments and it is padded with an endless, unnecessary natural scene. But it has a few moments for fans of interest, a spooky atmosphere, and Don Peake's decent music score. However, this is the usual way for dead-camper movies. <br /> <br /> There are many better movies in this water, but all over Prey can be remarkable enough to get hard. Although it may be more rewarding just before viewing Dawn (1981), Vale Turni (2003) or even The Final Terror (1983). <br /> <br /> * 1/2 Off ****
