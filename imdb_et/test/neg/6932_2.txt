I can only guess that this film was a test that was wrongly installed. Years ago, it would have been the movement of images accompanying music. Later sound would be added to the children. Finally, it would have been Technicolor, Cinemascope or Imax. This movie must be a wrong attempt to introduce a new item to a talking picture. During all emotional scenes, nature stops in a mid-dial dialogue and their inner thoughts are spoken when they look at the distance or turn to the camera. This interruption is very painful. Imagine those top-notch players trying to be busy during narration. Painful. I have no idea who the trick came from, but it was the only time I ever saw it - and good reason. In every scene, the actors were forced to roll their eyes, wrestle their hands or overdo them. <br /> <br /> The story is a hopeless soap opera that takes place over a couple of generations. Disappointed in love, Norma Shearer is looking for a reason to live. He has a friend who is played by Ralph Morgan, who worships him, but he takes it for granted. He is interested in a doctor who is playing Clark Gable, but he is absorbed by himself and does not care. She lives because of the weakness that desperately needs her. He only marries him to find that his family is crazy and never gets children. In the future, the doctor will come to himself, who will be self-beaten in his own oven to find out later that he loves him. The child builds confidence in her husband who becomes successful, but she understands that it is really Clark who loves. Confused yet? Forget the rest, just look at a few episodes of "As the world is changing" and it all becomes clear. The stigma of the actors stigmatized Harold LLoy. It must not be missed.
