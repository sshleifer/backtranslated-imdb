One of Bolls' better experiments. Just shows that if you do something long enough, you will have to fix it randomly. It is still not good, but it is at least observable, which is an improvement in bleeding. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry is that Farcry's story was not a strong point in the games, while Bloodrayne had a strong story and so Boll had a better chance of mixing it. <br /> <br /> Action in this movie is actually pretty good. From time to time it is too much, but it is a good way to look at it. <br /> <br /> Wise action was pretty decent. Most of the participants are pretty good, but you can say that they do not take it seriously when comparing other performances. But the lighter mood given to the film actually helps. <br /> <br /> Although I think that getting a little bit closer to the game story could have made a little better movie, the changes made are pretty practical and not big enough to change. Especially since the game chart was hardly an Oscar fight for the FPS carnage. He would have liked it to be Jungle because it was an integral part of the game, but there is not much Jungle in Canada and it is at least in some rainforests. <br /> <br /> Why Boll feels the need to change already professionally written and directed playgrounds that I don't know, but he does. And as long as it starts to talk about the source material through its customization, it is always missing. Watch a movie laugh for it and maybe watching a party at a party.
