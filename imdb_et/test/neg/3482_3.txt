I'm surprised at the big comments in this OK surf film. It really comes from the California Dreamin school to the barnyard beach and is not really plausible. The idea that a leading child learns to travel with such a large pool to win a true surfer in his game in a real ocean is simply silly. In Australia, where most of the city's teenagers surf, this film smiled amongst the audience, where it was all sea salt. Made in the 80s, but with the heart of the 60s, it's good to look and feel and sounds good, but it's not a classic class. Even the actors did not cross it. We are serious here in the LIQUIDITY SYSTEM or ROW THE END OR REFRIGERATION IN BACHO COUNTRY. Oz stars such as Occy and BIG Wednesday hero Gerry Lopez have been created to add our peasant's wave abilities to the head, but it made the crowd only in the cinema. It's ten years old, who doesn't doubt much. It's not even God's Handbook, and it was stupid.
