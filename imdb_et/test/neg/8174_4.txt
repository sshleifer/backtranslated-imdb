OK, this is short ... this movie is full of dirty dialogue, seemingly and hard. thanks to the top and poorly written lines. I couldn't laugh at moments that had to be very serious. The circus is the bright spot in this movie. Seeing the circus in your flowering was definitely a treat. <br /> <br /> There are moments that come through so good. But then it will return to the B-film territory. I was tempted to stop it several times. <br /> <br /> I don't know for sure how this best picture got. It must have been a slow year!
