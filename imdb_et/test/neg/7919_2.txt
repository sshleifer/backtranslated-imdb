I think this is a disappointing sequel. I miss a lot of old signs (King Gator, Anne Marie, etc.), and I don't like even half of the original voices wanting to do that. Charlie lost a lot of personality and the villain Red is not even half as bad as Carface was first. If you're a big ADGTH fan like me, it's worth seeing how the story goes on, but don't read that it's 5 stars in your book.
