I watched this movie last night and let me say it is the absolute worst thing I've ever seen. The whole movie is a train wreck and it's not actors. This is a terrible script. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** Alright, Eddie loses his job to a monkey. His hungry son is disappointed. The bathroom goes crazy. <br /> <br /> She gets a free vacation. He goes with Uncle Nick and the original Audry. Their boats run together. They stay on the island. They are stupid and hardly even look at a nearby hotel. <br /> <br /> OK, that's right. What makes this movie merciful is humor. It's so terrible, mountainous, and stupid, you can't even laugh. Nor is it stupid funny humor. I couldn't laugh the whole thing.
