Ahh, nuthin 'like cheesy, discovering, semi-porn, frightening ... This one star Jaqueline Lovell (sometimes Sara St. James), a nubile starlet, also seen by "Femalien", "Erotic House of Wax", and this family favorite "Nude Bowling Party". Now he is a contest of Surrender Cinema talent-free competition, marked with meaningless, soft porn editing. "Perepea" is actually trying to be a real moovie. Man and tramp are trying to say that tramp is a spouse. They are turning in a wheelchair to a large generation of evil genius and a family of moral failures that use mind control to send zombies to make their evil offer. This genius has a giant head, so the wise title of the movie: it's about the scope of humor in the movie. In principle, this is an excuse for showing Lovell and Dianne Colazzo (Ernestina) numerous talents. Compared to some of the greatest dialogues, the flock (what the hell is "oats", anycow ??), and just stupid, this titer thriller is such that it turns to Drive-In Theater breast milk farmers, but not another. MooCow says it avoids inequality, unless you are looking for cheese in R & D / horror at night. : 8P
