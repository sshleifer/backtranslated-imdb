While David Lynch's version of Dune is uncomfortable, uncomfortable, and unfaithful to the Romantic, it is visually well designed and well-functioning. The best thing to do is try the Sci Fi channel to make Dune a minis that it is ambitious. In fact, it is almost the only positive praise that can be offered. Actors (with a few exceptions) seem to be happy with their least emotional and least appropriate accents. Costumes seem to have been designed by someone with a large surplus of Mylar fabric and unhealthy love for headgear. <br /> <br /> Partly, this miniature lives in the well-known shadow of Lynch. effort. However, it takes elements of a Lynch movie that was not in the novel and copied almost wholly (i.e., Guild Steersman's navigation order), and it only encourages to encourage a negative comparison with the Lynch movie. A for effort. D almost everything else.
