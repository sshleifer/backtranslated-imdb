First, I have nothing against Christianity. I believe that every person has the right to believe what he chooses. But I can't imagine how stupid a person must believe it! What a waste of believers' money. They would use it to feed starving families better in third countries. I don't want to talk about this "movie" talking or plot because I couldn't find any of these. The story is simple - two reporters, one (A) is an atheist, the other (B) has for some reason abandoned faith. B restores the faith of faith and teaches the A lesson - believe in Christ or go to hell. This message will appear after ten minutes and will continue at the end of the movie. People, don't believe in the rating of this movie, first read the comments. I did not share my life for one hour: (PS: Why is it classified as sci-fi? Because of these little strange sounds and a little light from the sky? PPS: UFO = Satan's evil deeds? New :)
