Mansfield Park is on the other side of my favorite Austen novels and Fanny Price is my heroine's favorite, so I'm sad about the unhappy fate he has suffered in his big and small screens. The only good reading I've heard was for Amanda Root's radio, which gave her the same quality as the "Persuasion" in the movie Anne: Stern, solid and heartfelt moral focus. If the actor had been younger, he would also have had good visual casting; but Fannys, who has reached our eyes so far, has been similar: Mary Crawford; Ruby girl's girl; and (in this incarnation) the jovial earning smell, or maybe sour, his high moral principles were pulled down. <br /> <br /> Well, I was hoping for a better one but was afraid. In the series was sure Edmund, an actor who was in the best pleasing sabbaths, and perfect, that is, completely terrible, Mrs Norris; otherwise it was void. The film, which was apparently meant for deconstruction or some other bad theatrical idea, came out of the mixed burlesque. After such disappointments and the pieces of the sister of this production (the new "persuasion" and "Norther's monastery"), I was not able to confuse the recent disappointments; and in general, it felt much easier if not. It condensed the novel wisely and finally felt like a comic book version. On the other hand, it had to reprocess most of the characters except Crawford, and it accidentally reduced or eliminated most or all of the most memorable things in the book, including its most famous character, and what it should be if it is not his most famous scene. <br /> <br /> The character is an official aunt in Norris who is always ready to guide other people to do, but can always avoid having to do it themselves; it doesn't make any sense here. And with him goes a lot: his note that cuts through Fanny, "... considering who and what you are"; Sir Thomas's discovery that he had banned Fanny from firing his room all these years, and his roundabout apologized to him; Fanny's honesty admitted during the visit home that Aunt Norris was better able to manage her house than any of her sisters. But then this story is missing from the whole journey, and so is the majority of what happens in theatrical drugs and most of what is not suitable for returning to Thomas Thomas; and in fact Sir Thomas and his wife differ from what they were. Most importantly, the scene where Crawford proposes Fanny, one of Austen's most complicated, is easier said; it is missing that Fanny is sure what he knows is right, and what he knows is likely to be true, all distractions of Crawford and anyone else can throw him. For a male reader, which is no less than at the time of writing, it shows unbalanced clarity - unbalanced, in any case, as far as I know - what a woman goes through, trying fairly, but firmly, to deal with a man whom she has reason to trust. It's a great scene in the novel; on television it's just a scene. <br /> <br /> And Fanny, oh, Fanny: When will we see you like that?
