Strawberry Color has a great script, but I just want Errol Flynn to be there instead of James Cagney, he's not a part of it. I think Olivia did a great job. This movie is also a daily dream, so it's hard to follow. I don't like the attitude of the male character; how Cagney presented it was just out. I give him 3 poor people who are the main male. (If you like tough guys who want to fight all the time and say it's your movie). The strawberry blonde would have been better if the main arm had more positive attitudes and changed the script so that she was happy she was with Oliva. <br /> <br /> This movie shows that money does not bring happiness, women are the right jokes. Simple and easy not the best movie, but everyone has to decide for themselves.
