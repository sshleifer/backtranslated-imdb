Norris is a Chicago policeman who stumbles on a devil's apprentice? who wants to create Armegeddon well. Ultimately, he kills the creature, gets it, throwing a solid gold 24-inch pound, not very sharp, about twenty feet, hard enough to penetrate the chest. Unlikely? So is the rest of the movie. Much of it is made up of CN and its sidekick who drive cars and talk nonsense. An Israeli (or Arabic) child is seemingly humanizing the CN. OKAY. Does not work, does not make sense and promotes the plot, so-called. Also, no police have been summoned to the police. This is ridiculous as a prerequisite. The whole thing is bad. Unfortunately, it is not so bad to be entertaining bad or campy. Just bad. But - you can see how Norris tried to find a successful Walker: Texas Ranger series.
