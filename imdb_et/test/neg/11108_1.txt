This is another Sci-Fi channel original movie that arrives at Rhys Davies, where it's hard to decide what's worse, acting or writing / managing / producing (John Sheppherd beads all three.) Main story: Obsessed exobiologist grabs the chubacabra monster, smuggling a cargo container on board a cruise ship from which it escapes and a blood bath begins. Clich√©d sci fi poured a strong captain with a beautiful daughter, a nice hero and a mad scientist. Captian calls a terrorist warning about the ship (of course, it doesn't believe in the monster story.) There's no dramatic helicopter drop from navy seals here. The budget allowed only eight seal forces to reach the fiberglass fishing vessel and fly on board ships. Puleeze. Also, ship hair computer animation, which you could do better on your computer. I also loved when the seal commander saw three people out of ten binoculars out of the ordinary miles. When the Sci-Fi channel continues the original movies, I hope they understand that the audience is not a kindergarten and buys better scripts and directors. If it were a video directly, you'll find it in the 99-cent trash.
