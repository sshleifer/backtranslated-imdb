In the 1940s, the actor named Lake Veronica once lived. A beautiful, talented young woman who had repeatedly demanded many high-budget Hollywood pictures. Fast forward movement in the late 1960s, age, alcoholism and all-inclusive happiness have faded everyone's favorite actress. Now, it is steep, Miss Lake has decided it is time to follow the steps of her peers (?), Joan Crawford and Bette Davis and return to a reliable horror of good oil. What about meat feast? Really? He couldn't have washed it. To put it mildly, Flesh Feast is a dead pile of garbage that can be one of the five worst films I've ever seen, and I've seen them all. The lake plays a scientist who draws the Nazis to bring Hitler to life, with rehearsals for young people related to breeds, that's right, breeds. If you're not a big Heather Hughes fan, run and never look back! <br /> <br /> I know very little about the person of Lake Veronica, but also about the 40's, but I think that such a successful career really became so sad. Flesh Feast is almost impossible to pass and almost I mean absolutely. Director Brad Grinter, Nudist Camp Director, and a man who accidentally brought us the biggest B-film ever made in a couple of years. You should be wondering if this was what Blood Freak would have been if Grinter hadn't steered together with Steve Hawkes? If so, bless God for Steve Hawkes. You don't think religion, tropical blood, the Turkish Monster, could be much better than Maggots and Hitler's attempts, but it really is. So forget that you've ever heard of it and find Blood Freak, it's just waiting for you to entertain. A couple of years later, Lake Veronica progressed rapidly from Hepitita, broke and forgot. End. I hate you, Flesh Feast. 1/10
