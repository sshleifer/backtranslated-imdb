This film is worse than the choking of your diarrhea is a generous underestimation. The only thing that is more pathetic than this deplorable garbage is that producers pay for registering a number of accounts for the evaluation of counterfeits. <br /> <br /> When you look at a poorly-behaved, unstoppable, snoozer of Goonies Sloth's movie kills people in a way that completely ignores all the physical rights (pulling the legs of untrained people, causing them to torso) is your good movie idea, then tap yourself out <br /> <br /> No carbon-based life-style cancer that would work with a million eons would make this movie scary or entertaining.
