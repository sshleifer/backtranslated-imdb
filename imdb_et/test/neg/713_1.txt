It's not a movie. It is a collection of random techniques made in a fascinating part of the world with some random texts. The film is not that big and the text is not so big. The final product is exceptionally boring. <br /> <br /> Changing the comments on the DVD can add some entertainment value because the director makes a rather uncertain argument that it is a sci-fi movie. It is also fascinating to read about the extraordinary dangers and difficulties that the team suffered from collecting this material. Too bad it's garbage. But I think "Fata Morgana Making" would be an exciting film, like "Ed Wood".
