The previous poster concluded that the military did not respond to the police in a disaster, as depicted in the film. In fact, the military role would be to provide assistance to civilian authorities if so requested. Civilian authorities would take precedence. In practice, the army would need 48 hours to mobilize itself, because there is not much military presence in London, especially with the current overseas responsibilities. Even if they were dependent on COBRA, we would have had the impression that it was entirely a government emergency department - even a reference to the Met Police Cobra Department. In fact, COBRA stands for the office briefing "A". This is just a room where PM or DPM will meet with their advisers to discuss the current emergency!
