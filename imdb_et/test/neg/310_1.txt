The film made no sense to me. Good actors (SergioCastellittoaparticular's favorite, he was a big "Uomo DelleStelle" / "TheStarmaker", but it was made by Giuseppe Tornatore, an excellent Italian director, not mediocre who did it), but a terrible, dirty script, terrible editing and director who seemed a clue what he was trying to say and ended up saying exactly. Pretentious garbage load, but such a film that some Italian-speaking intellectuals, who had failed in my twilight and distant past, would have loved it, and unfortunately Italy is not their monopoly, can be found everywhere and apparently recognized as a great masterpiece. I never thought of Bellochio as a leader. I remember seeing my first movie "PugniNella Tasca" / "Fists in the Pocket" (or any such title) in Rome when it was first shown 50 years ago (I lived this time). All the usual pseudoes attacked it, but it was quite cold for me. I didn't think he was a lot of director and still not. The age has certainly not improved her and this film must be one of her worst.
