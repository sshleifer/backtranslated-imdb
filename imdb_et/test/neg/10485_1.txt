This cheap and garbage film is about a NASA test rocket that is sent into space with animal loads. It disappears for a while, then suddenly returns, landing in the forest, triggering a mutant creature with a witch. <br /> <br /> Like many movies of this type, Night Fright also has familiar teens boogieing with 60's surf music before being killed. However, no murder is far from memorable because we do not see anything. One thing we see, however, is that one of the teenagers seems to be about 40 years old and the sport is a pretty impressive silly hairstyle. <br /> <br /> To make a creature function work, it must really present its viewer correctly. In this movie, however, we only get a brief look at the monster. It looks like Robot Monster is a foreigner. But I'm not sure; when photography was so dark, I just couldn't figure out what the hell was going on for a long time. Although my gut feeling was that I probably didn't disappear.
