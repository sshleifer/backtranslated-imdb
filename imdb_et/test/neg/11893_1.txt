Can you stop people from believing everything that this man says. Get <br /> <br /> your facts right before this liar praise. She's not even Flint <br /> <br />. He just says that his "blue collar" look should be. She is the rich suburb of <br /> <br /> next to Flint. I mean he went to a private school. Wow, it certainly looks like <br /> <br /> as they suffered a lot from Flint's landfill. He was also born in Canada. Wait, this makes him a Canadian citizen. I wish she just went there. Instead, he lives here with his $ 1 million New York apartment. There's this working class. Certainly you can't wait until his DVD starts coming out. I want to tell her here how big companies are bad. Where can I get these DVDs? Oh, yes, Target and Wal-Mart. The two largest companies in America, which were the only two stores that allowed them to sell.
