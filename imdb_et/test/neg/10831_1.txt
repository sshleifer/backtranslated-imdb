When I first saw this movie, I literally rolled up laughing on the floor (especially when they started to chase with water, and when the boy traveled through the peoples' gardens, I thought it would suffer in the washing machine?) effect! this film did not have a clear budget. whether this or the guy left for his toddler for control. The water coming from the devil looked like a baked beer jar. What were the actors? did they believe it was a good movie? or did they just need the money? not that they would have earned much. When I first saw it, I was like God, how old is it? when I looked at it and saw it was done in 2003, I thought my TV was broken. <br /> <br /> It's really a catastrophe, more than one.
