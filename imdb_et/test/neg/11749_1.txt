Let me begin by saying that this transformed version of one of the greatest ever films "Psycho" (1960) has been just a good example of bad direction, bad action and bad pain. The best way to describe this film is to compare it step-by-step, acting and working the process from the outset. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock, one of the greatest film directors ever lived, was going to shoot the original black and white, despite the availability of color at that time. Okay, people in 1960 may not be accustomed to bleeding or terrible scenes as much as we are today, but it didn't prevent people from liking it and applying for 4 Oscar. Gus Van Sant had no reason to release that color, except that the year was 1998. What would have meant the color to be realistic. After washing the shower scene, Norman's hands are easy to understand that whatever blood was used looked like a red wax. When he is washing his blood, his hand is red. <br /> <br /> It might not have been possible for Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins to be better lied in the original. Perkins worked well for Norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiled and talks to strangers. Hitch wanted a beautiful and good actor and he worked well. In this version, I personally think that Vince Vaughn saw the Norman role as perfect and beautiful and strong, unfortunately his behavior was nothing more than terrible. In a motel where Norman and Marion have a long conversation, she was close to zero and her voice and face never changed. In the original of the same scene, which describes the madhouse, we can clearly see a sudden change in Perkins' face expression and he looks terribly angry, though not aggressively. Vince Vaughn works here through the whole conversation, just as he just had his hearts. Again, terrible action. The same goes for Anne Heche. In the original scene, we see how Marion (Janet) is tense and nervous when traveling to Phoenix. He was money, but at the same time frightened for life. That's what I call the actor. In the innovation, Heche has no signs of fear and he smiles regularly for money. I don't think anyone would be "happy and smiling" if they just stolen $ 400,000 and the whole country's police are behind them. In the shower room, Janet grabs the curtain in the original, turns around and dies after clinging. In transformation, Heche grabs, turns around, then moves in another way, has a stupid expression on his face and manages to die with great effort. Again, terrible action. <br /> <br /> This movie has also made some special changes for the first time, which seem to have something to do with the plot line and the current situation. In the scene where Arbogan is murdered, two scenes flash between the two scenes. One naked woman and another sheep. Many people, including myself, are not quite sure if the second scene showed a sheep or cow or whatever it was. What on earth is a beast or a naked woman related to the murder of an investigator! The changes were simply inappropriate and unnecessary. The final scene also has a few changes. Let me add some (and only) positive points. I felt that Julianne Moore did a good job and played Lila's good character. And William Macy worked well, almost as if he had to play the character of Arbogast. <br /> <br /> It is common for a person to know that the purpose and intention of reprocessing a film is to make the current generation aware of the film with a good classic plot line and try to see it better than the original. And if something happened here, as I just said, it is the exact opposite. Unfortunately, many people, like me, didn't like watching this movie if we didn't know the existence of an unforgettable original version. <br /> <br /> Please don't watch this movie, it's not close to the original, and the original will always be one of the best-created movies, if not the best.
