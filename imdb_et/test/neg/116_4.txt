Blind Date (Columbia Pictures, 1934) was a decent film, but I have some problems with this movie. First of all, I do not break the participants of this movie at all, but more or less I have a script problem. I also understand that this film was made in the 1930s and people were looking to escape reality, but the script that made Ann Sothern's character is weak. He went back and forth between the smoke and felt that he should have stayed at the end of Paul Kelly's character. He really cared about him and his family and would have done something to him and he did, giving him at the end Neil Hamilton, who I think was just a good time. The character of Paul Kelly, though caring was honest and the man who loved Kitty (Ann Sothern), not Neil Hamilton, though he really liked him, I didn't see the depth of love for his character. Production values ​​were high, but the script might have used little work.
