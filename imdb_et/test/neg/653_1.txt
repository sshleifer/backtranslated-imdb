Renee Zellweger is bright, but the rest of this movie doesn't work. It's like a hamburger-jello-gray salad - an interesting idea, but who ever thought it would actually work on the film? I like the two previous films by LaBute - they were ruthlessly honest and cool. This movie only succeeds in ruthless and cool - cutes with jumbo dolls. (Think: Think: Doris Day-Rock Hudson's movie Sam Peckinpah might have been - now reduce your expectations to match the current mass production with Hollywood State.) That actors are gifted like Freeman, Kinnear, Eckhart, Vince and Janney ALMOST make their scenes live, which shows that their talents are impossible to rise above the material that simply does not fit. I would have found that, at the end of the film, fun (Lynchean) was a funny, feeling-good-self-speech by Freeman, if there was no suspicion that this convincing morality was meant to be accepted seriously.
