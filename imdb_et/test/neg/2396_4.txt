"Love and Human Residues" is one of those apparently written, apparently functioning, apparently staged slips that are so obvious that the escape speed from your attitudes and preparation is beyond me. There is no point in explaining that this amateur flick tries to cram every smart line, every misanthropic uprising, every particular sexual predisposition into one movie without having to worry. In a nutshell, sensational nonsense without feeling ... that pretty much just leaves a mess.
