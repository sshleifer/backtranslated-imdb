People don't seem to agree with me that movies can be bad and good at the same time. Similar people, who see a movie with a carrot top on the cover, browse the frickin office and continue to look at the film with serious expectations. Is Carrot Top Funny? Of course not. Was this movie something special? Of course not. It was a stupid movie and everyone just got to know about Mr. Topi so easily. Such films, or Kazaam or Killer Klowns from space and quite a few movies, have never been taken seriously by Pauly Shore and should therefore not be seen as some of the worst films. You look at them, either waiting for a stupid movie that is badly bad or you're like six years old and you really think Carrot Top is cheerful. <br /> <br /> Please be prepared to know that the top of the carrot has slowed down and you want to look at a serious movie and struggle to write a serious review .... don't look at it. Choosing this movie is like picking a 5 year old without knowing the alphabet.
