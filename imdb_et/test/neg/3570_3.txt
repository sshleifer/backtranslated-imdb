I have to agree that the film is not the best I've ever seen, but I would like to mention that the actors depicting Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey were the actual Dorsey brothers. As actors, they were wonderful musicians. A film based on their famous cracking would have been better for professional actors to play parts. Many films made during this time took advantage of the popularity of Big Bands. Most often the films were not so good because the musicians are not commercial participants. Most of the audience in the cinema did not see Tommy or Jimmy Dorsey; they went to the plot and to the music. I've never been a Dorsey fan, but music is good today. <br /> <br /> I have to comment on the previous post about Mom and Pop Dorsey players and their accents were considered extreme by the Dublin audience. Arthur Shields and Sara Allgood were actually Irish actors, both born in Dublin. You might recall Mr. Shields as a lover of Mr Playfair in a quiet person and pr. Allgood as Mrs Monah's tenth cheaper.
