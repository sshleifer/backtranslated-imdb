As you do not know, EÃ§a de Queiroz is one of Portugal's most legitimate writers. He was witty, he didn't hold anyone in his critics and must now run his grave. And this is not because this film is bad, but it is due to one of his masterpieces "O Crime do Padre Amaro". It is treated like cheap, thrown into the trash. <br /> <br /> When it was disclosed that it must be "modern and urban", take a book that I was afraid of taking the liberty, in the sense of the worst, usually modern, in these contexts, to adapt to p **** to be halfway in the most appropriate way. So the moral and social dilemma of a secret, banned affair is replaced by the long passage of drug dealers and hip-hop singing on a specific or relevant reason. It's just there, as if it wasn't very well. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there's a lot of sex so you can count on it at least. I remember how every film in the 80's, regardless of genre or tone, always found a way to sneak into some nudity? If it was a thriller and they didn't need it, they just found a way that when he tried to conquer, "it happened" that he would be in bed with a woman who screamed in France (of course naked) when the police forced him. Ahem, free, it's the word I think. Not that naked scenes have something wrong, but here they make the creators of this movie desperate simply because the film has nothing else, it's completely missing what you call dramatic content.
