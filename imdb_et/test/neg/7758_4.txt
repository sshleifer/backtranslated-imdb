The 1960's boy showed former vaudevillians who are hiring men. As you can expect, they are all they do. During the 11-minute episodes (leaving 4 minutes for a 15-minute period for advertising), they do things that set the fence between warring neighbors, help the magician on the stage, and deal with the trunk and purses found. /> <br /> Growing up I had never traveled through this show (which seems to have shot in New York). I thought I had heard or seen most of the children's events since I watched them as a child or watched them in nostalgia conventions. Until the Alpha Video was released on this DVD, I was fully aware of its existence. <br /> <br /> The show plays like three Stooges mixed with Abbott and Costello, as people doing routines do. (Indeed, one couple claims to have created the legendary routine that Abbott and Costello perfected). He's not bad, but it's not really good because everything seems to be soldered. Time is often turned off (although it may be due to bad directions) and jokes were reused for years before the show was first run. The odds have seen it before. On the plus side is the thing that would be perfect to introduce very young children to the vaudeville-style comedy magic, but she tries to sit down even with short episodes. <br /> <br /> Only nostalgia junkies. All others should look at Abbott and Costello or the three Stooges original.
