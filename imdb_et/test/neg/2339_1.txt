It's a joke, right? Lynch didn't get it on television. He was in money, so what to do? Well, he somehow got some dollars and "stopped" the pilot and confused it by mixing everything ... How can anyone see a failed pilot TV as a cinematic masterpiece?! <br /> <br /> And now everyone has a deeper meaning! Well, wake up, there's nothing! Like this other Lynch TV series, what was the name again? The same procedure is there. Build a mystery and then come out with something. I think Lynch will repeat this concept as long as people understand that Emperor has no clothes. <br /> <br /> In Germany, comedian Harpe Kerkerling. She dressed as an opera singer and "performed" some new "art songs". Sing the complete crap like this: <br /> <br /> "Wolf, Lamb. Beach. Hurrz!" <br /> <br /> It's classic now. <br /> <br /> In any case, he later discussed with the audience. And they were serious about the deeper meaning of wolf / sheep. <br /> <br /> So let's say it together: "Hurrz!" <br /> <br /> 0/10 Macaulay J. Connor
