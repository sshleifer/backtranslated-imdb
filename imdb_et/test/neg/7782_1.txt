Don't look any more, that's the worst movie. There may be others involved, but they are not even worse. I couldn't find it. <br /> <br /> I found a laser disc of $ 3.25 for clearing and selling this movie, and I thought the film with these participants might not be worth the price. It turns out that it is worth triple that they should have seen it as a minimum. <br /> <br /> I am almost certain that the girl in the picture in the package is not a girl, they replaced someone else, someone younger and a mansion, to make it more attractive. Regardless of the "plot", the actual film was about three minutes, the rest is filler. And I don't mean what kind of filler you only understand that it is a filler, if it is over, or it is a kind of eye candy that you don't mind because there's a filler you mean on your shopping list. I think "music" must be someone with a friend who had a radio that he once listened to. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> If there had been a nice mountain, a river valley, a forest, something, there would be something positive about this movie. No it is not. Even with the button on the remote control, even at the speed of laser radiation, it can't get it fast enough. <br /> <br /> After years of thinking about commenting on movies, tempting, but not registering with IMDb. Finally, I broke because I have to do my part to push the user's rating to this stink as far as possible. <br /> <br /> The guidelines ask you to "focus on content and context". I can not. Not enough content to focus on, and that's exactly my point. Sometimes the bad is just bad, and this movie should be much better than it wants to be just that.
