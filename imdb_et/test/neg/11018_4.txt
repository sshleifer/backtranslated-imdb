This completely unfunny film is so up and pathetic and unrealistic that during the 90-minute torture I was probably looking at my watch about 70,000 times! Lucy Bell is so much higher than this mess, and that she's getting low, it's quite depressing. I have to admit that the whole audience I was smiling smiled hysterically, but most of them were Greek or Italian, so I think this humor makes them probably laugh, but not me. All this movie makes you sick that all these slackers would excuse their fools for 90 minutes. God, and I can't get it 90 minutes ago!
