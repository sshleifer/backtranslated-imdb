The atmosphere and the droll dialogue do not allow this overpriced classics to be redeemed. Boyer is a French thief who hides Algier in Casbah, while the police are trying to find out how to get him out. Meanwhile, he falls on Lamarr and tries to find a way out. The movie is slow to start and never go. Reminiscent of Casablanca somewhat, it is completely absent from a larger topic than the wanted man who attracts a good woman. It's all talking-talk-talk, where Boyer's endless scenes relax between his idiot cohorts and Boyar, who hides Lamar. Personally, I didn't care about Boyer's character in one minute, so the tension was completely non-existent. The characters of the 1930s character stood out from the fairy tale as Boyer's camps - boys who obviously do not belong to Algiers. Sigrid Gurie is a boyfriend who is overflowing with Boyer. His harsh wife, who is not in front of her, doesn't care well about the future she can have with Lamarr. <br /> <br /> There is a very long long series in which to surrender to Boyer, how the other henchman is caught. It sounds exciting ... too bad if we didn't see it ourselves. The end is completely antimicrobial and seems to be significant only because it is not Hollywood's happy ending; it doesn't stop it gently.
