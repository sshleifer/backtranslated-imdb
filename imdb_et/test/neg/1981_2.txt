First of all, I say I'm as subjective as possible. <br /> <br /> There must be some possible spoilers to be careful about. <br /> <br /> I hardly look over the movies, but this one I felt I had to look through. This movie, "Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children", based on ps1's very popular rpg (Final Fantasy VII), has been around for some time. After years of hype and dozens of trailers (no one I ever saw, I had only seen photos), this film was very excited by the fans' legion to see their favorite characters on the big screen. I myself had played and finished a couple of times like any good fan, and I was such a freak, I was quite excited. So I thought to myself, "WHAT SHOULD COME?". <br /> <br /> Well, the movie started in the OK for the first 20 minutes, but then things get out when the movie moved on. Undoubtedly, this is the best searchable CGI animation, but it does not help with a weak plot, undeveloped characters and pampering scenes. <br /> <br /> Here's a story basically. The three silver hair nancy boys who have nothing to do with the game are said to be Sephiroth's clones (he is a frog of the game who allegedly murdered all of his clones) trying to kidnap any child for some reason that wasn't all right, apparently to make the army (kids?). They also focus on some children named Denzel, I don't know who this baby is or what his idea is, he just seems depressed all the time. So, sephiroth clones are also associated with a scheme that involves some disease called geostigma that affects only children, it seems that this disease causes boredom and a small amount of skin discoloration. <br /> <br /> Their Boys Day. Apparently Cloud and his teamworkers have learned the ability to fly, I felt a bit insulted that these characters fly around the city, fighting with the dragon and always landing there. Perhaps, if the film wasn't so up, the view would relax and then be amazed. The real problem with this movie is logical. Now I know what you say, "But it's called the ultimate fantasy! Well, it's a silly way to think that the game is based on some reality and the movie should go through this CONTEXT. Context and logic in this movie are inconsistent, I could explain it, but if I did, I'd write a script. <br /> <br /> Also, some of the scenes in this movie were extremely viable and tritiated, like when all the characters in the game appear just in time for their mandatory screen, they will not bother the fans, they will show you if there is a bit and there is not a lot of story. <br /> <br /> If it is too long, here is an easier review - <br /> <br /> the first 20 minutes good-looking cgi animation scenes for stunning visually <br /> <br /> illogical pampering action / unbalanced action (leaves the viewer pinned) weak plot super person characters = no tension j-rock soundtrack / score (what happened to the orchestra?) A terrible end <br /> <br /> Great time SPOILER- <br /> <br /> Ending this movie is disappointing. they could have really been in a cool and sweet end where the cloud dies and meets after a lifetime, but after a big battle on the final table, a wound arises where the ball breaks through the chest. then the cloud is a 100-year setback in the film and then wakes up in the pool of life. (I remember the life flow of the game, but it had no ascending qualities if they had done, they could have brought life back to life, thus making a completely different story) so that the cloud is alive again and everyone has a party diving into the pool and we have ultra cheezy badge / lifetime type. <br /> <br /> It's not that the movie has no moments. it is worth seeing. but that's all. <br /> <br /> Other than being a really good movie. it is strictly for blind fans. not for people who care about plot and character and story.
