This is the title of a movie search. This is a pitch that sounded lucrative for some of the studio soldiers and the rest are fucking. When this film was made, there were two more things that the CGI didn't do at all: people and fur. Furry people were therefore not meant to look good as a computer. This is the only example I think when well-funded after-effects took a huge leap back to the landings behind the original film. The design of werewolves does not help the advertising. The filmmakers probably could not decide between the quadruple and the bipartite, trying to do both and end with a creature that looks just as uncomfortable. Transformations are anatomically unreasonable and the end result with a relatively large tip and a short knife looks like a cross between Ron Perlman and hyena. But back to the crass part. This is a film that exists in PURELY cash at its forefront. I'm not a fan of Landis' original text, but a boy, is it good in the light of it. If you thought that some of the Landis humor was forced, try some of the torturous attempts here. The worst-case scene, the body humor, the dog you ... you know, you just have to look at it yourself. Thomas Everett Scott is in Europe with his friends on vacation and decides to take a break from the "ugly American" and bungee jump from the Eifel Tower at night, leading him to save a young woman (Delpy - Julie is not worth getting a star in America. Ask Rutger Hauer), that he jumped to his death. She's part of the werewolf cult that draws ... I'm not sure anything bad. Stereotypes, loose plot holes, confusing end, despite the fact that the studio only took care that the title could fool millions of "American werewolf in London" fans for transferring their money. wrong.
