(Spoiler Ahead!) This exact plot of the movie has been made before. It's made out of Ferris Bueller's Day! Marques "Bat Man" Houston plays sick. Her diligent parents believe her. His sister knows he is fake, but he still has to go to school! He's crazy. She has a party with her friends when her parents are away. By the time his parents get home, he is sick again and his parents have never known the party. I like better than they were in House Party 3 and still immature!
