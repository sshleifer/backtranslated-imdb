Rutger Hauer helps out a film that can be summed up by a young person who finds himself in the category, and obviously needs a lot of help. <br /> <br /> At first, there are many more promises, a movie that can become Michael Clayton or Stranger Than Fiction. It's too bad because I really started out. Then, as with the soundtrack, he went far from the big and intriguing principle. <br /> <br /> It is fun enough because a lot of fun and interesting characters worked well. I am sure that this is enough for many people. The problem is that all the feeling is lively and empty, which ironically should be the main discovery of the character's self-realization. Not the film itself (this is not a film of itself), but the fact that the character should recognize his life and become empty.
