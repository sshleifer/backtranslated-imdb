It is beyond me how this script was sold and distributed much less. The dialogue was so bad that it was sick. Train and helicopter scenes seemed to be made by high school students. Lou Diamond Phillips must be hidden in its place if it --- this "movie" is? was shown in a private screening, after which he probably stayed in the back door. The only feeling it had in me was bad for myself, they had to "listen" to get through it. I couldn't see it all, it was so predictable it was funny. Who knows that maybe it will pull one network from the comedy situation.
