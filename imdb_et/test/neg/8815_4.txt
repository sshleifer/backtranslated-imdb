I really tried to "see". The story was good and I admire the speed of the movie. At the same time, there were too many clich√©s and elements that they saw "cool", but in fact they didn't make any sense. <br /> <br /> First of all, what I liked about the movie was the story's overall tone and I thought the assumption was fantastic. The character of Jigsaw Killer was intriguing and reminded me of vintage Dario Argento. Danny Glover was excellent for his obsessed detective and Monica Potter was good for the role of a doctor kidnapped. Shawnee Smith's scene was incredible and both Wan and Whannell should be praised for using this scene to get a demo for the movie. The whole notion that Jigsaw killer finds a chance for his victims to kill himself is a great concept, but when the movie went, the logic started. <br /> <br /> When they showed that Zap was one of the hostages of Dr. Gordon's wife and daughter, it was obvious that he was not a Jigsaw killer and part of it. The scene in which he puts a stethoscope in the heart of scared Diana, while Allison screams at him through his paw, was one of my most invisible scenes. It was supposed to be chilling, but nothing. Also, as Jigsaw killer finds the victims a chance to kill themselves, he has no problem with the policeman's throat cutting. I think this is the way to show that he does not want to catch, and goes to all kinds of tools that are necessary to prevent it from happening, but it just didn't give me the logic, especially if he does not admit any regrets about the death of another detective ( what I liked about this setup would have been better for someone who actually served it). <br /> <br /> I felt that Leigh Whannell was good for Adam. It was not really an exemplary role and has many possibilities as an actor of character. However, I had no direction for James Wan. The story may be original, but there was no definite direction. I think I'm tired of a fast, MTV style that favors an old approach to leadership, but a lot of Jigsaw killer scenes reminded me of too much "Se7en", too much of it. As the movie progressed, I became a demo roller like "Hey, look what I can do." Instead of being intriguing, it became very disturbing. But hey, it worked. He is now leading the Final Destination 3, so he is on the road to a successful career and I think he will be the ultimate horror leader in the coming years. <br /> <br /> What really was the end for me. As I said, I knew Jigsaw was not Zap, and I liked how Adam discovered the mini player after his killing. It would have been a terrible end, except for one deadly mistake: I felt they should have left it where you didn't know who was the killer. The only way to do this was for one reason: boy, are we wise? No no. For me it was not just a point. <br /> <br /> Some of the better horror movies are made for the reason why we see the story. Although "Saw" started very well, the unsatisfactory need of filmmakers began to be "cool" and it should reduce the winning story. Perhaps, if they didn't want to make the films themselves and rely on a more experienced horror director, I think it would have been a horror that he has been violently giving in the last four months. If this and "Cabin Fever" is the future of horror, I am very scared.
