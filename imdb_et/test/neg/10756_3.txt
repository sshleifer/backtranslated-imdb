"Opposing Force [1986]" was not as good as "Dr. Strangelove" and it was not as good as "Kwai River Bridge". Heck, it wasn't as good as "GI Jane", which is quite sad. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a fundamental ethical problem: in the situation of simulated prisoners of war, how far are you going before you break the law? What exactly is the law in such a situation? How can one simulate someone's torture without torturing someone? Can you deliberately cause pain? How to break bones? Look at the executions? Sexual Abuse? Severe Blood Loss? Real weapons with bullets? Death? Somewhere between them there is a really cloudy line that shares the "acceptable" "cruel". <br /> <br /> Now, what could you do if you were in such a training program and the lines between simulation and reality are getting lost? What could you do? This film tries to portray this dilemma. <br /> <br /> I found interesting what tactics are used for "resistance training". I have a brother who went through the USAF POW training program. According to him, it was technically very close to the brand. <br /> <br /> The film has a pretty good premise, but it doesn't have a very good story. I was wondering if it could be based on a real event, but it became quite obvious that it wasn't at the beginning of the explosions. They have to change three-quarters of the screen in the scenario because it takes a real extreme turn and moves somewhat pointless to shooting with a lot of annoying explosions. <br /> <br /> I found it to have a rather unsatisfactory end; again meaningless. I don't know what the whole thing was - I just didn't think there was. It could have been a lot better if the fireworks had a little more story.
