This film is terrifying towards its "Julian Grant" and its incompetent leaders Steve Guttenberg, who is making a firm effort to win a similar competition with Bruce Willis! Writing is a reckless thriller of Hollywood action; Sean Bean - one of my favorites - David Fraser and Kim Coates give a decent result. The film is definitely below average. 3 out of 10! I don't know what Hollywood studios are thinking, giving so, a weak director like Grant. And I would say to Sean Bean, "what did you even think of participating in such a movie, after such great films as GoldenEye, Ronin and Patriot Games!
