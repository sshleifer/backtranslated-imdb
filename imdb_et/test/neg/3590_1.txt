I've rated this movie 1/10 and made it good character. this movie is not as it seems and I can't get that point. Take the first joke, for example. Their signs begin at the beginning. well that was OK but then they start having some guy talking about the hood and then he dies then their other guys who talks then he dies after another guy says people don; Don't get your birthday out dying. and he's got a cake. then he dies. The jokes are just fools, they are smart and I would have thought they would have been better than some other frightening film leaders. <br /> <br /> Shawn Wayans (written by) & Phil Beauman (written by) <br /> <br /> but it sucks and I hope they want to do another comedy the next time.
