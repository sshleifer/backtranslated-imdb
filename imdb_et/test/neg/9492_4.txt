Douglas Sirk's open "female image" cries to a universe based on a preaching, dogmatic, didactic novel that could not be tolerated by intolerant Lloyd C. Douglas (the author of this second beloved chick, * The Robe *). Rock Hudson, who played him on stardom, plays Bob Merrick, drunk of millions who are more interested in looking for skirts and racing boats than completing a medical degree. In the first scene, he wrecked his boat proudly on a lake. The accident almost kills Merrick, so he needs a rather mysterious "resuscitation machine" to keep him alive. . . In the meantime, the beloved surgeon Dr Phillips falls in the heart of the city. Because a local hospital can only hold one resuscitator at a time, Phillips dies that lous lives. When Merrick becomes aware of it, he tries to make excuses for the Phillipside family, especially the widow (Jane Wyman, coined and dressed matronly hauteur), but someone and everyone who knew the surgeon was spitting on Merrick, like a crazy crazy. . One of the hospital staff's doctors even calls it "all the waste" that playboy lived instead of a Christlike surgeon. Hippocrates could have said something about it! <br /> <br /> These early scenes are when you find a typical Sirkian icon glass: the director rubs our face so much in the middle-class inconvenience, in mid-century America, that a person finds himself rooted in a waste of playboy to put their moral hypocritical rings under the leaves. But unfortunately, no: the striking plot of the novel has to move on, and Merrick will soon find that God is going around it when he sees Otto Kruger, an artist who pipeline, says Phillips made him a better man and even a better painter. (Why do we not see any such amazing art?) We know that Dr. Phillips, who has been abusively widespread, refuses to pay for medical services (even though those who have qualified these "great exceptions" will never be clear). It should give our hero a completely new outlook on life and an example of personal behavior. Kruger even tries to make everything very illegal, "If you start this thing, there is no way out! It's obsession. ... MAGNIFICENT obsession!" So Merrick is trying to settle it when he comforts the widow with excuses, but he puts him somehow against the car. He loses sight. Obviously, Merrick still has several railway stations to be able to read a decent companion in the past. <br /> <br /> But Sirk continues in his revenge, even though the film is growing more and more to preach. The most obvious thing is that Agnes Moorehead is the main hospital nurse and Wyman's friend and integral lesbian lover. Note the disappointment of Moorehead's face when Merrick, who was finally redeemed as a doctor, shows Wyman for the rest of his life. Hudson's own homosexuality, which is the secret of Hollywood at that time, is also very ironic. He and Wyman - 15 years and older - create absolutely erotic heat from scratch in their scenes, which by the way is scarce, probably because more scenes between the stars would hopelessly expose the whole company. (One thing we know for sure: when Rock Hudson was under some obsession, it wasn't Jane Wyman.) This is chronic tea * and sympathy *. The circus seemed an enjoyable nose when this gay actor, who was attractive to innocent women of the era, pushed them off with stunningly painted "female images". In fact, the director and Hudson worked 6 or 7 times better on the follow-up of this film, * All That Heaven promises *, which informed Hudson again about Wyman, but with a realistic plot added. Meanwhile, in * Obsession *, we have to endure God / Kruger, who is happy to look down at Merrick and his medical staff when they are preparing to save Wyman's life, with a swaying vocal musical score. But to see why Sirk is considered an auteur, look at this scene where Wyman explains to her grown daughter that she can actually tell the difference at night and day. The whole frame is darkened, the daughter is barely visible, and Wyman's face is weak with a light silhouette. He says he hates at night because "I know Dawn will never come again". A great, cool moment that deserves a much better movie than * Magnificent Obsession *. <br /> <br /> 4 stars out of 10.
