I talked about this film between 2012 and 2012, but I chose Inglourious Basterds thanks to the amazingly high IMDb rating. I have to say what is disappointing now. I was expecting a certain amount of free violence, but I also expected a lot of wise dialogue. I got a huge dose of myself, but not nearly enough. I felt short. Relations between violence and the plot are very important and I think this film is totally wrong. And the plot? It's so plausible or really all that fun. Save time and money. I can't believe what this assessment says about gory and violent flavors of modern masses.
