this movie was absolutely terrible. most comic scenes seem to be old and tiny, and the more fun scene of the movie was already given in the preview. the whole premise of the film is so incredible and ridiculous that it is really difficult to get into it. the actors themselves are the most unrealistic signs. it is not only the fact that the movies are so hard to swallow, but how they force it to sink under the throat, waiting for you to fool and accept it. the plot itself is so low and predictable. the boy somehow renounces every school he applied for (i think he forgot to fully participate in community college) and decides to create his own school for his companions. everything lasts for a while until the validity of his school is questioned. At the same time, Dork's character succeeds in losing his beautiful neighbor to his wise sarcasm, which is apparently just his skill. then the last struggle with the students is somehow all the ties and the struggle for the survival of the school. Of course, convince the main character of the National Education Council to allow his school to live some "inspirational" speech. it would have been more fun to watch this film when I was under 16 and still aware of all college issues and questions.
