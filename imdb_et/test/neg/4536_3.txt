The director is the same Jin Ishimoto who put Neoedision and flixer.com (once promising online film community) out of business and on the network because he is his next film GIRL'S BEST FRIEND due to his director's style and film making method. <br /> <br /> HOLE suffers from this "look at me, I'm a filmmaker" style that is becoming the standard of today's Hollywood, damaging the content. <br /> <br /> HOLE actually begins with a unique concept, but this concept and promise of enchanting content will soon be destroyed in the "watch mechanism" of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> There are some funny moments that still look like a pretense, but it's a painful short look. <br /> <br /> How sad it is when a new "filmmaker" breed does not want to be a servant, but rather to try and dominate the screen. Heck, they don't care if they get their studio deal, house on the beach and the new car, content and presentation are secondary issues. <br /> <br /> The real sad part of this is Hollywood has so much glimpse that the entire aesthetics of filmmaking is changing. Instead of presenting the story in a simple way that makes the story first, today's directors get "experimental", ie "look at me". <br /> <br /> Is it me or I am the only one who really was put down with Sena SWORDFISH's opening protocol. This film rose to Sena leaders' attempts to "look at me" for film making. Unfortunately, this is not Mr Ishimoto's short film. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 ratings from Elec TV.
