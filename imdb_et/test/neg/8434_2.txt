And one of them is bad movies. The title, as it turns out, refers to the killer of a male animal, not to the fish. It is not a "78th Dante-directed" Piranha (which had fish) and is also known as "Piranha, Piranha". A trio of photographers, 2 men and women, joining a local hunter / trap called Caribe, somewhere in the Amazon jungle. Unfortunately, they do not know the continuation of William Smith's movie, who plays Caribe; otherwise they would have learned immediately that he was a villain of this act. Smith may also have refused to stop filming or cut off before filming (see the end of this comment). <br /> <br /> As mentioned elsewhere, this image has a lot of filler - long pictures of local nature (birds) - and a central unit, a motorcycle race that lasts too long. The reason why I got another letter is, of course, William Smith, who can't really save that mud, but proves once again why he was "running" 30-35 years ago if you really need a nasty villain; at his best, Smith can be really terrible. He is the type who enjoys killing, maybe in a sadistic way, and you get the idea of ​​the evil fault he usually puts when the mood hits him. Physically, he is very terrible, and you know that the remaining 3 characters are doomed in the first half hour. That was what Smith brought most of his roles; it seems hopeless against other characters with a similar monster. Unfortunately, the film's rebellion continues to the end, as if it had been lost for a minute - a confusing, incomplete climax.
