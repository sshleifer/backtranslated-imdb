If he was not married to the producer, Jennifer Jones would not have been the most obvious choice for a leading female role in the first World War between the American soldier and the English sister. His British accent is not perfect and in the fifties it was unusual for a great romantic lead in the late thirties to become an actor, even as attractive as Miss Jones, especially when he was several years older than his leading man. At that time, there were several beautiful young British actors in Hollywood, such as Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Jean Simmons, and Joan Collins, each of whom could have been more convincing in their role, but Miss Jones had one important feature, a marriage certificate called David O. Selznick. In this case, the film turned out to be a turkey that they were undoubtedly grateful for not having their own CVs. <br /> <br /> The film speaks for a long time of Frederick's romance, an American volunteer who served as an ambulance in the Italian army, and a British Red Cross sister with Catherine. After Italy's victory in the Caporetto battle, Frederick was accused of being a German spy and sentenced to death. (The film is very harsh on Italian military law; it seems that the Italian courts were entitled to death after a trial of more than thirty seconds without hearing evidence and without the defendant being legally represented or speaking in defense). Frederick manages to escape and cross the border to neutral Switzerland, accompanied by pregnant Catherine. <br /> <br /> Hemingway's novels have not always been very successful in filming. Howard Hawks managed to make a good version of "To Have and Have Not", a film that is much better than the book on which it is nominally based, but because he left the Hemingway plot largely overlooked and changed the film to "Casablanca", located in Martinique rather than in French Morocco. Like the For The Bell Tolls 1943, Farewell to Arms is too long and deadly slow. It is also wrong. Jennifer Jones will never make Catherine's life. In the case of Rock Hudson, his presumed Christian name may be unfortunate. He could be as strong as a stone, but also indifferent as this one, and in this film, his Frederick seems to be a big stone face. Despite the passion and emotion inherent in the Hemingway plot, the emotional temperature is always too cool. This picture has a few pictures, except for some attractive picture and postcard views of the Italian and Swiss landscapes. It is hardly surprising that it was not successful and that its failure ended as a producer of Selznick. 4/10 <br /> <br /> Short. Shortly before the Battle of Caporetto, an Italian official states that Russia had already concluded a separate peace with Germany. This battle began in October 1917 at a time when Kerensky Russia was still fighting next to the Allies. The Russian Revolution did not take place before November; it was only the "October Revolution" by the old Julia calendar. The new Bolshevik regime signed a truce with Germany in December 1917, but no separate peace was signed before the Brest-Litovski Treaty in March 1918
