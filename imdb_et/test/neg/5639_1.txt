As I listen to my parents, I look at it (after 10 minutes of giving up), they have no idea what's going on. When "Charles Dickens" looked into the camera, I waited halfway for a demon (yes, he looked like one). Unfortunately, it didn't happen. <br /> <br /> This film was for a variety of reasons that I didn't finish: one, it was unbearably slow. I mean, seriously, it was SLOWW. You can only understand 10% of what is being said and bad characters were used. <br /> <br /> If you have an English accent and you like LOTTT to speak, do not act, act terribly, laugh, and the same music / sound effects that are played over and over again, this is the movie for you ... <br /> <br /> 1/10 - totally terrible. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
