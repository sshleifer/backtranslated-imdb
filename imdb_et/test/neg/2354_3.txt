When posting this comment, IMDb is currently evaluating Alfred Hitchcock's sub-category Saboteur a 7.3 / 10. Frankly, I cannot say how this bad film would come from what is probably the most consistent good director. I've seen about 10 other Hitch movies in the 30s. Vertigo is therefore my hands favorite, while Saboteur is easily the worst. It is hard to believe that 7 years earlier Hitch 39 used the same formula in step. My suggestion would be to see it and avoid it like a plague. This is the only Hitchcock movie I turned off before the end and who doesn't want to go back and see the rest. If you need to look at it, rent it or lend it. Don't make the mistake I made, and buy a DVD in good faith, which is served by Notorious, Rebecca, Vertigo, rear glass, and the like. Even the master screws up sometimes, I think. <br /> <br /> EDIT: Maybe I was a little harder than I should have been with this movie. This is by no means close to Ed Wood or Manose, or something like that, but there are three reasons that I think should make it so low: <br /> <br /> 1) The name "Hitchcock" brings some quality expectations. This movie sends some of them, but they overshadow the path of almost non-sensual drawing. <br /> <br /> 2) I want to compensate a bit for all the 8+ ratings this film has received. Hitchcock is like John Coltrane's directors. True fans will find the reasons why they are considering some artistic work, but a high rating in IMDb gives more casual film enthusiasts than I think this film is much better than it really is. <br /> <br /> 3) I spent $ 18 for that. Maybe if it cost me $ 5 or even $ 10, I'd probably be a bit less bitter. ;)
