Komodo vs. Cobra is not going to set the world on fire. This is not a feature of cinema history. This is a group of underfunded filmmakers trying to make another movie, make one more salary, and continue to support themselves and their families. As such, I give these efforts a lot of relaxation. I mean, come on, it must be hard to be a Russian special effect technician. Not many big budget movies that are made there. IF-- They're committed to a bunch and more than willing to throw their everything into any flat American monster that needs the affordable SFX. And I get a kick out look for the same places appear over and over again with these flicks. If for some reason you find yourself looking back, look at the sequence in which Pare and the company walk through the "jungle". Look at their feet and see paved pavements. And if you still have a copy of "AI Assault" (shown a week or two earlier in SciFi), you can see the people there who drive through the same ersatz jungle. Come to think, I think helicopters will land in both clamps in the same clearing. I can admire the sustainability of these films. Every dollar appears on the screen! Too bad not just enough dollars ......
