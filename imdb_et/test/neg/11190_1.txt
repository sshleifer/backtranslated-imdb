A man beats a dog 2. <br /> <br /> A woman gets a cow from her cow. <br /> <br /> A man gets a fig board on a sidewalk. <br /> <br /> The woman sucks in shape for 15 seconds. </p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <p> <br /> Here it is. I just saved you for an hour of my life. Certainly, there are those who would complain about this "shocking foreground of cinematographic highlighting". But I didn't find it unlike the child's inseparable videos I shot with my friends in the ninth grade. If we never got a real cow. <br /> <br /> Having heard endless sermons coming from the beard, it is such an important film, I thought it would be worth my time. Don't make a mistake, it's a mess. When I hear another person, Bu単uel is called the father of cinematic surrealism, so I think I'm gonna hit someone. When he was preparing something, he took a step back 10 years ago from the surreal start of his elderly Fritz Lang (Metropolis), F.W. Murnau (Faust) and Robert Weine (Caligari). It made fun of the whole thing, as if Bu単uel wasn't sure he would really embrace the sans sarcasm of art, sans l'absurdite. Bu単uel would take another 40 years before he refined his style. Leave to early stuff and jump right up until 1970 if you want to impress your work. <br /> <br /> I'm sure he'll agree. In 1977, Bu単uel himself announced that he was happy to print prints of all his old films. In this case, I would be happy to pour lighter liquid.
