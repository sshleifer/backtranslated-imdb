What is Night Vision? Well, according to the star (Williamson), we see ... one package shop owner tells him that it becomes dark outside, to which he replies 'it makes better .........' night vision. What the hell does that mean? In fact, what in hell is this movie trying to say? It has holes in the plot that you can drive through the killer bath. Not to mention the police drinking, Robert Forster's dream through this bizarre attempt, related to the craze of the serum killer, and the killer who is filming his murders. It's actually all I remember. <br /> <br /> The film was in Texas, there were some car rides and the end of the clich√©. Maybe if someone watches this movie - can it be good? After all, without being able to see it ... it would make it better ..... night vision. Did it make sense? No. And this is not the film either.
