I was in college at college when this movie came out and I had never seen it until the last night. Finally, I decided to watch it because I like good dance and because the film had such a cultural effect. After seeing the film, I am completely confused about how it had any effect other than bedtime. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty pointless when you think about it. Does anyone actually buy the idea that this beer, filled with gnarly old steel workers and teammates, could keep their customers in the high dances that these girls did? They would all have reached Zanzibar faster than "performance art". Can you imagine that the real-life versions of this audience will respond to this strange TV channel that it didn't do? Please. <br /> <br /> It seems to me believable that there could be a woman working in a steel yard and also a dancer - after both are physically demanding jobs. But I didn't buy a second that the girl was working in a steel yard. And I didn't buy the second time that I was looking at a real steel yard. Steel work is dangerous. You will not keep your work area like a junkyard and not end up losing your limb. I love some man's techniques when two welders sit on the welding of large corrugated sheets. What the hell are they doing there? Or if it cuts 6 cm from stainless steel with a cutting torch. He was probably on board and just started cutting random things. <br /> <br /> But such story holes can be overlooked if the movie is fun or at least in some way stimulating. However, Flashdance does not offer anything to balance it. <br /> <br /> Dancing terrible. This is a spastic twist-style style that destroyed American musicals until ... well, are we really still there? The sensuality the film is trying to destroy destroys Jennifer Bea's complete lack of personality. I mean, I'm a 42-year-old man and when he had to eat lobster, my only reaction was to think he should get a lobster stick. dreams because his character is so stupid and low. The dog went more than he did. <br /> <br /> The love affair is flat. This is more than a boss with one of his employees. Zero passion. <br /> <br /> Even the last scene where he dances with Orville Redenbacher and some other rigid is not satisfactory because the panel reaction is so incredible. What are the serious dancers on the Alex's flat cheerleader routine? In short, the film had not only foot warmers and a big jigsaw. Oh, yeah, there's a good nudity when Alex "rescues" his friend's erotic dancer (ridiculous hypocrisy). Other than that, the film is a waste of time. I want the MST3K team to work. That would be a good feed for them.
