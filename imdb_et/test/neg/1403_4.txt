This wretched psychodrama uses every knocking device in the book to express his attention and sympathy for his characters who, with one exception, deserve no message at all, not to mention the two precious time of filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Like Robert Redford's "ordinary people" (a great movie that shows "Heroes" is clearly empty), the late teenage boy is dead, leaving his family in disrepute. In this case, death was a suicide, an event that almost always poisoned emotionally well the survivors in a particularly corrosive way. We follow these people in the next 8 or 9 months. <br /> <br /> Father (Jeff Daniels) becomes a take-back, practically silent, usually drunk rigid, who secretly leaves his job for a month, instead of sitting in the park for the whole day and requires a full board for every meal for a dead son . He treats all other pounds in the family. He sees his doctor regularly, but the question of therapeutic intervention in his apparently insecure state never arises. <br /> <br /> Mother (Sigourney Weaver) screams at her neighbor's wife, among other things, when she foolishly tries to buy "marijuana" (her term) in the main shop (what would adults actually try such a fool?), and eventually break into coma with lung disease, that all people in the theater assume he is a heavy smoker of cancer). Weaver has some fliplines, but in general he behaves too empathy. <br /> <br /> It is not that there would be no people who behave in these stupid ways when serious stress conditions arise. But why make such a generation movie? What can anyone learn from this couple's behavior? The deceased older sister (Michelle Williams) is away from college and too happy to stay with her family in the zoo. The younger brother (plays by Emile Hirsch) is the only trusted family member. His suffering is genuine, the causes are diverse and his behavior is coherent in the circumstances. But the Hirsch character is too soft, too frightening and beaten to wear the film. Other little players, subtitles, and cutesy, unrealistic dialogue won't help. <br /> <br /> The suicide theme is repeated in two other small characters. What is the writer-director Dan Harris, who is trying to say about this? Isn't that a serious thing? Why Jeff Daniels agreed to play with his father's father, as written in this scenario, is something that only his therapist could answer. Avoid this dog. Instead, rent a classic Redford. My rating: 4/10 (C-). (Revised 2/17/05). If you would like to read more about your comments, send me a message about the instructions on my web pages.
