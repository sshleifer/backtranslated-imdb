Every time I see such a movie, I get sick on my stomach. When I watch a movie, I want to see what I see in everyday life. When I go through my day, I see black, white, Asians, Latin, etc. How do you film and don't even think that other ethnic groups are going beyond you? I am sure they did not do so for the purpose, but paid attention. I don't care if this happens in Kansas or South Central. All I saw was one black. It was typical in the 1980s. Hey! this is 2007, where all the rappers, singers and athletes who act as actors in the Thomas Haden Church could have paid more attention. Shouldn't participants be more liberal?
