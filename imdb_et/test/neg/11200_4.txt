I went out to get this movie, and I was happy to get this VHS. Being a big fan of Gloria Grahame, it was a great collection. In addition, I cannot recommend this image. The plot is predictable (and weak) and the only interesting aspect of the film is that Sterling Hayden gets into deeper difficulties with his department. Mrs Grahame is always fun to watch (if you like me), but copying her singing will do a lot of that picture. She works for diving so let her use her voice. It can only lend to the atmosphere. I have to agree with the previous supervisor; ends with borrowing heavily from high heat. To the point that ends until the end. I've seen worse movies with Mrs Grahame (MACAO), but I never give her the chance to see her on the screen. If you have a movie night and are looking for another feature film, this is your movie. Enjoy the picture.
