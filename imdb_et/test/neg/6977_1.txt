Sitting on a big lap with a large laptop in her lap, one and only in Bela Lugos camera and in the awful vocal delivery that sounds like Shakespeare's reading, intones sloooow-ly: "Summarizing the man's unknown things brings endless things, (chewing gum), surprising because they seem to be new (Lugosi's eyes are now weighing, raised eyebrows and zooming, it continues), but most of them are not new, signs of the era ‚Äù(visual illumination, accompanied by thunderstorms that then go on for amazing 86 seconds). <br /> <br /> And that's what the undoubtedly the worst movie ever made, this "movie" is almost untold. Gleni (Ed Wood, Jr.), who crosses the dresses, hence the reference to Glendale.The film has no real structure, instead it usually consists of random vignettes that can ... or mi tte ... be related to Glen or cross section motif. One long sequence consists of a few unknown women who are on the couch following the whipping of a woman, which we call S & M today. <br /> <br /> Bela will then appear for a few moments without any apparent reason and talk more about a man like dialogue: "If he is wrong because he is right, and if he is right because he does wrong, pull the string, dance with it. " Huh? <br /> <br /> Almost twenty percent of the film's visuals are film material that is accompanied by a VO that is related to story motive, but not visuals. So we see movies with us: lively city streets, road traffic, thunderstorms and a playground for kids. But it gets worse. The cross-layered film has 58 consecutive seconds of hot steel casting and after 84 World War 84 consecutive battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Even the simplest items are botched. In one scene, we see the title of the newspaper, which includes "Man Nabbed Dressed as Girl". Under the heading that is clearly glued or pasted, the article is about ... taxes. One of my favorite studs is a woman on the outside of the screen, "planes, why it's against the creator's will," a voice that sounds like she just breathes into helium. <br /> <br /> Except for Lyle Talbot, the actor is equally horrible. The production project is cheap and poor; (but you have to love this sticky wallpaper). Editing is sloppy. Most background music is only suitable for 1950 style lifts. B & W cinematography has too high a contrast. And costumes look like something that came from economical stores. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that it changes "Plan 9 from Space" to "Citizen Kane". I just don't know how to make the film worse than Ed Wood's "Glen or Glenda". But fortunately, this is Bela Lugos. Every time he opened his mouth and looked into the camera with their big bulging eyes, I laughed at the floor.
