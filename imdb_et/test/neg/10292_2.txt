Important spoilers! <br /> <br /> It's a sick, annoying movie ... just like a sick, twisted director, Jennifer Chambers Lynch, who also wrote it. I don't even know why I gave this film a rating of 2. That's definitely not the actor's fault. Cast cast definitely represented his roles well. This is the way this film was written and how the characters were written, which was a real comparison of the sick mind. <br /> <br /> I know I'll never see another movie written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch. She is sick, twisted, unpleasant oral and unpleasant deviant. She looks, speaks, and sounds like a biker chick whose brain is stunned, who spent 20 years of hard time. You can clearly see what kind of person he is, by following him in the "Monitoring: Watching Watches" section of the DVD. You see and hear him for himself. He was just as bad as I had anticipated writing this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't mind bad language, though this driver is definitely talking like a sailor. It goes beyond simple bad language; worse than any p0rn film. The level of contemporary sad-violence and perversion that he adds to each of his written characters is a genre that is even illegal with p0rn standards. This perverse, disturbing thinking is clearly visible in his own personality and in the things he says. Another reviewer found the description I was looking for. It's a sniffing film. Be sure to listen to your story about deleted scenes and alternative endings. This director / writer is really sick. I can't believe anyone would make him responsible for the film, the less he will pay. You can be sure that I will never see another movie with which it is linked. In the thousands of films I've watched and collected, there are only a few directors and writers who have deserved such a boycott. He is offensive than someone I've ever seen in filming. There have been some bad directors and writers, but none of them can compare with their sick, twisted mind. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, which was just one murder murder after another. When he got over the murder of the hotel, the cops were shot and brutally fired by sick sick ... a family with bad parents (who had no children) ... followed by drug addicts .... the movie went on (even more) in a twisted, deviant serum killers. Movie. These were my real thoughts when I watched this movie. I was going to find out exactly what the writer was so sick of, because this writer must seriously commit to psychiatric treatment. To my surprise, it turned out to be a director. When I saw and heard what he was saying on the DVD, I realized that my rating to the writer was the right nose. On the DVD he was really sick, a twisted person I saw when writing such a disturbing movie. <br /> <br /> Although a little girl (Stephanie) Ryan Simpkins, really stole the show ... I can believe her real parents would hurt that bad mouth, staged the director near her daughter. <br /> <br /> This movie is annoying, ill, offensive, twisted, and needs some serious treatment in the event of mental illness. <br /> <br /> As for the end of the movie, the alternative ending was to end with this terrible attempt. The film or story or the stream of the movie didn't make sense and no use to the death of another character. I'm stunned that every studio actually spread the movie. The trailer was completely misleading. The only reason why the film got the audience it did was due to the smart vocabulary and creative portrayal of the trailer. This trailer does not represent the movie you see. <br /> <br /> Other than a child ... every sign of this movie was sick, murderous, twisted, perverted, violent sex, and their characters reflected in the mind of their creator-director. But if you look at it carefully, even the parents of a restful family; sick policemen take the pot; serial numbers that represent substitution roles; police station; and even a station dispatcher ... every one of these role roles contained a sexually, twisted, violent pervert. I'm not too sure about some of the actors after watching the movie and the special features of the DVD in the Canadian city. <br /> <br /> This writer-director has such a personal deviation that, whatever he writes, includes the role of each character in the same carbon copy sheet. The only character who had no divergent trends was a child. Watch closely and you will see it in every character. Then listen to the director-writer talking about the special features of the DVD and understand what I'm talking about about my mental state and psychological problems. He would not tolerate too many decent homes if he were not a Hollywood filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Jennifer Chambers Lynch does not have much filmography ... less than a handful of things. Since his carbon replicates these disturbing traits in all roles of his character, I don't think we have to see many of his films written or staged by his father, director David Lynch. I would recommend staying away from all the movies with which he is involved ... and I'm not sure his father's films are better. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Avoid anything written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch.
