SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> Not good. The movie was completely different from the book (not that the book was exactly classic, but it was really good.) <br /> <br /> I think Demi Moore was OK. In fact, I do not remember much or nothing of my performance in any way. But there was no big disappointment with Mrs Moore. WHY did someone who rewrote decide that a millionaire is suddenly a heart? (I refer to him as a "millionaire" because he also had another name in the movie, then the version of the book - just one change.) <br /> <br /> People who didn't read the book obviously knew nothing but In this version of the book, this man is so merciless and complicated. He's also exciting. The fact that such a big change was made in the film changes the whole plot. It was almost like seeing a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> I know that many movies differ greatly from books. But I also thought that Redford's character was a little wimp. This ISN'T Redford guilt (He is a great actor and could have been merciless), but without these qualities he just gets the love of another man, so this story becomes just one story of clich√© love that includes 1 woman and 2 men. It wasn't really the point of the book. <br /> <br /> It could have been much better. Even if I hadn't read the book version, I wouldn't have liked it so much, but with so much change it takes a few points for me.
