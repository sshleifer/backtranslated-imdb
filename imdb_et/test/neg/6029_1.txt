This is the worst war movie I've ever seen, perhaps the worst. I believe it is unbelievable that some people have rated this 10th. Almost every clich√© of war films appears in this movie and it is done badly. On the other hand, I would not have followed it to the end if it was not so impressive that I was amused.
