This movie was horrible, and it's not even worth the movie. The way I look at it is more than three noon daytime Disney cartoon episodes that loosely matched to make one video pretending to be the first Atlantis movie that was so well done and enjoyable. And where do I even start with this DVD? Story? Characters? Pictures / animation? For me, they are all bad and unobtrusive. First, the story in this direct video DVD is ridiculous and pointless. The only good thing is that it is consistent - it is consistently bad from start to finish. After the end of the movie, I still don't know why Milo has come back and how the incidents are occurring in three small nations, or between Atlantis. And all I remember about this movie was how bad it feels to me. The characters know the wood and have no personalities and the drawings are much different from the first one. You can say that they are not obviously the first of the same animators. As the DVD played, I found myself less and less able to do the characters and hope that the movie will end soon. In addition to the story and the above-mentioned characters, the picture quality is also poor in this respect, probably one of the worst direct video products ever released by Disney. As an original Atlantean fan - lost empire - I couldn't disappoint more about Milo's return, which is a complete waste of time and money. Thank you for letting me rent instead. However, I do not wish I could see it or even its existence.
