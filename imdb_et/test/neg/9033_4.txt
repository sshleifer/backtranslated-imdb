So Seagal plays DEA Detective John Hatcher, who lost his partner in drug research, a surprise in Colombia! Not to comfort or do anything but my father was born and raised in Colombia (so my surname), and now he is a doctor in California, so no matter what movies you think you believe, there are things other than drug dealers and cocaine coming out of Colombia ! <br /> <br /> Hatcher loses his partner and accidentally loses a naked Colombian prostitute, inspiring him to admit, somewhere that I've never seen him before or after his films. It was actually quite interesting. Seagal has a tendency to become almost as unusual as he never participates much in women other than the plot device, and how an occasional seduction attempt, whether it is a stripper or a lover, will never make the slightest interest. theme. He's all the bad guys. But in the confessional, he admits that he has lied, sold drugs, falsified evidence, and even sleeping with informers to get the information he needs to put bad boys in (I hope I can't trouble God, telling you that?). The priest tells him that he's going to his family so he decides it's time to retire. <br /> <br /> The next third of the film is the paper-thin character of Seagale films. The Seagall story of a mystical Jamaican drug dealers band has been flagged to death and they have no consideration of the extensive daylight of their products. <br /> <br /> Hatcher goes back to his old high school trainer, Max (minimal Keith David's effort), and right in the middle of the practice are some of the tricks that sit in the blacks, breaking a break into a high school girl on a book. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just had a hidden experience in high school, but I didn't know crack sellers and crackheads who were hanging out at school were. In any case, it won't be long before Hatcher learns how these sons are. They are not just for high school kids to break, but the coach has lost their drug players regularly, they are dealing with the Smart scenario with Max, and because it is not enough, his 13-year-old sister died in his trash. <br /> <br /> Ah, OK. We get the picture. I'm sure they will torture puppies and win old women and can also steal candies from children, just for a good measure. Is it really hard to find out who the bad guys are? The 13-year-old brother died in his cafe. Wow. <br /> <br /> Anyway. Not only does the film know how to develop a badger without using what is basically called film names, where evil acts are committed to them through dialogue, but they also do not know how they should act. The head of drug dealers is called Screwface, and I think you should talk to you about something like that. Screwface is a cartoon Jamaican man with these bright, bizarre green eyes that I think must be an important part of his character because he spends most of his screen time when his eyes are kneeling out of his head. His favorite feeling is to scare very loudly with his wildly overstretched Jamaican accent on his face, which is literally less than a inch away from whoever screams. This man likes to get so that the boys can see that he has to turn his head to not touch their nose. Everything I was thinking was how the poor guys start breathing. <br /> <br /> People, they don't want you to forget that these men are Jamaican. Their accents are so exaggerated and overwhelmed that they are almost impossible to understand for most movies. Not that it is important. It doesn't matter what they say, all you need to know is that everything that comes out of their mouth is a drug-related affair, they are just psychologists who are stunning and killing people. The film must be a big hit in Jamaica! <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with the film is that theaters, especially bad guys, as I have described, are wonderfully funny even for Seagale. They are so comic and strange that it is impossible for them to take anything other than the creation of goofball b-movie, something they have come up with in order to provide the feed that Seagal can distribute with their characteristic brand sense of responsibility. <br /> <br /> But the film also has a strange mystic that just makes it all strange. For example, a mystic, I think you would call him, at one point Screwface makes some curse (when I remember correctly) spitting the lips of Bacard on a living pendant that is hung upside down before he throws it on and blood slides from Screwface . Hmm. Interesting. Unfortunately, it warns the same woman who warns Hatcher that these people are "dead" to their family, which means they have a voodoo hex. Not to tame anyone, but when I was told that such people were cursed by my family, I would just laugh. Hatcher doesn't hit me as a guy who takes a lot of stock in an amazing voodoo church! <br /> <br /> But as you can see, the setting for the sea film is quite common. Unique villains, I think I could say, though not very impressive. Surely the strange movie of Seagall's early career?
