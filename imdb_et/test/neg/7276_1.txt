I've never been interested in cannibal films before, and before a few months ago I had avoided this movie genre. <br /> <br /> I had to go through a knee surgery recently and found that I had a lot of time with my hands when I couldn't work, I decided that after almost every horror movie we had to offer our local video store to take it on. <br /> <br /> Christ was a mistake! I've never seen a movie that would have been bad for all my film addiction years. It's just a bunch of s ** t that is pasted on a DVD and sold as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of respect for other horror fans who can change their brains long enough to enjoy this mess, They're more brain dead than ever and this is some achievement! 0/10 and it's generous.
