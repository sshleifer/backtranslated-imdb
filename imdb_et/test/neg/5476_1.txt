This filmmaker wanted to make a movie without telling the story - and did it. A really terrible line of unlikely / unexplained coincidences and an unidentified plot that are not all characteristic or clear motivations. <br /> <br /> We get click-images instead of symbols. Especially, this is a small and beautiful criminal boss who designs a superfluous "harsh man" and casts a shadow of a comic scare against the real heavy boys who have worked for him. Nothing amazing when watching a movie, except for one shot when boys hit the road and one of them carries a small suitcase (like the smallest full-featured American tournament kit) in a bright, blue, without explanation or excuse. Otherwise, it is visually standard - another exception is the beautiful bridge in CT.
