Be it people, I have to agree with almost everyone else's opinions here. Characters. Is. Stupid. They are all stereotypical and still have nice clothes and are always thin. Don't even start me as Jamie Lyn as the role of ZOEY. Zoey is a beautiful, popular, tan, blonde young teenager who all just loves! He has a "rebellious", great, personality that everyone agrees with, no matter how stupid or extreme. The most annoying is everything: his voice is damp and unpleasant. "OMG!" <br /> <br /> Take the first episode, for example. At the moment he joins the enormous PCA university, it seems that everyone loves him. The guys want to ask him, the girls want to be his friend and so on. Thinking that he is all that episode plays with Zoey always at the center of attention; he is the best player in the basketball team of unofficial girls, he is sure and he is sorry if he faces his face. Oh boo-hoo. <br /> <br /> My favorite character is the whole series, which is a girl who looks much later at the show, Lauren or something who is ONLY someone who will ever show me hate Zoey <br /> > And Zoey doesn't even look very loyal to his friends. In one episode, he even names his friend without apologizing forever and does not see it with the least regret. <br /> <br /> Zoey is always the best: <br /> <br /> -Desiging professional T-shirts and backpacks (which will become a big hit) <br /> <br /> - come with very detailed schemes what one person teaches in a lesson. <br /> <br /> Flawless Classes <br /> <br /> - Blame things that were not even related to him so everyone else could be happy. <br /> <br /> - So good trading that was so good was put on TV. The list goes on and on ... <br /> <br /> Ugh. He has no talent. She is always the perfect person. He acts potty and rebellious and preppy and ... UGH! Can't stand her. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but all shows always have great clothes. NOT NERD! Her wardrobe is better than mine, and I am pretty clever enough. <br /> <br /> Nobody cares if everyone in the PCA loves you, Zoey, and do something for you, even if it means giving them a better hand. <br /> <br /> BUT, regardless of these cardboard labels, the plots will create. Not everyday things. They are interesting and entertaining. Humor is usually good-natured and fun, but the characters are so papery that it's hard to enjoy. <br /> <br /> This show would be great if Dan Schnieder had some more time to think about the will of the characters because they were so typical, so boring that it was flat and stupid. <br /> <br /> Point: No one is overweight, all have stylish clothes, Zoey is the concept of Mary Sue, the story is thoughtful and humor is ridiculous. But again, I want to emphasize that characters are shown. Look at the exhibition if you need to, but don't say I didn't warn you when your eyes start bleeding.
