I do not mind any kind of adult humor, but this function was simply black. The first 10 minutes of Pryor were taking pictures of some guy, following my even greater torture. I don't know what happened in the last 5 minutes because I went out. After I saw it, I didn't see Richard Pryori again. And guess that he actually went to organizing a kindergarten. <br /> <br /> If contempt and tasteless, wrong dirty jokes make you laugh, you probably enjoy it. But if you're an "old-fashioned" type, don't worry.
