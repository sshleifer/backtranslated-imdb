I don't know how expensive it was to create this movie, but the effect was terrible. Half of the film was filmed on the canvas of the film (it is certain that the blue box would not look so artificial). When they traveled by boat, the background channel was moved by mimicking the waves, but the characters did not move. CGI Effects: Terrible (I'm not sure, but I think the effect was created with Paint and made them a GIF sequence - next time the creators should hire a professional CGI team). It seems that the creator of the CGI would have shaken the drawing strip with shaking hands. It has been confirmed. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was created in 1983. One of my friends told me the right date: 2005. My jaw fell, I was so shocked, I thought she was kidding. People, I suggest you skip this movie, the story is twisted, you don't enjoy it.
