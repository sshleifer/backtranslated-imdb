This step is so bad on so many levels, I don't even know where to start. OK - Good Points - Peebles are beautiful as black leather. Part of the landscape photography was stunning. That's it. Oh, and that was a nice touch where the buffer head was above the door of the Freemanville bar, I think it was for Buffalo soldiers. The movie begins with a sort of OK, but the characters are so smooth, so the comic book "so much", the bad guys are bad, I try to describe them further. The Spanish-Cuban American War was 1895-1898, when America was only involved in April-August 1998. I think the film said it happened in 1893 (I could be wrong, but I don't want to look at it again). Much of this movie depended on the FAQ who killed Jessi's father. Well, boys, the original FAQ started in 1865, and President Andrew Johnson destroyed it in 1871. Klan wasn't even around during this movie. Of course, nasty bas ** rds was busy again in 1915 and we know it for the rest. But for the film, it's historically wrong and it was a big part of the plot. I think I can make myself crazy by getting a lot more jab and I'm ready. I did not know that Boyz2Men and other such bands were inspired by the singers of New Orleans Street in the 1890s. I also didn't know that fetish necklaces were all rage for the women of the 1890s Sioux ... but then I was surprised to see a jazz singer doing acoustic 1-nail nails. like cheesy western more than most people. Such a waste of talent and money - it was really an opportunity to show part of American history that is not well known. /bkcwboy2.htm for more information. It could have been so good, but it was just ... bad for 1-10 if it gets from scratch instead of 1, because Mario looks good on his hat and there was the Appaloosa horse film.
