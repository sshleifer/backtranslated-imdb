SPOILERS <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> This is Tenchi? This is not Tenchi. <br /> <br /> Virtually everything is written amazingly ... When it comes to characterization, the only bright spot between Ayeka and Ryoko. <br /> <br /> Also, reputation is not punished for his actions, which mean rape of the mind. If one man Haruna made to Tench had made one man's cable, he would (rightly) at the end of the movie painfully buy, die terribly, and the audience would be happy. But not only does Haruna pay no price for her crimes, but she forgets her activities. No! The real Ryoko would have scattered him because of what Haruna did to his beloved Tench; the audience I saw it myself, everyone in this scene heard audibly <br /> <br /> Anime fans, avoiding this movie. Tench fans are making this movie even harder.
