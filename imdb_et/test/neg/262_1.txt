There is no - NO redeeming qualities for this film. They didn't check any facts - no ... anything. I am sorry for Larry Miller and I am sorry that his representative was unable to find him a more suitable place. <br /> <br /> Adults are all idiotic. The effect is cheesy and there is no sense of reality. The music is honestly cheesy. The plot is incredible. <br /> <br /> I want to see something good with my family, see something else. Take your time and check your attic for mold. My ten-year-old is watching this movie as we watch it. Unfortunately, he learns that not every film is worth it.
