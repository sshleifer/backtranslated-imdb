I promised some time ago to never get another Joe Castro movie (maybe after "Death of Death"), but I got it accidentally because it was a Troma release and I didn't read the cover carefully. Sorry. Well, I looked at it and it is not good, but it is, I think, a kind of "cheek cheek" .... if that is not the case, it seemed like that. Some of the awful people at the University of Rio Grande have found out that Chupacabra exists because someone in the surveillance cameras of GOAT BARN shows this strange field of view. And also because the person who allegedly killed this thing was the uncle of the expedition leader. There are a couple of cameramen, one of whom is spraying all the time and there is some former Marine called "Army" (?!), Who is some ammunition expert or something. In any case, they find Chupacabra on some man's beach and are ready to find it by taking part in two supposed witches along the way. This creature itself is quite ridiculous, the spine behind it and the big long tongue that Gene Simmons would die for. Finally, after a bunch of people were killed, Chupacabra will do it, and they will take it to university. Is it from another planet? Is it a genetic creation from a Puerto Rico lab? They don't really tell us. Not just interesting but not terrible. Certainly there is no wide audience for this. 4 out of 10.
