This movie didn't do it for me. I like horror and splatter movies, but it has very little to do with horror. The effects are cheap and if they look so fake when cutting one of their legs. The same applies to other effects, such as torture and sex of the gut. They could have spent some extra bucks on the effects. <br /> <br /> With many sexes (with pixelization like all Japanese movies) it's just sick fetish porn and seems to be a sick stuff market like that. Although it is bloody, it is suitable for titles like Squirmfest / Purge and Genki. These films have girls who eat and play with any fluid coming out of the body, eat up the bugs and fish to a great extent and have sex with all kinds of strange animals like toads, eels and ... One look at the cover says horror fans are looking elsewhere. There's no fear here, just sick and humiliating sexual scenes. <br /> <br /> Horror fans should avoid this and better control Guinea Pig2: Meat and Blood Flowers or even August Underground Mordum. Although not large, they offer at least a horror experience and Niku Daruma fails in this department.
