Tom Cutler (Jackson) is a retired policeman who is now working as a criminal. At his last job, he cleans up a new crime scene and destroys the evidence, and he doesn't know that the crimes have not been officially reported. It can't be good. <br /> <br /> You will hear cleaning products all the time, but usually when your body, etc. needs to be removed, if your body, etc. needs to be removed and the area cleaned. This is different because Tom Cutler is working with the police to clean up the police after investigating the crime scene. Hey, somebody has to do it. You know the police don't. The film makes it quite clear and the family's job is to clean the area. <br /> <br /> This is almost a good thriller, but the side line of Tom's daughter (Palmer) makes this story somewhat uncomfortable. I think they had to spend time. Oh, they brought this side of the plot around to connect to the other side of the plot, but it was still accessible and uncomfortable. Look? Music didn't help if I noticed that music was more suitable for people to see a longer journey. You know, music. Is it? Acting by everyone was great on this great thriller. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: No
