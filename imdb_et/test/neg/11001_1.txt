I had to suffer this movie three times when I was a zombie extra for the director's new film After Sunday. For the first time, when I saw this movie, the director remained beside me and had a clearly fake and cheesy-looking hand that stood out and grabbed one character. I couldn't take it anymore because I just smiled at the boy. The film has no direction and one thing that could make this movie decent (female nudity) was nowhere. I'm a fan of low budget horror movies, but it was too much for me. The worst part was that I had to watch it so many times. Also, don't expect the new movie to be better.
