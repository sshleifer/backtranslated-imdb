I appreciated this movie 3 and it was generous. The terrain is pointless and terrible, mostly acting terrible. I think Peter O'Toole did a good job (Tiberius), but he had to see the final cut. John Gielgud, regardless of whether he appears on his film, still played a role in Hamlet. The hard core pornography parts were not erotic and didn't tell the story. Okay, Malcolm McDowell had a nice ass and the guy who played Macro was pretty. The guy who played Claudia looked more like Nero's traditional images and was definitely in conflict with Robert Graves's Claudius. The Caligula, the wife and the child's climatic (?) Murder is inaccurate in that it shows him after the death on the staircase outdoors, when he was actually murdered in an underground passage on a palatine hill that ran across the front of Domus Flaviana, which still exists. There are places in this movie where almost everyone drew my attention away from it - merciless disorders. If you want history, read about Sueton or Tacitus, if you want pornography and sadism, check out Passoli's "Salot", but leave this movie away.
