This exhibition is another bad comedy that is likely to be canceled after two seasons. It's not just that jokes are sexist / racist / homophobic, they're not funny and clichés. In the first episode, Father said he wanted something: "I want women not to go out and get jobs and have the same rights as men blah blah" It really helps attitudes? Then he created his son who said he was strange. What parent says the child is strange? So this exhibition is boring, unoriginal, offencive, clichéd and above all NOT FUNNY. Yes, the American father is innocent. But it also makes a laugh and probably takes micky. That's the difference.
