Being an American service member, believe me when I say that this film does not in any way accurately reflect the emotional state of our soldiers / sailors / air travel / naval soldiers returning from applications. <br /> <br /> This is said. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the great stoneware clich√©. The scary (except for the little girl) character's background is weak and ridiculous, and the plot is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I made an account with IMDb to warn anyone about the brain. <br /> <br /> Canadian writer / director Francesco Lucente should be really, really ashamed of this movie. If he does not agree with the US foreign policy, he should write to the United States Government not to punish the English-speaking world monumentally with the film.
