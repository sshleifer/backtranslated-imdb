J.J. Jameson (from Spiderman 2) Quote ... Crap, Crap, ... <br /> <br /> Mega-Crap This pretends to be a tribute (and / or deliberate) to the Coen Brothers ... badly done. br /> <br /> There is no real secret to the plot. <br /> <br /> Diaz's performance is absolutely tireless. <br /> <br /> Dummies are not working really. <br /> <br /> There are many "duh" moments. <br /> <br /> I love black comedy, but this movie is not funny. <br /> <br /> I think it wasn't <br /> <br /> There are many movies in this genre that are much more fun. <br /> <br /> I hope this review is useful.
