Now I understand that it took two months. Really? I'm pretty sure my team could do it in less than a week. This film was so bad that I couldn't even pay close attention. Just more evidence that a boy is carrying women can not always write, act and guide you terribly. Now I understand that it was not a budget goal, but also no continuity or any real reason not to turn it off and look at a newsletter or foreign news in a language you don't understand. Oh, there are some decent looking women who show goods. However, there are not enough sexy women living to look at the travertine in the film industry. One of the longest 80 minutes of my life. I drove it out with the help of my old friend Jim Beam. Take advantage of yourself and get your weapon ready if you want to use it after hacking. Finally, the individual (moron) who remained in the comment before my opinion thought it was a great movie and loved it. Just more evidence that siblings should not be created. Ow, BURN !!! - Captain J
