the only reason I bought this DVD is because cynthia rothrock is inside it. everyone knows he is a martial arts b in movies. The trouble is that it is not a martial movie.cynthia rothrock on about a minute or so fighting scenes in this silly movie.now if you were a movie maker and you had a cynthia rothrock in your movie would'nt you want to have a lot of martial arts action? all he does in this movie walk around looking boring as i was when i watched this pile of crap.i its a lot of his movies and they have all b movies but at least they had some cool fighting scenes on them. is a martial arts fan to avoid it no matter what.I am still mad i wasted 4 dollars to buy this dvd
