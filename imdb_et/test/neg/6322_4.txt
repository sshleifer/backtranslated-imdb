New York lawyer plots to get rid of his old mother after an attractive and accessible woman meeting. The sculptor Robert Klane, who adapts his novel (the kind of flick that children would buy for dirty parts), doesn't seem to be aware of mental illness: it's just an excuse for spicy comedy and scatical jokes. George Segal, who was mainly in war and espionage in the 1960s, has now become one of America's greatest sad comedies; his nut reactions and dirty answers competed only for his mother's negligence. Segal is well connected with Trish Van Devere and the moments of unification (although they also play laugh) are actually the only sequences that can be directed. Ruth Gordon, lovable as he is, is just too much - and more of his less. This is one of the worst and edited movies I've ever seen from so-called professionals. Promising scenes that cannot play a full-blown effect are accidentally disconnected from other endless moments that cause the crass, rickety movie to be self-destructed long before it's actually over. * 1/2 from ****
