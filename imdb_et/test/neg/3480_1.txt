As a fan of bad movies, I was glad I found 3 packages cr @ ppy horror today on Best Buy. The set was inexpensive and contained a terrible "Darkness" movie, which I actually see in the theater. <br /> <br /> The other 2 were equally bad. The "haunts of abyss" are probably the worst. Because they were all bad, it doesn't talk much. But its stupidity, bad functioning, terrible effects and slow storyline made it a lot of fun. I ran to the floor with the development of every new plot. Abandonment of abandoned ship, lost crew, understanding that something was terribly wrong !!! It was nice !!! Of course, it seems that everyone's favorite scene is a sexual scene. OMG !! I almost lost it !!! There's a "monster cam" between that, I have to say I enjoyed this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of bad movies, so I enjoyed it, but I had to give a movie fairly 1. IT was completely ... But if the garbage is your bag, at least rent it ... (YES BAD red was deliberate)
