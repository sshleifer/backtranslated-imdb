Well I obviously agree with all the bad comments about this movie cos honestly, I thought it was such a piece that I thought the actors had done terrible work and the script was all terrible. Although the special effects were not a bit bad, but I think it should have been much more difficult to think about. I mean, how Clara Bryant put this film to good use, she wants to do a lot better if she looks a little further and it goes the same way with Kristen's honey, I think her character dies and she doesn't bother to try and protect myself I mean it must be a complete joke. He should at least do much better than he wants to become a soldier or more a heroine or something of bravery. But the thing is that the actors did a complete breathtaking job, and so did the film director and writer. they should have gone to a film school to think about better ideas and I hope everyone agrees with my methods.
