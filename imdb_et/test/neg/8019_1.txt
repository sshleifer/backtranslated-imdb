A couple of teenagers have a little sex on the beach in the 1960s. That is all. They say they are fifteen, while one participant is really twenty-five. Perhaps this film was somewhat revolutionary in 1978, which touched on taboo themes, but I can't imagine that at that time something was shown as a taboo in Esmiko Limon. disco music that is even lower. The choice of songs does not include anything other than the well-known "classics" heard by every other radio station today. The American Pie plot is not much different, but it's at least a little funny. Eskimo Limon is boring, flat and not aesthetic. Almost unbelievable that he had six sequences!
