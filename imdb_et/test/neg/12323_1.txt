Due to functional, direction, script writing, and artistic direction, this film is completely ill-prepared and the money would have been spent better on the shoes of the victims. When we got so sad they had to fill a child's movie with sexual enthusiasm to keep the parents' attention. <br /> <br /> Dr Suess is now running in her grave, "dirty ho" SHIT "and fake erections scenes, etc. their child, if there is no T & A. Greed greed and more greed. <br /> <br / > Compare it to classic children's movies and get a worrying view of the world These men should stick to making MTV videos How has this movie received over 400 votes than the perfect 10 is beyond me (unless it's a family of directors)
