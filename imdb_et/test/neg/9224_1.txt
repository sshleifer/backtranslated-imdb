It's really a remarkably bad movie, but it's a rare bad thing that is endlessly jaw-fun! I want to add other comments to this movie. <br /> <br /> The Rock Band on the airplane looks like three lean suitcases that come from casual labor and carry bad wigs. <br /> <br /> Look for a heavy child stuffed tiger consistency problem: it turns into a lion, leopard and back; it is dirty or clean depending on the picture. <br /> <br /> SPOILER! A filled tiger becomes a real animal to save a child (and writers)! <br /> <br /> The small Jimmy face that floats by the coffin on the Amazon, linking his stuffed tiger and tearing it, stays in the memory forever. <br /> <br /> Listen to any abandoned sound effect ever: late story when the priest finds Jimmy, counseling the monk's costume as a payment - the priest falls on one generation of disgusting moments and a beep, not a deep "BONNNNG" church bell, but boxing game "ding"! <br /> <br /> Watch.
