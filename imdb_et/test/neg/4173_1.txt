What can be said about this? Really one of the most pleasant experiences of my life. Your brain tries to shut down as part of its original impulse. I missed the experience of watching this movie, and I took two hours back. This film now joins Boogeyman and Zombie's revenge as the hellish trinity of horror films. I certainly don't understand this difference. I mean it terribly. A terrible way. <br /> <br /> This movie has no redemption features. Everything is terrible. The artless camera work gives us an endless picture of a lot of corn, a lot of mud. The story is farther away. The script is ?? Was there a script there? The offender is heavily uneven and carries yellow necklaces. Children are annoying. The leading man is charismatic. And it's the courage to go 100 minutes ahead. It is similar to torture at all levels without any merit. Normally, such a statement would be an exaggeration for comic effects. Not in that case. I'll say it again? it is torture. <br /> <br /> At the end I was in a state of paralysis. It was fortunately short. But when I got back, I decided I had to watch the "Making Of" featurette. I had to understand. Perhaps it would be a reasonable explanation for this fear. Was it all a complicated joke? For the first time, I looked at the "making" of picture 2 and discovered that the writer / director was, to put it mildly, somewhat erroneous. I also discovered that since I had taken the first two minutes of Dark Harvest 2 'making' I was an idiot. Not a pleasant self-discovery trip. Life sucks. <br /> <br /> Very Unwanted.
