Bad Quentin Tarantino hanged, at least I hope it's what they were doing, because at least then I can respect Tarantino's admirable leader. One scene of the "singing" scene with Rose McGowan is far from being done and a genius for this film and it could have been mistaken for this driver. So, in addition to her Quinton inspiration and Rose McGowan and one of her good scenes, this film was sung. Some of the crappiest dialogues I've ever heard are ready to bet why McGowan doesn't talk much because his dirty dialogue would have been. Trying to be funny, never, trying to be dark and not, trying to be stylish and just happy. Whoever feeds money to make such films, I hope it was all the directors, so no one's money was wasted. If not for McGowan, the whole cast is terrible and if McGowan is your best hmmm, I have to wonder.
