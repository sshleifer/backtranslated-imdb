Wow this is a stereotypical, terrible trash. I'm sorry for anyone who might be wasting their money to see it. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure I never laughed at this movie, I just can't believe they're going to make that terrible movie. br /> <br /> I'm more cautious now when watching late night movies. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the worst film I've ever seen in my life. I'm not saying this is the worst film that exists (though it could be), but I don't think I've seen anything so stupid and unforgettable in my life. it makes the Scary Movie series intelligent. <br /> <br /> 1/10 I'd give it to 0 if they let me
