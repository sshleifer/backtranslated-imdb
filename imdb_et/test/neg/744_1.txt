Norther's Monastery is not my favorite Jane Austen novel, but she has her own charms. This movie is not. It has some of the same characters as in the book, but the story has changed drastically and the most intelligent man in the Austen canon (when Emma's Knightley meets) is a heartless and mercenary. Introducing one or two completely extraneous characters and it all hangs over the corset perversion. I was so disappointed when I saw it for the first time in 1986; even today, it is the highest in the list of films that shame books on which they are based. Even Robert Hardy's fans should give it one wide view. It has nothing and I would recommend this N-O-T-H-I-N-G.
