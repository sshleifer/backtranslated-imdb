In this film, there are certain scenes (such as the first meeting of the hero with the super-villainess Shirley Eaton), where it appears to be at the brink of sexual taboos and its presumption (women want to rule the world, making men slaves) justice, but it never dared. The result is a movie with sexuality and somewhat violence. Despite the uncomfortable plot, the movie is not too high up to the peak where its amateurism is rampant (horrible editing, excessive use of stock footage). It is worth seeing only curio. (* 1/2)
