42/100. Often referred to as "Tarzan clothing", it is not in the same league as its much better Tarzani series. Basically, Jungle Jim was a series substitute for Johnny Weismuller Tarzan, after he became too complicated. Jungle Jimis is completely dressed. It cannot be compared in any way to the Tarzan series, not in operations, scenarios, or production quality. It's pretty tough. It is the first in the series and it doesn't speak much. Too many stocks are used and that is so obvious. The result is superfluous and the plot is flat and production is so bad that it is difficult to watch from time to time.
