This is undoubtedly the worst thought-out film in history. The inventions of Carrot Top are some of the most terrible attempts to be saved in history. I don't know his second job, but if it's half as bad as that, then I'm just crying. I give this movie a 30 billion star and God can heal the souls of the responsible people.
