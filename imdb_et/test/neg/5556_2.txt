OK, I've seen Hershall Gordon Lewis movies before, but it really takes the cake, its truly gory and brand, not to mention the nasty way the strippers are made. small town, the only sustainable grace is the late Henny Youngman as the owner of the striptease club, yes, please take my wife ..., please. strippers are real sexy in 1972, I believe they used this same plot again in Roger Corman's movie; was killed to kill in 1987. I enjoyed the previous HGLew, which was a 100 maniac which was a mini-masterpiece, but was not working well, no prizes here, but remember that this is a splatter film that paved the way for Friday the 13th, and saw in a disturbing scene a half naked scene stripper with her butt meat tenderizer.ugh! morbid stuff here.HG Lewis strikes again. 2 out of 10.
