<br /> <br /> The game is heavily edited and the scene sequence is completely mixed. Action is terrible (especially Helena Bonham Carter) and cinematic. <br /> <br /> The result is a slow, confusing, boring movie that will make them new to Shakespeare, right out of Shakespeare! <br /> <br /> If you don't see the stage playing, look at this version of Olivier (1948) at least with this drivel!
