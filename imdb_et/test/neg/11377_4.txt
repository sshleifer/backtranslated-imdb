I was hoping to enjoy this movie to make fun of the evening fun. I like Judy Davis and Juliette Lewis, and the assumption seemed fun enough on the wall. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found myself over and over again. Judy Davis gave a great result, but he had very little work. Juliette Lewis was fabulous, as expected, but very little to do. The plot was full of zeros that were just foolish, and as it often happens in this type of film, no one worked as a real person. And personally I thought Marcia Gay Harden was totally wrong. <br /> <br /> The film also seemed to be shifting around the middle of the black comedy about the farce, and the complete farce about black comedy. One reviewer here notes that other reviews seem to want this movie to be something else, and that is why he deceived it. All I can say is that I would have agreed that the film would be * something * and stuck with it. It seems that the director had some great ideas but couldn't pull them all out. I'll give him 4 out of 10.
