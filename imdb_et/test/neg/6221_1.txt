I love musicals, all of them in Oklahoma, to Poignant Porgy and Bessin, to the romantic "Damn Yankees". And I know most of the songs that sometimes sing them spontaneously, with the crowd or with each other. <br /> <br /> "True" music, different from this vaudeville show, is carefully designed to match the exact moment. It is an expression of sadness, regret, love, joy or exaltation - a natural extension where mere words fail. So, "Boys and Dolls" describes "My Time" for Sky Masterson's adventurous life, because it is probably the least likely woman. The song of every genial example of this genre sets the mood or develops a character, creating a place of fantasy that is absolutely plausible when it declares itself that the songs have proved. <br /> <br /> For this lover of Broadway Musical and their adjustments to the screen in the last half of the 20th century, Mama Mia is somewhere between the distortion of the genre of satire and the cruel fun of the house. There, the songs of these musicals have often evolved with complicated, often admiring lines of land. If the songs gathered here, just the collection, confused only the shaky premise of the film. <br /> <br /> Perhaps most of those viewers who make this movie a monumental success simply do not come across the art form of 20th century musicals. They have no idea of ​​a writer and writer that can make dance halls a cosmic person we know and love, as has been achieved by "Sweet Charity." <br /> <br /> Allow me to apologize for the arrogance of this review. Maybe, another day, another mood, I might have come into it and haven't been so critical in this review. <br /> <br /> But I can't imagine what Richard Roger, Oscar Hammerstein, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, and so many others could have done that stupid assumption. I mean, while the memories of seeing this movie are fresh, and I can't help but mourn great damage.
