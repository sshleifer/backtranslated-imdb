"Joyride" video box says "starring second generation superstars" and no one can be sad. Melanie Griffith has passed on to bigger and better things ... but who cares about the rest of the pain? So I was in the box that I was a pathetic attitude, I was stupid enough to buy a movie for the dollar mindset that I was in the "so bad-good 70's movies" of Ehi, not so much. Although so many of the 70 goal-oriented (or 70-year-old) films tried to say so deeply and meaningfully, Joyrers don't even want to try. It's just pointless. It has no interest. Every character is so poorly prepared that it is no wonder that these actors see it as meaningless. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the movie is about thirty-twenty-five times going to start a business in Alaska, but instead it is robbed and you have to find a job. They get banged, eat dog food, steal cars, rob banks. All of this is very typical, but in addition it is done in the most everyday way possible. There are no surprises and the flow is so bad, and the action of the characters is so vague that you can stay from several scenes and not from thought. <br /> <br /> But if you are a fan of Melanie Griffith's breasts - this is a must-see. It is still not enough to get it on the lowest rating I can give. <br /> <br /> Best line: "Jesus, everything is biology with you." * end ****
