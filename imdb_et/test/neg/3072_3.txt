Terrible. It is not possible to handle it. Several scripts, selections and uses of Mexican soap operas in places where the film is made a labyrinth and at the same time repetitive and monotonous, with almost all of the cast destructive performances. The references to Tarantino's work, which is so badly done, are more of an insult than anything else. I suspect that it was not a shameless and plot-independent exploitation of Matadinho's generous curves, no one took this film despite any theater. <br /> <br /> These are films that make me unwilling to watch Portuguese cinema.
