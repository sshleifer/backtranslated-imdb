The best part of this movie is the first one in Sicily. Crialese shows good talents for photography and the start of the film is amazingly surprising. The rest of the story is quite boring. Crialese requires meaningless stereotypical situations and symbols, trying to melt the neo-realistic suggestions and video music technique, Fellinian's surreal memories and a very tedious and completely off-the-record soundtrack that leads to the end of the whole thing, giving you an excessive sense of the story is sharply short. To be honest, this is a real overpriced movie and Crialese is a real overrated director.
