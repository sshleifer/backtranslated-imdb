I see a pattern here. When you see a movie about Mystery Science Theater 3000, it's likely that when you go to IMDb.com, there are hordes of lovers of the movie, but it was chosen for this TV show because it was so bad. I'm sorry, but I read a lot about Rocketship X-M because it was a landmark sci fi movie that emphasized realism. Well, if that is the case, I could write several paragraphs about how even, according to the knowledge of the 1950s, this film is totally wrong. Gravity can be the first obvious observation, or when MST3K made skits "selective gravity", what if they die of their death and they just stand there looking out the window? effect on this scene? I would like to think that they started with good intentions and that it ran over the budget or something, but I think this movie was just normal cheese, like the sub-type. Compare this "When the Worlds Collide", which appeared in 1951, to see the true place where this film is located, is not a comparison. The movie gets 2 or maybe 3 independently, it's not even funny to watch it. The MST3K episode is about 5 or 6 because there is no action or much to joke, just bad, bad, bad, oh I mentioned it is bad.
