Webs begin with "Chicago: Today", as four electricians, dean (Richard Grieco), Ray (Richard Yearwood), Sheldon (Jeffrey Douglas) and Junior (Jason Jones) start to disassemble electricity for an unused building designed for demolition. When they search for the appropriate cables and things, they come in contact with a set of doors that, according to the buildings, should not be printed in blue so that they are nervous and all they are forced to open doors to find and find space-filled computers and scientific machines. When they get confused with some buttons, the portal to the parallel universe opens, Dean & Junior accidentally fell into Ray & Sheldon after looking for friends. Unfortunately, they have all reached the exact parallel Earth, taken over by a mutant spider, who eats people or makes them mutant soldiers with whom he uses to defend himself and do what he wants. In a desperate attempt to survive, they are with some of the last people, including the original inventor Richard Richard Morell (Colin Fox), who says that with the help of our electrician boys he can (yes) be able to build another portal to bring them home ... <br /> <br /> Edited and directed by David Wu I thought Webs was pretty crap, it's as simple and straight as it really is. The Grenville Case & Robinson Young Manuscript is reluctant to say that it is the smallest, and there are holes in the plot where you could drive through the tank, for example, is this movie really trying to say that some mutant spider things are no bigger than a couple of people took the size all over the world? How did they do that? If this parallel Earth was the same as us, where hell was the army? Police? All our weapons? Some fragile looking spider things literally billions of people ?! The whole flawed, stupid and downright naff concept constantly struggled with me throughout the film. Don't forget that most of the buildings that have been around for decades and are in perfect working order have an interdimensional portal between them. Then there is a nuclear reactor with a size of a portfolio, the fact that one electrician can work it completely at random when he accidentally pushes a button in a room that probably had a 100th spread of tens of devices and what a wonderfully thought-out man who sets his base for explosive trapped without telling anyone what if one of his spouses had taken it away and found that their fellow bombs were broken? Wouldn't you be the best for you? What about food? Do they grow in their small vegetable patches? I could go on all day long when there are bad, poorly prepared and poorly written web pages, but I can't bother. The characters are cliched and annoying, as is the film as a whole, which probably doesn't help. The only thing a decent thing I can say about the web is that it is short and it is moving at a fair pace, but when everyone says and does, it is still a mess. <br /> <br /> Director Wu has to take a lot of blame here to see the movie look cheap and the editing it credits is terrible. There are many tedious inappropriate slow-motion shots that come from somewhere, the action scenes are almost identical and change very fast forever. She uses this very annoying instant metering technique with a bit of old jerky camera movement, now I don't know anyone else, but I hate this editing style because it just looks like a complete inconsistency. In fact, I don't know any people who like this thing and I'm puzzled why filmmakers think people are doing it. Forget about any gore, but some shotguns spider zombie soldiers and they don't have red blood, so I don't think it is real. <br /> <br /> Webs are created by -TV, American Sci-Fi-channel, I think, and it looks as cheap as low budget and in haste, as you expect. It's all so cute, forgotten, flat and boring. The special effects are far from being special and the spider cadence has no imagination when it finally appeared. It was OK, because everything was so poor and I still can't believe that Grieco was wearing a sweater. <br /> <br /> Webs are crap, I can't say anything good after I have been through inferior movies and this is the only reason I don't give it a 1 star and a quick look at IMDb users' ratings on the web what I already knew he had more than 1 vote than any other very good reason why ...
