At the heart of almost every thriller of really big crime is a carefully considered, super-serious, methodically planned super-high-stake, which 9 times out of ten has committed a number of pleasing gray morals to whom life is not fair, worth returning. The first scriptwriter, James V. Simpson's manuscript, is going to the right of the armored. He made extra-double-assured that we had nothing but sympathy for the recently orphaned Iraqi war veteran Ty Hackett (short of Stomp's Columbus court) who had taken his house by an evil bank (brother, I). there). And he gave Tyile Mike (Matt Dillon) who is super nice and handed him to an armored car industry where he works with Baines (Lawrence Fishbourne) and some strange French guy (Jean Reno). These boys want to have fun and play worshipers, but they are also serious armored car boys, so that means they carry weapons and are tough. may start to think like I did, maybe maybe - it's a fantastic, tongue-in-cheek, cornball harp film with some nose characteristics that move the story in its natural way pulling, who really hope to truly open the plan and have many potential "holy sh * t" moments. I mean, music alone is a textbook-thief-movie - sharp, sharp shocks that work on overtime because we are treated with close-up characters who say things like "Actually I'm doing" and "Are you crazy?" the film has serious genre shock potential. <br /> <br /> Then things really start to smell. These idiots have these tips without a plan. There is no "Ok, here's what we do ..." scene, no drawings, explosives, black baths, or ski masks (despite their "test run" as seen in the trailer). No, these guys steal $ 42 million dollars from their trucks (which are only monitored by HOURLY contact radio, despite being equipped with some fancy, big GPS technologies), and they don't even intend to sit down and discuss. Hell, Mike, only tells Ty about the plan at night, which is completely ridiculous. Of course Ty got his house to think for as long as Mike promises "no one can hurt," he is on board. Guess, though. Someone gets in. Why? Because after the trucks have left the abandoned factory, they have no plan. It was so. So far they thought about things. So, of course, things are getting rid of. These cats deserve everything they do not prepare. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this script, like some bad improvisation game, looks like: "Armored Car, which is kidnapped by its own guards ... GO!" Despite some of the good increments that might have been in some interesting direction film, the story can just break down and quite soon, it makes no sense, or even far from believable. <br /> <br /> For filmmakers, they do not have a cool "hook" for these throws, their characters seem stupid and bright. And if the characters are foolish and tempting, the audience has a hard time investing in them and their story. And if this happens, the drainage of all the films will remove the film from the bottom, leaving a ridiculous, hollow crust. <br /> <br /> Stop it. 3/10
