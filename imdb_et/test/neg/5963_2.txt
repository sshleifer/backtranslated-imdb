Boyle Heights, Los Angeles: The legendary South American goat sucking vampire, El Chupacabra, is open, feeding everyone who is not happy enough to cross their way. Animal Control Officer Navarro (Eric Alegria) and Chupacabra Expert / Author Starlina Divide (Elina Madison) are trying to suppress the creature, but find that their progress is hindered by a couple of fools, a hungry local money wishing to catch the beast fat for a fee and a couple an unpleasant scientist who wants a monster for his experiments. <br /> <br /> Two weeks old taco smells, El Chupacabra is an incredibly bad horror film that even fans of incredibly bad horror movies may have difficulty sitting on. With my terrible script, terrible direction (not one, but two talentless hacks? Brennon Jones and Paul Wynne), a ridiculous dialogue and some of the worst behavior on this porn movie, I recommend this movie as much as I drink tap water in Mexico. <br /> <br /> As Navarro and Starlina continue their research, viewers are treated in some incredibly weak gore, the worst design-style history, the most incredible dead person I've ever seen in Dr Butcher MD's blinking corpse and high-tech computer security system. clicked on the keyboard. <br /> <br /> To be fair, a rubber-coated boy, a monster per se, is quite creepy (hairy, with big claws and a face like a particularly ugly bat), but its appearances are scarce and far away, with more of the annoying trials of the Navarro officer on screen compared to the anxiety of the killer with the name creature (how many times do you need to see Navarro h and your paperwork?). <br /> <br /> If you, like me, make a mistake of wasting your hard earned money on this terrible latino pill (50p in my case), consider using the disc as your tequila chief, not really looking at it.
