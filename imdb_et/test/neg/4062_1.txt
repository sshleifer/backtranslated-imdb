The plane is 747 Jumbo. The cab is located on the top floor of 747. Pilots in the movie do not climb the stairs of the 1st class cabin to reach the cabin. They move in front of the first class cabin and through the doors to the cabin. What gaff !!! On the front side of the first class cabin is a carpet and a TV. In addition, there is a radar dome. Before the start, it is shown that 747 starts the taxi on the track. There are only two engines on the plane when lifting. Areal 747 has four engines. Who was responsible for the continuity of this film? At the start of the flight, the plane suddenly also includes toilets - another farcical gaff !!! After that, the plane changes behind and vice versa. At this point I stopped watching. Absolute Garbage !!!
