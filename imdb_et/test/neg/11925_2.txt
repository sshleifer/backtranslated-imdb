Critics have begun to understand it as the Oscar winner club. After Halle Berry won the Monsters Ball, it immediately went to the devilish Catwoman. Hilary Swank triumphs Boys Don't Cry and follows it with The Core. Jamie Foxx takes a terrifying glance at stupid Stealth after catching Ray. Now it seems Hollywood Starlet Charlize Theron craps all over her "Monster" Oscar with this one of the worst Sci-fi glasses ever made. <br /> <br /> The film loses its audience's interest after just 20 minutes, the only thing that really deserves to be left is that, despite the film, Charlize Theron is still an extraordinary actor who clearly makes the best raw and ridiculous assumption . Big Flux is not only low, but it is also very blunt. It's really a pleasure for comic book fans and Horney teenagers who like the idea of ​​a semi-innocent Theron for 90 minutes. The flux can only succeed. <br /> <br /> Fight against the 2011 virus, which kills 99% of the world's population, and in the last country on Earth, Bregna, surviving, about four years later, in 2415, continues to be the name of a scientist who has developed the Goodchild Dynasty, its physician. <br /> <br /> All this in utopia is not all well and it is not outside its high walls. Citizens never endlessly jungle but unspoken, an unwritten taboo that holds and binds them to an unwritten taboo that holds and binds those unfortunate people together, which lies in their paranoia walls, in correspondence and indisputable obedience. Filmed and surrounded by Berlin, ironically, it is a story directed towards a totalitarian state, a city surrounded by a wall where its peoples are no longer able to reproduce, and its sinful and secretive trail of how it survives. br /> Flux is an assassin to whom underground rebels have set to change the course of humanity forever. This is the story of his struggle for justice, freedom and revenge. Looking at an unrealistic video game rather than a movie. The only thing that fails is that there is no queue at work, Flux can just be the beginning and the end of history that could have been one of the worst in franchise history, thank God for sad shells. <br /> <br /> My final decision on this really bad feature? This is not really the story of Charlize Theron who jumps in a black suit like a grass bunker. Operating is very pure moral and emotional compared to other cinemas that are today. It tries to be too much like an adaptation and it doesn't really take much of the drawing that I was expecting, the only thing that was done to the right, respecting the comic, was to fly in sight. Avoid at all costs.
