I am ashamed that I went to the theater to watch it when I first released the movie. Although I think the story of Aristotle Onassis and Jackie Kennedy is thin enough, it is a film that should never have been done; consequently my low rating is. <br /> <br /> The film crowns a rich Greek business story called Theo Tomasis and fights a cute young widow, Liz Cassidy, killed by an American president. Sound familiar? Yes, all except the names. <br /> <br /> Cast must not be defective. Anthony Quinn plays the Greek grandmother for perfection, and at least it is a comfort solo, having just read that Ari himself asked Quinn to play a role. Jacqueline Bisset is, of course, beautiful and experienced (for all purposes and purposes) by Jackie and James Franciscus has a good American appearance on the president. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this movie it came out and I don't want to see it again. It seems to me that I recall a fairly bad language and some general discomfort. Otherwise, I think it is a sensational and supposedly intimate glimpse of a jet on board abundant and famous, sailing ships, beaches, swimming pools, etc. Yes, the Greek island landscape is remarkable, the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> From your type, I think it's okay. There is no end of TV movies about Kennedys, which I admit to occasionally tune in and not my credit. It's basically just another. It would be much better to allow Aristotle and Jacqueline Kennedy Onside to relax peacefully.
