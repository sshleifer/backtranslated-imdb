In fact, there are some good reasons why a person should be completely crazy about watching this exhibition. Breasts are nice, although some of them are not so real, but usually they come in pairs, which is good. Watching the beach on the beach is also a very relaxing experience, as it is the perfect place to just take it easy and not to worry about eating rubber sharks. It is always good to remember that David Hasselhoff is a god. Not God, but God. It is not so much about his ability to act, because there is no one but his chest tells a lot. There is also no kit KITT in this series, which is good because Hasselhoff told in the interview that he always thought KITT was gay. Of course, it can look for her as an idiot, but given the other recent statements, it shouldn't surprise anyone. <br /> <br /> In short, it's completely safe for people. It gives us a lot of trouble and a lot of laughter, something that many deliberately humorous exhibitions don't really give us. I have to say that it is no wonder that Borat loved Pamela Anderson. I enjoy watching the exhibition. No, it's not a great show, it's really terrible, but I enjoy it. It's basically like a B movie that lasted ten years.
