It is difficult to get a deeper insight into this type of thing, because there is not even a partial reason to see it, not to mention this opinion. I don't know anything about it - I looked at it and laughed at fake breasts. Obviously, this unofficial order for the 1982 "Slumber Party Massacre", which I enjoyed in a fun way. "Cheerleader Massacre" looks like a late nite soft core Cinemax porn! And not surprisingly, there are chicks like Nikki Fritz and Samantha Phillips (fruitful actors). Lots of hackers and not much more ... A group of 20-something high school cheerleaders, two random boys, and a fat, stupid comic-relief came into the country and found a house where they were going to stay overnight. The recently escaped "Slumber Party" killer is in the area and will kill them. There is no gore or originality and I wouldn't say that nudity is a real "point of sale" because it is almost as boring as it may be in a clever film. Absolutely terrible ...
