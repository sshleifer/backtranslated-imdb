Crash should be a film about racism in Los Angeles. But in fact, it's just a series of coincidences between multiple characters that connect one of the world's largest cities in one day. Who the hell does it believe? There are unrealistic situations one after another. On the other hand, this film shows that it shows racism between the Asians, the Iranians, the Latin, the black and the white. But the big mistake is based on racism before the writer. Mainly because the white characters of this film are usually portrayed as better socio-economic people than the rest of the races. The Iranians are as poor as the Asians. And as always, the Latinos are a portrait of a housekeeper, a police officer or a very low profile job like a locksmith. Jesus !!! Don't you think it's time to change these stereotypes? Same as black, portrait as gang members, except for Black TV Director, who was the only fresh character for me. This movie sucks so hard that makes me so frustrated about the movie coming out of these days in Hollywood. Always with stereotypes. There is no realism. Nothing can be identified. It's just a big waste because it could have been a great way to show Latinos, Koreans, Iranians and Black in a different perspective.
