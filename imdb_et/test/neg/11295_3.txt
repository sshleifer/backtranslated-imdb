I'm a great fan of Thomas Harris, I read all of his novels at least 5 times and Hannibal is the book I love most. That's why this movie was my biggest disappointment and I really don't get why some people give nine or even ten. Are their demands very low or they haven't read a book or both. Even if I hadn't read the book, I still have a movie an absolute average and would give way. The novel, creepy, mysterious atmosphere does not appear in the film once, when I first saw it in the cinema, I forgot. Why was Margot Verger, a very important character, completely abandoned? Why was Barney shown to be a stupid ignorant whose only purpose was to earn money? And most importantly, why was the psychological process finally over, caused by the drugs Lecter applied to him? Not talking about ending the end and completely changing? Well, the reasons why Jodie Foster refused to play Starling are well known and I accepted it, although, like many others, I am very disappointed because I found Starling with him. With such a psychological depth of Hannibal, it is very important to identify the character when they are customized on the screen, but as the Germans say it is "yesterday's snow". Ridley Scott made some incredibly good movies, but he doesn't live his name. Jonathan Demme had the right feeling for the plot, the characters, and their relationship with the sheep silence, he would have had to do Hannibal. My only comfort is that I only saw the movie twice, it's been a long time and thank God for reading the novel, I can't see the scenes in the movie. I'm so sorry, but I can't recommend it to anyone.
