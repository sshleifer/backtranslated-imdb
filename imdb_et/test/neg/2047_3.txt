Like the Americans, we have expected HORROR and the unknown leaders who run unknown writers to expect HORROR and unknown managers to be "par". We hope it sucks and if they do not, it will become a success overnight. <br /> <br /> It's not successful overnight, nor is it a weekend or a month. It blows from start to finish and my only suggestion is: Go here to know that it is going, enjoy it for what it is, what it is not and if you have something better to do, hold it on the back. . It's entertaining, looking at the busy street while the elderly are under attack, but don't expect much - they almost never hit the real car, but just a lot of hoop.
