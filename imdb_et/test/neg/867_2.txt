Mom starts at night somewhere in the middle, which looks like a wooden building in the desert. The lift truck pulls up and angry Father strikes his slutty daughter Virginia Monroe (Claudia Christian) and leaves there, but he's not alone because Nestor Duvalier (Brion James )'s shadowy figure looks at him short distance. Virginia is trying to chat, but when she starts grinding her cigarette under her Leopard print, the high-heeled high-heeled boots of Nestor grab her throat and pull her into the darkness. Then Nestor shifts his upper loose, becomes a monster and starts eating his guts. Virginia is the last victim of a serum killer with Lieutenant Carlo Hendrix (Art Evans) and LAPD, or at least this is the message that local TV news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas MIller) tells his viewers. Clay lives happily with her pregnant girlfriend, Alice (Mary Beth McDonough), and therefore her mother, Emil (Jeanne Bates), has a free space where she decides to rent Nestor to wear a dark sunglass. Unfortunately, Emily accidentally knocked Nestor's sunglasses, showing she has strange colored eyes, Nestor then turns into a monster and bites Emily, who turns her meat into a monster like a monster. Nestor takes Emily out to train her, find a suitable homeless gang (Rory VanSaint), murder her and eat her gut, but Emily's son Clay has seen the whole thing and has to choose between what is right and her love for her mother. Now it happens that it is a monster of grotesque bleeding and eating meat! <br /> <br /> Patrick Randi edited, written, and staged thought my mother was a pretty horrible movie. Looking at some of the other comments on the IMDb & Genre List that have been given, it seems that many think the mother is a comedy horror. Well, I can tell you now that the mother did not see any comic elements at all, because they are not, unless they are very fine. The only thing I can expect is that people see comedy in the actual situation the mother is presenting, being an old lady who has become a meat-eating monster and predictable problems and an emotional nerve that causes her son to know. There are no jokes (except for the appointment of a prostitute Beverly Hills (Stella Stevens)), a sense of humor or something even in a funny movie about myself and as far as I can see that it is played perfectly straight throughout the 90-minute driving time. So if a mother doesn't have comedy, does that mean there's a lot of horror? False, the mother sucks and is painfully slow to look at, especially after the first thirty-minute minutes of Nestor, who has become several times a monster, biting Emily, showing her how to hunt for food and Clay. Until then, the mother was moving at a fairly good pace, some OK special makeup and interested me, unfortunately, her mother runs for another hour, which is basically Emily's son's patient emotional mess, her marriage and her ending marriage. is in love with his mother's love and the fact that he is a meat-eating monster. This part of the movie is incredibly slow, boring and boring as a water of demand, even if the nerve is able to use the role-play scenario of clich√©s, where Clay tells her mother she's going to her room and staying there to lock the door, telling her and putting her windows over, so she can't get out of her room. The mother's script completely ignores the origin of the monsters and asks that we simply accept that this thing exists without any reason why we should, regardless of how silly the explanation might have thought that any monster background would have helped. Technically, the mother is blissfully and cheaply looking, although I cannot say that it is badly done, it is a very average thing so that it does not impress or do anything to make time for. The monster has a special make-up effect OK, but its use in the case of very fast blinking, flashing and missing. Don't be fooled by any fictional video box, as I was, the monster is only three times the maximum, and all these are the first thirty minutes. Also, there are not many gore, broken hands, short intestinal eating, burnt body and drilling in anyone's hands. Action is fine, but please, Mr Brion James, what is this annoying pressure? At least James had a good idea that he knew he was nonsense and reasonably decided to suppress at the beginning of the procedure, all others are noblemen waiting for the black lieutenant, who was also black policeman Fright Night (1985), but you can recognize him Die Hard 2 (1990), did she and her mother die in the same year? Talk about the opposite ends of the spectrum! In general, there is nothing I really recommend to a mother as a horror film, and this is definitely not a comedy for me. Very poor, very disappointing, and once again I have come across a fancy video box with lots of cool looking monsters. Be sure to avoid one.
