Anthony Wong stands for both this and the original (much better) Untold Story, but the similarities stay there. Wong obviously does not change his role and instead plays a worshiping policeman who is involved in a rather suspicious woman, Fung (1994 Miss Singapore, Paulyn Sun), who is definitely repressed nutty. But his shameful "wants to be with a man who is a girl killer" is not as close as Wong played in the first. The film itself seems tired and numbers. Yeung Fan as an unreliable girl in the interests of physical love tries to keep one from boredom when it is possible, and Sun has a nice ass, but even that doesn't save that dud. <br /> <br /> My Class: D <br /> <br /> Mei Ah DVD Additions: Sub-interview with Cheung Kam Ching & Paulyn Sun; Anthony Wong's filmography; very short summary; Movie theater trailer; and trailers for "Chinese erotic ghost story" and "twenty something"
