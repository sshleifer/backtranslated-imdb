Simply put, I was amazingly disappointed. I'm a big fan of Asian Horror and I can watch unoriginality (I enjoyed "The Red Shoes" and "Phone" myself), but it was just bad. <br /> <br /> There are many very high quality elements in the film: photography is eye-catching, visual is cool, leadership is inspired, the actor is pretty good, music is easy on the ears and CGI is incredible. But because it is a horror movie, it is assumed that we are afraid of what just does not happen to this film. Like most South Korean horrors, it is almost original to end-to-end: there is a trademark that is long-haired, vengeful, a ghost of a woman, evil, black hair and water-threatening pieces, and at the end almost complicated * but not quite meaningful (twist is just one of the best features). And the spectator's irritation, if the film is not recycling (sometimes so accurate that it can easily be copied into plagiarism) from other films, makes it jump. Much. And by leaps and bounds, I don't mean to jump out or anything, but the loud noises and sound bands used to listen to the audience six feet in the air (there are also some "made-jump" moments that are just fierce). And if it doesn't hang from other movies, it's boring and hard to sit. <br /> <br /> And this is a shame, because "Ryeong" could have been very good and he has everything to do it is good, but its annoying excessive excess of completely predictable loud noise and jump frightens, which will eventually destroy the movie . A perfect example of how good it might have been: is the moment when one of the fancy characters looks at the body, and without the sound, looks back at the body. This is completely predictable, but using silence in this scene is great. And, unfortunately, it's so scary when the movie got me. <br /> <br /> True, "Ryeong" has some good features and even a couple jumps that are not as predictable and workable. There is a very good and sad backlash to explain the events and writhing is quite unpredictable. These are the only things that separate the film from any other Asian ghost / horror film. But their problem is, although they're working, they have been used before (J-Horror fans can easily understand that the big revelation was inspired by "A Tale of Two Sisters"), and it takes back the story for fifty minutes to go. <br /> <br /> So, finally, Ryong seems to be a truly wasted opportunity. Tae-kyeong Kim hoped that the plot's twisting and other good qualities would act as anomalies, so the audience wouldn't notice the big mistakes. But he failed and well ... We noticed everything. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 4/10.
