There is little action at the beginning of a book based on this film. So the idea of ​​turning it into a movie seems to be a completely fancy idea anyway, basically ensuring failure. <br /> <br /> Most of the book is a young sailor named Marlow's spiritual journey through many blinds and healthy people in Congo. I feel the character of Marlow's trips was not massively made by the scriptwriter. It was the greatest question of light and darkness. This is the main point of the book, and if it doesn't change the film, everything that is left is 100-minute boredom and monotony. <br /> <br /> In this case, the question arises: why should someone make it into a movie? Then you could ask for an even better question, who would like to see it? This is completely viewing for viewing. Had it not given my class class rating, I would never have considered watching a movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. The heart of darkness has been removed from all its understanding and meaning when taken from the pages of the book. Novella is tortured to read up to the last twenty pages, but the successor is that it is a pretty decent book. The film is like a blast in the dark without the possibility of targeting the world. <br /> <br /> How can a book that deals with the realization of spiritual processes and darkness be depicted in a physical, visual sense? I feel it is impossible to show thoughts exactly. I also feel that the difference between time and film creates big points that don't seem to be at all. Novella Heart of Darkness was released in 1902, while the Heart of Darkness film version has been running since 1993. 91 years between these two can be the cause of seemingly different landscapes. Novella seems to have much tougher conditions and the film does not represent the prehistoric sense of Congo. In the Congo, the film just looks like a second place, not a darkness, an inhuman place where this book paints it. I feel that it removes another important element that really contributes to the novel. <br /> <br /> The two biggest aspects of the lack of film are a little intelligence in the book The Heart of Darkness is gone. If the contradiction between light and darkness is the greatest issue, does it not contain in the film that the whole film is incredibly pointless? And that is. It is boring, unmistakable and a great waste of time. There is no reason to look at it. The book has been removed from any importance. If it is necessary for some reason, read the book. Avoid the movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> Cast and Credits Marlow: Tim Roth Kurtz: John Malkovich Russian: Morten Faldaas Proposed by: Phoebe Nicholls <br /> <br /> Director: Nicolas Roeg Written by Benedict Fitzgerald based on Joseph Conrad's short story: 100 minutes rated PG 13 (sexuality and language)
