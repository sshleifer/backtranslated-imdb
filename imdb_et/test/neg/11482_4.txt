I waited much more for this movie. The preview seemed interesting, so I decided to review it. The bottom line is that "Sebastian Cole's adventures" had only one decent thing: Adrian Grenier. The character is well designed, but everything else just moves through the length of the movie. Clark Gregg is really good, but I don't think his character was explained too well. I mean, there are not too many explanations; she wants to become a woman. However, there was something missing. <br /> <br /> The obvious low budget of the movie was nice to see. I liked that the movie was only filmed in a script (it was bad) and only a few actors. It was a nice change. <br /> <br /> Although the main idea of ​​the movie was really okay, it was a disappointment to see many scenes that had nothing to do with what was thrown here and there. As I said, the script seemed very promising, and I have to say that I was interested in director Tod Williams, but it was basically a very slow film with no good dialogue. <br /> <br /> "Sebastian" started searching for a good end, but again it dropped straight into the hole. Action was mostly good, writing needed some work, but the film's budget helped it out in the long run. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone if they want to quietly watch a movie that has a strong lead but not that I stay away. Personally, I wouldn't look at it twice.
