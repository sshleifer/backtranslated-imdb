This series does not bring the British view of the revolutionary war as much as the American view of it. The main theme of the series is that the silent majority of colonists enjoyed the British rule; that the founders were manipulative schemes whose sole purpose was to lead Britain to a violent civil war; that the supporters and militias of the American Revolution were racist, violent attacks in the fight. It is clear that the purpose of the author, Richard Holmes, is to make the viewer extrapolate these qualities straight from the American population from 1775 to the present. For example, in the episode "The Shot Heard Around the World", Holmes trembles a Boston Massacre's hidden print claiming that Crispus Attucks, the black man and the first person killed in the revolution on the skin, were "lured" by Holmes. argues that depicting Attucks as a black person would have been a bad propaganda of a revolutionary cause. Holmes never shows how he knows it. And there is more. Holmes goes to some lengths to work in one, unjustified, cruel: British desecration. compares American soldiers with Viet Cong and Majahaden - without mentioning the goals of these groups. The list goes on. <br /> <br /> This series is said to have been made in response to Mel Gibson's "Patriot." He says a lot if the academician feels the need to answer Mel Gibson on any subject. Instead of presenting a British view, Holmes really wanted to give a sensational, anti-American view, and in the process he made himself a historian Roger Corman - strictly third a level.
