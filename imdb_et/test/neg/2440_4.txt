Justine can't find the perfect wife to make her first perfect. When a geek friend has towed, he enters a virtual machine to improve his appearance. When he sees the opportunity to create his perfect man, there is an explosion and the results remain in his imagination. The problem is how many obvious sex jokes are there? How predictable can such movies be? Some funny moments here and there, but nothing surprising or different about jokes in other movies or even in normal life. If you liked WEIRD SCIENCE or "water outflow" with a "gender identity crisis" then all those 90 minutes you might enjoy.
