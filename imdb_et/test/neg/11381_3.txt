"Ghost Son" is Lamberto Bava's best film and at the same time his worst. I think this statement requires some clarity. It is his best because it is well targeted, ambitious, accessible and very stylish, but his worst because it is a boring, unigenous film and undoubtedly a huge hit on all Bava's past efforts. Let's face it: many fans, I certainly involved, were not interested in this film, appreciating its plot, its famous names, and even the boring sounding title. The only motivation here was Lamberto Bava, who brought to us a large number of twisted Gialli and fun splashes in the past. "Ghost Son" is a bit beside his return movie, "The Torturer", and while the latter is definitely not a good movie, he lives at least with his fans' limitations, with too much slease, blood. and sadism. "Ghost Son" is a weak and intolerably soft horror film that even speaks of the main ghost stories. The emphasis is too much on sentimentality, and it has a bad impact on the already terrible and terrible moments of the atmosphere. One or two potentially good ideas may be the basic premise, but the film is generally boring and too clich√©. John Hannah and Laura Harring are celebrating a happy couple living far from ranch in South Africa and raising horses for living. Joy and happiness could not be improved, so naturally something tragic happens and does. The Mark dies in a car accident, but the incredible Stacey stays on the pasture where he is constantly in touch with Mark's spirit. She even gets pregnant with her child, but soon after the birth of the child, mystical events begin to emerge. It seems Mark's uneasy and selfish ghost "embraces" the child and uses him to encourage Stacy to commit suicide. Focusing on all couples' relationships, many events and subcategories are underdeveloped and / or unexplained, like the whole youthful maid of Thand. It is too little and the only real moments of fear are too obviously borrowed from classic movies like "The Exorcist" and "Rosemary's Baby" (vomiting green, self-moving furniture ??). Speaking purely in terms of terrible entertainment "Ghost Son" is a painful failure, but it has to be said, it's a beautiful and enchanting look. Cinematic art is extremely elegant and many camera angles are truly inventive and desirable. Sometimes a desperate result even reaches an intimidating atmosphere, though nothing is important on the screen. There are several beautiful pictures of wild animals in South Africa, but if you are interested, I think instead of the geography of better countries. There is not much to suggest here. For fans of aerated ghost stories, there are many better choices and dead hard Bava fans are advised to (re) watch "Demons", "Macabre", or "Blade in the Dark".
