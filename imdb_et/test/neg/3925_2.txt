This film is poorly written, difficult to track and contains bad performances and dialogue with Jason Patric and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The prerequisite for a credible but weak (secret drug agent subordinate to the drug underworld) preciously better than this Lili Fini Zanuck flop. Competent support was not enough to record this movie (Sam Elliott, William Sadler, others). <br /> <br /> In addition, this film contains the absolute worst "love" scene of cinema. <br /> <br /> In addition, the soundtrack has been overestimated; just otherwise the legendary Eric Clapton's rebellious, delicate without the substance "Tears in Heaven". <br /> <br /> "Rush" is completely fun, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> 2 10
