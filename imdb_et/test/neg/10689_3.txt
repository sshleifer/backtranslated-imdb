Considering the budget and inexperience of all parties, Livin 'Life Life could have been worse. Jamal wants to be Chris Tucker (whom I've always found very annoying), as noted by the previous commentator, but Peanut (Edward D. Smith), while some of his (over) reactions go too long (director's problem), some are relatively fine and Funny moments, for example, when he tries to teach Jamal a joint smoking with his finger. Throughout the time, it is mostly more balanced and self-sufficient than Jamal, which could have been the germ of a nice study of contrasts, but it was not developed very far. <br /> <br /> writer / director / operator / etc is not an excuse for ignoring it. Has he ever seen a movie? Faces are important! Has he ever heard of a neighbor? Even Ed Wood could make a close-up. I don't think this is a budget issue. I could only give a general description of what any actor looks like, not just because they are not loved ones, but enlightened ...! Outdoor lights can cost too much, but you can make a reflector with pieces of paper! This would have required moving the camera to exclude the reflector from the image while helping to solve the close-up problem. If it is too technical, you can turn the actors around so they are not in the shade, or you can expose the shadows, and if it wasn't done in L.A, I'd say you use cloudy days. It goes without saying that the movies that it steals are all, except for the weekend in Bernie's, better than that, but Livin 'tha Life would have left a much better impression if he didn't just go through the cracked path to get a glimpse of any human elements. <br /> <br /> PS The hairdressing scene is just stupid.
