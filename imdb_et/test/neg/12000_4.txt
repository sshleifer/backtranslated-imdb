Wow what is this cheesy film! It looks like it is the backside, where the camera follows dogs passing through the forests. Then it gets a bit boring and follows the story that some girls move home to some ghost of Indian spirits. Then we get plenty of pictures of a partially clad girl and another naked girl in a bath. This suddenly becomes a joy when "Zombie Indians" emerge on earth and start terrorizing girls. We even get Indian. <br /> <br /> This movie starts out pretty boring, though I found the story of four Indians who were buried alive. When Indian zombies (or whatever you want to call them technically zombies), girls start terrorizing when all the fun begins. It's not a special wedge and it can't be taken seriously, it's just something fun to watch when you're bored or when you drink with friends. I can't think it would have worked better as a short-sighted one because the first half is boring.
