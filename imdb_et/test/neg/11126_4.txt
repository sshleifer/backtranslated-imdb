Cryptozoologist captures mystical chupacabra on the Caribbean island. To get civilization out of his bribe, he leaves the large luxury cruise ship's merchandise and I think the script was disastrous. <br /> <br /> Let's start with one thing I didn't really like about this movie .... The monster really just looked like a man of rubber. CGI scenes looked like a different film. OK, what is now on my chest for all the bits of this B movie. <br /> <br /> The best thing was John Rhys-Davies (his daughter near the eye.) John was funny and buggy alternately, and whatever the writers say, he said so well. The good job he had to work on. Cyptozoolog was up and fun to see, he had some jokes. cannon feed for the monster, as do some crew members and guests. In this movie, there are some pretty funny lines and a pretty amusing block that covers the thief. <br /> <br /> Special effects are usually low and I swear they used the same blood thirst on the wall scene in about four different movie sections. I did this as a footless man. This is because this movie wasn't scary at all, because I feel that it would have gone a little more to improve the film's ability to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you like B-monsters, it's worth it.
