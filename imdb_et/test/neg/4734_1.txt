This is the worst film I've ever seen, and it takes the price of a 2007 rebellion movie (made by me), but this film is a part of every good movie, I mean, the actors came with poor performance, the story is just nonsense. I'm really, really disappointed that they could have done better things than this junk. I just wasted my time and money with this movie. I want the production company to be able to return my money. Anyway, I would have great expectations of this film and I am disappointed. I don't recommend anyone watching it. so if u want to waste some money, do it in some other way than this piece of spam.
