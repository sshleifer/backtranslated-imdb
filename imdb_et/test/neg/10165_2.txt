Looking at this movie today, I got the feeling that this thing was about 10 to 15 minutes from the start. John Wayne rides out of this trading venue / salon somewhere in the middle to meet the owner for some robbery. Everything she sees is a massacre, some dead bodies, fight marks and someone alive. This is because the owner's daughter is hidden in the secret space you find in the old secrets of English murderers. The catholic families who were caught in the 16th century in England with an old faith built these things to conceal those who were royal to their faith. Nothing you see in the West, but a good trick. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, due to poor editing or writing or both, we never know exactly what led Wayne to this place. But it was B-West and not even good. <br /> <br /> Gabby Hayes is in it and she's clean shaved and plays a quiet part of the time. An unusual situation for garrulous Gabby. <br /> <br /> If you want to bother and find out what's going on and see whiskey without Gabby Hayes, watch this movie.
