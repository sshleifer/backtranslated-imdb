This movie does not deserve the time it takes for a VCR or DVD player! Michael Dudikoff and Lisa Howard are two beloved hunters, but they are contradictory. He is ambitious and organized, while being rejected and completely dispersed. <br /> <br /> In this movie, bad guys are kidnapped by Jersey Bellin (Dudikoff's character). It opens the door to bad godfather impressions, ridiculous fighting scenes and Tony Curtis, who plays the most feminine view I've ever seen! The end must be the most ... incredible scene I've seen in the film for a while. I believe that the Terminator, even on the Matrix, is more likely to be true than this end! This movie is just cheap. The script was supposed to hit someone as completely ridiculous. This manure was given a green light, allowing itself to be let go of the malicious public. I watched this movie with many other people who all agreed we were deceived. No one in the group can say anything good about the movie except that it was over.
