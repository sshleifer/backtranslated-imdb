First, "Mexican werewolf in Texas" is not a werewolf movie. This title is bullcrap. The story is actually about Chupacabra, which kills all local villagers in Furlough, a small town in Texas. I think the distributors renamed the original title so that it would change something more or something. And I think it really works because that's why I bought this chick, it sounded so stupid. Anyway, this movie is not good. In fact, it's bloody terrible. But when I bought it, I didn't expect anything else. This is a low budget horror movie with a Chupacabra monster. If you have a bad dialogue, bad dialogues, actors and some gore, you should check out this movie. But I have to warn you, this movie is really a baaaaaad. <br /> <br /> This movie has some of the worst things I've ever seen. Actors are trying hard and cumbersome. They don't say almost any line in the normal way. They always have this totally wrong tone just about anything they say. It's so stupid that it looks almost like a freaky parody. It's like they shot every scene only once and were happy about it. The worst of them all is the blonde girl who should play bimbo. He's the worst. I've never seen such an actress so halbana (and I've seen Pteradactyl). Even when his boyfriend dies, he can't be a bimbo. I hate him. <br /> <br /> Some of the shots in this movie were actually pretty good. The ones that were shot during the day are pretty decent for a low budget project. But most of the film is made at night when Chupacabra strikes and the lighting is too dark. Gore scenes are small and short, but really grizzly and violent. Effects are pretty fun, but I like it. Chupacabra looks pretty confused and it is easy to see that this is the guy who fits. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie should only be viewed by extreme fans at low budget rates and it is very important not to look at it alone because you probably die. I recommend watching this flick with your friends and beers.
