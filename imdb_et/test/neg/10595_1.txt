I watched this movie for the first time the other day and I missed the tears. I think I was just looking for some setback with a wonderful series. I watched Mod Squad's TV show religiously back in the day and it was fantastic. It was packed with action and the relationship that the three had with Greer was calm. There was no such thing here. When Greer was murdered, you get the idea that these 3 should have taken less care. The actor who depicted Pete is really a good actor but wrote his part as he mentally challenged. On television, Pete was quiet and serious but also funny. They had such a man as he was during drugs, drunk, or just unknown. I don't recommend this movie at all. Especially if you were a fan of the TV series. It's a complete push.
