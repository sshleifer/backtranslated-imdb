This movie just seemed to be missing. The plot development was so short in time that it seemed like losing any similarity to the real story. There was a lot of wasted dialogue and it just seemed that writing was hasty and a bit too misleading. Exorcism scenes and the story of possession began to take a back seat character (which was slightly weak at first). <br /> <br /> To sum up, leave it out if you have not rented out the rest of the horror of your local video store and you have a movie you haven't seen before. You're much better off when you look at Emily Rose's exorcist or exorcism.
