This movie was okay, but like most TV series, it would have been better if it was just television. The best and beloved characters had only five minutes while the three mediocre characters were all over the film. <br /> <br /> Unlike most television-based British films, this movie will be launched and seems to be the winner, but the pace will stop unexpectedly when three mediocre characters are in the real world, waiting for three comics to be captured. <br /> <br /> The movie will not go when Hillary is a room with Steve, Flag Masquerading Steve and Geoff somehow write himself in the Middle Ages. What made me think "hang up? How does it not need a key to enter this world, unlike the Royston Vasey characters? The medieval scene was okay, but Monty Python made it much better and of course fun, Peter Kay and Simon Pegg's lights, neither said anything funny, Kay was on the line and Pegg just sat on the wall to get bored. br /> <br /> I liked the fact that they seem to forget what happened in previous episodes like Hillary fled to the 2nd series on Caribbean, but he was filming escaped from prison and Lipp is a pedophile vampire not mentioned at all in the movie, which was also quite disturbing when he cared for the children alone. <br /> <br /> There were many plot holes and unexplained situations like Geoff and Dark One flees back in the Middle Ages to Royston Vasey? Like the 3rd series, it started good, but as the movie progressed, it went down slowly and was a very weak predictable end. <br /> <br /> They would have done better Monty Python did, and recycled all his best and classic sketches from the 1-3 series and the specialty of Christmas, and it was turned into a movie that brought characters back to a completely new audience that can't be asked to watch the series or to buy DVDs for the best. save and wait until it is on TV ..... where it belongs.
