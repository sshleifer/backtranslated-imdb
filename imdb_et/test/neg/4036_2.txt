I had a terrible misfortune to watch this b-movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is --- save your time and money! It must be the worst b-movie of all time, it should not even be called a b-movie, more than a f-movie! Because it does not work in all aspects that make a good movie: the story is not at all interesting, all the actors are thin with paper and not at all believable, have a bad direction and the sequences of action are so fake that it is almost funny. ..... almost. <br /> <br /> The film is packed with a single liner, which no respectable person can find the least fun. <br /> <br /> This movie should be targeted at men, but all the women in it are so unrealistic, especially the old wrinkle that ends. They try to appear in sexy in these strange, terrible costumes and they can't fail unhappy !!! <br /> <br /> Even some of the most ridiculous b-movies still give you a laugh, but it's just too painful to watch !!
