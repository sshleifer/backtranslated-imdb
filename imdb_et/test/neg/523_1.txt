This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen (nothing included by Pauly Shore). I couldn't believe the movie could actually be that bad! <br /> <br /> Coolio must be one of the worst actor (again, except Pauly Shore) to ever "celebrate" the movie. The temptation to hit the STOP button during this movie was great (in fact, if my VCR had a PRINT button, I would be ready to press it). <br /> <br /> Take advantage and do something interesting to watch this movie, for example, watching grass grow or watching golf on TV.
