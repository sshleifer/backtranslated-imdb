I couldn't believe absolutely that this production was unimportant. I honestly thought that gay men had a better taste. I know I'll do it. <br /> <br /> Most of the accusations are not cast, but we take them first off the road ... the only one with real talent was Joe Souza (plus he was the best cast bod). She had a beautiful, clear theater-style voice. Okay, and Jaymes Hodges's voice was that way, but he had a free word in every issue. The rest could not keep a note in the bucket, although the music was obviously imitated after that. Must be really terrible for their living. They were all girls except maybe three. If I want to see naked WOMEN, I can go to the titty bar. Not sure why someone would decide to film L.A. production in place of New York. I imagine that NY is more readily available for singing talents, though one might think of L.A. They could find better LOOKING boys. Probably not. <br /> <br /> But I chop ... the real fault here lies with the creators and the manufacturers. This score was the most banal, worse than ever heard. It sounded like some theater halls took all their musical documents, threw them into a blender and poured it onto the page. Unfortunately, I am sure there are many who cannot say good theaters and how to write them. I mean seriously, I laughed at my ass all over the place, but not a flat joke. I think the sick "my-lover-dead-AIDS song" titled "Kris, See What You're Missing" was the most hysterical thing in the whole performance. Genius writes ... Kris / Missed ... wow ... they ALMOST most rhyme ... must be good lyricists. And Jesus ... at the end of this song ... "Oh Kris, Ohhh Kris, OHHHH Kris ..." Over and over! My second favorite was "You Have to be a Pumpy Junkie Boy to be Humpy Hunkie Boy" ... WTF ??? The whole exhibition was full of the most arbitrary lyrics of JUST BECAUSE they rimed. Where did these people learn to write songs? Obviously they listened to Sondheim and said, "He's not that big, I can do it" ... as evidenced by a reference from "Bobby, Bobby, Bobby" from one song. Second irk: why are 20 times the songs of Robert Mitchum and Tab Hunter? Apparently lyrics and not actors will come up ... again, bad writing. <br /> <br /> If you love torture and pain, and I know many of you are strange fetishists, go ahead and watch it. But you are warned.
