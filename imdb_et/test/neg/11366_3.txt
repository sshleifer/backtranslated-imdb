There is not much to say about how much wire and supposed Sholin monks are ego-trippy about drawing Kung-fu and cartoon Japan to take over China. All of this wouldn't be as bad as it was, not completely counterfeit in the Japanese sword fight. If you watched a samurai movie or two, you can say that in the movie "Japanese" the fight is just the same "Kung-fu" (really circus acrobats) doing the same things as the Japanese sword. However, there are a few fun moments, such as when Japanese woman Ninja blows her clothes on the middle of the flight to arrange a mung and catch her with a fishing net. Of course, schizophrenia seems to be a bit about whether Japanese should be shown as completely despicable or there may be exceptions. The "main character" of Japan has been shown to be largely honorable, but not beyond unjustified cruelty, for example, when he murders a reassured monk to have his own duel. Quite silly ending. For a moment, even the similarity of the idea of ​​an epic battle does not arise.
