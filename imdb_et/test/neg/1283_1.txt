This film should go to a journal that is one of the worst times. I can no longer say that this is still the worst film, but because I've seen every movie ever made. So far, I can't make such noble claims. The story is hidden, the actor is terrible, at best the "special" effect is no more than a few pounds. dry ice and fan. Someone has to be connected to someone to get this movie. Mr. Busey posted this one! The dog is well trained and cute, making it the only redeeming quality in this non-should-be-made movie. Two hours and 3 dollars in my life will never come back.
