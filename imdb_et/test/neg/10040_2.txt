The filmmaker remained with the most accurate overview of the story published in 1894, which includes a manuscript of 1846 by Richard Williams Bell (John and Lucy Bell and Betsy Bell's younger brother) entitled "The Problem of Our Family". This is the only visitor account ever to be known. The filmmaker should be given accuracy, but there is little to say about the quality of production and operation. The action was very poor in theater and sound and picture quality. It seems that the filmmaker simply photographed the scenes of the reported events that took place without drawing a plot or story flowing through them. If you need to get to know the story, read it, it's more engaging and convincing.
