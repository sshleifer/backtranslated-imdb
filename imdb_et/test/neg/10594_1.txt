The film was slow, the dialogue between actors / actors knew the "apartment" and basically the characters were not developed. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps scoops around with mad eyes all the time Pouting and basically watching the annoying all. Denmark does not have the magic of the screen, and the character of Ribis is that no one would want to step out even when they were paid. <br /> <br /> Throw a strange scene where Epps needs to dance to an old man, and you have what perhaps the worst movie in Cinema history may be. <br /> <br /> I watched it on the satellite (thanks for the goodness I didn't pay for it) and wanted me to be <br /> <br /> Take your preference and move your underwear and socks into the drawer if you need but you are tempted to watch this movie when it is on your TV. When you ask me a terrible movie and I have something good to say about every movie.
