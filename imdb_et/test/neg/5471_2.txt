How can I go wrong with the film that interferes with Peter Cushing's complexity, Donald Pleasence and Luan Peters busts? Simple, you give them a scary script to work with. <br /> <br /> Peter Cushing is leading the satanic culture that has hit a few friends from Donald Pleasence. Donald plays a decisive but remote priest who wants to find his friends, but needs help from Scooby-Doo to find Fred. He calls a New York City bloodthirsty wife who dresses like a hero hero. Meanwhile, one lost person's girlfriend, Luan Peters, joins the search. If all this sounds interesting, you, like me, misled. <br /> <br /> It doesn't take long for the trio to grab the malicious ones, but their methods of bringing bad boys to justice are stupid. Women also find this fucking. Each time they reach the bad guys, our two male heroes say to Luan that they stay at the hotel, even though he can better satisfy himself than a nice priest playing Pleasence. <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (The script really lets us suppress. No ping has been built. No attention is given to a useful dialogue and you need both hands to calculate how many times Luan Peters is told they fall behind and Let the men work for the men. The sight of the minotaur on the film didn't bother. We get the shape of the minotaur that ignites the flame). <br /> <br /> ANSWER: $$ (There are some attacks and some sacrifices, but those who do away for gore are hopeless). <br /> <br /> ACTION: $$ (Although there are three of my favorite characters in this movie, there is nothing redeemable here. Peter Cushing doesn't have much of a screen, Donald RÃµmus is clearly aware that he is a stinker and is bad at using Luan Peter used it because it should have been much better than the talent involved, but then again Ya nkees lose the game here and there too). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $ (Luan Peters takes a bath, but you see something beside him. He's not obligated here when he was in a muscle and blood show.
