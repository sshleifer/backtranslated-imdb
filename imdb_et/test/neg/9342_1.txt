I don't comment much on what ??? Stereotype characters, absolute ignorance of Colombian reality, terrible self, bad color selection, NOT funny (this should be comedy and they expect you to laugh because some of the popular music is crap next to events), when you see somebody else, I mean the translator, then you know they are at least good, but watching it, call the movie, it's impossible to guess it), you're tired of the music ... it's the "comedy" it doesn't have the rhythm, the only good rhythm in it, it's rap songs in the final credits .. .. pathetic, isn't it? etc ... etc. etc. It has been a long time since I haven't seen such a bad movie!
