The film has so many potentials that were not developed. Mark Hamill gives good results, and so does Bill Paxton. The landscape is beautiful and the ultra-fast plane is clean. The problem with this movie is that the story is so underdeveloped and the plot doesn't go anywhere. Some points in the movie will draw you almost to sleep. I'll give him 3 out of 10 stars.
