Come on? FANTASTIC DRAMA ON SCREEN? Are you kidding people? I wouldn't play horrible Molly Gross even in school games! Where do these people work? Do you borrow some papers from your neighbors? Terrible plot, terrible action. Heh ... why are you taking us for the snakes? What can I say more? I understand that this is a television production and the actor does not have to be from Citizen Kane. However, they should try harder to make money. And besides, what can be said in 10-LESSES for such a simple film? Do you want morning paper? What to say? Worse movie in the decade? OK, you want it - you have it!
