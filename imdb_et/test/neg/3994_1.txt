Let me get this straight ... "The Church" has a secure "locking mechanism" that keeps the spirits from leaving, but the ultimate solution is to bring it to the ground?! LOFL! Maybe I won't lose the plot. Maybe it's a man from Ed Wood's film school or something. This film is as useless as the church itself. Hey ... maybe that's the thing. This whole Rosemary baby-esq segment was fun. I can go to my corner of the Halloween costume store and get a better drag. The whole movie needs to be rebuilt. Right. There were so many things that were played ... so many things that could have jumped from my seat and through the ceiling. I'm not sure if the guilt is writing or editing, but what I saw shouldn't have that high rating.
