Stop-Loss is an agit-prop-garbage that occurred, heavily handed, speech-filled, preached, nose, and stylized in such a way that only MTV would be guilty. I was hoping for much more talented young actors, such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Philippe, but the scriptwriter / director Kimberly Peirce is doing a hatchet that depicts war injuries for American youth. I'm sure he did some work on exploring the war in Iraq and the young men who are fighting for it, but you never think of Stop-Loss. In many ways, this confusion resembled Catherine Hardwicke's Dogtown master, an equally inaccurate, too stylized TV-like solid. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
