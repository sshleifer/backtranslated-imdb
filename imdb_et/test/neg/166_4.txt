Strange, deliberately biased Dyan Thomas bioopia, where we hear a little more than a dozen lines of his poetry. Instead, we have to endure the exposure of the raw character seen by his proto-bigam attitude towards the wife (Sienna Miller) and childhood love (Keira Knightley). Matthew Rhys plays with Thomas, who has the magic of inoculating us against his opponent's resistance and Cillian Murphy is permanently in love. <br /> <br /> The film never looks decisive where it goes. There is no such a distant viaduct from one end of the war to another. Maybury seems more interested in his two female guides (who wouldn't be?) Than the man who brings them together and shares. Miller is the choice of these two (I found Knightley to be the best, but then I never found his sympathy), but both offer terribly controversial Welsh accents. Other funny decisions include too much of the insignificant character of William (Murphy), artistic production (such as double crystals), neither impressionist nor symbolic, nor a period of old chestnut action that doesn't mix. 4/10
