His astonishingly horrible but strange hypnotic style led by Albert Pyun, "crazy six" is another precious jewel in this decade's expensive hugo haas (jess franco). "Stylish" redirecting, inconsistent drawing, occasionally in the midst of eurodisco torch-warm presentations, all of these seem to mark our man's Pyun features. The most interesting is how he always gets a top-of-the-range b-movie compared to Wynorsk or another video driver. Ice-T, Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles and the very strange Burt Reynolds are not bad cast, although they often look a little confused. See "Postmortem", "Mean Guns" and "Omega Doom" to Get More Excellence in Pyun Chaos!
