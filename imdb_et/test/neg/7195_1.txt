It appeared to a friend of mine who bought the DVD for me. They had this "Savage Guns", which was a completely different film. Obviously, people who have packaged a DVD have never bothered to see what they burned on the disk. The soundtrack is a combination of TV Batman / Early James Bond / Spaghetti Western. A lot of galloping around this music. The boy seems to have some time to burn between the scenes and give the track to do something for people. I wish it would have been a little worse and then it would have been a widespread feeling of Ed Wood's films. It's just terrible.
