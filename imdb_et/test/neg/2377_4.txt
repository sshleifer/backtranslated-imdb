This film is a perfect example of a film that cannot be successful only with a big budget. It is obvious that there was a lot of time and effort devoted to it: the animation is liquid, detailed and magnificent - the sound track is not too memorable, except for Celine Dion's final song (at least I think it was her). The musical result is a powerful orchestral material. Tissue for animators and music composers! 9/10 However, the story and characters gradually fall. It seems very "been made, done", predictable and uninteresting. Characters have different personalities but do not like anything. They irritated me infinitely. I tried to do it very hard, but the story didn't matter - it was a cliché-action-adventure area. There were jokes that weren't funny. It was vomiting that was predictable from start to finish. The dialogue was a cliché and terrible - especially the last line "It's not ... which gives you wings, it's love!" Whatever it is, I remember cringing. I wanted it to stop fast and fast. I was not the only one I thought it was boring. Watch Asterix and Obelix Cleopatra movies when you watch it. It was a waste of time.
