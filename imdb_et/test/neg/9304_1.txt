This is the worst film of all time, no doubt, and there was actually more laugh in Schindler's list. Not only will this tell you how this movie is unusual and how big SL is, considering it is heartbreaking and contains 1 laugh. I wish I could meet "Yahoo Serious" so I can cheat him and all the other very bad movies he's ever had. There are also very few things about Australia that they want a stupid tree. Don't get me wrong (Mel Gibson) from Australia are great, they brought us Mad Max. It makes me very sorry that such garbage people, (I just read the review, said it was "very funny," ill, not). I personally boycott this movie and start a petition on the internet to ban and burn all Yahoo Serious movies, so I've stressed it, so RETARDED. <br /> <br /> Do not hesitate to be shared by anyone who has seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Note: If you are forced to watch this movie in orange style, invite me to a free euthanasia.
