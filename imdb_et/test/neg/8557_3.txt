Madness's edge is the story of the 1800's, determined by dirty Scotsman, who can't keep his penis in his pants. It just happens that there is a younger brother who is against rape and kills him, but constantly says it was an accident. It makes her wife crazy, she's misleading and she's falling because she loves George too much. <br /> <br /> As I said, this type of thing has already been done. It's just "more artistic" because it's Canadian and it's an indie production that has been done with little budget barely known actors (except for one child from Lassie, yes, she's in it). I don't know if it was an Oscar feed, but it was sure when hell was bored. And it is based on a 40-page story. Half of these short stories have been added to this flick and I'm glad. Otherwise I was killed. Unfortunately, I had to look at it in the basics of my media and I had the task. Read the story and compare and contrast the story. RECOMMENDATION. <br /> <br /> It is harder to answer a movie if you don't like the movie. Well, I hope it's the last type of task and my class. What's worth, Annie Herron was completely hot, she had a nice, soft ass and I liked her naked parts in the movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 Boring, Oscar Feeding and Graphic Sexuality ..I changed nudity.
