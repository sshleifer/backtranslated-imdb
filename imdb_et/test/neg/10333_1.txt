This film dates back to the 80s, but it seems to have been made from the Stone Age. The effects are too cheesy. I have a copy of Sandra Bullock on my copy, so I bought the movie. He was in the movie for about 5 minutes. He probably denies any involvement. <br /> <br /> In short, this part of the movie is not to be seen except to laugh at how bad it sucks. Rent it to see the worst movie ever made.
