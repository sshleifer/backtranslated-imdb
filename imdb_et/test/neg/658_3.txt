Compared to the recent gore flick HOSTEL that this film reminded me - I would say that seeing is not bad is a little better, but not much. A very complex plot includes a handful of criminals sent to clean up a sheltered hotel for a shorter prison sentence. The children will soon be killed by a woody religious psychopath who cleans them from their sins (I think). One of the things I was most afraid of was looking at WWE wrestler Kane. He finished a decent job, considering that there were only two words in the movie. There are a couple of pretty gory moments, mostly related to eye-gouging and quite memorable scene where a girl gets a cell phone pushed down her throat - probably the most effective death film. <br /> <br /> Don't say this movie shows us something new and definitely far away. Can't recommend it.
