Actually, I liked it a lot. It had some interesting turns. But it just stayed there, having seen this feeling after all the SAW movies. Allow the end to end in a typical hundred, but let's be honest ... a group of guys who don't know each other (or they believe) that are being thrown out of an abandoned chemical industry .... <br /> <br /> But then it loses something . There is no intensity, there's bad group dynamics, no urgency. <br /> <br /> Some nice twists at the end and definitely worth seeing if there's nothing else on your album, but it just left me empty. ..have passed but it didn't respond.
