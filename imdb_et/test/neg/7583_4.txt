Roger Spottiswoode is not the worst director, and he did a good job on the undervalued sci-fi thriller "The Sixth Day" (Mr. Schwarzenegger's Office Fall). However, "Air America" ​​must be one of his most intuitive projects. <br /> <br /> It's a concentration between drama, comedy and war films - it's not a very convincing blend. In fact, I found it to be overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Robert Downey, Jr. (during his flowering), as a pilot, who was recruited with the ultimate secret CIA organization operating in Laos during the Vietnamese era. Mel Gibson plays his co-ticket and stumbles with the knowledge that they are trading drugs and not. The film was released from release because he celebrated two famous faces and Aerosmith had re-recorded the Doors classic "Love Me Two Times" for the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The song's redo is quite bad for a movie.
