In an effort to put together a scary space comedy for the genre, this film falls into two. It really takes place in space, but it's not funny or scary. The plot is depressing and one joke about computer intelligence is dead. Saying that Paul Whitthorne as Ethan, Angela Bassett as Fran and Brad Dourif, as Al Bert, do their best for the donor. The Homan-esque relationship between Ethan and Al Bert suggests, but it has never been studied, while the sexual effort test franc and rick are both raw and ridiculous. All in all, it is a turkey that is best suited for late night TV, preferably during ironing.
