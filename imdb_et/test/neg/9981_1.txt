Who really wants to see it? Nasty violence, sex, so long. I don't want to, but I always stayed with my philosophy to watch any movie as badly as possible. It was the hardest (immediately after "next Friday"). <br /> <br /> It's basically just a mess. How can this be called something else? Rome's Emperor's Story for Gore and R&D excuse. Yes, yes, "Hey, it's realistic, they've been like that." Well, but why do we trouble it? I don't care if it has been (and there are many scenes where I really doubt it). The point is why should anyone see it? The problem is that only one reason you might like the movie and that is what you like about violence. There's nothing special about it, just cruelty. You can say "Cool!" like you would say in a splatter-slasher movie. But violent horror movies can give you chills and excitement, maybe the signs you care about. But here's all dark, boring and boring. Every character is crazy. "The story of an emperor who can't handle his power". What? In the first scene where she runs nude with her sister! I have no problem saying we saw 2 1/2 hours crazy. <br /> <br /> But maybe you're turned on, seeing Helen Mirren, being pregnant and dancing. Or 5 minutes of heavy scenes that some people see as a movie message. Or castration, yes right, it was fun! True birth scenes as fun! People, animals, care, just treat them as toys. <br /> <br /> I don't care what anyone says, it's not a movie, it's just 2 1/2 hours of blood and sex, humiliating and nasty. Watch porn movies if you want to have sex or watch horror if you want violence. At least these films are not an artistic masterpiece. And they are shorter. <br /> <br /> [0/10] [6 (1+ - 6-)] [0/4]
