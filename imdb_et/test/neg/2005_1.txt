It was by far the worst film I've ever seen! I and my husband have over 600 DVDs, most of which are Sci-Fi and Horror B-Movies, which are not top quality but still fun. Dracula 300 had no redemption features at all! Writing was terrible and the action was even worse. We spent 3 times trying to get through the whole movie because we can tolerate it at a 30-minute interval. We thought it had to be better ... we were wrong. I'd rather look at the body being enamelled than to sit back again! When he finished me and my husband just looked at each other as "is it?" The end seemed to be more, but they ran over their obvious $ 500.00 budget and were like "Oh, crap ... we're broken ... now ... fast ... check the credit!"
