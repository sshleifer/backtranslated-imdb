I hired a DVD yesterday, and it first started badly, it's a 4: 3 aspect ratio film, and it just gets worse, the actor is so bad and the movie itself is a way to be predictable, I was like watching a movie and told me: this happens and I think what happened? right ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see good action, don't look at what this little budget movie like I was disappointed. go and see Ali your way better!
