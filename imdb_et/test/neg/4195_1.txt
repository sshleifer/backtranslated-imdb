In addition to commenting on the technical characteristics or lack of production, action is absolutely terrible. What's really frightening about this movie is that I'm actually a copy of it, of course, it was in a good trash bin and was renamed "Dark Harvest 2" and after I saw it, I understand why it was a bargain - they should have paid me for taking out his inventory. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie, if you want to name it, is spent by a frantic father who runs around the corn in a maze looking for his daughters because he has a complaint that something happens to them. I suspect that the camera that the girls played at the beginning of the movie was probably one of those fiasco production cameras. In the maze, he runs into a ghost of a child that has been badly done, and the film goes terribly south. <br /> <br /> I see why they renamed this movie, otherwise they would never have been released. Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever had to sit on, and it wasn't worth $ 2 that I spent on it.
