There I sit at home in the morning, suddenly slipping my brother, which seems to be a fool looking for a movie I've ever seen. Given that it was in the 70's and the special effects were not for sharpe, this film almost equals the definition of nonsense. The foolish monsters, the stupid story and the foolish settings made it the worst movie I've ever seen. So bad that I didn't even finish it, I made it to a certain point, then went to see how long I could go without rope around my neck and I hung up. (im just haha) AWFUL MOVIE
