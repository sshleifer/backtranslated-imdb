I've been trying to watch this movie 3 or 4 times, but I just can't miss the fact that it's all terrible. I'm sure no one had dared to take Jack Palance as a protagonist, but by my nature, there is no fiber that believes he could act at all, much less to do it. <br /> <br Yes, I understand that Clifford Odets was a great author, but it's not obvious here. This strange and forced mish-mash of the 50's hipster dialog seems to be confusing with any real meaning that explains why no actor, even good (Steiger, East Lupino, Shelly Winters, Everett Sloane) knows how to offer their rows - it's like they don't understand what they say. And in the meantime, the Wendell Corey and Palance stage is a terrible competition to see who can be more stony. <br /> <br /> The direction is amateurish and completely burnt. Physical interaction between characters is the same in terms of dialogue. <br /> <br /> And can we discuss this fear? It is so busy, ugly and understandable, that it adds robotic, disconnected quality of signs, dialogue, and images. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to suck energy out of me. Everybody seems to have taken the Overdose every morning when they arrived at the device. Seeing Rod Steiger and Shelly Winters is bad, but it succeeds. <br /> <br /> I can see that it could have been more effective than Broadway, where intellectuals and combaters could have congratulated themselves on appreciating the power of the plot and pseudo-hip dialogue for artistic prosperity.
