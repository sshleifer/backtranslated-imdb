The story is over - all the killings were the main character of the joke and no one is really dead. Yes, I know Cry Wolf did it and did it well, but it's not "Cry Wolf", it's "Scream Crap"! Although "characters" don't die, we can see that they are killed (and killed in some other way), even though they are "killed" because everyone can see them. The President, if you show people killing, somebody has to see it when they're out of the camera and the killed person is killed alone, it doesn't work - and finally I liked a few scenes but your ending destroyed the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The actor is scary (especially at the beginning of a child who really thinks he beat his friends to believe that they are playing with their dead grandmothers brain) as half-baked (though if you are half baked, you might want a movie for you like), the only reason I gave this film a 3, is that a) they did something b) they got it out and c) they filmed the movie yes they read right, they wasted (at least) 5,000 dollars for the movie. Unfortunately, if they had taken pictures with DV, they would have had better money and another writer to pass the script and that would be good. <br /> <br /> I admire that the director did something (as most do not do), but HATWE that he is coming to the IMDFB, talking about how the film was originally. <br /> <br /> Avoid the movie if it means buying it to see if a friend is, can be a funny movie to borrow.
