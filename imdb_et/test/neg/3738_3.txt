Celebrity singers have always been a tough time breaking movies (cinema is full of failed attempts) and can go ahead and speculate why John Mellencamp has never made himself an actor. Instead of taking small portions into hearty projects, Mellencamp is right in diving when he plays the lead "Falling From Grace", which he also directed, and the results are as inconvenient and unsustainable as this title. The story of a famous singer who returns to his sticks in his hometown by opening old family weddings is Larry McMurtry's scenario, but the inclined film goes somewhere slowly. Supporting cast is decent, including Kay Lenz (who is always nice to see), Mariel Hemingway and Claude Akins (who share a really strong scene in the picture). As far as John's behavior is concerned, he doesn't seem particularly comfortable, despite the obvious efforts to look at him at home; it seems that it usually drives the camera, and it doesn't connect directly to the audience. * 1/2 from ****
