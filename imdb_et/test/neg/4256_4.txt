The year of production says it all. This film is a politically correct left-wing feminist self-esteem, such a magnificent symbolic variety that is ridiculous today, a messy mess. The goal of each scene is to enlighten one of the most pressing issues in society, mainly the role of women in the workplace, the role of women in men, women as sexual objects, consumption, politics, war, and so on. commented on one of the main actor's internal dialogue or on making the scene a surreal joke. I don't remember any plot or the characters. It is a kind of movie where consumption is mocked when a couple has love in the window of selling a furniture store, while a sales representative transmits a speech or when an interview revealing an actor turns into a full-fledged striptease because of course, "the offensive gentlemen of the press are equal to the dirty club audience. when we have to see the outbreak of war in a peaceful forest, we need to see a number of inflammatory feminist public speeches that are drowned in car horns or riots, and of course we have to see the cinema. Stalin's newspapers and all the other suspects. You get the idea. The film is incredibly any (man) Ingmar Bergman enthusiast, boasting Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom at their height of beauty, and also the pleasure of watching them so generously as you used to know in a movie I've never heard before It's hard to believe how Bi bi Andersson's face has a screen every time he appears. Cinematography is a gorgeous orchestrated bw, often comes up with an over-exposure (?) Dimensional whitish, and you just aren't tired of watching the performers. It is absurd that a film that has attracted so much attention from the feminist agenda that tirelessly promotes that women should not be seen merely as a wish has nothing better to offer the 21st century spectator an amazingly beautiful parade of babes. As mentioned, I am not complaining. I can rewrite it tomorrow.
