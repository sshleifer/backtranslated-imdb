It's a bad show of 80's film making if you're not a pre-pubescent girl. Riding a big name like Madonna, a story that physically attacks your intelligence and humor that is most suitable for kindergarten. If there were any doubts, I think this film's numbness clearly shows Madonna's lack of ability to act and made me feel very embarrassed. The only thing I can't believe is that they will never let the director back to another movie again. Madonna spends most of the movie, like a granddaughter's doll and talks like a child. It is painfully clear that the only reason this film was ever made was because Madonna was a big name in pop music. DO NOT REMOVE POP STARDOM FINANCING. Stay away from it at all costs!
