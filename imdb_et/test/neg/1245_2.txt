What could have been a great movie about the late poker profile (pre-poker craze) Stu "The Kid" Unger became disappointing. <br /> <br /> You can say that filmmakers worked on a short-string budget. Everything looks cheap. Magazines seemed to me a bit. <br /> <br /> The election of Michael Imperoli from Soprano was also a bad election choice. She seemed too old to play with the children facing Stu, she saw too much coke addicted (when you look at the material from the 1997 WSOP Main Event, the actual Stu was so thin and she didn't have too much cocaine nose) so she wore these sunglasses to hide), and I was waiting for Adriana to jump and shout "Chris-tu-phur !!!" <br /> <br /> They also missed her son Angie's earlier relationship, which committed suicide in the late 80s. <br /> <br /> Every time I saw Vincent Van Patten, I had to think he was going to announce: "Show stories out of Stu's head." as he does in WPT. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for real Stuey material, check ESPN Classic because they run the 1997 WSOP Main Event so often. Or try on YouTube. Avoid this movement like bad beating.
