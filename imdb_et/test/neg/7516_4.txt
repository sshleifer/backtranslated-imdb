Do you know they really want to crowd the moon? And in Geneva is the project under discussion that can lead to the creation of a possible time machine? All I can say about this film, based on facts about the future of the film) is scientific projects, but real. I hope the moon does not exist as in the movie. Now, as for the film itself, I also saw the original film and read the book. The book I didn't like but the movie yes. I totally agree with the previous comment that this film was frustrating, unlike the 60's. It was very good with force, it was just a parallel future of what is a good movie.
