"The girl's artist is introduced to the magic and astral projection of a bored television leader. To learn to separate her mind from her body, the man is again interested in a sense of life and well-being. Unfortunately, the man he sleeps, his spirit leaves his body and his uncontrollable body rides the streets in a murderous rampage on the streets, "according to the summary of the DVD sleeve. <br /> <br /> The summary is not entirely correct, as it turns out. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film opens with the embarrassing "extraterrestrial" example of a beautiful director Winston Recert (like Paul Sharpe) from the newly discovered "astral body" experience; it also requires an upcoming fight. Young Andrew Bednarski (like Matthew Sharpe), who is a child, pulls pictures of "Blue Man" when his murder game begins. Handsome Detective John Novak (Stewart Kaufman) discovers that victims are involved with Mr. Rekert. Mr. Novaki's investigation leads to a supernatural; an example of this is Karen Black (Janus) with whom Rekert fears she falls in love. <br /> <br /> Many cast persons are doing well; but the "blue man" crushes the knot to bind. Aka "Eternal evil", this unhappy story tries to be too good for its own.
