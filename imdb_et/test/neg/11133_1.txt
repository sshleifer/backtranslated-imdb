This is one of the WORST movies I've seen! Film packaging is better than film itself. My girlfriend and I looked at it last weekend, and we kept watching it only in the hope that it would improve ... it wasn't ... <br /> <br /> Image quality is bad; it looks like it was shot on video and filmed on film. Lighting is not great, making it more difficult for actors to read facial expressions. The actor himself was cheesy, but I think it is acceptable to the "other" teenage horror flick. Sound was a big problem: sometimes the video has to be rewound because the sound is unclear and / or muted. <br /> <br /> It has no real value; trying to drive "Sleepy Hollow" on coats. Don't bother about that.
