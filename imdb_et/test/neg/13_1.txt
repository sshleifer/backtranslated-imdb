Obvious vanity journalism for Julie in her first Blake movie. Let's see. Where we start. He is a traitor during World War II; he will redeem it with love; his friends (who are probably patriots because they are German citizens) are spending and must die; and he runs like a heroine. OKAY. Even the scenes of running pilots and buffaloes working for French intelligence cannot even be described, and we do not even mention Rock's romantic scenes from a female. (By the way, when they visit the museum, look at his gaze - I repeat it on the video and it is priceless). Is it a farce or is it a romantic classic or is it a war movie? I don't know and you don't.
