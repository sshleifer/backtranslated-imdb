This third part of the series of peacocks is the best. I know, I know ... but how good is that? Don't be silly. It's still pretty bad, but it's a good movie compared to the first two. Again, it was shot digitally, with proper lighting and good camera work. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> When a college baseball team threatens new members, one remains in a diabetic coma. Of course, they abandon him with a scarecrow related to peacemaking. According to the legend, the boy's soul is taken to a scarred body that lives and destroys terrible revenge. Co-workers drive to the beach, which is somehow very close to the corn field. On a sunny beach, they kill one by one with fake peacocks. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Brian Katkin is working hard to bring some drama to the movie. Unfortunately, the drama jumps over good and lands on ordinary cheese. Much of the action was fair, but there were some very terrible bits, including a terrible piece of poorly made lip sync. Some plot points were mostly unresolved and most of them were used to get someone alone to kill. Again, better than previous contributions, but still missing.
