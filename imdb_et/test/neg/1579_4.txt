I'm a big fan of the ABC Movies of The Week week. I'm only 27 years old, which means I wasn't even born before the series ended, but I am trying to collect as much from the DVD as possible. I have about a dozen. I had read such wonderful things about this film here and elsewhere that I was really happy to see it. I just got a post on my DVD today and watched it hard. I testify that the first one or two phone calls made me slip - this boy's voice would give someone a trace! But it began to eat fast and the whole divorce sub-block was stupid. I also thought Michael Douglas was an antagonist about half an hour before the end of the movie. As soon as this story was talked about how Elizabeth Ashley's character had locked her mother, I knew something was fishing. And did anyone think of why he suddenly appeared in the night when the fire was in the shed? I admit that I thought he was instructing the boy at school to make a call. I didn't think the noise boy or the previously recorded tapes (did they ever say whose voice it really was? I doubt Douglas could ever get his voice so high?). <br /> <br /> I am just giving this movie four out of ten because I really liked most of it. Especially Ashley is great. <br /> <br /> This is a disgrace, because this film has such a great prerequisite, but well what happens sometimes when it expects the movie too much.
