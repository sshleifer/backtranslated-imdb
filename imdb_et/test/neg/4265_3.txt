There is nothing wrong with showing how the old man falls in love with a young girl. Lolita did it. American Beauty did it. <br /> <br /> But. They did it fine. They didn't make it so obvious from the beginning that the director would love them with each other. Not as naturally as two people (no age), but forcing them to be around as if they were ready to fall in love. <br /> <br /> All in all, there should have been chemistry. This would have solved the biggest problem. People who have reservations about this issue would also have come and perhaps be convinced. This would have perfected the story of love, irrespective of impracticality. <br /> <br /> It was hard for me to believe Jia's character at times. I found it harder to understand why a photographer and an artist who seems serious is interested in such a frivolous girl. If he does not have any fear, which did not come out at all. <br /> <br /> There are many corners or corners of the Netherlands where the frame is tilted. It is usually used for something unnatural or something that can lead to something that is not right. So RGV calls the relationship itself unnatural. <br /> <br /> Camera angles, background points, editing, and even the matching of frames and symbols reveal their relationship. Is the Indian audience so stupid that we need to understand something in 10 different ways? Especially when two of them danced together ... it was obvious what happened. What was the need to slow down the scene with dramatic background music? I feel the topic was very well chosen. But Verma should not have kept in mind that this is a controversial topic. If that is the case, it will gently handle, why not?
