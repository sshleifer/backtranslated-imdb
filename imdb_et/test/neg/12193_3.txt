What could have been a great hostage movie was completely destroyed by what seems like a boring director ... there were so many directions the film could have taken ... a vampire bridge wasn't one of them !!! Last 45 minutes. the result is that the film is a completely ridiculous waste of time. ... and sex machine? ... You are kidding! Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel's similar talents (not to mention George Cloone) are completely wasted in this pointless film. Director ... Robert Rodriguez, known for his other gory flicks, including el mariachi, desperado, once in Mexico, and a very recent blue city ... really keeps your attention well done in the first half ... which makes you believe you are entertaining over time ... but then for some reason, and without provocation, madness ... there are even weak attempts at parody and comedy. .. truly irritating!
