The fans of Arnold rejoice with joy, the fans of brainstorming are amazed and the Catholics just cuddle. <br /> <br /> Illustratively, Andrew W. Marlowe wrote and directs Peter Hyams, * End of Days * gets The Open Terminator out of his open back (Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to the big screen after heartbeat) while blowing things up in mysterious ways and celebrating the Bible to give the Catholics more. <br /> This is a 1999 and doom-sayers living around the world live in the fright of their computers and lose their downloaded porn. Even though the Y2K mutton is on the streets of New York, the ex-policeman changed the alcohol security guard, Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger with the endless "dead-wife and child" hope for a relaxed cannon effect), encouraging theological waters to save 20-year-old Virgin Christine (Robin Tunney )? wait for it ?? Satan's bride. Dun dah daaaarrrh! It seems stupid. <br /> <br /> Every hero has his anti-Christ. Gabriel Byrne is here to fuck? and he has gone as 1999, on Christine's impregnation with Anti-Christ at 23:00 - 12:00, December 31, 1999? ironically, in the hour that all the porn is gone? it leads to the end of the day. Being able to read thoughts, create hallucinations, and use unlimited magic, Satan will not accelerate the process of impregnation in months and meet Christine as a teenage model, and then close the tights at the time set by the RAID; Instead, he will appear on December 28th as a Keyser Soze Terminator and wonder why he doesn't recognize him with an open thigh? (See comment above: stupidity.) Here is a film where nothing is understood when it is said, let alone whether it is considering its truthfulness or mythology. The priest (Rod Steiger) tells Jericho that "666" is really "999" upside down, ahead of "1". So wait - * Prince * is Anti-Christ? <br /> <br /> Satan Soze follows Jericho and Christine (J and C? Get it?) around the city, somehow doing nothing that really tries to catch them. In one scene, Satan restores Jericho's wife and child to tempt him to reveal where he was hidden by Christine. But when he sees Jericho's mind so deeply that he creates nostalgia for his family, why can't he see where Jericho Christine hid ten minutes ago? Satan can talk to an assassin without a language, but he cannot turn this assassin into a semi-automatic weapon. And when Jericho strikes the satan in the dark, Satan is polite enough to open his shirt to expose the wounds in the brackets, so Jericho doesn't worry unjustly about Satan's health - not sanitary to open the tongue? Indeed, instead of simply having Jericho to get close to Christine and raping her, Satan gives the side projects so much unnecessary energy (striking a language teacher, blowing a Jericho partner (Kevin Pollak), and then rescuing, and then bleeding again, ridiculously fought with Jericho if he could sneak at him, that we didn't know if a more efficient assassin / lover should be put on the case, would say, Antonio Banderas. <br /> <br /> What I find most valuable at the end of the days * is Arnold's brave attempts by the method: "sad" means dulling his eyes or excluding anything from a stranger accent; "depression" means lifting a bottle on his lips and not emphasizing a foreign body; "deadly scared" means expanding his eyes and not something with an external accent. we could only decipher it. <br /> <br /> After all, the devil is sent not by the holy people by Catholics praying for liberation from apocalypse like atheists Jericho. While the daily men of the impotent god incite "faith" and trembled in their cells that do nothing about Satan between them, the prince of darkness is repelled by a zero-fledged, high-weapon and foreign accent. It clearly says something that the Catholics blindly refuse to listen to: that even if the devil existed, those who are unconditionally and irrationally afraid will not be able to believe in their decline, not to mention that they are acting against it. In addition, they may not really want to hit him, because only by their opposite polarity will their god become permanent. <br /> <br /> Because it is written in the Revelation: "And the prince of darkness shall lay down the earth without the plan of any solid game, and impregnate the virgin on a date that is not important until the calendar of the 1500's gregorians receive the numbering of days, puts it in sync with the equinox and Anno Domine syntax that irritates sensible people for millennia, when Christians have forgotten Christ's actual date of birth and instead attributed the pagan Saturnalia festival, and the prince is making a revolution through purple tights and ambiguously lesbian band members? I can believe that people are blood-drained and crucified, and the alcoholic was built like Mr.. I can believe that a giant, supernatural monster cannot kill a man who is armed only with a foreign accent; I can even believe that the devil must foretell some of the thirteenth century Celtic Druid rituals, but what I can't believe is a 20-year-old virgin in New York in 1999. <br /> <br /> Especially about Prince ...
