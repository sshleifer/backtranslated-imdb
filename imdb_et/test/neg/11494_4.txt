I just finished reading Forsyth's novel Icon. I thought it was one of the deepest, most detailed and page-changing books I ever read, certainly my 10th top level. Okay, let me first point out that it would be impossible to properly adapt the novel to a 2.5-hour movie so that I understand that teams have to deviate from the version of the book and differ. However, when I say "distinguish" what I really should say, "take the characters from the book, add some, leave some out, take out the book plot, add a modern new plot, somewhere in the name of Frederick Forsyth". I didn't say it was a bad picture, far from it, some effects were top-notch and the operation was not half-bad. The story was sucked and not based on logic or reality. Forsyth's novel was so good and real and changed the facts of reality instead of exaggerating them. If you haven't read the book, wait for a good TV movie with a good actor when you read the book and try to forget it.
