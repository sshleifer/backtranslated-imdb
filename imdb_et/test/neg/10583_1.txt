The film begins with the looting of Spiderman, which is your introduction to Rick Ricker (played by the Drake Bell "Drake & Josh" celebrity, personally I would have given Josh a lot of fun) and the "Rick Punchers" joke is lifted from the plane, so writers had already scraped the barrel for ideas for this film. Rick's Class is a research trip to Amalgamated Genetics lab and this is where we can fill in the name of the first star in the movie, Brent Spiner (Data in Star Trek TNG), who plays Dr Strom. Rick bites the genetically modified dragon from his mandate. <br /> <br /> We will meet our next big star at Rick's home, with her aunt Lucille (Marion Ross of Happy Days) and Uncle Albert. Leslie Nielson from an airplane, police team and naked gun). And we will be introduced to Carlson's board of directors (Dan Castellaneta from the Simpsons), who will then be killed very quickly. We were told that Rick had slept for 5 days and got cheap, sexually oriented scenes designed to serve the attention of the male audience. Stephen Hawking's look scene is painful to look at and it's really a bad idea that doesn't work and is not far from funny. <br /> <br /> We get another Spiderman spoof (Rick catches the girl and all the planets) but the movie should end when Jill hits a bowling ball that falls under her head, which would have cut her skull and killed her stone dead. You see how Rick's first powers appear (thrilling power and speed), then his first rescue, which goes very wrong. We also have an incest that is really very bad. We get a setback and Batman's looting, in which we discover Rick, is solely responsible for the death of his parents. Spiderman Robbing Again Ricks Uncle is released by Jeffrey Tambor (Hellboy), who is playing a hospital doctor. Then we get the X-Men scam (done very badly when Patrick Stewart is about as white as they come), Barry Bonds plays another look. <br /> <br /> We meet an invisible girl (playing Pamela Anderson is waiting for her costume to be stunning!). Ricks Race 1 with his costume (if he confirms his ability to see and breathe through it) is another Batman fraud. Tom Cruise's Youtube interview clip plays another look (and not very good). There are many modern references, such as Youtube, Facebook and Wikipedia, all of which show that the movie is set today. There is a very weak gay joke (never a good idea for them) when Jill helps Aunt Lucille make a Thanksgiving dinner and the pissing scene is not very funny, just a baby. <br /> <br /> Aunt's farting scene is not very funny, just incredibly childish. Anyone who thinks it's funny is to have about 12 years of age. He kills and we really have a bad necrophilia joke (is there any topic that these people don't try to use to get a cheap laugh?) In his funeral, and even worse cremation jokes. <br /> <br /> At the awards ceremony, we get 2 worst pictures in the whole movie (Prince Charles & Nelson Mandela) and if you don't know how this baby carriage or stupidly humiliates this film, Landers will win the "Douchebag Of The Year" award. Landers has appeared in The Hourglass (a really bad scene where the same girl can run twice in the same direction with Jill). <br /> <br /> Of course, the sand glass is spoiled, Jill is rescued from a certain death and only the funny scene in the whole movie is the last one.
