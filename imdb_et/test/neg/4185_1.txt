This movie was terrible because it was sorta like casual gay porn, but they just don't come .... I waited almost 2 hours for fucking peacocks ... they just didn't come. Instead, it is just a stupid ass that travels through a dead corn field with a camera that is a mixture of the bad episode of the Blaire witch and the dusk. And the best part is that since October 23, 2005, they started taking a movie, please don't be fooled by the fool, though it looks exactly the same as the first dark harvest that hasn't bought the lion's gateway to corn: film and he had a brilliant idea release it as a continuation of the original dark harvest, which I thought it was funny ........ the only thing they had in common was that both were shot in a corn field. Film WILLLLLL does not scare the catch from others, like the first, so just leave it off !!!!!
