I was looking forward to Dante's contribution to Showtime's great horrorantology series, but it was easily bunched. It's really too bad. Some of this may be due to the poor choice of source materials as odd. Why Joe didn't just write the original, I have no idea. Instead, we get the episode of this soapbox, where the "message" crosses the script, the characters, the production, everything, and finally I just wondered if it could get worse and I didn't break it ... but it ended worse. What is such a talented creative team? Leave it out and buy John Carpenter instead. It can balance all the elements: horror, humor, character, vision and fun. Homecoming is about as fun as taking a bear will take you off your sleeping time.
