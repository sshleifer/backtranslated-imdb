If this film was made two years earlier, it would have been much better. Unfortunately, this was done in a decade that had no idea how the horror film should look or behave. When I first heard this movie, IMDbis categorized it as a sequel to the Cheerleader camp. Oh, how wrong they were. Yes, Betsy Russell was in it, but Uma Thurman certainly wasn't. I really would like to find this person who started this sequel to rumor. I'm sure many of us would be. I'm not giving up, because frankly I don't remember how this movie ends! I'm just telling you you're watching a real camp horror movie ... The Burning Starring Jason Alexander, Fisher Stevens, Holly Hunter & geek Fast Times at Ridgemont High. The Word to the Wise - Just because the horror film has the title camp, does not mean it is worth it. Oh, and one more thing WHAT HORRORI FLICK MADE EASIS MID 90 YEARS NEVER USED VERY GOOD!
