This movie was really terrible. It was not at least a little scary or even surprising. I went to see it with a lot of friends and at night we said, "Ruins destroyed my night." <br /> <br /> I would not recommend seeing it in movie theaters, renting it or even watching a movie on TV at random. It's an absolute waste of one and a half hours. The plot was almost non-existent, the characters were terribly underdeveloped, and they did not give any feedback on what happened, and then it remained completely open as if it had prepared the sequel.
