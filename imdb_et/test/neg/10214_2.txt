The new wrestling exhibition paves the way for a never-before imagined giant Zeus. Network President Brell does everything in his power to lead WWF champion Rip's square circle to resist Zeus, a "tough boys battle". However, Zeus is different from the competitors Rip has ever seen. <br /> <br /> Normally, I would give Hogan freedom as a wrestler who crosses the film's role, but this film didn't require much stretching from Hulkst, just asking Hogan to play what he failed unfortunately. "Tiny Lister" made great efforts as a powerful Zeus, but even his work continued to lack film, namely action! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, if you wish, with a salt and a sense of humor, otherwise you'll probably need to turn it off for a little over ten minutes.
