I find it horribly ironic that "left" Hollywood will continue to stifle its stakes by making these terribly lenient films that do not condemn and resist the war on terror. <br /> <br /> Dedicated to pacif, and hope that the war will die out, as BORN is on the Fourth Jelly, or HIGHLY THREE DAY, this movie really feels out. None of these soldiers question this war, the war, or the idea of ​​war. They just try to make another tour. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you are a patriotic American who wants to see courage and glory, this movie really looks like. None of these soldiers love America or even loves this service. How they rotting and crushing make them more like suburban teens than blue collars. It is NOT SOLDIERS, and it is not IWO JIMA SANDS. It's not even pointless action and war scenes are less RAMBO and more BUFFY. <br /> <br /> Ryan Philippe cannot carry such a movie so completely. Although she is devastatingly sexy, rough in the trade, men's room, bisexual sort, it is hard for her to portray her as a slow-talking Texas boy who wants to step up and read. It's not Sgt. Croft is Mailer NAKS AND DEAD. He is more like Joel in the other lives of the Truman Capote, in other rooms. She can't sell you the idea that she's been in a fight and made her a bit, OR she wants her wife and wants her right away. He worships on the battlefield and in the bedroom scenes, seeing he'd be much better than he would bend and get a good rigid attack from behind.
