The 70s were undoubtedly the "golden age of horror" made by the TV. This is one of those that was probably out of the week's ABC film. This is an old story of a house and / or ghost with one new owner. The film has a promise, but it has never been realized. Everybody has hurried too much. Tensions and tensions need time to build and grow. And nothing new. We've seen it all before and one better. <br /> <br /> One last thought: I don't understand why Robert Wagner's character fell on a long-dead movie star when he was married to Kate Jackson for goodness! !!
