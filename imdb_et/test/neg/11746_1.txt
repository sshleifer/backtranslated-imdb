First, first, who would take Hitchcock again with his right mind and the other who hit it? I testify that I had no intention of ever watching this movie. The original Psycho is one of my favorite films and it just seemed like a humiliating photocopy. I watched it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed less than five minutes to the mess that it was terrible. First, as mentioned, they did it off. Where's Originality? Why remake a movie that is almost perfect just like it was first done? Why start this movie again? If you intend to do something, do something else that doesn't work and do it better! <br /> <br /> Secondly, they used the same script from the 1960 version. The dialogue no longer works. It works well and sounds perfect for the 1960s, but it looks strange and stylish that comes from modern actors. Why not update the dialog? Hitch didn't write the script, you could have written. <br /> <br /> This film had some very good talents and was wasted by imitating the original actors. The actor who played in the car dealer seemed to just play John Anderson as a car dealer. All the actors felt that the only direction they were given was the characters of the original film. Vince Vaughn may have felt a little bit like Anthony Perkins, but by doing so you will lose the compassion you should have for Norman. Norman's masturbation over Marion's dress-up is too far away and lost the innocence of that character, which I think Tony Perkins was doing so well in his performance. Viggo Mortensen's accent was annoying and Rita Wilson was too old to play Caroline. His lines came out as someone desperate, not just young and fun like Patricia Hitchcock's performance. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I saw about the movie was that Gus Van Sant was able to open the movie when Hitch saw it. Hitch wanted to open one long stroke that went over to Phoenix, but could not at that time be able to hit a row that was criss-crossing. This film filled this vision with the helicopter that went into the hotel window. After that, though, the film became a waste of cellulose waste. <br /> <br /> If you're curious about how wonderful a movie will be destroyed, check it out, but don't look at it in any way until you look at the original. This is a lost photocopy of the original and should never be green. Try to master, not imitation.
