Without John Rhys-Davies, I have to admit that it never registers on my film meter. However, it is not a bad thriller, given the small budget, low quality effects, rigid operations and Sci Fi channels. The blood effect is very convincing and Chupacabra seems really realistic ... no matter what you think Chupacabra looks like it is one of the beautiful Chupacabra. <br /> <br /> In addition to the positive ones, this is like Kolchak: the night stalker (Darren McGavin, remember?) corresponds to the boat of love, but despite the final cheese of that work, it still has something similar to the plot and strives for your respect at the same time laugh and roll like your job is in conflict, so far I managed to find a nice pleasure. Maybe you too. <br /> <br /> Rated 5,2 / 10 Made 4 TV scales. <br /> <br /> This sets the 4.1 / 10 movie on a scale from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
