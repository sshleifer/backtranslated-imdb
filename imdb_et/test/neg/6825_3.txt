Reading the events of a few years ago (hard to believe it really happened) I thought there was an interesting story here. Many secrets were never discovered, the horse never found, the main conspirators never stuck. <br /> <br /> But this film seems to be disturbed by character training and very little attention is paid to the plot. Some other questions are raised, why would Mickey Rourke be in this movie? Its good to see a rourkes career is back down, but he must cringe to mention this garbage. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in a topic, do an internet search topic, you will be more educated and dare to say more about entertainment. Avoid this.
