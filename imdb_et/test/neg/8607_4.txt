The sex life of potato men is related to the sex life of many men involved in the delivery of potatoes. So there are no surprises there. In fact, this title is pretty much what you can expect: it is a peculiar comedy that includes sex and potato men. Sometimes the film works. This is a nervous, sometimes uncomfortable comedy about the lives of some rather irrelevant and rather medium men who have women with different types of problems. If the film does not work clearly and why it failed from the post office, it is that the peculiar, inconvenient parts are simply inconvenient and uncomfortable. Instead of laughing at the scene of a raised man in the basement, masturbating with another man when he loves his wife, I think most of us are just clumsy and wonder what Andy Humphries thought. Well, maybe it will show what he thought too clearly.
