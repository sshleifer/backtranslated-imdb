Both Killjoy 1 and Killjoy 2 were beaten, but the first was better. The special effects of this movie were not at all special. Even though the killings were better in this regard, they were not something that was against it. One thing that was worse in Part 2 was the characters. They suddenly changed emotions and some of their lines were just foolish. For example, one quoted sign: "You have a better R.E.S.P.E.C.T. or you know what it means to me." When I heard this line, I thought it was the worst I ever heard. The other thing I hated about this movie was that it was too short. A successful movie must go for more than one hour and twenty minutes, like Killjoy 2. If Full Moon makes Killjoy's 3rd, it would be the lowest level they could go. Generally 1/10. <br /> <br />
