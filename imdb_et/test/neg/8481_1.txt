(Includes very bad spoilers) What I'm saying about it ... It's a really bad and amazing movie! Too many CGIs and special effects .... you could say how ridiculous the baby is! at least go to "Dungeons and Dragons", another terrible bunch of TRASH. The mask makes Dungeons and Dragons better! Uggg !!!!!!!!!!!! Pure Crap !!!!!!!!!!!! I hate this trash !! I would also like to say that "Superbabies: BabyGeniuses 2" was also a really stupid movie. Probably as stupid as "Mask Son". "BabyGenius 2 had the same fake as" Mask Son "and also includes way too much CGI !! <br /> <br /> Anyway yes ... it was BAD BAD really a BAD movie .... just please avoid it .... DON'T recommend it to anyone ... please your just too ridiculous .... no point and really bad plot.The child peing his father was just flat!
