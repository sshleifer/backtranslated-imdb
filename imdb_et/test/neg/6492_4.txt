Robert Lansing plays a scientist who is experimenting with solid materials, but he goes one night too far and involuntarily makes four dimensions! The fantasy of atoms is quite charming very fun. Maybe it was considered a sci-fi (psychological surprise) over time, but today the film is slightly twisted and naive; it is a television party adapted to show the TV late late. Lansing and Lee Meriwether's wooden productions barely have one dimension, although Patty Duke (playing the lovely brat pre- "Miracle Worker") gets a colorful, memorable exit. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
