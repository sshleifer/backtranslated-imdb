This film begins with an interesting design and a promising premise, but does not offer cult-movie goods. It is placed in a sharp parallel universe, where everything belongs to the "Blump" corporation, this is a terrible stand-up comic who is lucky to grow behind his third hand. <br /> <br /> All the chances for excellent cheese are the 80-year-old adult Judd Nelson, Wayne Newton, visual visual lines and strange plots, obese women with nervous lingerie, necrophilia - but it never costs. <br /> <br /> is the main problem. Each scene is misleadingly slow. Nelson's stand-up routines should be funny because they are not pathetic. But every performance pulls up until it's even tangentially funny, just boring. <br /> <br /> Imagine someone telling you the longest, strange jokes you imagine, full of smirky self-congratulations in its funny and strange way. Imagine that, after two hours, you will never have a stroke. You've just recorded yourself blind when you look the blind upside down.
