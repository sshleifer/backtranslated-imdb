A cartoon of the 1940s, which today was probably banned by the Black Beauty gag, where Daffy drives a black man like a horse. <br /> <br /> The whole story goes to the bookstore, where books come to life every night. So we have, among others, Ugly Duck (Daffy) and Wallstreet's wolf. They stop chasing after the wolf fools Daffy with a fake doll (hence the title). <br /> <br /> And this chase is all in this little comic that is not real today. Just fun if you're a true Looney Tunes fan, I guess ... <br /> <br /> 4/10.
