When I was a little girl, I absolutely respected the Princess of Swan, again the same fairy tales of snow-white, sleeping and Cinderella, the princess and her prince, who saves the day, is always a timeless story that never dies, well, hopefully. But I thought I'd check out Swan's princess queue to see what they were and, unfortunately, this is a typical comic strip that simply destroys more than entertainment. The only sign I still found very amusing was the queen, she was very funny in this movie and had the best part. But the voice changes, they were noticeable and disturbed me quite a bit, I don't want to be picky, but it was too weird. The story was just about borrowed from the first Swan princess, but the villain of this film follows Rothbart's traces. <br /> <br /> Odette and Derek celebrate their one-year anniversary, but Derek has been too busy to fight for his kingdom to keep it safe. Also, as a result of his mother's birthday, he forgets that there is a new villain in the city, Clavious, who hopes to go over and over where the Rothbart authorities went and kidnap the queen on her birthday. But Odette has to go back to her swan to help Derek fight her and save her mother. <br /> <br /> Swan Princess 2 is, of course, more than kids so I don't think it's a good clean fun for them. The reason why these queues are disappointing is that it is usually just for the kids, it is the audience they are striving for, but it is more enjoyable if everyone can enjoy jokes and stories. Now it's here and there a little laughs and strangles, but it wasn't my first princess of swans. I would recommend it for a small one, but if you are looking for a fun comic film, I would recommend staying with the first Swan princess. <br /> <br /> 4/10
