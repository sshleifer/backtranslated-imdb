A good example of the actors and a seemingly nice plot - though not original - allowed me a nice evening in front of the TV. I was disappointed. The actors gave the standard (Juliette Lewis well like never before; William Hurt solid, but in the background; Shelley Duvall persuaded like never before), but the story was too thin for me to read and the turn of the finale was too obvious and too late; there was only one character who was nice to the girl, so what do you think! Then the final twist? I don't know what to think about. Boy and neighbor? Contract with the devil or just to move? What! The film had a good idea, but the ideas were not elaborated in detail. It could have been good, but it wasn't. Too many loose ends to tie, says Columbo.
