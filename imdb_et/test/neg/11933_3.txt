Finally, it hits the fourth installment of the series, the last one. None of the three successes gave tribute to a very fun original, but this particular film is nothing more than a shameless attempt to use the name "Magnificent Seven" and Bernstein's rushing music. Production values ​​are similar to TV films and characters are forgotten and indistinguishable: in parts "II" and "III" you could not remember their names, here you can't even remember your face. Lee Van Cleef was an inappropriate choice for Chris's role, but no one would have thought of replacing Yul Brynner. Don't waste your time.
