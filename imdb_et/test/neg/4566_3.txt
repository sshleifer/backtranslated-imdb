I think this is an "alternative reality" teen flick ... Specifically, Ferris Bueller type character leader cheating ring. Yes, I know it is not meant to compare to Ferris Bueller, at least not between "oranges and oranges", but it is less or less. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: it's galaxies away from even the small classics. This is traceable, though only if you have not waited very much. This means that the headmaster has some charm, but the assumption is thin because writing is not just wise. The film did not give enough interest, rotation or tension to keep my interest. Frankly, I continued to watch ... Looking at the hope of seeing something suddenly clicked. It wasn't. So stylish as it is, I don't recommend this movie. BTW, it seems strange to see that Mary Tyler Moore is the main one. He has really failed, I hope the salary was extremely high.
