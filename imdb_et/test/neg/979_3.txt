I can imagine what happened to this movie: a bunch of studio-boys sit around, drink gin-tonics, maybe a common one, and one of them raises the idea that it would be nice if they could find a movie that would cross a generation gap that at that time was as far away as Archie Bunker and Mick Jagger. Something that both college-age rebels and their parents find equally interesting - for various reasons, maybe, but still there is a ticket ticket. What are interesting hippies? Asia, philosophy, pacifism and natural kits and costumes. What interested their parents? Musicals, eye candy, sensitive script and nostalgia. Very well, then "Lost Horizon", old classic music, colorful. Can't stay, right? It was a bomb. James Hilton's lost Horizon is perhaps a less classic but not a bad novel. In general, he outlines the Utopian society of Shangri-la, the "Blue Moon Valley" near Tibet, with peacefully satisfied villagers serving the monastery of long-lived monks. The invasion of Paradise is Gilligan's island-shaped stranger (WWI veteran, missionary, etc.), each of whom is involved in the situation - which plot is related to the reaction of their reaction. choose to live in paradise or try to turn to the twentieth century rebellion. According to him, it is a gentle, pop-lit fluff, presenting Hilton's own conservative British views of the "Oriental" dress, exotic and familiar as a fortune cookie. As imprisoned guests of the monks, it is forbidden to leave the valley on the shore, but never forced to work or pray (not for the monks to do too much), to royal and to provide simple but luxurious accommodation. Do you want to escape? In this Central American sky-Earth, monks are both cultured and wise, the climate is warm, the food is rich and tasty, the villagers are picturesque nuisances and nothing changes. The nuns are courageous, but encourage them to see themselves and even flirt (this reason is one of the most fun inaccurate explanations I've ever read). Even their religion is terrifying: it was found to be the best mixture of Christians and Buddhism in both worlds, there is little offense, but the most serious fundamentalists or odd ones out there who actually knew something about Tibet (which was very small in the early thirties). <br /> <br /> Capra's film, focusing on the adventure / character interplay corners, was enchanting; and maybe Steven Spielburg could have flown it if he had been around. As an early seventies Hollywood product, the adventure was too fast and the updated list description is too sharp to impress many. The classic B & W's visual, indicative feature of the abandoned monastery is reminiscent of a luxurious and light blue luxury spa complex, and at least some monks' coats have tried historic accuracy. doing a morning massage and a fango bath with a few holes in the afternoon for golf. Perhaps Stephan Sondheil could have restored a story to some grit by playing a real conflict within every real reaction; only five years later, Brian Eno would have had a peaceful atmosphere for T; Instead, Bert Bacherach and Hal David were given the task of reading songs that marry Musik-like melodies with some of the newest Age Agey lyrics. Of course, each song requires a dance number ranging from just forgetting to completely eternal, and so is a script that has no single quoting line. <br /> <br /> Tie-ins for this movie was a legion - everything from cookbooks to the poster that was meant to advertise this movie, and that was the leap that I actually went into and bought the sountrack album. The only good thing I can say is that I have enough impression that I write this review completely from memory for almost thirty years - next month I read Aldous Huxley, I bought a copy of Bardo Thadol, and thus learned a true Tibetan culture. Moan. <br /> <br />
