Franco Nero stands for Cole's Ninja, who can escape his warlord Frank Landers (Alex Courtney) and his wife (Susan George) to protect them from a cell phone (Christopher George) who wants to land. Things become even more complicated when mobster hires Cole's old noble (Sho Kosugi), who is also a ninja. Inept martial arts actor, while having better product values, most ninja movies can't inject into the surrounding environment or doing this thing. Bad effort around.
