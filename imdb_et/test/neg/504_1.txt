The director spent a lot of time making the scenes true to historical photographs and all the sounds of the old western whims. Too bad that manufacturers and writer / director Michael Cimino spent zero time on any historical fact that was actually touched upon by Johnson County War. A lot of war was about using public lands for grazing. The bodies did not want the poor shepherds living on the ground to compete for the feed of this cold, wind-eared plateau. The whole epic does not mention one of the most important grazing grounds for grazing sheep. <br /> <br /> The worst scene is the fight between peasants and hired killers. In the form of peasants, they have been in the midst of attacks, as the number of Indians would work in many earlier Hollywood films. The truth is that the Johnson County sher William (red) Angus, who had 200 to 300 men, stopped the arms and trapped them in a TA-ranch. I doubt women were involved in the siege. <br /> <br /> Ellen (Ella, also known as Kate Kate) Watson and her second wife James Averell were hung by a lynch mob about three years before Johnson County invasion. Ella was never a prostitute. The Wyoming Farmers' Association (WSGA) spread it to disdain. The fact that the plot puts him in brothel music only serves the interests of the WSGA. <br /> <br /> I am opposed to using real people on a plot that is so obviously fancy. There are no facts about character events, timeline, or background. Why Michael Cimino would use those people who were loosely linked to the Johnson County War (and subsequent events) behind me. <br /> <br /> The film could have been more interesting if it had lived on the political consequences of federal government intervention in government affairs and what happened after Calvary rescued WSGA forces. Some effort was made against the Cattlemen, which is under the responsibility of Johnson County Attorney. But since Johnson County was unable to afford court fees and Wyoming Governor, Amos W. Barber, supported WSGA, the charges eventually ended. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think the movie was just an excuse for Isabelle Huppert's nude DVD version of three of the three four-hour work.
