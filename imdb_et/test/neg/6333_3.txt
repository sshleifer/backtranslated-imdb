An unpleasant "home invasion" genre can be traced back to Wes Craven's "last house to the left", where nonsense like "I spit on my grave", "wrong path" and "visitors" right after the footsteps of this movie. In the beginning of the 80s, an Italian who offers the same plot is reopened, with a twisted turn on the mainland train. "La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto"? English speaking countries known as "Terror Express"? starts surprisingly well, but about twenty minutes is worse because sex scenes start to get the most serious serious activities and tensions. <br /> <br /> David, Phil and Ernie, the three rich youngsters who are calming down and terrorizing other people, are in continental expression in Italy. The train is full of other passengers, including a prostitute Juliette (Silvia Dionisio), who often travels by train and has agreed with one carrier to act as a pimp, persuading male passengers to take part in their sleeping chambers for their money. The three cretans quickly caused the passengers to bother because of aggressive and drunk behavior, but things become more serious when they take control of the whole car exclusively and barricade themselves from the rest of the train. Soon they will temporarily check? a young young woman (Zora Kerova) has been raped in two young people in a narrow space; Juliette has a long-term sexual assault; and later the disgusting trio men forced the passengers to play dice to decide which person rapes a 16-year-old virgin who travels with her parents (the concept is a double taste because her father is one of the men who is forced to play). The only traveler who seems to be ready to fight is a convicted offender sent to Germany, but what hope does one man have against three armed thugs? <br /> <br /> La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto will start well. Various intriguing characters are introduced and three hoods have a truly disturbing effect on passengers. Although the story is clearly exploitative, the scenes that open up are cautious and the film seems to have risen above the usual genre level. Things break down during a spooky scene where Kerova is inside a sexual intercourse section. The scene is filmed, and the effect does not seem to have caused compassion for the victim or hate criminals? instead we ask you to turn on. This is the worst of sensationalism. Subsequent further humiliating rape, but rape sequences include too much of a persistent camera for oral and female genitals. One sequence containing a 16-year-old girl who is on the edge of a hard core and is particularly wrong. At the end of La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto it is easy to forget that it was meant to be a thriller because the last hour of the movie is devoted to pornography rather than skipping. Easter people love it; others may search elsewhere.
