I looked at the version of the pathetic American over-dubs, maybe it made it a lot worse, but what I did was still a bad movie. It seemed like a low budget. Visuals reminded me of the tedious 60s BBC costumes, etc., of a second-level TV movie, a random white dog that replaced Dogmatix. Mainly, however, I feel that the characters in the film did not behave like the characters in the comic and the result I never felt willing to give the film a bad look. Without using a movie without a comic, it's always hard to catch the comic and I didn't feel it worth it.
