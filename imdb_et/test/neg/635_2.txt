Watching ALIEN EXPRESS inspired fear, shock, regret, and yes. In order to guess that those who have done a good job in the past, they should do something like this. Horror, horror. <br /> <br /> Tell me if it sounds familiar. <br /> <br /> A train specially built for a political campaign is a big rally in Las Vegas for the candidate, Texas Senator (Barry Corbin, the only actor with the same decade ALIEN EXPRESS and NO COUNTRY OLD MEN). At Utah, the meteor burns a car waiting for the train to pass. <br /> <br /> The train stops. Local law enforcement has been called. Could it be? The senator has a lovely young lady (Amy Locane from CRY-BABY and MELROSE PLACE) who just happened to have ever joined one of the officials who answered 911. Lou Diamond Phillips (STAND AND DELIVER, LA BAMBA) is a former husband. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the eeev has managed to keep the aliens away from the train. <br /> <br /> The train leaves. Lou gets his friend's helicopter pilot so Lou can fall on the train (about 70 miles per hour) so he can save the day. Like a friend's reward, he runs on a helicopter hill. <br /> <br /> What is another example of how poorly written ALIEN EXPRESS is. The police hero sidekick must die, we all know it. But he should die at the end of the third act, usually during several lives. <br /> <br /> When Lou is on the train, he can lose his shirt so he can wear Bruce Willis in the DIE HARD sewer. female beater t-shirt. Yes, Lou is 46 years old, but he hits the gym. The part he plays is not worth disturbing, but he is in good shape. <br /> <br /> The senator will be delighted with Miss Utah in the afternoon, but foreigners will intervene and both he and the woman who are young enough to have his grandchild to pay the highest price. <br /> <br /> Soon we will have bomb threats, multiplication of aliens, and of course the train will get out of control and speed up your date as Lou and Todd Bridges (DIFF'RENT STROKES) try to save as many lives as possible. <br /> <br /> The whole movie has just one surprise. At the beginning of the story, the couple raised their wine glasses for their thirty-fifth anniversary, hoping for a further thirty-five years together. The guy gets up, but both live. Maybe the writers lost them easily. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you would like to be on the wall. Those who have done better work (and indeed deserve much better than this) are probably happy for this job. Did they think they were doing something useful or sleeping (and / or drinking) asleep? At the end of the story, (quite a few things) gather in the last car of the surviving train that has been disassembled. The rest of the cars move over the cliff, but the main characters stop just a few short shores. <br /> <br /> Lou and his ex are reunited. Good luck prevails. I would have thought that the first thing they would have done would be to get off the train so that they would have a firm ground under their feet, but I'll land. <br /> <br /> Someone looks out of the window and sees the star in the shooting. Look, do the wish. Then another. Then more and more. Earth is bombarded with meteors that break open and horrible hands, with big teeth dolls everywhere. <br /> <br /> It has come to see the words "Sci-Fi channel presentations" The "original" movie tells us that we are happy to have Ti-Vo so we can in the next two hours move on. Or better yet, just go ahead and delete this two minute story and spend that time smarter.
