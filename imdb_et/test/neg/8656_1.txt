Neal N Nikki will vote for the worst films of the year by Planetbollywood. It's hard to believe that the famous Chopra movies have redeemed the movie. It was presented as a film for the family, but it is a ridiculous sex comedy. Nor does it laugh, but boredom cries and does not have sexy girls to make sexy girls sexy. The title song is the most annoying song of the decade, I'm Neil, I'm a man, a rock star superstar. Uday Chopra is one of Bollywood's worst actors who never have the talent. After making many Super Flops and not getting a movie from the producer, not his family. He gives a complete nonsense report that will lead you to eternal death. Tanisha, who is and always is known as the Cajol sister, gives a terrible result. Both participants have the most disturbing chemistry and their age is very immature. This is a special look very lovely for Richa Pollad, who has a pathetic role. The end was so stupid and stupid, I can't believe I actually paid the money to rent that money.
