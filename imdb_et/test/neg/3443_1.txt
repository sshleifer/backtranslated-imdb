honestly, I don't know why this exhibition lasted as long as it happened. ah, humor is subjective? but yes, this show is incredibly miserable when you ask me. Tim Allen is annoying. Jill is annoying. guys are annoying. Al is annoying. the neighbor is annoying. it's just more annoying, then funny. The plots are all the same, Tim makes Jill crazy and needs to get things right again. and the last seasons? the less you talked about them, the better who the hell is good for cancer sitcom? yes, great idea jerks. So yes, home improvement is not a very good sitcom. I would advise you to watch radio or Seinfeld. if I had to show it, I'd give it a rating of 1/10 because it never made a laugh. never before. so yes, it's still better than Nanny.
