I started to think critically about this adaptation in the first few minutes, but as a dedicated Jane Austen fan I stayed to the end ... But this is not a program that I would recommend to anyone who doesn't know his work I think it doesn't do the fairness of books and doesn't particularly entertaining television. This adaptation, which was not plausible, was something - many costumes and even actors did not have an authentic look and I found that the actor was sometimes poor. There is no doubt that the actors were all very beautiful, but it did not offer enough variety to create truly diverse, memorable characters. It was too static when it was completely in one place and there was no Fanny return, which is one of the most interesting parts of the story. The best actor was Blake Ritson, who occupied the health of Edmund very well and Crawfords were effectively cast. I like Billie Piper as an actor, but this role didn't fit her, and it was much better in Frances O'Connor's 1999 version, which gave a generally finer and more convincing result. Jane Austen's customizations always give a love story to make you feel good, but unfortunately it's one of the worst I've ever seen.
