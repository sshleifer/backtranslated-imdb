Hungary can't make good movies. Fact. This is a great example of this. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the term "plot" is not in this movie. It is seriously weak. Even many people would argue with me on this issue. Of course, it's taboo, but that's it. There are endless possibilities that could have been used when they were used, but they almost missed. I think the whole movie is just a pretext to show pictures that are the only decent things in this horror. <br /> <br /> Actress is just plain. There are not many features, so you think the actors have great facial expressions or imitating abilities, but not. In fact, they absorb 86% of the time. And then they don't say anything. When they even say one word, you start to tilt your head, saying, "It's unrealistic." But if this is again, it is partly the fault of writing a letter. Most dialogues also have no emotions. <br /> <br /> Editing is sometimes OK, but most of the time it is illogical and only worsens the whole picture. It could have given an emotional boost, but it seems that the editing here is about cuts one after another. <br /> <br /> Nobody tells me why critics say this movie is a masterpiece. Calling it "art" does not improve it. Sorry Mundruczo, but you couldn't. Live with it. Even if you probably do not care about my or another boy's opinion, who scarifying your "baby".
