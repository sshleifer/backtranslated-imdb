Well, I remember when the studio created Schrader and asked Harlin to act again for this movie, they were quite right. <br /> <br /> Dominion: The exhibitor's prequel is just a bad movie, it's boring, really it is. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to think that the studio set aside a psychological masterpiece and that all those who, in such great words, condemned Harlin's version and praised Schrader, even if no one had ever seen it, would have been right. <br /> <br /> But they weren't. <br /> <br /> In short, Schrader has no idea what a horror movie should be, and it will show up on the road. <br /> <br /> Droll, boring, inadvertently funny at the wrong place and bad supporting cast. <br /> <br /> Save your money and nerves, don't see it.
