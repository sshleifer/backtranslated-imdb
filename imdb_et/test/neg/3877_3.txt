I do not mind the after-effects; sometimes they are better than the original. But many times the originals are best left alone .... especially if you can't cast a duplicate. One of the biggest reasons for "Great Seven" was the popularity that was very popular. <br /> <br /> This is hardly an "excellent seven" if only Yul Brynner returns to one of the famous group "Great Seven". Six out of seven men are missing and replaced by much less well-known actors, losing their appeal in haste. In other words, except for Brynner, they have no boys charisma! It is similar to a championship sports team who plays out all substitutes except one. <br /> <br /> Brynner is good again: fun to watch, fun to hear that his distinctive deep voice, but the story, not just the rest of the team is flat. This movie should never be done. At first we took care of seven; here we couldn't care less.
