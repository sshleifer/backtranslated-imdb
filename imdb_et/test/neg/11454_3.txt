Like many early-sounding films, Cimarron has to look more at historical interests than the massive entertainment options. The best actor candidate Richard Dix's bite can be apologized as a silent film school actor. But even with the help of suspicions, Cimarron is poorly portrayed as a drama - an expanded film that moves independently of a series of unrelated sequences with little dramatic effect. Offically, the film is two hours and four minutes; it looks like you watch it for four hours. There is no reason to waste your time if you do not want to see all the best image winners or you are interested in a great deal of time. In my opinion, Cimarron's worst choice for the best picture in the history of the Academy and the award should have been to City Lights or Little Ceasar. Cimarron is hardly remembered today and should have been remembered, if not for the Oscar victory.
