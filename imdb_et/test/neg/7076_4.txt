I work in a video store so I could see it for free thanks to God, if I had paid for it, my review would be less forgiving. <br /> <br /> Well, the main idea of ​​the movie (geeky girl takes bloody revenge) is not all that original, there are several parallels "carrie" (playing the average practical joke loser, except for one nice girl that is actually harming her , Tamara and bears a bad family background). I still think it's a fun idea to trashy teen horror flick unfortunately they didn't take much advantage of the potential that is here and would rather put emphasis on all the wrong things. <br /> <br /> What worked: I liked the tamara actor. she seemed good (when she was hot) and her dirty lines were fun ("Sean can't come on the phone. She's a f ** king patrick!"). <br /> <br /> That didn't work: The whole wicca thing was stupid. I generally prefer rational explanations (he could have done all his thing to revenge his teacher or one of the boys). there were lots of logical healthy pictures, and the boy seemed really bad (if the boy cuts his ear and tongue - please !!!) <br /> <br /> the whole idea was not in front of the Oscar buzz but I just think they wasted comedy and their intermittent potential. it was tolerable but far from good!
