I tried. I really, really tried to think of something that deserves more than two. It's not that I can't get it - I'm a big fan of Asian cinema. The truth is that the film is parental, long-lasting and painfully separated during the construction process. <br /> <br /> I think if you are from Alfred Hitchcock's "Don't Tell Them, Show Them," you could understand this movie, but you would still be bothered. <br /> <br /> First of all, terrorists are trying to become aware of Jean-Luc Godard's style and fail to do so. Edward Yang understands the technique, but he is very inexperienced. (Maybe he's getting better with age; I don't know I haven't tried other Yang movies yet.) The point is that he uses "show, don't say", which really only stops the story of the procession. Of course, he will get visually captured images, but they will not draw the story together and they will not help to do it better. <br /> <br /> In addition, the main concept of consciousness and "show, don't tell" is that the correct picture, the correct drama, repetition and close correlation can make the viewer draw his own conclusions; not to say that these are the right conclusions, but they can be changed as the story progresses, and every director should try to get some kind of audience interaction. With that, Edward Yang disappears seriously. The viewer is constantly on the periphery. There is no reason to take it, there is no reason to consider characters or their motives, no reason to be emotionally involved and really no reason to remain alert. <br /> <br /> Finally, Yang Yang will lose the story he wants to say, not the story the film itself tells. His art moves in one direction, but as a big dog he can't control, he keeps up with the lead, trying to get it back to the desired course, not what he naturally follows. The most special example of this is the end. The end result should have been at the time of the man's revelation. We have already been told about the end of the book on which the film focuses (and, more broadly, on the possible end of the film). If Yang had decided to stop at this point, he would have been much more powerful, ignoring the observer - is the story playing as the book says, or is Yang playing in the "real world" differently? Asking the viewer to contemplate this is a viewer interaction that Yang painfully needs. Instead, he continues to tell the story he wants to say by striving for a natural conclusion about what? For the sake of the main character - we don't have to get to know it more superficially, and Yang does not feel the need to say whether he has made him a finer, deeper character. <br /> <br /> Why else does Yang prolong and torture his movie? To get more of these "visually stopping images". The movie really does. He wants to stop, it has a conclusion that feels naturally and leaves the viewer unhappy, but instead pushes Yang. Instead, Yang builds a complicated end that leads the viewer, causing him to "question what?" The first end, what Yang ignored, was good. The second end, well, my idea was "what cares?" Because it's not like it was something that hasn't already been outlined in the story ... but the last end? It was really a waste of time. Not only did the "real" end leave me free, but I also thought it was a story about what the story might have been. Yang sacrificed potentially a good story of the bubble-melancholy-noir-toned conclusion he had demanded all the time. <br /> <br /> My last problem with the film is nothing about the film itself, but about its production. Subbing (if you see it below) is terrible. Long sentences remain in the second or two times, while short sentences remain too long. Also, if Yang changes the images quickly, the subtitles will be removed from the screen. This is one of those rare cases where subtitles should be able to remain on the screen even when the image has changed because there is not much dialogue anyway.
