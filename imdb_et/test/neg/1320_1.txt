As bad as they can. This movie makes a deadly mistake that the viewer does not care about what characters happen to happen. The two women on this flick are so stupid that you start to root out the bad guys for the thing to end. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the few that was so bad that I had to go to the other side of the channel. <br /> <br /> Put on high tongue, no movie. People, not even the Ohio people, just don't act like that. Well, maybe the writers do it. <br /> <br /> There's not enough beer in the world to make this movie acceptable. <br /> <br /> F903
