I've seen this movie today. Very frustrated and wondering how it could be an Oscar list. The most sad things are: <br /> <br /> 1. It's very slow. <br /> <br /> 2. How can Ghengis-khan, a brutal and mighty Asian Emperor, play with a warm, lovely eye of a good actor - all during the film, except for one scene? <br /> <br /> 3. A lot of holes in the plot: There's nothing about how he became an emperor; something he spends 20 years between his childhood and maturity. We see ex-slave without money, power, friends or home. Click! - Next second, he will run a huge army without any justification. <br /> <br /> 4. The emergence of Ghengis-khani magic can only be explained by one wolf / god / whoever it was. <br /> <br /> 5. Can a person love his wife, after seeing him for years? <br /> <br /> 6. Is it enough to win a sword fight if you just drive your horse through enemy lines, sitting there with two swords and all dying around you? Does Ridley Scott know that? <br /> <br /> 7. Why doesn't Khan's mother see her as a parent after 20-30 years? <br /> <br /> 8. What is the motivation for the main character? (None. Literally.) <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. Really. The work of cinematographers is good; Nature is prominent - but the movie can't be done without a director and script. The real Ghengis-khan fills the director. <br /> <br /> Yours sincerely.
