Director Fabio Barreto received the nominee of a strange academy for his latest film, O Quatrilho. Quatrilho is a bad film, but Bella Donna made Barreto one of the slowest films. The adaptation of his novel Riacho Doce is ridiculous. Think of me how poor Brazilian fishermen speak of perfect English? In the movie they do. There's no scenario, it's just a very long video clip with beautiful spots and many sex elements with Moscovis and Henstridge.
