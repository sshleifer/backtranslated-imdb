My good friend said, "The monkey is funny, anytime, anywhere." One exception is BANANAS. It's just the BASIC MOVIE I've ever seen. It is worse than PLAN 9, which is worse than YUCCA FLATS BEAST. This is TERRIBLE. The spoken monkey gag gets old after about three minutes and believe me everything is there. Make sure you have a whole host of people to revive you after going to TOXIC SHOCK from BANANAS, which is the worst movie.
