When you see Barry Corbin in the movie, you can never be sure if it's a classic or a trash. Guess which category SOLO belongs to. Obviously derived from the popular sci-fi novel WEAPON, SOLO marks the stars of Mario Van Peebles, who sees a human-sensed robot who decides to think himself and is thus directed towards elimination. He hides out in the village in Mexico, probably saving money in places and in additions. Paying a boss is cheaper than paying in dollars, I suspect. William Sadler is one of the robots and soldiers who were sent to destroy Van Peebles. Van Peebles can easily hit them all, while Corbin looks far away. The film is a terrible ripoff of the TERMINATOR and CYBORG series and obviously has little to do with this source material. It is terribly written and acted upon and a great struggle at the end when it is totally comical. Van Peebles, a dignified actor elsewhere, is scared when he pretends to be a robot covered with synthetic meat. He looks like he's doing Robot mostly.
