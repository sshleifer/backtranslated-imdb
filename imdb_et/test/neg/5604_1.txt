With the production, what a waste takes time and money. Here is what some Europeans call the sci-fi film producer. Take a former model, Alexandra Kamp, pair with a US c-class actress and become one of the film's most famous producers Harry A. Towers. Then the towers find some hidden munich-based products. House, Tandem, Rola Bauer, and then mix it all without a script and get "Sumuru" - an invaluable pearl among the worst films! Get live people and do anything else you do, no movies! First of all, the producers went to South Africa to see what is on the screen is a gigantic sand hole where "action" takes place between extremely bad actors and extremely bad fxes, which every film student makes better.
