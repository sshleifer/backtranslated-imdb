I thought there might be some level for this movie and the whole thing went through. I can sum it up, saying it left a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> The film started with OK, I think Herc's initial character was true of myths. Both the child and the young adult started a fairly strong but not the brightest lamp. Later he becomes somehow loved by all charismatic speakers. Ah? Another problem: terrible CGI. Satyr looked OK, but the rest of the critters watched terribly, especially the charter, the most direct beast of the movie. And how is Leelee Sobieski's skin sometimes golden, sometimes normal? The worst part for me - and everyone should be - was the twelve work of Hercules. Because manufacturers probably didn't want to cover all of them; suddenly they thought that the primary screw heads who look at this garbage could not read this high. Instead of Hercules TWELVE's work, we got the work of sixty Hercules. Yes, five jobs! WTF?!? He didn't even finish the last one, so it was a 4 1/2 labor! Just terrible. I'm taking Hercules: Legendary tours over this mess day every weekday.
