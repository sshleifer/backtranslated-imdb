I was watching it last night for the first time in 40 years. This is bad. Really bad. But it has amusingly terrific moments to look at. First of all, was it deliberate to make the boy a nanny completely feminine? She even tells Costello la Mae West that "I'm lucky!" like Costello makes a double shot. God knows only what would have happened if the babysitter had been a hunk. This child would have seduced her in the heartbeat! Then there is the main male dancer. He's totally wrong. Roar with a laugh when she jumps and dances, without the talent being ever better in her life during her giant grave. Two romantic leaders are zeros, waste. Abbott can sing one line and the other singer duplicated. Geez, I think he couldn't even tune! Costello is not charming in her fear number, and I think very young children might like it, but there is not much to suggest. But oh, this attractive feminine boy! This aspect just blew me away! In addition to the family accepting someone out on the street without referring to the babysitter! Take a little bitch out of them today!
