this is the worst film in the world. the only reason I gave it was 2, because the first 10 minutes were hysterically funny "is it real?" sort of. it was such a fun and small budget ... they shouldn't even work hard. Nudity and violence were in the face of nudity and violence, and the consequences were so bad that you would not believe it (think of ketchup blood and cabbages as separated heads). don't rent it!
