This year's Eurovision was a big disappointment for me. I've been watching the Eurovision Song Contest every year since 1986 (well, at least that's the one I remember the most, and I was just 2). Like every other year, it contained both good, bad and terrible songs - nothing new. But this year's show was the worst thing I remember. Only very few good (decent, probably more similar) songs and lots of terrible songs. <br /> <br /> The Turkish winner song "Every Way I Can" sounded like a Turkish singer Tarkan burst hit "Simarik", just sounds much worse. It doesn't deserve to win from my perspective. The Belgian song "Sanomi", which came second, was language. Interesting, what's next? Animals are singing? Nonetheless, the music of the song was quite memorable, giving the songs a kind of dreamy feeling that the "lyrics" seemed like. One of the better songs, but it doesn't speak much. <br /> <br /> After one of the closest competitions in Eurovision history, Russian duo t.A.T.u. finished third in only three points behind Turkey and behind Belgium, "Ne Ver, Ne Boisia" ("Don't Trust, Don't Be Afraid") I was one of the few highlights, surprising almost everyone, being the most covered girls of all female contestants. They promised to speak their song and if we ignored the fact that they couldn't walk a couple of times in the first choir, they promised the song very well. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise when watching the scoreboard was Austria. the biggest odds for the song - a song that was really terrible - but came to 8th. Could it be that his song is shaken to the rhythm of the song? it seemed good, but because it seemed so stupid that it was really fun. <br /> <br /> Sweden did what they do best, ABBA. In 1999 they won "Take Me To Your H eaven ", sounded like ABBA. In 2001, they made the top 10 who listened to their heartbeat, again sounding like ABBA, and this year they did again in ABBA style, ending with top 10 again. <br /> <br /> England was ultimately punished for their absolutely terrible attempts to make the songs they've had in recent years. <br /> <br /> Ireland finished the 2000 winner, "Fly On The Wings Of Love". And I can go on and talk about how bad the songs were. <br /> <br /> I feel a little sorry for Aussies who finally got the chance to see the Eurovision Song Contest this year. They deserved the better. <br /> <br /> I didn't show this example. Eurovision since 2000 is one of the best in recent years for me. 2001 was pretty good but not so good. 2002 was okay, but definitely no more. This year was just a disappointment. <br /> <br /> We hope it will improve next year. If not for us, then at least Aussies. <br /> <br /> 4/10 One t.A.T.u. for one, for a short ride, one for a butt and one for the rest.
