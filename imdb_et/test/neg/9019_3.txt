This slightly embarrassing 50s sci-fi-horror schlock is not entirely loser. It's about a manned space rocket that falls into a remote area. A number of scientists are going to explore and discover that astronaut is a coma; he is kept alive with foreign embryos that have been mysteriously implanted in him. In any case, the title quickly raises the head of the alien's monster, causing general devastation, including partial head removal. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie is that it is pace. The appearance of a blood beast takes quite a long time, and he only gets to his own within 20 minutes. He is undoubtedly a totally ridiculous creation, but it is not really a problem because he gives a fair amount of comics. At the end of the movie, where we have the final stand-off and this ridiculous creature is going to talk to the doctor with whom he died earlier, you are doing well to not strangle. Also, in the case of a glorious X-ray, where we see the embryos of strangers floating in the body of astronauts - it's too funny for words. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, the fun moments come at the blood of the bloody night. too little and far. If you're a 50-year-old sci-fi nut, it's worth checking out. Just don't wait too much.
