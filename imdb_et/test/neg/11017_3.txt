I really wanted to like this movie, but after a few minutes of fun opening, I barely smile. I agree that there were no chemistry between the two wires and the other characters were looted. The script completely wastes Bud Tingwell and Kim Gyngell's talents. <br /> <br /> However, I have to say that there was a lot of laughter around me and even applause at the end. Maybe I couldn't associate it enough. I'm glad I went to cheap tickets.
