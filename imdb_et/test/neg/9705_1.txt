Sorry to say, but I was disappointed with the movie. It was very rushed because I think you understand that the Pride & Prejudice movie length version would be, and I felt that many of the main scenes were simply merged through the story to get through the story. Because the film is so busy, unfortunately, you can't really feel and feel every character. <br /> <br /> Not only is this movie boring. I say that in the case of the capital B, I started to go 1/3 and could not wait until the film ended. Since I've read the book and looked at the BBC version, I knew how many scenes had to go before I finally left the cinema. Mr Darcy, who is in this film, certainly cannot act. He also looks too young to play Mr Darcy. Every word that comes out of his mouth has rushed as he needs a script or something. Where is the structure? At first he seems to be confused about everything. He's just strange! It all looks like. <br /> <br /> Try not to compare Colin Firth's version, but if you love this version, you're probably still disappointed. <br /> <br /> Costumes are totally shocking. Where are the corsets? I know Elizabeth is poor, but I think she still knows how to dress like a lady's fashion, and that hasn't been grown. Her dresses show she can be the poorest peasant in England. <br /> <br /> I did not agree with any scene in the movie that I do not think it would be right in the society where men do such things, to be honest, that a wealth of wealthy Mr Bingley should know. There are some things that are said to be too slow when this movie is set up, and like Jane Austen. The nature of Bingley is shocking, it behaves like it is simpler, not character or respectful. But that's his laugh !!! I have almost no presence with Mr Wickham and Mr & Mrs Hurst and a couple of others have no presence at all. Keira did well, but that's not the same.
