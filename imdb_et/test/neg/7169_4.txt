George Burns returns after he has been a great success in 1977, "Oh, God!", What is a successful fantasy that was successful with the sudden need of the 1970s to go from comedic to comedy redemption (although it made money, the original was more consistent "Topper" of the 1930s with comedies as a return to a good self-conscious religious cinema. Here, God appears to young girls (Louanne, who had previously directed "Annie" in the production) and asks her to spread her Divine Word, causing her only problems for adults in this process. A peculiar, family-oriented film seems to be warm-hearted, and Burns begins to worship with harsh jibes, but writing is half-full and half-matured, and its adults are considering putting a little Louanne on everything that makes God feel more annoying than an older friend. Louanne has another problem: a perky boy with poor little eyes is used to showing the screen and sometimes it seems uncomfortable. Medium-budget output has a dirty, TV-like look with a few graceful touches. The final scene mimics the first "Oh, God!" it brings confusion to the peace of mind that is welcome. This is the finest moment in the movie. ** from ****
