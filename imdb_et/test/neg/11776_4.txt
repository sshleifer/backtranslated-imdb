Considering the subject of drug addiction, it is almost impossible to let the bones go, but to be a rather depressing film. But depressing doesn't necessarily mean bad. Unfortunately, in this case, it is really bad. The film has some good things, especially Vera Farm's high-quality power at Irene's core, a mother working on cocaine addiction. But here's not good enough to weigh up bad. Movie failures are mainly a story that can't capture and never seems to be going. Irene goes to rehabilitation and arrives at a helpless husband who has no idea how to support her attempt to start her habit. Irene is growing close to another drug addict who is a male nurse from a rehabilitation center. Complications arise. But the story has never sparked to life. It doesn't seem like a movie is actually anywhere. You can say that this is a tough and realistic look at the drug addicts' daily struggles. Maybe so, but in that case it doesn't make an interesting movie. All this has a very "blaa" feeling. Minimalist cinematography doesn't help things by adding an extra layer of incredible drab procedures. And no other performance will measure Farm. Hugh Dillon is OK when Irene is a male friend, but no other majority gives value to the procedure. All in all, this film is a dark, depressing and quite boring ride.
