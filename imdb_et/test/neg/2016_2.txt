A spacecraft that travels through the galaxy is exposed to a mysterious merchant ship that is likely to enter space. The team is examining the hope that it will make a claim to its cargo and acquire the ship. However, when they are on board a ship, their own ship is leaving mysteriously, leaving them to fight and fight not when the creature calls itself Drakula or Orloff. <br /> <br /> Not a bad start. I mean, it will follow several typical sci-fi / horror plots. The genres are pretty much that even the most original story inevitably refers to the comparison of another movie. But when you start with a fairly typical horror convention, the Dracula legend and the vampires in general and combine it with a fairly typical sci-fi convention, the team that is doing something and getting into the fight they are forced to confront the filmmakers is a better sleeve on their sleeve to print their own mark on a familiar genre clamp. So, no, Rood and Milborrow have their sleeves, but their hands. <br /> <br /> This movie starts with a malice, Caspar Van Dien has very badly forwarded a voice that gives enough explanation to explain who his crew is. I would also like to point out that Van Dien's character is Van Helsing. And, so very cleverly, it's Orloff's character on the Carpathian system planet Transylvania. Without joking. I mean, guys, we get it. And again, do not be kidding and use such names if you have nothing special in the store. <br /> <br /> So after introducing the Van Helsinki team, we mainly have a movie about this team trapped in a space ship with a vampire that is lurking. <br /> <br /> I'm a very forgiving viewer when it comes to low budget movies. Sometimes they may be great, see Raim's first two Evil Dead movies. Dracula 3000 had an adequate budget that was sufficient for some decent special effects and 3rd rings, such as Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio, etc. However, unlike EVIL DEAD clips, there is no talent behind the camera. The talent in front of the camera is marginal, but I give the participants no benefit. They don't know what to do. Alexandra Kamp-Groenveld, the best actor of the cobra, is killed quickly and always enjoyable Udo Kier decreases as an exposition tool for the viewer, as the dead captain we hear and watch through the video magazine. Grant Swandby is also a good professor, but it is difficult to take 3000 scientists seriously, wearing glasses and traveling with a wheelchair. And yes, this is a WHEEL chair because there is nothing futuristic about it. As far as the rest of the participants are concerned, I am sure that Coolio really tried to intimidate himself into becoming a vampire, but I do not believe that the irritation is scary in most people's books. Tiny Lister and Erika Eleniak do not offer much. Lister is never a big brawny black stereotype of IL. Eleniak seems really unhappy in the movie and never tries hard. Eleniak is a beautiful girl, even in the mid-thirties, but it seems that the film's duration is a bit worn and interesting. <br /> <br /> This leads us to Count Dracula / Orloff, played by Langley Kirkwood. Frankly, I don't remember who the vampire should be. He introduces himself as Orloff, but at some point he also recognizes Count Dracula. Get your finger off. In any case, you will be completely surprised at how this vampire is. Have you ever seen those cheesy horror shows that have local networks with a time slot on their creature? Yes, it's so bad. Langley Kirkwood, an actor who plays Orlock, has found that it is almost impossible to put together such ridiculous clothes. I'm sure his friends are still in trouble. <br /> <br /> There is not much on the plot. The Vampire is the last one that is sure and wants to go to Earth for some reason, and there is also some kind of lip service that wants to get Caspar Van Dien's character out of Van Helsinki. Most of the team becomes vampires, including Van Helsing, and the team uses these conventional machine guns and pistols to hit them before they explain the old heart of the routine. Yes, that's right, bullets, and yes, year 3000. Keeping this amazing vein, one of the main areas where the team opens up to fight vampires or vampires is because there is more than one that threatens them, full of old Soviet posters and insignia and such. What? There are also references to God / religion that are obsolete systems. But these references only confused me. Did the Soviet Union return? Do Rood and Milborrow want to do that? It never goes a long way, fools and posters look like. Just looking for cheap. <br /> <br /> The positive side is the film is edited and edited. Cinematography is nothing remarkable, but it is clearly done by professionals and I had no problems with special effects. The ships look like in space. While I am writing this, I recall how God fears the master's body when the team discovers it. What did they mean? Why didn't anyone say anything? See how difficult it is to say something positive about this movie without being negative? I think it's a thing. Regardless of what kind of positives you try to give this sci-fi / horror debacle, it becomes overcrowded due to lack of quality. <br /> <br /> Poor Udo Kier.
