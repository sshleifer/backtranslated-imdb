This is one of many US attempts to make an old classic British TV show that is more known than it. Of what I don't see, no one has mentioned you or even admitted you knew there was a TV-60-60 called "Secret Agent Man". Phantom, etc.) a man who had been used as the first James Bond, but he turned it down because McGoohan was a very dedicated person and kept James Bond's bed and violent ways against his values. <br /> <br /> This exhibition was in black and white, and it's a pity for those who haven't seen it, you've lost a lot. Mr. McGoohani played the "Secret Agent Manis" called Drake and after this show he finished a very popular, though sometimes strange and controversial, TV series "The Prisoner". The person he played in "jail" was that a person whose identity is not published is kidnapped and transported to an island where he does not know where he is or who he was, who is responsible for his robbery. He knows that his prisoners want to know the reasons for his abandonment of the British secret service, and this island has no names for the inhabitants, but they are referred to by numbers, and the Patricks character is given a number that is "6". the same character he played in Secret Agent Man, but McGoohan himself challenged it. <br /> <br /> In other words, the famous theme song that the original Secret Agent Man received is unmistakably known. It was written by Johnny Rivers, famous 50's and 60's pop music, and from what I read from some of you, I think this song comes from this version of the show. You're very wrong with that. It was Johnny's, and it comes from the original TV series, so let me help set the facts straight. For those who complained about the name of the exhibition, it was stupid, well in England, it was actually called a "dangerous person," and in the United States it was sent back to "Secret Agent Man". when it was first presented. <br /> <br /> This current show has little to do with the original, in such a main name, Drake, not on it, and I think they did their best to make it into their "Secret Agent" version. But it uses the redone version of the original theme song, so it tells you that this exhibition was really meant for redone, though still the worse redesigned version of the original series.
