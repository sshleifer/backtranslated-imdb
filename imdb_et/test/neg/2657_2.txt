Why is it that "romantic" movies that never go anywhere will always start (and probably end) with crappy jazz? It's not wise and it makes it look like a bloody TV movie. This movie was gentle, slow, boring, unoriginal, wood and I said bored? <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford apparently attempted to be mysterious and crude, but he was just a crawling, gummy policeman who seemed to walk the congresser's wife as if he was acting like a perverted - staring at Thomas with a perverted glare, hardly ever barely talk. <br /> <br /> And why do they always hunt British actors who put bright accents - they're cast because they're famous, and everyone knows they're British just because they're famous!
