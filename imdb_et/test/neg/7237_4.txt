I hated that the first movie is really boring and we only see the end of the octopus. <br /> <br /> Land bodies are found in a New York harbor. The police have no clues or doubts until Nick and his colleague realize that the killer is a giant octopus. Everybody, especially the police captain, refuses to believe Nick's story and soon the port will be filled with boats to be celebrated on July 4th ... <br /> <br /> In this movie we see more gigantic Octopuses and special effects for this movie are really good times. <br /> <br /> This movie works not bad, but not too good, but okay and look. <br /> <br /> Some movies are really cheese scenes, but if you can pass it, you should enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> 5/10
