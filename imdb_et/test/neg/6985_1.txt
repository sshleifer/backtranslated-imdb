First of all, the original concept of the lost treasure of gold plates in Lake New Zealand, which was subordinated to the World War II aircraft, is an excellent opening. There is nothing more than a comic as a drivel. Men who drive men, men, helicopters who drive men, helicopters ride boats, boats behind, for the better part, the most boring mess, absolutely no progress. Separate mention should be made of cutting the cut because many scenes are put together in random order. The actions of all involved are embarrassing. The last thing about picture quality and sound quality on this DVD is so bad that you will be terrified. - MERK
