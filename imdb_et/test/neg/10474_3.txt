I rented this movie by Netflix, I thought I'd get the 1972 version. I sat wisely looking at this new version, thinking: Gee, production values ​​were remarkable! I was convinced that the soundtrack was a little 70s. I was still convinced that it was a 70's film when it happened to me (almost every five seconds) that one thing between Gene and Finney was intense hugging, charged foam, a passionate kiss. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, although John Knowles himself has shown that this is not a homosexual relationship, it is painfully clear that yes, that's exactly what it was. If people of the same sex (usually adolescents) have "intense" friendships, this means that those longing for love, unity, desire to express themselves sexually remain. These guys had to contact, but they were never allowed. <br /> <br /> Despite Toby Moore's moody performance, I never felt that any emotion was real. I've never been involved with any boy because their relationship wasn't really honest. <br /> <br /> People want to live in fantasy and think it happened in the 1940s when these guys couldn't have had sexual feelings against each other. But I say they did - at least in the book they did, and in this movie, almost everything was painful to Finney. The "intensity" that John Knowles existed between them was the closet homosexuality, the hero worship, the idolatry - which would be expressed in a sexual manner under normal circumstances. Even if these guys repressed it, he would have had to be crystal clear, but this movie is not really a hint. Finally, it is an incredibly bizarre moment when Finney interrupted walking, playing all the other boys during the ball game. If they weren't just cluster nuts, they would know they can't throw their body at him. Obviously, this breakthrough of the bone was lost both by the director and the manufacturer.
