Let's be right in the heart ... It's a terrible movie. The story is confusing, supportive cast is ridiculous and the leading actors look like they were forced into it. The story asks us to believe that there is an underground lesbian sex culture where their psychiatrist murders members who just happen to be transvestite. Ellen Barkin is investigating crimes and developing Peta Wilson, whose work seems to be a cult recruiter. Sexual scenes are equivalent to bad porn and when Barkin and Wilson can, Poor Ellen looks like he is hurt. Barkin's talent has been completely wasted in this class B disability, and I hope he gave his agent a pink slip after the film landed.
