I was on a mission to watch Uwe Boll's movies to see if they were really as bad as everyone. The first thing I saw BloodRayne wasn't a complete loss. I liked it more than most people and rated it from 4 out of 10. Next was the first dead movie house. Now it was terribly bad. I can stand for ten minutes and go fast and that was the case. I saw where it went and I didn't have to see it anymore to evaluate it from just ten. <br /> <br /> But I also had access to the sequel (but not Uwe Boll, but mysteriously the same guys who wrote so unlikely to write the first one), and because he got a higher rating than IMDb, I thought I'd give him a chance. And I managed to see it all. It started with some funny references and cool lines (as the president got his instructions from the vice president!) And acting is a light year better than the first. Here's a lot of cool, like the very hot Emmanuelle Vaugier, whose coolness is Carrie-Anne Moss, Claudia Black and Evangeline Lilly. Man, I hope some Matrix-style movie will come to him sometimes. And always a pleasant, super-aerobic Victoria Pratt. I love sporty women. And there was also Nadine Velazquez (Catalina "My Name is Earl"), who performed quite well. <br /> <br /> There wasn't much about the story, and it wasn't great, and the end was disappointing because they couldn't succeed in their mission. Well, at least two networks survived. I think this is also a small victory. <br /> <br /> A good but pretty bad movie. The participants make it traceable, but there is no real substance there. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
