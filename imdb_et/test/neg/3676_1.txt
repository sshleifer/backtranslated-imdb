This movie is complete. I love Val Kilmer and this year I was very surprised by the "good movie". The entire DVD box is misleading. Val Kilmer is one of the main people of this movie during billing for about 2 minutes. Even the summary on the back of the DVD is not quite right. It could have been a good movie, but the direction was terrible and the plot was about as thin as a piece of paper. Usually, if the movie is terrible, you can sit back and laugh. However, this movie is so bad and boring that I started to sleep on it (which I never did during the movie). OUT OF ALL EXPENSES!
