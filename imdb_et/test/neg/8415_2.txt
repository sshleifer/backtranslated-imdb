I was hoping that cellulose would be an interesting film but was deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> Paper pulp has very few features and is never in your interest. It was a real victory to continue watching it. If you say to yourself, "is it?!?". This is where you think after looking at it - why did they ever work hard? <br /> <br /> Too bad because Michael Caine is a good actor. I also hoped to see this great Lizabeth Scott, but she only appears on the screen for one minute. Scott is one of the greatest films of all time, noir femme fatale girls, and it was his last film. <br /> <br /> Well ...
