First of all, let me say that I am not someone who usually films when I think of watching movies, for example, I love Tarkowski movies, Berghman is also a favorite ..... but that? Positive points can be easily summed up: photography is great and music is perfect .... does it make a good movie? I thought so, but this is a great example of what (for me) doesn't do it .... maybe because I'm too stupid? possible, but I don't think so .... For example, Tarkwosky used very long shots, but what he never did depicted exactly the same picture of two people on foot for 5 minutes (and I mean only their heads, because this movie is a lot of these frames, but sometimes it is effective), the overall result is probably boring, even with intelligent subtypes (which are done so that although intelligent are above all very pedantic) <br /> <br /> You always feel that the director is doing some long shots not for aesthetic or symbolic effect, but just for budget saving .... <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed in this movie because I really liked the first 30 minutes or so, but it went on and on without it would be the same as in the first scene .... <br /> <br /> very commendable comments on this page, I also feel that some people are trying to see much more in the movie than it is ... if the movie is slow and smart, it is not needed k arily means it is very deep .... yes, this is an allegory of music theory placed in a small town context that is quite interesting, but it doesn't make a deep movie .... except people who absolutely want something to do intellectual masturbation, but then this is not what you find in the movie, but what do you find about yourself .... an exercise that I think can be viewed much more effectively. Stalker "or" Solyaris "as the Werckmeister Harmonies, which owes much to Tarkowski, but the cab is not equal to that level.
