Almost everyone in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take Mike Myers, for example. He has reached a point where you realize that his shtick hasn't changed since his SNL day, over a decade ago. He makes the same cutesy consciousness streams and the same voices. His cat is painfully wrong. He's trying hard. He's a little A-comedian, not the cool cat he's supposed to be. The rest of the movie is just as bad. Sets are incredibly ugly --- and clearly thousands of dollars. (Background cardboard cutouts would have been more meaningful than building a whole neighborhood and a main street.) Alec Balwin is trying to make a funny impression of Grand Santini, but he is looking and sounds insecure. There's even an inappropriate cheesecake moment for the faux celebrity Paris Hilton --- which sticks to the mind just because it should be Dr. Seuss's story. Avoid this movie at all costs, people. It's not even an interesting train wreck. (I hope they will do Horton Hears with Robin Williams. Then we have a bad Seuss movie-headed spasikomedia trilogy.)
