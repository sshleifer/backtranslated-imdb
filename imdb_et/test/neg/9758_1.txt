When I watched this movie, I felt that my bag closed slowly in my head. The action was terribly hot and it was a bad operation. The most brilliant act of the whole film was the man who had to play out-in-a-a-coffin. I felt something but relief when it was finally. I was expecting this film to be a true tragedy with a deep psychological intrigue after that. All this was stupid, no start, no culmination, no end, just rambling and forward, and the plastic bag deepened. Let's be real here. It's a terrible movie.
