What a disappointment. The story is so simple - "good guys sometimes do bad things and sometimes bad guys do good things" - dressed in a racial sense that it looks smart, complex and meaningful. This is not. It has no nuance. <br /> <br /> All that happens is a telegraph, and then it went again if you didn't answer the explanation. <br /> <br /> To convince and move the audience for such a movie, there must be ambiguity and motivation and action on the characters; not just present it as a series of 180-degree changes in the action of each character. <br /> <br /> One and a half times I wanted to waste more time on it, but I thought I'd stay with it if it improved; a big mistake I had to stop then - it just got worse.
