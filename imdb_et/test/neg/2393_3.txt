Oddball is a black-comedy romance that contains a great lie and less than a star script. Brenda Blethyn ("Lovely and Amazing") is the title "Betty", a woman who is trapped in a marriage with a man who probably interacts with her beautiful, blonde secretary. Guess who plays this little role, yes! Naomi Watts ("Mulholland Drive") must start this project before his superstar status was secured by the blocking game "Ring". <br /> Molina ("Frida") is an old-fashioned entrepreneur who suddenly decides to reveal his wishes for "Betty" that has been around for decades. Perhaps Miramax hopes that Molina's move in the upcoming "Spider-Man 2" may be of interest to the small trinkets that come on the DVD shelf. <br /> <br /> But the award for the sharpest gratitude results goes to Christopher Walken ("Catch Me if You Can"), who goes to a Vegas-based funeral as a modern entrepreneur in a small province town. His character must have a parachute to the village because he has no reason for this script. <br /> <br /> This means that if you want to see some of the top participants in some low-cost humor then that's for you, and if it's not your way, try renting Harold and Maude, the ultimate funeral movie which is still funny.
