When I first saw this DVD on a three dollar binary, I couldn't really believe my happiness: Christmas card Tori Spelling, William Shatner and Gary Coleman? Needless to say, I immediately grabbed it and considered it a valuable investment. <br /> <br /> The film itself was as bad as any movie you wanted to combine with Christmas and the three "celebrities" mentioned above. The dialogue was uneven, the characters were one-dimensional, and Caroli's character was absolutely unbelievable. The film itself was a lifeless boredom that refused to stop and made me use as a human being when the end finally came. <br /> <br /> My advice: Don't watch this movie if you don't have to watch this movie and just under the influence of some serious holiday eggs.
