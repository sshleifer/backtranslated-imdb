Aksar is a terrible movie. Script, story, actors are all just ridiculous. Dino Morea plays a man who pays Emran Hashmi to attract his wife. Yes, it's as ridiculous as it sounds. Both Morea and Hashmi offer incredible and surprisingly bad behavior. Udita Goswami plays an aggressive, capricious and angry woman. He has a good look, but he has a zero factor. The film has one hit song called "Jhalak Diklaja", compiled and sung by Himesh Reshammiya. I couldn't figure out this song because I didn't find it very good, though it's memorable. The film should be a thriller, but it looks like a comic, thanks to the terrible direction and writing. Avoid this cheap at any price.
