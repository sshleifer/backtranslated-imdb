I'm in no way terrible when I say that this movie was worse than any other film ever made. Worse than "Batman & Robin". Worse than "Manos, Fate". Seriously, it's so bad. When people tell me that the movie is terrible, I use "Two Girls". If the movie is comparable to "two girls" then I will not look at it. If it is twice as good, maybe I'll look at it, but just laugh at the retarders who pay someone to do it because the film is twice as good as it would be in the garbage.
