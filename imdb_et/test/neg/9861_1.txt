What Game Over: Kasparov and Machine are not best at capturing Garry Kasparov's psyche during the IBM Deep Blue Competition in 1997. You see him getting more and more paranoid and becoming more widespread, as the second game made Deep Blue a movement that seemed too humane when he thought it was on the computer. Kasparov thought then and still that IBM was deceiving. <br /> <br /> Game Over is trying to appear impartial, but it is clear that the director thinks IBM was deceiving. However, they do not provide evidence to support the cheating requirement, but that IBM's security around the computer room was because IBM had really hidden big masters out there, some of the key computers, and Kasparov's claim that the computer didn't play like a computer usually in two above. In two games, Kasparov played a game designed to trick a computer, trying to sacrifice a pawn in a situation where previous computer container programs would have taken a pawn, resulting in possible computer loss. Deep Blue didn't take the lead, and Kasparov seemed to suffer a certain amount of confusion and he didn't seem to think that he was playing Deep Blue. This game looked at him so much that he couldn't recover, and after playing games 3.4 and 5, the game lost 6 terribly. <br /> <br /> The question of whether IBM cheated on this single movement in two games where Deep Blue made a move that every person would do, but that was until then displaced computers. Joel Benjamin, chess master of IBM's programming team, explained in a documentary film that they know that chess computers always got rid of this situation, and so they spent a lot of time and effort programming Deep Blue so that it doesn't make the mistake of making other computers. If you think Benjamin's claim is clear then IBM will not cheat. Unfortunately, the director quickly led and never mentioned IBM's explanation of the rest of the film, preferring to cut the 19th century chocolate game, the Turkish and Deep Blue shots, suggesting that Deep Blue was really controlled by man. As a person who understands programming, IBM's explanation is quite reasonable - if you knew what you were doing, there would be nothing difficult to enter into the code so that if so and the conditions are met, then do so - in other words, tell the computer what to do if the situation like in the game created by Kasparov 2 has ever happened. It's not cheating, it does a good job of programming a chess kit. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is quite clear that the director thinks that IBM was deceiving and repeated comments about the 15% increase in IBM stocks on the day that Deep Blue won, it is thought that IBM will cheat on its share price (Kasparov even compares IBM and IBM). Deep Blue with Enron). However, there is a lot of external opinion in both shock and information technology communities that Deep Blue won a fair and square and lost Kasparov because he just didn't get "machine machines" from the perspective of his computers. with a machine that didn't seem so stupid. I just wish the director had given us an alternative opinion. <br /> <br />
