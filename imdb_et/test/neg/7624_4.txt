After succeeding in a nightmare on Elm Street in 1984, director Wes Craven decided for some reason that his next project was this TV movie. I'm not a big fan of this director as a whole; Early Exploitation Flick The last house on the left and his modern creator, Scream, sit well with me, but the rest of his work is very hit and I don't hesitate to captain him that others have tagged him. The main issue here is cryogenic freezing, although it is rather a plot jumping board than an essential part of the film. The main influence here is probably the magnificent zombie film Deathdream of 1974 and we focus on Miles Creighton; a businessman who has been frozen for ten years before the accident, which means he has to thaw immediately. Miles is part of a sick people project; they pay to freeze them in the hope that they will recover in the future when their illnesses can heal. Miles has been successfully revived and is considered a miracle ... but the person who wakes up is not the one who was frozen, as Miles returns without breath. <br /> <br /> This movie could actually be pretty decent, based on the idea behind it, but we are given a plot that is not really there and what to say is that Craven doesn't do the best of the film's potential. The "soul" is the main point of contact, but it seems that getting soulless and simply murderous will / compassion is the same thing that seems a bit sleepy. The film was made for television, so it is not particularly disgusting and it is obvious that it was not spent a lot of money because the whole production seems very cheap. Michael Beck has never become a very popular actor and it is not surprising when he decides to perform here; if he is satisfactory, he will not have much charisma and will not be central. The plot does not flow too badly, but there is a real lack of temporary and / or tension, and things are slowing too often, so the film is sometimes quite boring. It all shrinks to the predictable end. In general, I have to admit that this film wasn't at all impressive, and when Craven's filmography goes, Chiller should go with Shocker, the Scream effects and The Hills Have Eyes II.
