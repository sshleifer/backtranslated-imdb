The films about everyday life are most interesting to me from all films, in the hands of the artist who is watching all the little details of everyday life. French cinema often seems to be very good in such a case, and I love French cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie was everyday. It didn't have a lot of land. It was just the characters who lived in the city, very normal people and things just happened. But it wasn't a very interesting thing and it wasn't very insightfully looked at. The film was trying a little mood, but it wasn't a very exciting mood. And even though I can't think much about the film, it was wrong to do anything right on almost every level. <br /> <br /> There were many characters in this movie. Many of them were similar, so it was difficult to understand who was and what their relationship was. I don't mind understanding the movie or even watching a particularly difficult movie more than once to find out the details, but it was an understandable solution that isn't worth it for me. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can really say about this movie is that the cinema was pleasant - functional, not brilliant, but pleasant. The camera often hit some nice postcard-type shots. But it rarely found very interesting small details. <br /> <br /> So far, I have seen a handful of not-so-good movies at Seattle International Film Festival, but it was the only one who didn't get all the applause when rolling credit. I felt a great collective relief when the film was finally over. But I think there are probably some people who would like it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
