Awful, terrible, terrible times a hundred more are not going to describe how crappy "Biggest Loser" is. Take this picture: take two fat pairs that have nothing interesting to say, lower them and let them work for weight loss, all on first-rate television. Am I the only one who thinks this is not something people with a three-digit area want to watch? Everything pulls forever, because the lard pieces are how weight loss means so much and their lives and their lives. Does anyone care? Do they think we care? Do they care when we care? Probably not. I think I'll save myself by breaking it and selling it to some major television company. If it goes on television, then my training will be done!
