One might think that the writers of the incredible backgrounds of World War II Stalingrad would write a script. No. There's no story here! It's like porn, violent vignettes interrupted by pathetic, rotting and meaningless dialogue. <br /> <br /> One set of Germans are driving around shooting and shooting. Slowly, there are fewer Germans to march, shoot and shoot. Then the Germans don't have to move around, shoot and shoot. <br /> <br /> Pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Chilcoot
