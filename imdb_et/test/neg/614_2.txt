hey .... i really don't know why this movie is rated so much, maybe i missed the point. How I see it, many international filmmakers have made great movies that have dealt with "schizophrenia" and are informed, excited, shocked, aroused emotions, and forced the audience to go away from their reality and think ......... though it is true that the pursuit of the machine so far was ambitious, considering all the other films, it is short ..... unhappy ...... it was too slow, there was no details about anything and the end ... was completely ... pointless ... ... open ended or something .... just pointless ..... to see if you want to see a good concept that's completely wasted .......
