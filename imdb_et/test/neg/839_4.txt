There is a lot of money behind this production, so its appearance is very good. It contains some interesting performances by Gilbert Roland, Eddie Burns and a short hearing at the beginning by Christopher Lee. There are some exciting winning attacks, and a humorous bit or two - Dyjago satire, the name without name and Sabata is fun, especially when given the names of the failed President of the Mexican Revolution. The problem is that in the west of the spaghetti there is no purpose, as tried here. The main element of spaghetti is IRON, which easily mixes with comedy; in fact, the source of all Spaghetti is Kurosawa Yojimbo, which is widely recognized as the great black comedy of all time, and most Spaghetti easily slips over the true comedy of very complex diversity. Perhaps this is the best proof of Trinity films, which are both publicly spaghetti and openly comedy. So why worry about a genre that by its nature satirates itself? As a result, I found the whole company not convincing. None of these characters were people I would ever care about, the story was largely cliché, and the production values ​​only reflected the money involved, not the director's passion. First of all, it is a banal and pointless attempt to get into this phenomenon.
