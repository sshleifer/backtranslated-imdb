I am a fan of Jess Franco's strange style and lover of even his trashier films, and my personal opinion is that he has created some masterpieces in addition to several very fun films, such as the brilliant "Paroxismus" or "Venus For example, in 1969. However, it is an indisputable fact that the 180+ films that this very prolific filmmaker has directed to his career also include a number of great epochs. "Sadomania" 1981 is definitely one of those stinkers, but it is totally bad and draws less film that can bring hell out despite the constant and nudity. <br /> <br /> Of course, constant nudity keeps you entertained for 20 minutes, but since it continues and it is likely to be boring after a short while. The only thing that really watched me was what was intensity that is kindly spoken, a little fun. <br /> <br /> After a couple of newborns disappear in the desert on some islands, they will stop it. i, the local prison camp guards. Although the spouse is excluded from the island, the woman is taken to a prison camp, a court for torture and sexual humiliation, ruled by the magic Magda, and an extremely perverse governor. Of course, prisoners are completely hot chicks, most of them are blond, guards are completely topless women who carry rifles. </p> who looks at it for a good plot. The (only) interesting thing about "Sadomania" is the high level of exploitation even in the "Women Prison" films. There are probably two short scenes in the movie, where we see a woman who actually carries her head, sleaze contains all sorts of sexual perverted rape and goodness, and some torture scenes are really disgusting. It is amazing that this extreme level of film can still be so boring. Sleaze keeps you at the start of the viewing, but after the first 45 minutes I was really hard not to fall asleep. It also makes me wonder why Jess Franco chose all pornstars, Ajita Wilson, who, according to most sources, was a transsexual born male (perhaps for this reason). If you really want to look at it, make sure you have enough beer at home to sit through it and watch it just for slipping and exploiting (and maybe a light inadvertent fun factor). Don't wait to be very entertaining, but it is almost incredible how such a high-quality film can be so boring. I'm a fan of Jess Franco and I'm always, but "Sadomania" is just bad. 2/10
