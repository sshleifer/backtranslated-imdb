I don't understand why people praise this movie. I didn't like it at all. I look at it with several people. None of them took care of it either. First of all. It's just clear that another low-budget studio is trying to get into a big name story. Real filming looks like a TV interview. Makeup is bad. When watching a movie with DVD accessories. You will see that the people involved in it are a lot of enthusiasm. There is no talent. There are facts that appear in the book. The facts are distorted by the comedy and the skits attached to it. I have read several books and have followed several exhibitions about this story. What I have always adhered to from this material is that it was a serious horror story. I really want someone to really make a good movie. It's always fascinated me. Bad action is a story broken. The situation of the little boys drew even more. Watching this movie. A little boy and his problem are the things that you and your friends remember and laugh at. There was no point in why his brothers smiled at what happened to him. It was like a witch had to be so threatening, but it was OK to throw her brother. This is an enchanting story of him and his little problem. I still can't tell a little girl saying, "Mom said the teeth are going to rub teeth." Frank Fox's statement and facial expression are so bad. The terrain with him where the food was with him is pretty stupid. The sound of its parts seems to be the psycho of the movie. Also, a girl lying on the bed and her little "bladder control problem" comes from The Exorcist. This film lacks the talents of creativity. We put the film for a few minutes and we knew right away that it was a scorer. I also noticed that their shortcomings were in film quality. Its parts looked like what a person can shoot on a home video camera. I noticed that many credit people had many different jobs. This is probably the movie put together. Someone said I like this story. I get all my friends and filmed with a camcorder and a computer. It doesn't matter if we don't know how to act. As long as we get this movie and say it's good. We got the family together and prepared the food. Then he sat down and looked at this failed attempt to make a movie.
