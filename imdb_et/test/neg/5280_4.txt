Stupid horror movie about five 20 somethings (3 guys, 2 girls) going to this place in the middle of nowhere. What they don't know is Dr. Chopper and his female assistants who are attacking and killing someone in their own forest. They use their parts of the body to do some tests ... or something. Also, five college girls and two lesbians are thrown away to kill them and show some cracking. <br /> <br /> Pretty desperate. The story is confusing and boring; Gore is ridiculously fake; Dr. Chopper and his assistants move with TERRIBLY; Here is a terrible black "humor" and people just stand when their friends are attacked or just stand there and let people kill them. <br /> <br /> It was quite offensive. There are some advantages. The twist of hours was pretty good and five young actresses are really good! Chase Hoyt is great as Reese; Butch Hansen is OK as Jimmy; Ashley McCarthy is also good when Tamara and Robert Adamson have their moments in Nicholas. Chesley Crisp is best than Jessica - she was great! Some of these five dramatic scenes were well-functioning and interesting. Unfortunately, the dialogue did not really exist for them. I'll give her my performances for 4, but here's nothing worth mentioning. Hopefully, these actors will be worth them.
