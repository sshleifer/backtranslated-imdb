All rave reviews could not be expected to see this show. We love unpleasant humor and creative material, especially from Australia and New Zealand. <br /> <br /> I admit that this may not be a fair view because we only saw the first 15 minutes. But we just couldn't handle it anymore - it was definitely the most boring and painful 15 minutes we've ever seen watching TV - it seemed like 15 hours. Songs can be interesting (but light) about themselves, but with a 3-minute interval, which is a story that just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> We are now trying to delete the memory. If you want a nice strange humor in a pleasant and interesting movie, check out "Dishes" instead.
