This movie was released in the UK called Blood Rites. It was directly banned and was never published again. <br /> <br /> Like The Ghastly Ones, it was said to be the gruesome hungry denizens of the New York's famous 42nd Grindhouse chain. If you are looking for some kind of horrendous horror, you will find it in this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, you'll see Colin (Hal Borske) living with developmental trees off the living rabbit, you have to try a dirty 16mm camera job that makes Ed Wood very positive. <br /> <br /> Three sisters spend three days in the household with their spouses before paying the old man's money. Of course, people in this situation will begin to die. Family secrets have come into contact and a lot of blood flows, especially during harsh breaks. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the rabbit that the British have been challenging, I know I did.
