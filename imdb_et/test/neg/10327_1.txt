This movie is so bad that I have wasted so much time as I am already talking about. Got bad ... really ... ... BAD ... and I'm not even so critical ... .. I'm almost ashamed to admit that I've seen it ... Sandra for a few minutes will show you how far she is really did ... I really mean something beside it is really worth the Oscar for him ... I guess the only way he can see it is not in any way ... I think he had to start somewhere. .. but really ... so bad ... ... terrible really ... bad is a word too good for this word ... but I don't want to understand now ... but how you can't get after 90 minutes wasted ... 90 minutes of my life that I never get back ... 90 minutes if I could have done something better ... like sitting in my back and staring into space that would have been a better time ... (walks out of shaking away)
