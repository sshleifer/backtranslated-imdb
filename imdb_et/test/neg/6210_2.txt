Frankly, I have to admit that I go and see some stupid movies based on the leap they created or are currently creating. This stupid Salman Khan & Govinda feature is one of those stupid movies. Okay, now we've all seen Hitch starring Will Smith as a date doctor who is trying to help odd people find the truth. Then why should we see Salman Khan again? There's a $ 64,000 question.
