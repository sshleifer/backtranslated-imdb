nothing funny, interesting or relevant about this movie. besides the two characters that end together, nothing has ever been solved and there is no plot. and by the way, what is the actual DVD cover? this is a short daisy duke shorts ... where was this scene in the movie? No one ever carried Daisy Duke in this movie! Surprisingly, almost all the good and jack black players in this movie are playing a complete song (this may be a steadfast story ... don't know) ... these are the only redeeming values. in general it is just a waste of time.
