It's really the worst movie I've ever seen. For a while I used to watch harsh movies, including Battlefield Earth, Delta Force Commando and Starship. All these films are cinematic gems compared to Ironheart. <br /> <br /> There is not much point in making this junk summary; I think this is a more useful summary of your reaction to the movie, which is: I get furiously angry and I want to cut the tape tape from the VCR and then (about) 80 minutes to play. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this movie a 0, but IMDb won't let one movie down 1. I give him 0 a good idea that I say every movie with any score above 0 is endless ( indefinitely) many times better than this - it's really so bad.
