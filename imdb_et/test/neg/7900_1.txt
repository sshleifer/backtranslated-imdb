This movie was just terrible. How would someone really like to watch a movie and those who liked it for a long time in the mirror and ask themselves whether stereotypes are bad. Ignoring the face of racial stereotypes was just terrible. It never had its moments when it respected the 1980s, "Airplane!" Awful acting, terrible script writing even in the movie Mo'Nique or Tom Arnold. The film was bad from the start, but people could see the whole thing, thinking the plane was falling. One of the worst movies ever, stay away.
