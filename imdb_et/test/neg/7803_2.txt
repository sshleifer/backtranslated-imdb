Patsy Kensit and some random Australian blacksmiths who are in the midst of an investigation into the series of murders, but who still can't find the time to shoot minors and suspect a new man who is an adulterer. The serum killer is suddenly no longer important when it is found that a woman's supposed lover (who is basically only her companion) and a male policeman becomes the main suspect. "Tunnel Vision" is a really boring, incredible and relaxed Aussie thriller that will probably imitate popular sex games like "Fatal Attraction", "Disclosure" and "Basic Instinct". The characters are extremely one-dimensional and the script is widely described by every good-police / bad police clich√©. Police women plaguing the position of men in full body, shoot-first ask-questions-later mentality, alcohol problems with stress, etc etc? Even the unhealthy eating habits of the police are a current gag. Yawn! Kensit really does his best to make this film more tolerable, but he lacks the credibility and talent of a true cinema hero. The final twist is more or less interesting (not at all original, in mind), but by that time you have finished taking care of the characters for a long time. The scenes shot inside the sex clubs look ridiculously counterfeit and the control of Clive Fleury is totally unbeaten. What is the waste of time?
