I'm in two ways, following Christopher Nolan's film debut. Some of me admire that it costs $ 6,000, but some hate it as an art house. In many cases, it reminds me of the cult film PI, a movie I didn't want, and I can't get my head around the head of a person who wants to be a writer with the following people. Isn't it logical if someone wants to be a writer sitting in front of the keyboard and writing? <br /> <br /> Well, I think it gives Indie filmmakers the hope that just because they didn't make a budget movie worth $ 6,000, over two thousand IMDB members will vote for it and over fifty members will comment on it but you have to think about whether this film would be so well appreciated if it wasn't done by Memento's director?
