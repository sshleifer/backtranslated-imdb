This movie made me think ... how could I write about it without the personal distribution of the director and all the actors who in Australia are proud to actually get out there and make a movie. > <br /> But the movie itself? Let me tell you the story .... <br /> <br /> Yesterday I found a DVD in my local rental center and I had some vague memories here when I released the cinema, so I thought I'd give it this for some reason. 'Before I looked at the real movie, not something I usually do. Turned 'making' halfway because I would be nervous enough if we were not so wonderful to put together such a hard-hit movie with this raw script attitude. <br /> <br /> Movie? Ugh. Perfect clich√©s and pathetic character development. Actors? Well done guys, you're Aussies and I commend you. And, as the football team is just as good as the trainer leading them, unfortunately you didn't have a great script to work with. <br /> <br /> I felt that the movie really trivialized so many topics that it seemed to want to cover. I've seen many comments here that point to something other than soap. Finally (and forgive me if I do not express it correctly), I was extremely disappointed that there were no optimistic records at all. Yes, we all know that life is full of hard stuff, and yes, we know things like Incas do, but I really find it hard to praise a movie that doesn't have a single joy. I believe the director has a duty to put it in SOMEWHERE. Otherwise, the film is all about them and their feelings, they have created it for themselves, not for the audience. <br /> <br /> What I think is why this movie is not that big. The specialty mentions that the director wrote the script in a 36-hour session, the day he himself tried to end his life. Well, it may be cathartic for him, but the film is self-evident if you know behind the story why it was written. "I feel scared, I'm writing about the fear of the movie." (Note: I have read an interview with Andrew Urban and understood why Thalluri should write something to help him solve his own problems, but I believe that the film has a line that cannot be overcome - the film's line of emotional needs, and I feel that is what happened inadvertently here). <br /> <br /> With his own promise, the director had no technical experience at all, and unfortunately it does nothing more than twelve media projects for a year. <br /> <br /> Any suggestions that this film should learn at school or that all teenagers should follow - are not sure about it. Because in the end there is a very dangerous line. I have also been in a place where I thought that someone who no longer needs to "see life" is "happy", but as an adult, I worry that this line may affect the viewer in a vulnerable youth. mood. Maybe be there to promote the debate, but again it reflects a chance of a story or joy in this story as a whole. In fact, it almost shows that there is more sadness. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen Elephant, but I can easily find it because there are all the comparisons here. <br /> <br /> Any personal guys here, I hope you can make another movie, and we all have to start somewhere, so forgive me if I'm too harsh. I am glad you are proud of what you have created, which is what life is. However, this is not a film I would like to have. <br /> <br /> But the whole "Silent you have to look at" - we already know it.
