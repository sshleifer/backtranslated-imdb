The worst movie I've ever seen! 90 An exciting movie making protocol. All the ingredients make this movie a real CRAP work. Bad behavior, bad leadership, bad storytelling, bad makeup, bad dialogue, bad effects and bad reasoning behind actions taken by certain characters. Also, this terrible blonde, and the stupid fool that was a foolish Asian girl, threw, and both attempts were just scary because these girls are ugly. Some good horror movies came out of the 80s, but it can never be considered one of them. Kevin Tenney also devoted one of the greatest sins of narration: he introduced signs (old man and old woman) at the end of the film. I would vote for it in more than 10, but the voting system probably did not work. Directly from the title I knew it was sucking and I returned my DVD, but Best Buy does not return DVDs or consumer goods when they call it, or so says my receipt. I have "The Dunwich Horror" and it was really godly, but I still feel that "The Night of the Demons" (evident Evil Dead RIP-OFF) was much worse than "Dunwich Horror". It's like "The Howling", how in hell can descend from this anorexic cow ??? Save your money and get "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (just don't get any of your sequences) or "The Evil Dead" or "Dawn of the Dead". "Demon Night" is a very, very bad investment. Each of them was just a crazy, tormenting pain for the audience because the whole movie was terrible everywhere! Do yourself a favor, DO NOT KNOW! You save some brain cells.
