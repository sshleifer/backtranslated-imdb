What is this!! it's so bad. Animation seems so terrible, it seems like a ps1-type game. Participants are terrible, they just can't save their lives. I sat through this movie and at the end I was annoyed when I realized I had wasted my life for 3 hours. I haven't heard of this movie, has it ever come out of the movie or did it go directly to the DVD? Girl Get Down?! What it is, it was just a stupid movie. They copied completely "Tomorrow tomorrow". It became one of the worst films I've ever seen. I would definitely recommend that people waste that time. You could spend your time watching "Tomorrow tomorrow", which is much better. Well that's what I mean by the movie. In fact, why am I writing my time, damn it! Its really annoying for me, its a waste of 3 hours and 10 minutes.
