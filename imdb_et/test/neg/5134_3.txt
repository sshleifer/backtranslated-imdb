OK, I don't want to disturb anyone who enjoyed this movie, but it was a really bad movie. Just as the scenes were edited and acted, it made them shine at some points. I really tried to enjoy it, but it was like a student film, they have to have the smallest budget. I really liked this story, and the characters were nice, but the movie as a whole was just terrible. Why is it that in almost every movie with lesbian characters one must commit suicide or death, or go straight?!?! It sends a false and unrealistic message. I gave him 3 stars and everyone thought it was very kind to me. Watch this movie only if you want to laugh, how bad it is.
