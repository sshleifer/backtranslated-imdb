Low budget spam in Greece, led by Peter Cushing. It is up to the priest Donald Pleasance to stop them. Crown International released this mess in 1978 and was a "weekly dog" on one of Sneak's preview episodes with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. I forget which of the two "pulled" it, but I see the point. Crappy's film has the worst Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance performances I've ever seen. The video box is a monster. There's no such beast in the movie. Instead, you get the shape, but at least it is atometric right. (Woo hoo!) <br /> <br /> Cultures look like Klu Klux Klowns ... if a group could exist. Skip it.
