Wow. So my boyfriend and I went to the movie to rent a movie. I like stupid horror movies, so I browse the various terrible movies they had to offer when he went to look for Michael Moore 'Sicko'. So I found the worst of them (as I found out soon). It looked good on the cover and the description on the back seemed adequate. The fact that it was an overview of the IMDb bid proved that it would be good. So the next night we put it on a DVD player and after the first five minutes we were so incredibly confused. leave you asking for a bigger WTF? The plot has no unified story - except for the vague reference to the local myth of murder, but it only happens in the film in the last twenty minutes. So pretty much in the first hour if you have it: casual, confusing jump; inconsistent plot; parents who are not parents; bad behavior; bad dialogue; a boy who magically changes hair color; and a host of unpleasant symbols that will get you bored! <br /> <br /> The film moves so slowly that it is a chore to sit and watch there. I'd rather floor the restrooms, honestly. Don't worry about that.
