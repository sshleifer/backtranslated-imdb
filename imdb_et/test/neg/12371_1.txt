This is one of the ridiculously bad movies I've ever seen. I can't believe that who wrote the above review was serious. Maybe he was involved. It has nothing. There is no tension, action is terrible, direction hopeless. Music Score (?) There are three tricked ads that played the ad. Plot (?) All five minutes to write. Dialogue is what a decade would be when asked to do homework. The only (slightly) redeeming feature is the psycho-playing actor who grimaces, trembles and trembles perfectly, and is therefore sometimes fun. The only reason you would be on the edge of your seat would be if you have a weak bladder. Don't waste your time.
