.. but unfortunately no one thought that Van was killed to save this deadly production. The only positive thing about her movie is her nice singing voice ... too bad that songs are mostly uncomfortable and lovely. Why did I hate Van so much? Well, for the whole movie, he seemed to make a third price for Soupy Sales imitation - with lots of looting, bad jokes, and too much energy trying to make everyone laugh. The worst thing was when he "taught" the class - these kids laughed at everything he did. Heck, Van could have read the phonebook or show them autopsy photos and they would probably have laughed! Now, the only bad decisive decision in the Old Film was that it was just the most obvious. Of course, when John Gielgud (cute actor) plays Asia, it was ridiculous and Michael York played Peter Finch's brother! The bottom line is that because of their crazy election choices, the film was executed from the beginning ... and the worst was the godly Bobby Van. Now in his real life he has been a beautiful person and sad that in real life he died so young, but with the material he gave here I just wanted to hang out his tongue to get him quiet. > <br /> Now I also mentioned songs - egads, these terrible songs! Frank Capra's original LOST HORIZON was always a delight - no song and dance number in the movie. Why did they decide to add basillion songs that didn't help the movie? They only earned it seeming like a buggy mess - like the original DOCTOR DOOLITTLE with LOST HORIZON. The end result is a sickly childish movie - no one who can be enjoyed by anyone over. <br /> <br /> Now that you can remove these problems, you have a decent movie base. After all, the plot is beautiful and is still hidden under all the goo. Peter Finch is especially good (though certainly not equal to the original Ronald Colman). But given that the original was an almost perfect classic, why this sticky confectionery production interferes. Who wants to strip ?! By the way, this movie included Harry Medved in The 50 Worst Films. Though I didn't like the movie, it wasn't bad enough to be in the book. I think it was mainly because it was such a big box failure and it appeared a few years before the book appeared. Great book - just not one of the best choices in the "hall of consecration".
