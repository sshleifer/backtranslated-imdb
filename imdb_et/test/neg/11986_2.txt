I really liked the Far Cry game, nice graphics, good design, interesting and smart enemies that were over the medium length and even somewhat decent. I'm not against the spin-offs of game movies by default. I thought "DOOM Movie" was fun. But what Uwe Boll has done here is playing the game and changing every aspect of it and making them terrible (not length, just 90 minutes). The characters are even more stereotypical than the game, which is quite an achievement. The whole plot is spoken without twist or mystery. Several blatant ridiculous scenes tell you every story. And come to "genetically modified soldiers"? they could have come with a better name. <br /> <br /> But this movie should be awarded for the most idiotic love scene. I've never seen anything like that before. I couldn't believe they were trying to be serious "we have to get out of damp clothes" "I think I'm getting hypothermia" (although everyone wears T-shirts) "we have to deal with body heat" "Is that your weapon? "But ... but there were no people who knowingly did that? There must be a scriptwriter, director, actors, miner, electrician, some food guy! Why did someone jump into this scene to prevent this evil from happening? Did this film take place on destructive, inhuman, genetically modified films? I'm not going to talk about how many logical errors, inconsistencies, and script writing errors, but even a hard-pressed operating fan can't be anything but offensive. <br /> <br /> This movie really asked him to be rated 2 out of 10 so I'll do it. But it leaves me clear where the second letter comes from. Special Effects? Nah. Acting? Not quite. Links to the game? You wish. Wait! they used the game to fund the title and credit. It was clean. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a bad movie night, go to "2012 - Supernova", it's just sad.
