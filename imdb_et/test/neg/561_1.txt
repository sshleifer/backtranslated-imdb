The scenario is the worst part of this movie because it comes from one premise to another, losing all the important bits that would have made many different stories. (This movie is confusing because the audience doesn't know what the story is.) I had no problems with low productivity values ​​and it wasn't great, but it is a TV, so it was good. I don't mind if some scenes looked like they were made together. But having such a non-sensual scenario is totally unnecessary. Has any executive read it before withdrawing money? Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> The prologue was, in particular, so badly written that he had to fill in all the details left out. Prologue rushed, it was not clear what happened, ie. The Russian Revolution was reduced to "Some Unrest in St. Petersburg", with the next scene arresting these soldiers. I know the main history of the revolution so I can fill in the details, "these irritating communists." The prologue is best ignored. <br /> <br /> It could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who he is. This creates this precondition in the shelter. Then he may have difficulty identifying himself for the rest of the movie. No. The film assumes he is the one he says (although there is no empirical evidence yet). It creates a melodramatic romance, a love that is so strong that it believes in something it says. Okay, dirty romance. No, because it doesn't make sense. The interests of love seem like a mad (and, incidentally, sloppy) wild gesture. It does not work because the film foolishly decides the truth at the end of the monologue. They did not marry or return to America. Love story collapses. Despite the fact that we have a lot of love, I was never convinced that they were in love. I find the rom-com romance more convincing, even though there are only one or two scenes that confirm that they have even spent time with each other. <br /> <br /> It could have been a thriller-type thing where the film assumes he is the one he says he is, and he fights to prove his identity. No, the case is more concise than dealing. A strange voice comes back to fill the details of a better movie. <br /> <br /> The funniest thing to consider is what really happened. Anna Anderson was loony, who went to America and married another kind and they did crazy together. Throughout his life he had lunatic behavior. None of this is in the film either. The shelter has a really annoying character who grows out of nowhere and proclaims itself as "one flew over the next / twelve monkey type informant. Luckily it disappears if he hasn't brought anything."
