Ruggero Deodat is often recognized when he invented the Canal Holocaust Kannibal Sub-family in 1978. But director Umberto Lenzi, who is usually recognized as a Deodato attacker, led MAN DEEP RIVER 3 years earlier in 1972. Is this a worthwhile start for the genre? Well .... not really ..... <br /> <br /> The photographer accidentally kills a man with self-defense and, while returning to the jungle of the Asian country, he grabs a local tribe who keeps him imprisoned, forcing him to work as a slave and finally accept him when she marries her daughter's daughter. Throughout the film, I didn't feel like it was a horror movie. It reminded me of drama like MAN HORSE, which I liked better. Ivan Rassimov is pretty good at the photographer, but it is Me Me who is the main daughter who is memorable and great. I've always been a Me Me Broad fan because his breathtaking performance is at JUNGLE HOLOCAUST and he never gets any credit for his acting careers, because he's hardly speaking in his films. He is still very talented and charming. A lot of real animal distortion is one thing about DEEP RIVER, which can make it a horror film, but even one that doesn't work well. <br /> <br /> RIVER DEFINITION is good for those who want to see what started with the cannibal subfamily, but Deodato records and even Lenz's own later entries are easily hidden as a genre entry. Recommended only for graduates and Me Me Wide fans.
