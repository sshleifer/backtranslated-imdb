I should start by saying that I have a love-hate relationship with musicals. Some of them are fantastic, some are outrageous. So I expected the hair to belong to one of these categories. But it did not fall into the center instead. <br /> <br /> Songs are not brilliant, although the "Sodomy" song made me smile a lot and everything is dated. But the film does not pull me like others like Rocky Horror. Although this is a bad example, for years I hated Rocky Horror, maybe I got it and loved it ever since. Maybe the hair is the same. Although I doubt that it will get as much exposure as Rocky Horror because of content that contains language and nudity, I doubt I will get the chance to grow with me. Gettit? Hair .... grow ... oh fit yourself. <br /> <br /> In any case, I couldn't see a technical failure that was ashamed for the last fifteen minutes. has wished to see how it ended, especially after reading some comments here. <br /> <br /> Not a movie for a casual cinema visitor, but definitely for music lovers. I really hope they will not do it again because I think that such a transformation would end with a low, pale version of the original PC version. <br /> <br /> It is worth searching for a genre.
