Although Aeon Flux was somewhat fun and a little better to spend Wednesday night as a pub, I was happy to have bought one free ticket. knowing something about the movie when I went, I really didn't even know that before reading this site was an animated series, I was ready for something, and as some other viewers pointed out, the trailers were well filmed, good looking and the interesting cinema brought me in. I was frustrated halfway through the movie, it reminded me of the fifth element, but I also feel it was just lacking in depth and left me feeling empty. and a meaningless and slightly boring weapon fights when you intend to do it, do it with some style, not just with the explosions and the fall of inert defenders. personally, I would have seen a little more story and townspeople, or I learned more about how the chairman was undermined than another long and loud fight against weapons.
