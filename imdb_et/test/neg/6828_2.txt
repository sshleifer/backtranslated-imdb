"How many ppl does it know?" ... "We keep this!" I don't know if at least some new dialogues can be done or not? The film is a true copy of the original. Bruce Willis probably made this film when he was half asleep. How he looks at Richard Gere's face in the cold blood when they meet near the harbor ... oh my god! scared me of hell. Why he kills Major Koslova and his mates are not clear to me yet. The second thing I didn't understand was the poison solution he put on the car (what was it in the world?). <br /> <br /> The plot is haywire and the climax is boring. Another funny thing was how the Russian-language club was killed. I fell to laugh out of my chair when I saw this scene. Also, what was that gay boy ... what purpose was it. I think the movie is too fast to be easy to understand. You really have to think about what the devil thought of the director. LOL. <br /> <br /> The best scene was Richard Gere, who tried to keep two steps between fast-moving trains. must have lost one's head if not touching the pillar.
