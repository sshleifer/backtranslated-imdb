When I went to the video rental store to get the movie, I saw one and immediately thought it would be funny. The picture showed that it seems to be a classic type of comedy that involves teenagers (like a road trip) that I think would be worth. When I turned on, I was disappointed because the jokes were terrible and cheesy. The only bit the director thought would be funny if someone slipped wet on the floor. It is not a joke and does not make people laugh. I thought that turning off this movie was halfway. I was angry about this movie because it was just a waste of time and money. The film was not taken care of enough, not enough time and work. I found that the actor is also pretty bad. The only time I laughed was for extremely bad jokes or actions that weren't really funny !!! I appreciate this movie 1/10. I hope this comment is useful.
