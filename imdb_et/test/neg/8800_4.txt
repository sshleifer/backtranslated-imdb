"Man from Utah" opens with a singing merchant who praises the horse on the guitar. So we introduce John Weston (John Wayne) to the city and look for a job. When he helps Marshal Higgins (George Pre-Gabby Hayes) fix his bank robbery with his fiction, Marshal offers him secret work to investigate Dalton Valley Rodeo. Probably the winners of the rodeo's big prize money years are the band of intense bad boys at Spike Barton (Ed Peil), who also runs the rodeo commission. Serious wounders, who have the supremacy of Cheonne Kent (Yakima Canutt) in Barton's Upper Glory, were severely ill or dead. <br /> <br /> Even in those 1930s Lone Star Western had John Wayne a charismatic presence, suggesting the quality of future stars. If nothing else sees Wayne in the young movies, it's a real treat. The film itself clings fast at fifty-three minutes, much of which is in stock rodeo, bulldogging, and Indian parade and dance. In a decisive rodeo event, Weston avoids a disaster by detecting a poisoned needle inserted into a "dynamite" port, which was previously an unlimited bronze on which he holds over Cheyenne. The end is not surprising, as Barton's bad guys miss out on rodeo events and go for a thirty-thousand-dollar pot that has been deposited in a local bank. But Marshal and Weston are planning their plans for foil and Dalton Valley Rodeo Day. And as we saw earlier in movies such as "Neath the Arizona Skies" and "Randy Rides Alone", Wayne's character closes the movie in a nice young man's cluster, this time Judge's daughter Marjorie Carter (Polly Ann Young), who tried her all through the film.
