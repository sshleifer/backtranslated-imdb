"Death House 2: Dead Purpose" (2005) is a sequel, although you don't have to see the first dead house to get a movie. This means that the value of the output is definitely here, with a great zombie effect, and it is very well edited with a very effective design. But that means it's all good here. <br /> <br /> The story and script are terrible. . . there are bold plot holes everywhere. It is also funny how the soldiers do not mind when they get their blood (unlike 28 days later, when blood in some parts of the body infects you). It is also realistic how there are few orders with soldiers here, unlike the usual US military discipline. <br /> <br /> 4 out of ten.
