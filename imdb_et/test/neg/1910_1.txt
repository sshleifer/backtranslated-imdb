I was eager to see this movie, but when I finally had the opportunity, I was very disappointed. I had to stop halfway (or was it a quarter?) Due to bad script and management. Not to mention the poor! Josh Hartnett is the only one who can act, and he is a more suitable story as a hero. <br /> <br /> In principle, the story is almost loosely about a girl from a country that cheated her for a long time - a decent boy who has meaningless sex spoiled with rich breast. This film was not able to express my sympathy even when the writer wanted it. I don't know where the moral values ​​are going? <br /> <br /> Participants are so stiff that when I continue to film (a couple of weeks after it was a dull nature), they were still unable to pay attention. The spoiled couple gets me just nasty! What a movie! <br /> <br /> I think all the people involved in this production must sit down and look at them so that they don't make the same mistakes next time. And next time they may consider Josh Hartnet the main character.
