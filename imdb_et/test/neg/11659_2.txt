All I can do is the mood already expressed by some other commentators. This is the city of God meets happy. The ruthless cut-throat bipolarity (one minute ruthless killer, next minute Luv's hill) is absolutely convincing. You can approach it in two ways: (1) a sharp, realistic film became delicate; or (2) a delicate, ABC-afterschool special, which is contempt, violence, and animal cruelty. Either way, it just doesn't run, do it? Why is it so praised? As others have said, he gets a "conscience" from the West. Show us the images of poverty that are in contrast to our fluffy, double-width theater seats and 44-oz coke, and we praise the heart. But - oh - don't forget this candy, because the bitter pill of reality (which is very merciful) is hard for us to swallow. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed that this film will receive so many prizes and prizes, especially if there are many more worthy movies. All I can say is: refrain from movies that receive prizes (Hollywood Oscars = Sweeping, Syrups Trip. Cannes Film Festival = Beard Race, Artistic Propaganda). You need to work hard to find a real jewel.
