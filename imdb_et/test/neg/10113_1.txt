I don't even understand what they were trying to achieve with this movie. You got the guy running a bunch of cats because he's dead, but in order to be really dead, this girl must shoot them? And they leave the body, though normal people do not see them because they are dead? The script already has a Nebraska-sized hole, then the main character played by Susan Paterno, who drones her lines with a monotonous, boring voice and so little emotion in her face, that she could also mark a female terminator robot. It's totally terrible and I don't even understand how I managed to see this movie until the end. The end is as stupid as the whole movie's way of thinking, and absolutely no reward for the viewer, which is the way ever. They could also call this movie a "small movie that could choose ka-choo."
