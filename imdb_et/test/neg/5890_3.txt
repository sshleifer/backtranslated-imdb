I just saw this movie last night and after reading all the reviews I was expecting a good emotional sports film. What I got was something cliché and boring. Yes, I thought it was boring. I saw all the star got hurt long before the game. I thought maybe they were waiting for him to come together until you knew the game was "big", but I think the first game is good enough. <br /> <br /> Parental relationships were also very clichés, dominated by a drunken father (I say McGraw impressed me) and a boy who wants to stay and help his (heavy?) mother. <br /> <br /> I especially liked casual girls (Melissa and Maria) who were all in the 5-minute movie and just put a challenge on the football boys. I thought "ok, now how is this plot going?" Maybe I missed this point: "Well they play in a football city that loves it so that girls throw their feet". <br /> <br /> The sport event had some good points, but most of it was so busy! I think the first game lasted longer than the whole playoffs! And I was not so sure about the consistency of the final game closure clock. <br /> <br /> I think I saw the movie that won the best sports film ESPY when it was the only one released. Honestly, I found it to be a boring film full of people who have been maliciously obsessed with pigs. For a better football movie, see Remember Titans.
