Recently, I watched this movie on Sundance, and it kept me interesting from the beginning. However, it seems that he will take forever to where he wants to go and finally I was deceived. In short, Noble Willingham (Walker, Texas Ranger celebrity) plays the ship's salesman, who is starting to harass a man who claims to be his son. According to a mysterious caller, Willingham has a dark, dirty little secret that affects the son and has reminded him (son). I don't break anything with anyone, but I got three things about remembering this movie. One, the film has more bugs than Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino and Glengarry Glen Ross. 99% of this is from Willingham. It doesn't take long for me to wear four words continuously. Two, I just couldn't believe that someone would answer the phone many times, especially if you know the crank caller is on the other end of the line. No matter where Willingham is in the movie, be it at work, at home, in the canteen, etc., the phone always speaks and always responds to this "son" poison, and then hanging ONLY ON THE ANSWER, IF THE QUESTION CALLS BACK ON TEN SECONDS! How many of us would do that? Now I understand that we probably don't have a movie if it doesn't respond, but I just couldn't stop the belief in this particular issue. Three, and this is the least criticism, why is the director so "Corndog Man" (caller / son) showing? Most of the time he's just on the other side of the phone's red voice. I could have lived with other things in place, but because they weren't another to deal with it. I give the film credit for being a somewhat original idea and keeping my attention from the beginning, but that's it. See it once only. But if you're like me, you say "Triple K Marine!" after going to bed at night or two after you have followed it.
