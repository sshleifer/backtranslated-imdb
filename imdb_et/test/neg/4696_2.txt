Because of the summary of the IMDB plot, it's audibly like Noah Taylor's film, when the Fairuza Balk is central. It is incredible how such established actors could have been in such an amateur, meaningless, non-movie. The Balk breaks down with boyfriend Taylor, sleeps with the devil (I think - Dempsey plays) and accidentally kills Taylor - who follows him for the rest of the movie as a ghost. Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen.
