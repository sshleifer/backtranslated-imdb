Johnnie (Bert Wheeler) is a possible singer; Newton (Robert Woolsey) is a potential inventor. Both work in the cigar room in the lobby of the office building. Johnnie wants to sell the song to Winfield Lake, who is also the owner of the building. Lake Secretary Mary (Betty Grable) is Johnnie's sweetheart. When the lake becomes dead, the facts are that Mary and Newton think Johnnie is a killer. They talk again to get Mary going to prison. But who really shot? Who is a black widow, a blackmailer who threatened her? Other characters in the symbolic mystery of the murder are: The Suspicious Woman of the Lake, the Self-Satisfied Private Investigator, the seemingly slow caretaker (Willie Best), the Lake Auditor, the songwriter who thinks the lake steals her and the other who thinks everyone is stealing her. It is up to Newton and his truth machine to show the true killer. <br /> <br /> Babyer Wheeler and Cigar-Chomping Woolsey will beat me anyway, but they made several movies together in the 1930s. some of them were funny. <br /> <br /> Not that. George Stevens, who moved on to his career, drove this depressing comedy into a torturous mystery of murder. But the two scenes are good and both Wheeler and Betty Grable sing Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh's excellent "Music in my Heart". For the first time, they sing it up the stairs (after that, they dance back). Later, Wheeler and Woolsey are on the rocks to see and talk to Mary, who is in prison on a higher floor. Wheeler and Grable sing to each other through bars. <br /> <br /> "Nitwits" have little smiles, but the comedy level is best illustrated by the Woolsey line: "Sonny, you have a six-year-old boy, and I even bet he was glad to get rid of it." Has it watered Groucho? Who did not use redundant "even" when he said it.
