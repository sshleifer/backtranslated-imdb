I know ... I know it is difficult (if not paradoxical) that there is such a thing as "plausible" fantasy. But for me, there is also a situation where too many inconveniences are interfering with the general views of my film, or are pulling them away. The latter was for me with Goliath Awaits. Not only did I have too many unanswered questions about events, but some also acted, I thought it was a bit overwhelming. (Maybe it was writing: asking them to say too many trite, predictable, cloned (over) reactions.) Others have said enough about the plot. I just want it to happen - and I think it could have been more convincing. P. S.: This is a fresh comment about this movie - I finished it a few minutes ago. not commemoration years ago.
