From the very beginning, I liked this exhibition to every character except Reba himself. He comes out as a saint than your type and quite honestly a big bully. And it smells like it is in every scene and every episode. In later seasons, Van also becomes unlikely, like his former self-looting. and Kyra walks around and is unhappy. The first 3 to 4 seasons are pretty good when you forget about Reba. After all, it's pretty funny. Basically, every Barbara jean episode is silly, Reba means her, but bad Ole Barbara jean desperately desires that Reba likes her, resulting in Barabara jean telling her how fantastic she is for every episode . I think it is quite clear that Rebal has self-esteem issues and she wants her to be seen as the whole forgiving saint. It is also a shame, because there was such a potential other than his exhibition.
