I agreed to watch this movie with a group of friends, despite my extreme mind horror movies. But it wasn't a monster that turned off this movie for me, it was a terrible acting and completely nasty end. There is no redemptive qualities in the cave or the cave - it is badly done, ridiculously written, badly bloody and adding a free event to me. No, it's not because of my horrible movies that make me hate this movie - I saw such wonderful teen horrors as "House of Wax", that is, the film leaves you with a terrible idea that by renting a video, you support the creators inside
