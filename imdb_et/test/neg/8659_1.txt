this is the worst film I've ever seen and that betrayed me the most that it is a jams raj movie, so first, when you see a promo you think so, it is definitely another mess of the belief. The frustration story is stupid and stupid what we have seen that boy is about to get married and falls in love with a girl blah blah blah. if you see this pathetic movie don't go with your family, there's too much exposure and kiss. I don't even see why you look at it yourself. In general, this disgraceful nasty and something else that is bad and starts with the d-movie doesn't see you seeing hatred in Yash Ji and Yash Raj movies
