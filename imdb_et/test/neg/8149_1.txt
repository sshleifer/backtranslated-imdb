With a little respect it deserves, I would like to say that this movie was terrible. The filmmakers had good intentions, but the overall quality of the direction and value of the production was obviously lacking. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good hard smile and then wastes another two hours of their life, which is a truly painful experience. I'm surprised to find this movie on the $ 1 DVD where it was nicely placed. I thought maybe it was good and I could detect some amazing independent movies - I was wrong. I wish I never saw this movie. My 3-year-old cousin could not make the inferior movie. I'm glad to see the movie because I can finally tell people I've seen the worst movie ever made and be sure.
