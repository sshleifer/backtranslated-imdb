A fun "B" crime thriller in the early '50s is a story, wooden characters, Allison Hayes and Abbe Lane are the only two sex points that make it eye-catching, but one short picture, just a few shots long, shows the country's street bridge across the river "el "Cars, the 6000-series Pullman-built cars painted in their original 1950s color scheme, as they were delivered in 1950 as new. makes the picture worthwhile. I think such films, Ulmer's DETOUR, D.O.A. With Edmund O'Brien, FUGITIVE, Harrison Ford, and other movie genre (metropolitan crimes), it's interesting as something other than being close to Chicago and San Francisco and recognizing most street locations. Other visas are really exhausting boring film!
