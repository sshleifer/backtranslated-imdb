His father, who wants to revive his son, agrees to allow a researcher to try his experimental breathing process. so they believe that the revival process has gone awfully wrong, "according to the summary of DVD sleeves. At one point, Edward Norris (Philip Bennett) asks, "What do you think this is, a city of boys?" Mr. Norris should know because he was in "Boys Town". The "two-man man" is rather a "black Friday" minus Karloff and Lugosi. You're doing math. This movie can be a candidate, a recycled script; it contains an intriguing final act. After the dull "shooting", hang the drama to catch a well-played scene in Norris and continue to addict Addison Richards (like George Bradley). <br /> <br /> **** Man with two lives (1942) Phil Rosen ~ Edward Norris, Eleanor Lawson, Addison Richards
