This highly compulsive attempt to blend Robert Altman and Quentin Tarantino (who are themselves superfluous) is not informative or fun. The development of the characters is arbitrary and unbelievable - especially in the last scene of the culprits and the little boy, as other observers have pointed out. Also a couple of humorous moments aside, the movie is not so funny (black humor or otherwise) because the director seems to think it is.
