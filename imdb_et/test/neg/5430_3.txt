I just watched Congo on DVD. In most cases, I love these movies, but it's different. It made me write my first comment on the IMDb movie. I was surprised how such an experienced filmmaker team came out as a result of this film. You see, there was a lot of money for this production, but you can't make a good movie if you don't have a good script. And if the producer Frank Marshall gave us a lot of great movies to watch; he would never have had another Spielberg. This shows how difficult it is to make a good movie, maybe you have all the ingredients, but if you can't eat, stay out of the kitchen. If you can make a recommendation, don't spend your money on it. If you want to see it on TV first look and do your mind.
