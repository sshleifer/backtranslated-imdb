"Eh-heh eh-heh hey, dude - look at these aliens. They're like - biting people and things! Eh-heh eh-heh eh-heh" <br /> <br /> the slowest movies. It's cumbersome for anyone with a brain. Of course, you have payrollers who give a glowing overview and vote for this abomination, but it's easy to tell who the sales are. Their reviews are too good. Giving such a movie would even be a mediocre review, claiming that he had a complaint to improve the B-film. The naming of this great movie suggests the hands of the company. <br /> <br /> That's enough. <br /> <br /> This movie was about all the bad qualities that a film can have on the bad that it's enjoyable just to laugh. The old Japanese 60's monster movies had this film that was missing. At least in these 60's movies, you could laugh as a bad rubber monster fit. Or laugh when you see a string that holds the spacecraft, how the links hung and how the flames bent behind you. These movies were fun about how they were. Alien Express (aka Dead Rail) actually looks like a good movie that makes it extremely absurd. <br /> <br /> Impacts were terrible for today's standards. In addition to the terrible. But not as bad as the 60s monster films, they lacked a comedic appeal. The plot and the dialogue were about as sophomoric as I have ever seen, made even worse by being as predictable as you could expect each time. I can't even point out the holes in this plot and the logic; it just wouldn't be fair to this merciless plot (plus it would start a long time). Most of the actions were terrible; Lou Diamond Phillips must be very desperate to accept touching it. <br /> <br /> The SciFi channel is quickly becoming a "cheap excitement" that produces a movie after a movie without concept or intelligence. I can only wonder - why barely? It won't get worse.
