I've never seen TV series or previous movies. This is probably why I didn't enjoy it. Bored and just not funny, summing it up nicely. <br /> <br /> Given the budget, it seemed like a movie, it was embarrassing, they couldn't even do a decent job. <br /> <br /> Without exception, we went to the cinema and hoped to see a somewhat funny movie that wouldn't be reasonable to overpay. My friend was up at the movie and I spent the next 2 hours hoping it would finally start. Hope that died with the final credit.
