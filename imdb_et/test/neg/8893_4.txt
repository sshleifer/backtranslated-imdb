This movie came very close. The direction must be a little smoother to move from one piece to another to make it more credible. In particular: the need to escape the main character is not clear enough. Is he trying to kill himself? Is he trying to escape? His life doesn't seem so bad, so it's harder to swallow that he wants to leave so much of his life. It is also not very clear how much "in love" he has fallen with Jennifer Jason L.-. If the film was processed more with these details, it would have been great. On the other hand, the indicator is very good! Maybe if you have a couple of drinks to instill logical thinking, it would be more fun ... <br /> <br />
