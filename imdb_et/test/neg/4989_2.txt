Let me start by saying that I never wanted to see this movie; I had to watch it one day, and I thought I thought I'd get brighter and enjoy what it was, and that might be fun. What I expected was one of the worst films I've ever seen. First of all, there was nothing less humor. The creators considered humor to be ridiculous / satisfying when they contain sarcasm in every row that comes out of the Underdog's mouth and uses the scene after a strange scene, playing the "delicate" side of the audience, making them "ooh" and "ah" for more boring scenes and inaccurate scenes and inaccuracies , with weak performances that made me want everyone who enjoyed it. The action was boring, humor was annoying, and the traits / plots felt they spent about 10 minutes creating their entire personality, giving the Uninspiring Actors / Actors no choice about it how to portray your character the least, this movie is ordinary and just terrible in every area, and really only children under the age of 10 can enjoy it, even though this age range was targeted, it does not excuse it so badly exhausting and cause I feel so convincing. Parents spend their money in Up, Wall-E, Spiderwick Chronicles, Water Horse or Hotel for Dogs pa rabbits, the last families / kids, or even Alvin and Chipmunks are better than this messy!
