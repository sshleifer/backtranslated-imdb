I think only members of the selected audience really had an interest in seeing how the New York-based man's hustler is acting, but I would bet that even those brave souls switch off with irritating patchwork techniques and deliberately mute sound recording here; The fact that these inherent "defects" were a direct result of the film's low budget / underground / experimental character would say, in addition. Anyway, for those who are so inclined, the film has extensive male nudity, and Joe Dallesandro was understandably grounded? and gay? icon! <br /> <br /> An episodic structure that shows the daily routine of the hustler protagonist, a couple of somewhat interesting scenes: his meeting (and ultimately being put) on an eccentric older artist; where Dallesandro expresses his views on his unusual work and describes his specific way of acting for a couple of future "colleagues", including perhaps the most unlikely husters? good-looking fun! Perhaps it is gratifying that the film only lasted 89 minutes against IMDb's claim that its full length is 105 (but the latter may be a mistake)! <br /> <br /> I looked at some of Warhol's "movies" and this is certainly not as satisfying as the most acceptable example I still encountered, BAD (1977) and just a little better than I like HUSTLER (1965) were mostly strain to sit. The fact that it was only the first part of the trilogy failed well, but as they say, you have to do what you have to do, and the other two chapters had to follow fast ... <Despite the overall negative reaction to it, FLESH is still valuable As a capsule of the 1960s and a prototype of the underground scene of this era, both in kinematics and in real life. The picture of Dallesandro from this film beautifies the record of The Smiths' own debut album of 1984 and transsexual Candy Darling, who is quite unremarkably visible here. 1969's name. Although the last band is my all-time favorite, one of the reasons is that through their unique and ground-breaking music, they described a lifestyle that is completely different from my own; it's really a case where I'm rather rather aural than visually!
