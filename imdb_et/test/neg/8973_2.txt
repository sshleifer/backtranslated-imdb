Oh Gawd. From time to time I want to go back to Monogram Studios and pull someone in my 2-room office with this sloppy music. It's one watt higher than a flat lining from 60 to 61 minutes, and actually shows (within one minute that is spread in milliliters per hour) that the actual talent is poorly captured. see the point without bothering that this movie, which is easily energetic and really funny and allows lethargy to be the main thing. The strange story shows Grace Hayes, a karma vaudeville truperit, who attacks his horrible way to college, where his rat-bag son is a rich college clown. He will determine his playboy path, no matter what. His real life son (weird looking) Peter Hays plays with his screen son. His real life wife plays with his secretary. Talk about nepotism. I suspect that this talent package was the monetary financing of an almost monogram that funded the back-lot music made by resident schlockmeister extraordinaire Sam Katzman. As with other Monogram musicals, it just seems to be a reason to shoot the latest new furniture purchases and luminaires to show other studios that Monogram Pictures are "abundant" in their class B modes. See the true proof of SWING PARADE in 1946: they just built this gigantic nightclub set and then apologized for the filmmakers and musicians running. Story? Missing. Anyway, ZIS BOOM BAH is more BAH than BOOM. Where was Gale Storm and Mantan Mooreland when the Monogram really needed them? China is likely to stand at the gateway to PR images whether it seemed safe to enter. Junior Jive Hipster Roland Dupree comes to life to transform his teenage legs into two amazing dance numbers, especially in the new and expanded City Shop / Club. Ordinary crumpled curtains are loosely loosened on the back, and a set of mismatched drapery stages even has one dark main towel that is left and back, as each amateur sequence tends to be the previous one. The girls in the choir and their great-looking partners in this finals look like the Monogram office workers who borrowed (typewriters and carpenters) filming in the morning. They have no dance talents and they are so common on the screen ... ALL girls look like they're all called Joyce. There's even a costume accident where they wear frilly hot pants ... just one leg. It's all so terrible and harsh ... and actually irritating when one of the actors involved actually alters ZIS in fact FUN. One strange interesting thing is the dialogue between Grace and his son / daughter legally: it is so random that it actually works despite the script and logic. He has a life like presence, the only thing that makes a ridiculous story somewhat convincing. Dupree child is a real star. He can actually do something ... no matter how dancing tubby Liberace I do ... You read that right.
