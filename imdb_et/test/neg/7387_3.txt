Super Troopers was a quick classic. Club Dread was disappointing for many, but its moments. Puddle Cruisers has fewer moments. I saw this movie on the shelf of my local video store and saw from the bottom that it was made by the Broken Lizard group that made Super Troopers, so of course I pulled it up. I found only one scene to laugh out loud. Far from Super Troopers. All in all, I was very disappointed. I don't recommend it to anyone unless you have enough free time and really need some time to kill. However, you are better off playing video games or something that can make you laugh or think.
