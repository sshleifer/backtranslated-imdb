I've spent one year in Iraq, and among the hundreds of films I've seen here, this little pearl was Vampire Assassin. From the cover (African-American, with a curved blade, leather cover, and bad behavior), I expected to get Blade away. Fair enough. <br /> <br /> So I put it in and I noticed a borderless African American with no blade, no corn and no, nothing except ... I don't know. If you have read any of the other reviews, you will get the content of this color. It sucks. Bad. Really bad. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it was an immortal vampire killing Highlander-esquire lightning or camera zooming karate-kick sound effects or $ 20 budget props, or "ok we have 90 minutes to shoot it before we try to shoot at Johnson & Johnson's car park, "or martial arts, which is just as exciting and fast as two older people with sex or 7th grade talent or eccentric Asian Master, either old or acid, or what, but the film can force you to question your existence. And it's fantastic. <br /> <br /> Several movies may not be so bad that your head will explode like scanners. If you (or MST3K) with your friends, it's a flick for you. I've seen it three times already and I think it could have caused a permanent damage to my psyche. If you have no idea about the quality of the movie, the people tried to free it and nobody would take it. Not even with force. <br /> <br /> A short story, look at it. Whether under masochistic joy or punishment. It tilts your skull (and mostly for all the wrong reasons).
