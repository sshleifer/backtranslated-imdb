I'm really sad that this is the first bad overview I've ever done for a movie. EVER.I could watch this movie and this is another movie in all the movies I've seen. .. decrease. The first is Open Water, which just didn't get any point. The next Karate Kid had no mention of Daniel (correct me if I am wrong, please.) And this final line came in shock. It was like, "If you have to fight ... win." then it showed a flying bird and made the flute playing and I was like, oh. Okay, so it's time for the next part. AND HOW CREDITS ARE GIVEN TO GREECE. <br /> <br /> GEEZ MAN! Hopefully I never have to look at the movie badly, I apologize for those who love The Next Karate Kid, I really, really ...
