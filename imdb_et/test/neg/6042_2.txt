Someone said that WEBS is a lot like the SLIDER episode, and I have to agree. Spoilers: I never liked the sliders and rarely seen it unless there was nothing better. WEBS is a movie that shows you no other choices. Read the book. WEBS has TVs that have been seen as part of their PROBATION or Work Release Program. Some low-budget TV movies have actors who are at least enthusiastic. Participants in the WEBS look at how they received a paid minimum wage and worked on a time clock. They have such despair, "The-Paycheck-Better-Not-Bounce." Queen Spider looks good except it is rarely visible, and there are no other spiders (and no network). Queen Spider bites people and they become Spider Zombies, which means they're trying to keep their eyes on attacking WIDE OPEN people. People fight for many different reasons and they are not compassionate. After all of the "people" meetings, I would have liked the character-like youth to be taken. Everything the WEBS made me feel was APATHY. I was dumb with the characters and hoped for some interesting gates and special effects. Gore was minimal and special effects were reserved for the ugly spider queen who seemed good. If WEBS had a bunch of Spider Creatures people, it would have been more interesting. Obviously, they could just budget "spider-zombies". WEBS is a sad entry into the field of SPIDER-oriented films. It could qualify as the worst Spider movie because eight Legged Freaks had a great special effect.
