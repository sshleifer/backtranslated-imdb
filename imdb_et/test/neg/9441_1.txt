This movie has no redemption features. It is not even worth to be "so bad for a good" category - it's just bad. Poorly acted, badly descended, poorly written, poorly directed, terrible sound recording and the whole thing is just an incredible amateur. Just how it is released is behind me. <br /> <br /> Oh, and would any PLEASE tell the leading actor that if you play "mad", it doesn't mean you should constantly align your hair. in a movie that was generally irritating, it was probably one of the most irritating things. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I think it's the only movie ever to have a Nazi caravan ...
