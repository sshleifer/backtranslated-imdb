The film is excellent for Venezuela's tourism, birds, birds and other birds. Only one piranha. Nice scenery. The only highlight was the alligator, which was seen in a very long and boring motorcycle race. The end of Caribe's sinking is a solid Hollywood proposal. There is no definite story. It goes from a Venezuelan landscape to a lighter rider attack to diamonds and a ruthless hunter who, for some reason, goes crazy, which eventually ends. A very low budget movie that could have been filmed everywhere in Venezuela. William Smith is a very talented actor who has made very good films. Like all participants, they must have at least one bad movie. Don't waste DVDs for $ 5.00.
