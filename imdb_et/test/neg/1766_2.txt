I was very excited when I saw the "cold mountain". Unfortunately, like most movies, I am very happy to see it was hope! If it wasn't a wonderful invention called a DVD, I think I would have put my head through the monitor, I was so bored! <br /> <br /> I was watching Kidman and the law closely when they meet because their characters are allegedly "assigned" to each other. However, Law showed that love was bitter, but Kidman seemed to read seconds until he could go back to his trailer. Zellweger's character is pure Granny Clampett (as if we didn't get it, cornball banjos celebrates him with every entrance) and so from above, it was all I couldn't laugh at! Ironically, his presentation emphasizes just how rigid the boards are. Ada is almost starving because he freed his slaves; we never know why. What is even more amazing is why none of them were left out when Ada and her father were unusually benevolent, and (as shown in one scene) was a very dangerous time for the negro (as they politely called). Why didn't the neighbors teach her how to produce cow's milk or grow a crop? Heck, why didn't he just sell a farm and went home? And for all Ruby's practicality, when he sends Ada's "evil" bug, he places more chickens on such a chicken! <br /> <br /> By the time his beloved finally returns, Ada doesn't need him or anyone else - what a big joke! Indeed, he may be physically intimate with Inman, but his real closeness is Ruby, who has transformed Ada into his own Über-Babe version. Did anyone else notice how they walked down the hill with their hands, happy as two peas in the pot when they left behind Inman? <br /> <br /> I doubt Minghella admitted it because she was too busy because she was too busy doing the Bush movie. Inman tells us that he is "like every fool sent to fight the flag and a lie", and Ada's father says, "I imagine God is tired of being called to both sides of the argument". These "observations" are historically inaccurate and offensive. Although slavery was the basis of the south economy, the causes of war were more complex. It was incomprehensible that the soldier thought the reason was "wrong" (in fact, most of the rank and this file was indifferent). In order for filmmakers to get their views on the time when such views would be strangers to hit the newspapers, it is puzzling. <br /> <br /> Structurally, this film is negligible and episodic. The law and Kidman have failed and they have zero chemistry! The script is little more than a semi-baked dialog and a sudden set of clichés and banals. "Little moments like a diamond bag?" Ugh!
