I saw it on sale - NEW - in my local store for $ 6 and I said "hey! Action film with this brother Bloodsport and Enter the Dragon, led by the man who made the dragon's entry - and it's cheap!" So I bought it. Sorry! This is perhaps the worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen some doozies. <br /> <br /> Do you know how movies that are deliberately campy like Evil Dead II and Dead-Alive are AWESOME? You know how movies that should be serious, but turned out to be so terrible that you have to laugh out loud and watch them again, like Lionheart (old Van Damme movie) or John Carpenter vampires, are you really cool? This film, Ironheart, can be one of them. I do not know what the filmmakers thought, but it seems that this film was made without shooting, any budget or script to talk about. (Although I am in the script comment, I should note that Bolo Yeung has no features in this film - the only reason he presents the first bills in the box is that he is the only actor in the movie you ever recognize (if you are not Jackie The fan of Chan, in which case you feel a bad boy - and you want to call him!).) What's sad about this movie since '92. By that time, T2 was the Day of Judgment, so you know that the 80s campiness was over ... but not quite. After that, you think that the 80s Chuck Norris movies, high school comedies, and Jason / Freddy's sequel were merely genius works. <br /> <br /> Things to Know: <br /> <br /> 1) Nobody in this movie can do beans. Richard Norton, who is looking for the rich and bright, is closest, and Bolo Yeung is looking for the right meaning ... and bright. Everything else is terrible. <br /> <br /> 2) Martial arts scenes are forgotten - just a lot of white boys who have a lot of muscles pulling out their shirts screaming, running at Britton Lee. Britton Lee strikes, then falls down. Even Bolo's final showdown is disappointingly short and as creative as my running socks design (and equally smelly). <br /> <br /> 3) The rest of the action is pathetic: the guns look like they came from the K-Mart toy department and they really come in capsule form. When somebody strikes, they collide a little, then they still lie brownish-red to their clothes. Britton Lee will probably appear on the side, but you will not see it at all, and later on the same day you will see a wound ... I had paper cuts that were worse than that! <br /> <br /> 4) Of course, the girl dresses up the wound, then they can, the next thing you know they are in bed after sex. Ah? What? The credible development of the interests of love and any kind of character development are ignored in this film. Remember how Bruce Lee's characters didn't have to have sex to be cool. <br /> <br /> 5) Car chasing is by far the worst I've ever seen. It seems the director sat with a hand held camera, because two cars were driving along the road, oh I don't know about 30 miles per hour? Don't try it at home, kids, these people are professionals! Ha! <br /> <br /> 6) Really bad writing. Here's a scene for you: Lee follows, so the girl follows the followers to warn Lee, but her car is too slow. So, when he catches up, Lee and the bad guys are out of their cars and there is a thrust. Lee has killed two bad guys, but Lee is shooting down Lee when the girl runs almost to Lee, so the bad boy runs away. (Huh?) Then the girl's kiosks and she can't start it. She tells Lee that she's now involved and she's with her. He points out to him that they cannot leave his car because bad guys are pursuing him. He convinces him somehow that he should decide how to solve this problem - so he shoots the gas tank and blows his car. (And remember that later, the same evening they have sex.) Huh?!? <br /> <br /> 7) If you look closely at more than half the nightclub frames, the dancers are synchronized with music. Dancers are also too co-ordinated with each other (probably in the 1980s, all dance clubs took people to dance). The DJ has a girl with a microphone, but she does nothing but dance. Bouncers talk to people who fight to "take it out" - without moving their lips. In one scene, the only invaders passing by Lee and Stevo are just inside the entrance, but behind! Obviously, if you're the main character of the movie, you can go straight on the line. <br /> <br /> 8) Lee notices it for the first time, but he doesn't. You know the second time - even though it's the same car of the same car. The girl nevertheless announces. Bad guys follow twice, but they don't notice. <br /> <br /> 9) Lee is worried that the bad guys are chasing the girl's car, even though they have already seen her, where she works twice. She leaves her child at work, taking care of her friend while she is sex-free without Lee. DON'T learn about parenting from this movie! <br /> <br /> Today, you can't think of more grip ... you get the idea ... Ironheart is so bad, it's not even funny, it's SAD.
