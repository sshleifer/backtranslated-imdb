When I first heard this movie, I was eager to rent it, believing (mistakenly) that it was one of those bad fun movies and I was treating it. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> For the beginners, the tempo is agonizing, slow-moving. This pace won't even take up the movie in the last 15-20 minutes! The plot was boring and the end was pointless and confusing. For those who are looking for a cheap excitement for an exciting horror film, look elsewhere. This movie gives joy to bounces, but it's a very bad "thrill", cheap or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Try "Child Play" instead.
