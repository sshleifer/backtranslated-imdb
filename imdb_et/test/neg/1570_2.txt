Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series. The essence of the class war was always a topic worthy of a funny beating, but it is better used by most in the TV series. Chemistry between Yootha Joyce and Brian Murphy was always lively and writers wrote almost completely flawless episodes every time. In my opinion, this is the best British sitcom from the mid-1970s to the 1970s, crossing RISING DAMP, ROBIN'S NEST, at your service? and so on. The ON ON BUSES series, which ended a few years earlier, became the next pride and joy of GEORGE AND MILDRED ITV (or ITV 1 as it is currently known) enjoying a four-year run on the channel. <br /> <br The film is, however, almost terrible in almost every respect. The general nature of the television series has been almost completely cut off by the writers of this abysmal film (whoever immediately announces it is not the same who worked in the series). As one observer has already pointed out, Mildred has no sense of sharpness in the TV series and it does not come as far as it is, as well as surprising. <br /> <br /> The plot, instead of focusing on the class war with Fourmiles, was the basis of the television series, actually Fourmiles writes almost completely after the first half hour. The plot, when you call it, is made up of George and Mildred, who go to a hotel for rest and mix with gangsters. First, the first level talent is wasted here in the form of Stratford Johns, Kenneth Cope, David Barry and Sue Bond. Most of them have passed their flowering times, and everyone seems very embarrassed as they are very well aware that the only thing worthy of a salary is salary (which probably isn't much). <br /> <br /> The movie's jokes and gags (if you can name them) depend to a large extent on the traditional British farce, including erroneous identities, embarrassing situations, poorly-timed secrets, characters who lose control of what's happening and the general mess. And it all fails. As the other observer has pointed out, it seems that the writers of this film have never seen an episode of the TV series, and instead have shaped something that resembles a CARRY ON rumble. The scene removed from George by Sue Bond is especially out of context. <br /> <br /> The mystery of this movie is the BBFC certificate - 15. Just why is it 15 when everything is visible is harmless, non-vulgar entertainment? <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, the sitcom spin era ended long after the release of this movie (shortly after Yootha Joyce's sad death). And behind this film, Hammer, known in the 1950s by the mid-1970s, soon disappeared from all the vagueness. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is almost general. My advice - skipping and confirming TV shows. You're not leaving anything, I assure you.
