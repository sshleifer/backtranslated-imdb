Idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots, yes Camp Blood (or if you want a terrible badder as a bad coat that feels bad as a bad movie, "Camp Bloody awful" is so bad actually is pretty frustrating look. And it has all the ingredients that are a bad movie ... <br /> <br /> Honestly acting control. Bad script control. Tacky effects control some originality - double control. <br /> <br /> It doesn't even try to be different and is full of any predictable clich√©. For example, the film opens for a couple who is in sex in the woods, so naturally they will be dead. One of the most troublesome things is that this movie actually created two sequels, how and why only the mind disrupts. <br /> <br /> Just stay away from it.
