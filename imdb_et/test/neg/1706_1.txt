This is a film that rotates around two mysteries (which I now demystify). <br /> <br /> First, do movie makers understand the concept of "parody" before you use it to bombard a pub in the whole movie? A parody is when reproduction attempts to ridicule, comment or honor the original work through its own depreciating humor. In other words, such work on the parody should be a reason and they should definitely be smart. I didn't see any of them in the movie. I saw some terrible 10 second jokes that fell within 2 seconds after the transfer. Bryan Stoller apparently went to Eric Roberts and said, "Hey, I've come last night looking at the survivors, and I had this brain hit the DVD. I want you on the board without reading the script ... because I'm planning to write this movie without one ! "<br /> <br /> Here's another secret: Eric Robert's career. I think Eric Roberts had a career because he was unhappy. Now I understand that it is that he is a fool (and therefore deserves a career he had). After watching the film, it is obvious that it would have been better for him to have gone to the usual adult films with higher budgets, more ... intense ... scenes and roles, better functioning and direction, more complex and weighty plot and a much wider audience if this is a B-movie refusal (C-movie?).
