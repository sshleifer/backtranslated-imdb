Say what you know about the movie "Gore Gore", Herschell Gordon Lewis, to admit that his first films (1963 trashy "Blood Feast" and 1964 crackerbarrel "Two Thousand Maniacs") were his last (1972) Gore Girls)), the man stayed true to his museum, began to despise the young male and female body to cheer the camera. For example, in "Gore Gore", someone has looted pastes and pastes with Tops & Bottoms Club and unpleasant ex-detective Gentry is hotty hotty. cub reporter to help with the thing. The film has remarkably annoying and repetitive background music, terrible lighting, exhausting behavior, reluctant characters, problematic sound, and of course some of Lewis patented non-branded scenes. So one of the removers is shifted into boiling oil; Has his face ironed and his nipples are broken, and another one has his ball driven by the meat tenderizer until his entire back is covered with it, m it also seems to be the Buiton tomato sauce. (I may be wrong here; it could have been Ragu.) The film also casts some flat humor, although some lines are pretty funny. For example, we find out that the real name of Suzie Creampuff's killed stripper was ... Ethel Creampuff! One bottle of acid says "Made in Poland" (don't know why, but I thought it was funny). And some of the striptease club owners Henny Youngman's lines are, of course, fun. However, this is not a movie to show to Aunt Ethel or her sister Agatha. This is one of the sick people you will ever see, with just one particular fire, with a pleasant moment in the crowd - a movie with a title card that reads "We proudly preach: this movie is over"!
