When I saw the trailers of this movie, it seemed like a good romantic comedy. I waited for some light, fluffy fun. Instead, I was bored and a little depressed. <br /> <br /> Frankly, there were no chemistry at all, and the film had little, if any, funny. The little girl was divine - when she cried, I called - but I thought they might have used a somewhat younger role. <br /> <br /> In both cases, the film was filled with long, dull silence or the expansion of opera music. I'm not anti-opera, but I would have preferred that they spent that time giving us the characters who were all rigid and underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with this movie. All the time I looked at it, I wondered how much better it would have been.
