The debate has taken place a thousand times. Is the "Venetian merchant" anti-Semitic? (I think it is.) Is it not unfair to always mark this little anti-Semitism in a otherwise great art work? (I don't think it is.) Does it play the role of Shakespeare as the world's largest playwright? (I think it works.) Does it play a role if it didn't do it for a specific racist purpose? (I don't think it is.) Michael Radford knew all this and that is why he added to his film the prologue of the Jewish mercy in the Renaissance-Venice. because this game has always been and the new make-up gives only the first (but meaningless) hope that someone has dared to set something right, which is a constant annoyance, not because its anti-Semitism is particularly shocking, but because this game is William Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Why spend so much time depicting a man's hatred - Shylock? Why use a big and serious actor, like Al Pacino, when in the end it's all outrageous (but hey, I'm a non-responsible-Shakespeare-written) court room scene. And now I would like to be very precise, just like Shylock myself. <br /> <br /> He demands his right, according to the treaty, which - not very responsible - Christian Antonio, who has always been seen, signed in full awareness of the consequences. Of course, what Shylock calls is cruel and useless, but that's not the case. What we see (or should see) is a man who has been humiliated throughout his life until his entire anger remains. I think such a man is obviously inappropriate to read things like compassion. <br /> <br /> But what to play / movie (these are now and the same) is not doing right now. Become a soap opera! Cruel crazy about his knife, terrible (but rather short-sighted) audience, poor "victim" was tied to his chair. True, Antonio accepts his destiny, but why can't he just say one word, "sorry"? I think we don't have to lose many words about the ridiculous decision of the young Dottore of Padua; it is a truly "popular judgment" that does not differ much from what was seen in Nazi show trials 400 years later. From one minute to the next, this Jew is robbed of everything he owns, baptized into a Christian, and kicked out. <br /> <br /> Isn't that terrible? Probably not. The story moves to the romantic complexity of the rings and its happy ending. <br /> <br /> What you can learn from Libeskind's Berlin Jewish Museum and similar places all over the world is that anti-Semitism is often unnoticed by mass. because what is so devastating for a minority or some people is confirmed by the overwhelming benefit of the majority. We should be the exact task of everyone to develop such trends to discover and reveal such tendencies. <br /> <br /> I don't accept the excuse that this movie was made ill-treated by Shylock for creating empathy (it just doesn't work). I don't think anyone would be forced to be gracious. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie; especially for the Oscar.
