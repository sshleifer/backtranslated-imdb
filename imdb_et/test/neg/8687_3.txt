Evil All begins with the San Sebastian Strait in 1683, as El Diablo, the treasure ship of the 17th century, sinks with a violent thunderstorm. Jump to San Sebastian's modern strait, where two divers explore beautiful underwater coral reefs rich in wildlife, encounter a wrecked wreck of El Diablo and explore it, but attack and kill something that looks like a vicious eel. Captain Max Cash (Wayne Crawford) owns and manages a boat trip called "Vagrant Viking", which provides tourists who want to fish, dive and explore the islands in general. Sarah Livingstone (June Chadwick) is an art teacher who dives into a treasure hobby (we all have to do something to make time right?), She hires Max and her little clad assistant Tracy (Sheri Able) to try to find El Diablo and get rich. Some of the most disgraceful members of the local community spoke about the sunken treasure because they cast off criminals and trappers, who Max and Sarah point out that El Diablo has a bad past, a past that allegedly leaves this supernatural inheritance even now ... > <br /> Director: Jean-Claude Dubois, According to IMDb, with little help from Crawford's star, although the version I saw only in Dubois, I thought the Evil below had some options and is a bit different, but unfortunately it is not enough to save it seabed as stone. Arthur Payne's manuscript begins with OK, when two divers are killed by a sea creature, but this opening is never mentioned, the creature has never been seen and supernatural killings are no longer there. The evil below is the case of a serious and terminal case of identity crisis, it does not seem to know what it wants to be because it captures pieces of underwater adventure, horror, action, thriller, crime from different genres, and even has time to murder in mystery and religious nonsense. As a result, Evil feels very funny, fragmented below, and because the best scene in the whole movie is the opening procedure I found to be more and more frustrated because there is no consistent horror because it went downhill quickly and to reality Never see a sea creature again. Evil Below is boring, slow, uneven, predictable, silly, and there is no magic or intelligence, in short Evil Below does nothing that a good movie should do. <br /> <br /> Director Dubois fails to enliven things, although he probably shot a lot of underwater wildlife material, because sometimes I thought I was watching National Geographic's documentary with all the fish, corals and wildlife. Forget every gore, some blood-colored water and blood cough is about the same gory as it goes I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> Technically Evil Below is very simple, it's cute and completely forgotten besides the nice underwater photography fish. It is a point and shootout thing, and as a whole, output values ​​are very small, even the place where it was shot doesn't look very sunny or tempting. Action is bad, but then did you expect anything else? <br /> <br /> Evil Below is a poor movie, this is the basic story that is all over the place and it can't decide what it wants to be as a result of this confusion. Add it to low production values, the fact that there is no gore and absolutely minimal horror, which film is probably best avoided if you are absolutely desperate and even then definitely have better ways to spend 90 plus minutes of your life. .
