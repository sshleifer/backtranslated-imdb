I can imagine the writers of the story who are thinking about this script: <br /> <br /> 1. Let's do a series of films like Se7en, Knight Moves, Copycat, and lamb's silence. People like a series killer. It sells ... 2. The sorcerer must take some pattern. I know; he copies this serial number mystery from the novel. It's not done yet, at least not exactly. 3. Now we need some way to make this movie unique; of course, a good man can be put in bed as in the rear window. 4. Finally, we need a twist that gives this film the sixth mindset and the success of ordinary suspects. <br /> <br /> Okay, now that you know these things, you know the whole movie, so don't waste your money. One of the things I really hate about the movers is that they take a very good concept for the film and lead them completely to the ground. I wrote better stories than I was in Junior High. I checked my watch every five minutes. When finally the twisting ended, I was not shocked, I just said, "Oh. Who cares?!" The characters are two-dimensional. They have your typical movie personalities. This movie is just a proof that stealing other successful movie elements is not a bad excuse for the script. I'll give this movie out of 10. It would normally serve at least 2 or 3, but I'm so sick of unoriginality. When do they learn? 1/10
