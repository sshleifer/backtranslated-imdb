This "movie" and I use this concept loosely, reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote, eighteen months: "P.U., smelly poopies!" <br /> <br /> Like this joke, this movie will only be an appeal to a very young, very immature or very stupid. <br /> <br /> That means there are some bright spots. <br /> <br /> The effect that most reputable $ 100 million went is kinetic and convincing - I think it's as convincing as such kinetic CGI effects. CGI baby effects are not great, but I imagine that they are very difficult to do ... even though they could have been better for a hundred million dollars! <br /> <br /> Moose, dog "Frasier," called at a regular show. Steven Wright did a small part well. Alan Cummings was fine, Alan Cummings-as-wool, which we saw before, and Bob Hoskins as Odin was unknown, but enjoyable. <br /> <br /> An actor who plays Mrs Avery was a cute-like-a-button, as you wanted, and Jamie Kennedy, as you thought. His best role to date has been in the Scream trilogy (not to be confused with the Lord of the Rings) and the Three King. He should perhaps stay in the finer forms of comedy. Jim Carrey, he's not. <br /> <br /> Writing and direction were even worse than Kennedy's performance. I partially remember one smart (though seven-year-old) line I want someone to quote exactly the "catchy quotes" section. Something that Avery offered in the costume is "Craptown", it was a second-class joke, but somehow funny in the context. <br /> <br /> Everything over, because there is nothing lower than "one", I give this film one.
