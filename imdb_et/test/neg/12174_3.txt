I'm totally surprised when the highly prized "cemetery man" is among the fans of fear! Now, I usually welcome movies that interfere with two or more genres of genres and I love almost every zombie comedy I've ever seen. In my opinion, this Italian cult class did not really show too much to pump it ... That's the result of a full-time cemetery guard and his slow, male-child, Curly Joe. I'm looking for an assistant because they seem to primarily destroy the dead who recently died seven days after their first death. She meets a widow whom she "worships" with the tomb-yard atmosphere and develops fast romance, soon having sex with her dead man's grave. Her dead body lives and bites him, launching a series of events that seem to be consuming the rest of the film. The "cemetery man" tries to add every element he gets, such as horror, romance, comedy, action and long-term failure. It pulls along, never focuses on any long enough aspect to make the viewer interesting, such as the paunchy sidekick relationship with a live interrupted head, off-road motorcycling, the main character who chooses to lay down a gun on random sidewalks, and so on. This thing is so complicated and boring that it's impossible to take it seriously. Of course, it is stylish and often "elegant", but even the most "artistic" films need the right kind of linearity. The "Cemetery Man" explosion, which for more than a few minutes is unable to concentrate on something that will become very tiring after a while. People say "it's a more complicated zombie movie". Frankly, I do not want to touch zombies with anything more "complicated" than Romero ... Here is a little gore and nudity - mostly scenes where he wants to play a "horror film", but not nearly enough to make up for this uncompromising lack of structure. Terrible movie.
