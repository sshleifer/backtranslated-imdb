I know this exhibition gave women a lot of liberation in the late 90s and early 2000s, but come on! You have a whiner, a buzz kill and an overhead analyzer. This exhibition brought women to bad. I can not STANDI Carrie analyze all the small things in this show and that's what really killed me. Charlotte also hurt his ears about his non-existent predispositions and Miranda's cynicism was a complete buzz. I mean, can he just be happy? Samantha was the only one in the show and the only one worth looking at. There was also a good episode when Nathan Lane was at the show, but it was the only one worth seeing - the rest of them were the same. Humor was drier than a sandbox and not a very interesting line. All in all, it is not a very good show and I am glad it is over.
