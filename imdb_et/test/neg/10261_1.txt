All this movie was bad, the actor was bad and the plot was bad. And there was all the blood and gore that was in "Demons," which is a good movie, and it wasn't scary at all. My brother said this movie was bad, but I had the opportunity to give it because the first film was very good. When the movie was over, I understand why my brother thought this film was bad. The only plus in this movie was the music "The Smiths" and "The Cult", but this is a movie and the music track is not the most important thing. And I saw four sequences appear after this movie, I haven't seen them, but can they be as terrible as I am, but I don't see them, but maybe I can see them for a while.
