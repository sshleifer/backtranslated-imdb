With such a title you will be forgiven for thinking that this film is a great painter Goya. Then after half an hour you decide it is more of the Roman Catholic Inquisition. Even wider in width, maybe it's just a time view. To characterize Milos Forman's dishes, crumble too many axes and pay little attention to Milos Forman's colorful, but frightening, striking mish-porridge that doesn't fit in all three accounts. <br /> <br /> Milos Forman (who lost his Jewish father to the Nazi concentration camps) is a big director who painted and got away from Mozart's buffalo. He won prizes for this. His life in Czechoslovakia gave him a taste of diverse, repressive regimes, especially communism. He also made an equal assault, but impressive, one flew over the cuckoo nest. So how does he, at the age of 74, give us this confusion? Goya Ghostsis is one of Goya's removed horses. The main character is brother Lorenzo, who is passionate about Javier Bardem. Natalie Portman is as lively as the Goya model Ines (and later the film, her own daughter). The weak link with Goy is that he paints both. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo tortures (and rape) Ines, whom he suspects as a Jew. His father is torturing Lorenz. Napoleon strikes to release Spain (briefly). Ines leaves the cave that the church has left and looks for her child. Goya is still painting, but is deaf. His main concern seems to be to help Ines. And so on. <br /> <br /> Historically, Goya was also a historian. Unfortunately, as Forman had abandoned the idea of ​​Goya's painter, it could have been used to draw the whole film? a great piece of history that Goya sees. But the painter is too hard to gain weight. Similarly, the Inquisition Fear Document should be made? Compared to other despotic arrangements throughout the time, little admission has been forgiven by the Holy See. Although it may be questioned whether Forman is sufficiently competent to rely on factual considerations. <br /> <br /> "I thought it might be the heart of a wonderful story," he says in a production note. "There was a lot of parallels between the communist society in which we lived and the Spanish Inquisition." But this story is too small to pay attention to. With our expectations and something bigger (in the background of a great painter, the Inquisition of the Inquisition, and even the French Revolution) we are asked to feel involved (if any) in attracting Goya. The result is that we feel cheated. <br /> <br /> The background sample is treated terribly. Goya went to the deaf in 1792 (when the film started), not 15 years later. Napoleon is as plausible as the cut of a grain pack. We see that the church is going to die of death (as the usual procedure was the Church's demand that the secular hand did this dirty work). The battles are too choreographic and staged. It's not worth bare bosses for that. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, production values ​​are generally good. Colors are vivid, amazing (at least until we give up any valuable event). Bardem is great, and Portman is delighted until she goes mad. Although he doesn't talk much about Goya, what he says is great, even if it is superficial and rather irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, I had a late night drunk conversation with my friends and we asked each other. if you could choose the director of your life, who would it be? Unfortunately, for your record, Forman must be at the bottom of my list.
