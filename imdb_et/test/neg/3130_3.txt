The Dakota Incident must be one of the strangest West I've ever seen. Not good, but definitely strange. <br /> <br /> Leading stagecoach rides the city of Christian Flats, killing all passengers. It is going to continue, but very few, for obvious reasons, want to risk Cheyennes on the stomach there. But Linda Darnell, Regis Toomey, John Lund, Whit Bissell and Ward Bond are for every reason. And Dale Robertson, who killed John Doucette, who was hit by Doucette and Skip Homeier, and left him dead in the desert, is so eager that he wants to ride a team. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Cheyennes attack convincing group of passengers when they are forced to cover their dry laundry. The one who lives and dies is the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The Dakota incident came to the end of Republic images before Herbert J. Yates pulled his small studio plug. The Westers were their specialty, but usually like Roy Rogers. It wouldn't be a Rogers product. In fact, it's incredible. The characters are not in any reality. Whit Bissell takes back the magic samples from his claim, but Robertson discovers that it is iron pyrites, fools. Toomey is a guitarist who is going to go crazy. Darnell is for his deceptive leader, but he really doesn't know what to do if he finds him. Lund wants to bring Robertson who committed the crime but took him alive. Because he needs help but is not like that. <br /> <br /> But the worst is Ward Bond, a US Senator in his peaceful mission to Cheyenn. In real life, Bond was the individual of the best wing and I am not sure that it was a caricature of what he perceives as a liberal. She's really funny, but I think she could have been involved in this role. <br /> <br /> I was trying to get into the Dakota incident but couldn't. And the end was a strange fantasy to say at least. <br /> <br /> Give it three stars to the involved participants.
