Today, as President's Day, my husband and I had a DVD card that was in our local library. This is a film that appeared in 2004 and fell under our radar because we are big filmmakers. I'm a published author who hopes my first book will play. I noticed references to "The Notebook" when reviewing other movies, so I brought it to our viewing and this morning I offered a great opportunity. We both really liked it. It made my wife cry; we can relate many things to our own continued love relationship, and even I fought back with suffocation. <br /> <br /> This afternoon we decided to work and eat after a lot of housework, so we decided to actually catch the matin√©e. When we came to the theater after seeing most of the current movie party, we decided to see "Victoria Day", which for some reason was not in the theater, although both IMDb and my phone movies showed it playing there. That's why we looked instead of reading "Dear John" and that it was written by the same writer "The Notebook", making it an obvious choice because we enjoyed so much "TN". <br /> <br /> What a disappointment! First, the characters did not have the same credibility or empathy as TN; and we continued to comment on all the similarities - two dozen or so - as soon as the realization of this movie was nothing but the other reviewer commented, "poor man's laptop!" It was a real sense of "cash flow", which means that the sparks just threw the story together, based on the exact TN model, just to make a quick bush. Not only that, after the "bug-eyed" trollop for the unlikely "dear John's-John" wimp for a cancer patient, we ridicule the movie with everyone, passing the soap to the end of the stupid line. There were only about 6 people here on Monday at 16:45, and my wife even said I kept it so I wouldn't destroy it for others ... it was so bad. <br /> <br /> This vision from the "TN" heels ensured that the hanging resemblance was vividly recognizable and Sparks blatantly, cheap test writing was painfully obvious. We just want us to have seen the "Victoria Day" instead ... no matter how bad it was after watching this cinema. And, uh ..., during the last 30 minutes, I said, "... don't give this cow the coins ... don't give that cow coins?"
