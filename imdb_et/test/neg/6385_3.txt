Well ..... it's not horrible, but ....... !!! ??? The worst low-budget backwood-flic is the worst, sort of AND ... that's why it's pretty charming and funny to watch ... at least on my TV !!! Cross Pete Walker, Herschelli Gordon Lewis and ... say .... fucking, I give up ... just can't get out of this nice movie with the "more beautiful" resemblance. Everything is so wrong that I have to include it in my movie collection ... Death in Venice ..... Nekromantik ..... Blue velvet and good, bad, ugly ... right! ? People who have some small talents to add to movies or the sexy events they buy from other people should look for this movie right now .... surely there is fat lil 'ol' goldmine, oh Maaaannnn !!!!!
