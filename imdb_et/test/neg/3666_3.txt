Dark Reality is a visual image that has been slightly damaged. Although the plot and story are good, there is a bit too much nonsense. Although I felt the film was well done technically, the actor was spotted, it was just a bit too dark for my mood when I watched it. In principle, IT says there are a lot of missing people who can never be found and maybe tortured by clergymen. I think some information about the prisoners and their reasons for being so ill would have helped some. It came like a snuff movie just for violent content. If you want women to beat, torture and kill, that's for you. If you are looking for something a bit literally and more expressively and reasonably, skip it.
