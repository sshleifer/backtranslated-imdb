Whew! What can you say about this strange, astonishing glimpse of Ed Wood's crusade fantasies? Well, one word that comes to mind is inconsistent! Wood uses harmless, random stock footage plaques and builds a story around them - and what the story is! Wood himself celebrates Glen, the usual Joe, who just happens to enjoy his groom's lingerie and sweaters. I think what Wood wanted was tolerance for all the Glens in this world, showing that Glen is just like all of us, just angora. Ummm ... ok. But then, we get this very bizarre assembly of some horny fucking, chick slave, some rude, pointing people, some moore stock footage, and finally emaciated Bela Songs, playing some twisted, invalid puppetmaster. Lugosi is a hell that casts garbage like "Beeevare ... beeeg greeeen dragon that looks at your fingertips: she eeeets the lads, puppydog tails and beeeeeg snails!" Um, ok, Bela ...: = 8 / Here's a strange, twisted type. After that, he reminds us that 10 out of 10 men wear a hat and 7 out of 10 are bald. Hmmm must be that alien / cross-dressing / habidashery cowspiracy-thang !! Glen or Glenda stands for a trustworthy wood score actor, including Lyle Talbot, Delores Fuller, and Timothy Farrell, and Wood is capable of competing with each of the harsh, amateur non-talented. By now, everyone knows the sad story of Bela: by the time he used the wood for this fault, he was probably one more fixed and needs a mole, but even for him, this depth is still unresolved. One of MooCow's favorite wood sculptures is equipped with a Buffer Scene loading - it's sooo looped! MooCow says "Puuuull de schtriiiiings" and Glen or Glenda collect copies - you don't believe it! : ??
