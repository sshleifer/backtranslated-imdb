technically, this film would have had everything: decent actors, nice terrain, obvious landmarks of budget absence, celebrity like richard attenborough. The plot summary also sounded promising, suggesting satire to foolish bureaucracy and ordinary people. <br /> <br /> However, it never gives. The plot is just too illogical. Throughout the film, one person does not do any reasonable things. crazy politicians, ridiculous soldiers, brain-dead villagers - everyone just pulls from one incredible situation to another. What they do not all have a sense in the present context. <br /> <br /> Of course, such a movie must be absurd and exaggerated. At the same time, there should be at least one case to point out the madness of the city center sharing. in fact, there are (at least) two attempts that unfortunately fail: the main character who does not seem to have a clue with him, and the "writer" who sometimes crack out of jokes, which may be considered to be entertainment for only 12-year-old audiences. <br /> <br /> The most impressed is that the movie tries to be funny all the time, but never made me laugh. I've seen a lot of bad "funny" movies, but so far each had at least 2 or 3 good laughs. so in this sense "puckon" is really remarkable. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a big movie with a comparable plot, see "Brazil". don't waste your time with a puckon.
