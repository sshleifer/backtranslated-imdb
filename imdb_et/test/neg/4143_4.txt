I wanted to make this movie dog, but somehow I can't find it for myself to do it. <br /> <br /> By showing the duality of fighting styles, this is Li vs. Li a somewhat decent fight for supremacy. br /> <br /> This is one of the films where the story performs. Li's behavior is extremely amateur, hesitant and rigid for most of this movie ... to the end. At first, I beat myself to believe he was doing just one of his two characters. You know, to show the differences in personalities. But that seemed like an inexperience or a lack of talent. It got a little better, relaxed, to the end. But it wasn't enough to record his performance. Jet Li's actions improve as his career moves forward. I don't hate my actor. I just hated him in that. <br /> <br /> I also have to say that the effect was a "B" class effect. What is the effect. <br /> <br /> The story itself has great potential. It was uniquely creative, bold and fresh. Unfortunately, the budget was not large enough to accommodate better lighting, effects, film quality, and some lessons, or the director simply didn't care enough to disturb those little details. He also did not lead science in the scientific literature. The fact that was a major obstacle to this film. <br /> <br /> Sequences were a bit unilateral because it seemed to give more to one character and little to the other. But the whole story is made for a very pleasant experiment. <br /> <br /> As enjoyable as it was, I couldn't possibly think that it was just one of those movies that you couldn't help but watch it for what it should be, not what it was is. <br /> <br /> This price is on a 6.0 / 10 "B" scale. <br /> <br /> It's 4.2 / 10 (on the "A" scale) to get a good plot from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
