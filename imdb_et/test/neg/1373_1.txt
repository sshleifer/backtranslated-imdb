Although mencia could be summed up as something other than the chappelle exhibition clone, it is really worse. First, Carlos mencia is a jacka ** that is just as funny as it is an original that doesn't speak much. The exhibition includes spells of American television ads and political issues, and the "comedian" review of politics adds to the low quality of this exhibition. besides, mencia breaks more flat into ethnic jokes and stolen Jeff heroes, on the one hand I can guess. while Carlos can laugh at any time at the same time, for the rest of the time he will spend offensive to everyone, including the exploitation of his own audience. except for the southern park, pulled out and standing on Friday evening, this show shows the end of the glory of the chappelle exhibition, which for those who have not heard, was before he went to Africa.
