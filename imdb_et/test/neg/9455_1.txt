Purchased for Â£ 1, the Vampire project is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Wooden, flat effects and terrible storyline add a movie that has no reason to even see. PV is one of those films that does not even have good grace to be pleasantly bad, instead it seems that this beast is trying to frighten itself, stupid and crap as humanly as possible. <br /> <br /> The Vampire has created a serum that he sells to old people as a lifeguard, and those who take it fall under his control. Former lab intern worker with sister to try and stop. Someone should have stopped the garbage makers. <br /> <br /> Nobody needs to see this movie, and I've really been scared of humanity because 2 people have given it at the time of writing. 10 out of 10
