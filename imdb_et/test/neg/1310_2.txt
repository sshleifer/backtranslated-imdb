I really don't joke if I can honestly say that this movie is not suitable for watching on Sunday night at ITV4. <br /> <br /> Underground scenes are just terrible when London is said to be under 30 hours of water, the character of Robert Carlyles is drab. The equipment of the police commissioners reminds me of something Kate Moss was throwing up and Nigel Planer seems very old, actually I'm worried that he might have suffered a stroke while filming. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle's father who was "on time all the time" is probably too much Ketamin, and although he has a big part in this awkward journey, he deserved to kill him before he tried to be Kate Winslett (Titanic), while hanging on the Thames barrier. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for film students but avoid it at all costs.
