I saw this movie a bit and I was interested to see that the critics give him two letters, the result of which I agree. Basically, the film begins with the Kermit frog (Steve Whitmire), who talks about all of his Muppet, that they have lost everything, and finishes depression at the session (and perhaps think of suicide). At the same time, in another world (Heaven), an angel Daniel (David Arquette, who had already been to Cosmopolitan) visited "Boss" (Whoopi Goldberg, another reason I wanted to see the movie) to show that Kermit really needs help. On return, this shows Kermit, Miss Piggyi (Eric Jacobson, not the original and better Frank Oz), Gonzo (Dave Goelz), Fozzie Bear (also Jacobson), Pepe Prawn (Bill Barretta) and all the other Muppets are ready to show the show to many people on Christmas Day and it all seems to be fine. But the real thought of Rachel Bitterman (Joan Cusack) has decided to close an exhibition or theater and Kermit does everything she can to make it happen. Of course, Kermit fails the last time and Bitterman tells him they are ready and he can take the theater officially. This is where Daniel is sent to Kermit's guard to try him, but Kermit is not in the mood and finally comes out saying "I wish I was never born". Obviously, you can recognize the deception of this wonderful life, where Kermit is George Bailey and Cusack as Mr. Potter, and finally, Kermit probably understands how much he means to everyone, and goes back to finding a theater as a recorded historical landmark. Whitmire also plays as a Rizzo rat and beaker; Goelz as Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Waldorf; Barretta as Dr. Teeth, Dog and Swedish Chef; Jacobson as an animal and Yoda (the only one who sounds like the Ozi version), William H. Macy as Glenn, Matthew Lillard as Luc Fromage, Carson Daly, Molly Shannon; Scrubs' Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke, Neil Flynn, John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes, Mel Brooks, Joe Snow; Brian Henson as Scooter and Janice; Jerry Nelson like Robin, Frog, Statler, Pops and Floyd Pepper and Kevin Clash like Sam Eagle. The most memorable moment for me is on the Moulin Rouge stage, in addition to the well-known face, not fantastic. He was named Emmy for outstanding music and lyrics for "All Matters". The Muppets were the number 100 100 icon for the largest pop culture. Enough!
