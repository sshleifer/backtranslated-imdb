The joke Dick and Jane couldn't attract so many levels. The writing ended with loose ends, for example, it seems that one of the biggest conflicts was Jim Carrey's DIck Harper's accusation, but writers never follow this conflict. Basically, the story is weak and mostly uncomfortable, but Carrey saves some scenes with his physical humor, but frankly, Jim Carrey was not very funny in this movie, and Tea Leone could also have been his appearance because he was not funny. This is just one example of Hollywood banking with the development of franchise activists with the evil unoriginal story.
