In general, it was a traceable film. I didn't stop it or stop it - it's a clear sign of a boring movie - so it passed the first attempt. Best of all, it got into the story soon, there was no boring unneeded back story characters. <br /> <br /> It's never going to be a great movie. It's also not a great B movie. I would recommend this to the comforter / horror fans who don't talk directly about video releases. However, there is violence. Unfortunately, deaths were rather dry and unimaginable. The special effects of the computer were actually pretty good. The way the "creature" used its chains in some scenes reminded me of the comic books "Spawn" and "Ghost Rider". it seems like talking with some accent. I had to look at the credit to even realize that it was filmed in Lousinia. <br /> <br /> Like most low-budget movies, there are small pages for filming. Lack of time and money would be key factors. For example, in one scene, it went dark in the middle of the afternoon for seconds ... during a short ride. Another example was a double stunt when the "creature" was not pulling out of the truck by falling on the "creature". He also seems to wear a shirt on the scene. /> All in all, I didn't get angry with this movie, but I didn't love it. I will probably never try it again, but if a friend owns it, I can check it again in a few years.
