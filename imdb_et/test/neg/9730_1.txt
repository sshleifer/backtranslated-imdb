When I saw in the voting committee that some people had given this movie 10 points, I assumed they didn't know the score was not 100. This is a disaster movie in the true sense of the word. Poorly written and weakly targeted so-called actors who are unable to act but are able to adapt. In the first 60 minutes, it seems that the story goes in the same direction, it turns into a hand and participates in a powerful fight with extremely bad special effects. It is not possible to develop an intelligent way for a hero who has limited powers to win, with superpowers, "writer" fraud. It is obvious that the father was added to the so-called story line because it was easier than accepting an acceptable departure. Not that the writing would even know the word "denouement". Some movies go directly to DVD. It should have gone straight to the trash.
