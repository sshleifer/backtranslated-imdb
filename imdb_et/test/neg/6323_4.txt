George Segal lives with his elderly and old mothers. There are many jokes about dementia like Alzheimer's, and most of them are not funny, though here and there were a few funny moments (for example, naked, running through the park scene and old people). At first Segal tries to kill her mother because she is hard to live with and is a selfish man. If the film were similar to Wiley Coyote compared to Roadrunner's comedy, where he was trying again and again to kill this indestructible power, it would have been a hoot - too bad it wasn't the film's overall tone. <br /> <br /> I commend Carl Reiner's attempt to make a tasteless film that is offensive to everyone. I have a special place in my heart for movies such as ED and his parents, eating and KATAKURISI'S ACCIDENT - all the movies about death that dare insult. But the problem is, where is POPPA? there are some funny moments, but it also has a lot of flats and the overall product is amazingly sharp. Plus, topics like homosexual rape, incest and others are really hard to make fun of. I read "GUIDANCE ON CULTURAL MOVIES" that it is considered a cult film, although I just don't see anyone who would like to see it more than once.
