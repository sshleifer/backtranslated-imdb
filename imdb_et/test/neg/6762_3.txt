I've ever heard this movie that you love or hate it. While reading some of the other comments and evaluations, I would like to say that this is true. I'll put myself in the hatred that this crowd makes. I've seen some really bad movies, boring movies, and even low budget movies. This movie is bad for all three. <br /> <br /> This island land Exeter (Jeff Morrow) returns to his sci-fi / b movie roots as dr. Doctor and his assistant Arnie (George O'Hanlon - named George Jetson's voice) with Les's girlfriend's assistant Vera are watching the meteor. This is the majority and it is almost double the date. Lesil has Vera and Arnie has her own "Susie" (Synchro Unifying Sinometric Integrating Equitensor - aka computer). Let's just say that the relationship between George and his robot girl Rosie (and his relationship with "Susie") is more plausible than cold clap-like feelings. However, the common meteor is not the object of all these interests. It's really an alien art nouveau / art deco energy storage device that moves about three feet as a dog. There is also a small alien "energy" that controls Dr Hubbell (namely, the main scientist). An alien is obviously and gone, malicious and evil. Is this the kind of science we share? No wonder the foreigners of the researchers were afraid of us. We're watching these movies first. After that, no questions are needed. <br /> <br /> The whole film is synonymous with watching some really boring scientific experiments, such as cooking an egg or adding color to celery. It's not the fact that it's a low budget sci-fi movie, or it's a bit cheesy and outdated. It's really really boring. The purpose of the whole movie is to find out what's going on. That is all. Most of the things we learn about what is happening are monologues and self-dictation. Now add a dirty dialogue, carton-functional and cheap kits, and you have the Ed Wood clone (by the way, Ed has also made very boring movies - avoid the orgy of the dead). Dialogue ... oh, dialogue. Yemen, like: <br /> <br /> "Under 2 miles from the sea? <br /> <br /> Why not ?! It came through a billion miles of space." <br /> <br /> Or <br /> <br /> "Do you think you can respect a man who is probably barking at all times?" <br /> <br /> This movie is probably trying to pull the Forbidden Planet, This Island Earth, the Magnetic Monster or the same light as the Outer Limits, Twilight Zone. Namely, a small budget sci-fi movie (or TV episode) that is convincing enough to overcome technical difficulties and strange situations. In principle, these films are somewhat enjoyable (story, its underlying meaning or the mere comic nature of dialogue or situations). There's nothing in this movie. It's just 90 minutes of boredom. I couldn't even enjoy it at Ed Wood level. I definitely recommend skipping it and see one of the films mentioned above. It's so bad that if my name was Dr. Forrester, I never think of showing this movie to anyone ... except Frank.
