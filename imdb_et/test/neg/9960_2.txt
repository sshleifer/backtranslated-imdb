OK, this movie seems to be pretty well covered with previous comments, but there are some more things I want to add. The crazy scientist produces serum from the blood of drilled animals to make a man a werewolf. If we stop our unbelief to buy it, fine. But an animal in a cage is a koyot. It would make werecoyote. Didn't the 1942 audience know the difference between wolf and koyot? They are easy to distinguish. It's weak. <br /> <br /> Second, this movie was covered with MST3k in the third episode (Comedy Channel). Joel and the bots took a number of episodes to reach the full-fledged steam and they were not quite there yet. They added enough time to this snoozer to keep you awake, but it wasn't one of their best episodes. They have never mentioned the outstanding exclusion of the real wolf, and this joke was just the air that was waiting to be hit.
