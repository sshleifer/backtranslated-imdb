After eating and properly digesting "pork", I strongly urged and obliged to inform potential viewers that the chewing of this product is the nutritional value of NO FUN and its LOW. <br /> <br /> The nature of this movie is the following WARNING as REVIEW. This is the first time I wanted IMDB to have the "I-don't-care-to-rate-this-movie" button because the only reaction to such boring TRASH is stasis and indifference. All the possible assessments would unfairly do all the other elements listed here, "10" is still questionable, "1" can convince some readers that this is one of the cases where "it is so bad that it is really bad and it's kewl!" , and "5" is not happy too, people may think it's OK-flick and alright if you want fun fun that's not ... Honest to God, it's not "10", zero or 5, it's not something, black hole, COLD WORK WHICH IS EMBRYO. I bought 3 DVDs from this area, which were at least cheap (7 dollars !!!) and good picture quality, I bought it mainly due to the positive and promising comment posted under my own entry. boy, I was DISAPPOINTED, this film is neither shocking nor disgusting nor nervous nor ... it is not even ridiculous, it does not take itself too seriously to laugh, but still serious enough not to be comic. The only order I found in MILDL Y DISTURBING, it is when two strangling heads put a bad dog in their bags and put it on a brick wall ... but even such a cruel premise will only lead to poor execution. The TOILET SCENE referred to below is unrealistic and filmed without any sense of rest, suffering or humiliation - the stools look like painted swamps! At the end of 85 minutes, the meat industry scene is where three men dressed with plastic raincoats (a setting found on the front of the DVD) start destroying the woman's body. I was reminded of "American Psycho" and "Shallow Grave", now these valves are worth watching and true masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Let REALISTIC take turns and don't hurry mythical every Asian-wannabe movie, as it seems recently ... <br /> <br /> If you are looking for some eastern horrors, try Danny Lee's masterpiece The same (English) titled "The Ba Xian fan dian zhi ren rou cha shao bao" (Human Pork Chop) has been since 1992 and has not - without reason - been compared to "Henry: Serial Killer Portrait". The same film, "Ren tou dou fu shang" ("There is a secret of my soup"), which is the same rival, speaks of the same film. It is available as a 3 region DVD and is considered to be the best of "Peng Shi Zhi Sung by Jian Tian Liang". I could add a few more words about special effects ... what special effects ?! ... ... have some cut limbs, they look terribly - in the wrong sense - probably "Made in Hong Kong". <Br /> <br /> This is all the information I share about this topic, hopefully it will be useful ... ENJOY YOUR MEAL!
