Remember the wooden, undramatic literary adaptation of the 1970s at its worst? If you see this wide-ranging, unintentionally fun chocolate box customization. Catherine Z-J is the most guilty person who undoubtedly easily replaces large clothes and gently looks to actually turn the performer. The face played like a melodrama or a Cold Comfort Farm with no fun, this effort is not helped by a script artist who has a tin ear for dialogue who is unable to fully read the irony or tragedy of the novel. Shame on the quality of the talent offered - Joan Plowright, Claire Skinner, Steven Macintosh deserve better.
