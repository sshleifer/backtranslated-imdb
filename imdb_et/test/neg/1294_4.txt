After the huge budget catastrophes in the United States like The Day After Tomorrow and Deep Impact, it was refreshing to see something smaller than a flood. <br /> <br /> Using mostly unknown actors and actors and focusing on England, the wonderful pace was changing to see how the Empire State Building was demolished. <br /> <br /> But for some reason it is not a strong film. Being quite shocking, seeing all of your favorite London attractions demolished with a very counterfeit CGI storm rise, the flood is really not coming. <br /> <br /> The performances are blissful, rescued by the hell of David Suchet and his refreshingly peaceful execution as vice president. He may be a bit too calm for what's going on in the movie, all that has been making him tedious about the fake water around London. <br /> <br /> It is understood that the effect was not as good as TDAT and DI, but the CGI was at best average. <br /> <br /> Bland, disappointing and sometimes even tiring. Observe it when you need to, but follow something else later.
