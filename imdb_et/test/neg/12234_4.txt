The first movie comment ever! I'll start by saying, "Come on! It wasn't bad ... was that?" ... No, actually it wasn't so bad. I laughed and worshiped the movie enough time so I can't say with my heart that it was a garbage. <br /> <br /> It's completely different, this and the epic movie (epic film suck bad .. doh!). "How so?" people would ask. I'll tell you how. This movie is not nearly that pointless, not to mention being stupid (and I say stupid because it is, but being stupid doing funny). Not the best, but hey ... what would you expect - look at the poster! Some people said it was stupid, I find it more objective to write comments (my own opinion), but yes, of course it was stupid, this is a movie "stupid"! Look, I'm not telling you that you go and watch the movie now or else you've taken away a century's event. I'm telling you that if you see the movie somewhere, don't try to open your eyes to the opening credit. See what it's all about - who knows, maybe you like it. <br /> <br /> I give him 4/10 that I'm not so bad and I made a laugh and some unexpectedly good sex-related jokes.
