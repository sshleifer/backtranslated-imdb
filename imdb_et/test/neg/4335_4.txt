Ben Stryker, a former green beret, stops in the small town of Agua Dolee to visit old friend Tick Rand. Soon after driving to Suzuki and getting there. The motorcycle gang, known as the "Savages", led by the tyrant Pigiron, finally penetrates. Stryker does not want to participate, but it will change when friends become real targets. <br /> <br /> Is there any good thing to say about this cloudy element? A tough call, because the only major reason to watch this low-budget car is the huge b-cast that the team was able to prevent from this project. While I don't think it's a complete botch job, it's not terribly good either. Now what's cast! Lance Henriksen (who is the main character, not strange that he doesn't have the most bills, but the last one), Karen Black, George Kennedy, Richard Lynch, Bill Forsythe, Mickey Jones and Leo Gordon. Now, what went wrong with this tiny little budget bungle. The lowness of the material is too one-dimensional to lend heavily to the ideas of better films (namely Mad Max) and offers a complete confusion of ideas that simply would not gel and could have been better thought through. The clich√©s used can be manipulated for good viewing, despite the fact that they are predictable, but "Savage Dawn" seems to let everyone effortlessly rush without the viewer being able to pick it up. The cast is mostly wasted. The bleached blonde Henriksen is powerfully strong and even with a praiseworthy presence that gives her a mysterious glow of character. She doesn't get much to hell and sometimes she gets lost. Too many side effects, but when he threw some bicycle ass, good times went. Karen Black's limping is very strange and it is all about shouting and bullying. Though she can't get to one of the most memorable struggles where Claudia Udy is the flirtatious vixen character of Katie. With a wheelchair, George Kennedy rides outright until the final attack, and Richard Lynch looks embarrassed as a rather superfluous mayor / city mayor. A glimpse of Bill Forsythe just sees it as the main leap of the notorious biker package. <br /> <br /> Junky's story (written by William Milling and Max Bloom) has this comic book book and is very much influenced by the Western genre. Just look at this villain. How they came with their names is a mystery. Maybe they pulled out of the hat. This is quite another speed material that moves one after another into a worse scene. Funny comic elements strike in and a little slippery. Exploitation of Tacky, which is not sharp enough and deaths are quite ridiculous. The clumsy script is full of twisted details and intolerable trite. Simon Nuchter's spotted direction was numbered and lightly positioned. One or two intense scenes cannot make a pace like that of your turtle and many hand-stunts. The carton kits had a dirty look, but they didn't have the organic idea. Gerald Feil's gravel-like cinematic art was better treated when the main focus was not on the city, but on a destructive background (such as the beginning and end of the film), touching some clean cameras. Pino Donaggio's funny musical choices drown his incompetence. <br /> <br /> Savage Dawn is a forgotten fast night movie, which is usually a big obstacle. There are better and more convincing exercises for the same beauty.
