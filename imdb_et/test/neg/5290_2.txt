20 years ago it disappeared when the police found corpses in their clinic, Dr Chopper (yes, he's driving both the chopper and the man). Since then, people around Tanoka Lake (or something) have disappeared, and bodies / body parts have been found all over the place. It turns out that Dr Chopper needs body parts to survive and has taken them from strangers such as a lesbian couple and 5 corporation girls on their own initiative (you get a picture) that passes through Lake Tanoka. When a number of teenagers decide to go camping, they are required to contact a doctor ..... <br /> <br /> Well, if you want to waste time, it's the right choice. The action really varies from bad to mediocre and girls who have been detained for no apparent reason all the time. Every chance to show the skin is taken, but nothing is actually shown. The same applies to special effects that are quite pathetic with every slash that has been filmed at an angle, so you can't see it, but the movie has many parts of the body that all have limped (probably covering how sad they actually see). The plot is quite wrong and the dialogue is quite sad. Only the time I smiled was Dr. Chopper's "Howdy!" when you try to scare. Don't look at it if you are not a hack'n'slash freak. Even then, I would recommend you look at something better.
