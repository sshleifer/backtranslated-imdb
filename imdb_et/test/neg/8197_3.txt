This is a film that was apparently made for entertainment by high school, high school children. Maybe for them it's funny, they can even see something frightening. For me it is bad and the plot is poor, there is no value for an adult viewer. I saw this movie weak and dull. Sometimes it was possible that the film might become interesting, but it never really happened. The creatures look pretty good, but after a few seconds they don't seem to have any substance other than the look. Sometimes I wasn't sure if the film was trying to do another comedy or it was another test of horror again. This movie wasn't good for me.
