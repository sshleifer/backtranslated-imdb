this film had many possibilities - it is a great story and it can be very scary. but of course tim burton doesn't really make horrible movies, he makes a crazy movie. and I usually like Tim Burton's stuff. but I thought this film was very weak. the best thing about film (and it is really worth it) is an artistic direction - the film has amazing immaterial quality. the script was not good. it was partly boring and confusing in other parts and no characters were built. I really didn't care that people had broken up with a kind of creature. I thought that Johnny Deppil was a good approach to character, but given that the script was weak, he couldn't go too far with it - and I was very upset with tests with a small accent on him and Christina Ricci Anyway, it is unfortunately not a great movie and not worth it vision if you are not interested in artistic direction.
