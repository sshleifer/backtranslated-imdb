It was the most adorable terrible movie I had to sit on. 30 minutes of film and I couldn't take it anymore. Seriously, don't worry about it if you are not a sentimental nutty or one of those pseudo-arty types that like this type of hell to feel more culturally. Bored, though action is good; The child is just irritating. Some scenes are very strange with very strange close-ups. I don't know why they made the whole movie black and white, but any impact they had hoped was unfortunate. There was just something to look at, and while it's a sad story, probably, it's just so stupid that it's hard to feel the sympathy of characters.
