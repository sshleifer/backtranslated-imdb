She finds herself in the obviously unexplained rash of suicide. Are they really suicidal again? Looks like a ghost is open. Guess? The rubber has long black hair that hides his face and moves with this head or hands in a twisted way, making a very strange sight. Repetitive theme music plays in unexpected places to proclaim the arrival of a ghost, and the odd spirit, similar to the small twigs wrapped in, is always accompanied by this unhappy spirit. Does it sound familiar? Well, if you've seen some Asian horror films in the last ten years. With this movie "Ring", "One Last Speech", and some recent horrors of strong and endless borrowings, this film is trying to climb an interesting and worn plot, but we have seen it before. Avoid being desperate for the last 10 years or seeing other Asian horror films.
