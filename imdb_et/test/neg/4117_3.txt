Time is theoretical, so I get a script for some freedom. <br /> <br /> I also understand the idea that by changing only one variable, you can potentially change how history opens. <br /> <br /> However, I cannot understand how time has changed. We are being given a series of "time waters" which gradually reduce the evolution of the planets. Although this is a convenient plot device because it allows our heroes enough time to solve the problem, it makes no sense. Certainly, if you change the variable and the variables of the planet have changed significantly or even completely, then by the time you come back to the "future", the evolution process is already created and no waves are needed. ? After all, why should the change that took place over 65 million years should wait for it to be effective? The fact that the moth was predicted in a timely manner can give it some credibility, but the life of this moth 65 million years ago had changed significantly, ergo, any changes in evolutionary history would have begun and would not depend on our return to our present time. <br /> <br /> To solve the problem, the team goes back to avoid changing the variable. By doing this successfully, we see that changes in evolution never happened and that no one even remembers events! Surely the solution should work for the original change? I like a good scrolling sci fi adventure, but if it's not set in a "far distant galaxy", it must have at least some basics of theoretical opportunity to make it really fun. <br /> <br /> A good premise, a bad plot, reasonable action and just a twist of Jurassic Park. <br /> <br /> Not in my "Look again" list.
