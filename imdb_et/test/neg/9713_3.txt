Pete Meteor. I saw it as "authentic" and "pearly". I got this movie on Saturday afternoon. I wish it was not. <br /> <br /> It was probably Mike Myers' first dramatic role. Unfortunately, it had to be this movie. The first thing you notice is that Pete's meteor suffers from a complete lack of a plot. Or, rather, a number of small sub-blocks that are not really connected and do not go anywhere. Young Orb Mickey lives with his parents with his younger brother and sister. In the garden, meteorite comes in and finally the scientist, Hugh, collects. Regardless of the title of the film, Mickey is the one who claims to be a meteor, and the "story" actually has nothing to do with the meteor in any form or form. So far, many other signs and sub-blocks are being introduced. But as I said before, they're not going to go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Things go from a pretty family movie to a dark thriller when Pete (Mike Myers) introduces and starts playing. Micky accuses her of the death of her parents, even though we never really said what happened or why. Hugh has problems with romance because his girlfriend can't go over her cosmic charm. And Pete's drug-related past begins to catch up with her and temporarily pulls her girlfriend and the rest into the mix when the shady characters begin to kill her. It looks like this is the main plot until you realize that it doesn't even have a role until the end of the movie, making everything else feel useless. Hugh's Girl Problems, Mickey's Bad Behavior, Meteor ... What's up with EARTH? Not so much. <br /> <br /> So the "plot" is separated and half of it is meaningless. But a good number of characters can save it, right? Keyword: good. Most of the symbols are terribly unlikely people, most of whom would like to die terribly. At least I know I would. Despite the title, Mickey seems to be the main character, which is a very bad step when you see him in action. She is one of the little kids in the WORST I've seen in the film, with a very bad attitude. He "borrows" the car, harasses and speaks to Hugh (adult) for taking a meteor, he is actually trying to burn his house when he doesn't get his way, and even tries to spend Peti's knife. You think this child is on the way to jail. Unfortunately, one of the worst things about this movie is that Mickey will never get what comes to him. I'm not sure at what point you should express your character sympathy because he's always a nasty little one. He is the leader of his brother and sister, so they come forward predictably and upside down and follow exactly what he does. Amazingly, they're pushed back so far that I don't even remember their names. They may not even be there. <br /> <br /> Their grandmother is pretty much a border alcohol. He tends to be as disgusting to Hugh as Mickey, and loves to push people out of his house and give them bad sounds if he doesn't slip the flower bottles and drink himself foolishly. Pretty ridiculous when you consider that he should take care of three children. His problems with alcohol have never really been addressed, although he collapses over time. <br /> <br /> Hugh is one of the few nice characters in the movie, but it's just because he's a punching bag for most of the symbols and takes their confusion without giving it back. The children treat him terribly, but he always comes back and tries to teach them and do beautiful things with them. He has a taxi driver girlfriend who seems to take every aspect of his life as a personal insult, trying to leave him several times in a movie when he goes to his cosmic lingo or does something to prove he's not exactly the same wavelength as the rest of the characters (fortunately ). <br /> <br /> Then Mike Myers is Pete. Pete, despite being the only definite goal and plot in the film, is extremely underrated and does not play any role until the other side. Unfortunately, Myers stayed in this situation for a dramatic role. Even if Pete gets the time on the screen, half of it is just Myers who runs through the blind alleys and hides in small corners. And while he was the only real point of this film, when his plot line brings the movie to the end, it is a strange, inexhaustible conclusion with all the characters that laugh with a good note, a quick and strange explanation. a movie that makes you wonder if they just filmed a movie you just watched. <br /> <br /> The only thing Pete sees in meteor is the role of Mike Myers as Pete, and this is when you can pass this scattered confusion long enough without being associated with the other person due to unlikely characters and a non-existent line. No, sir, I didn't like it at all.
