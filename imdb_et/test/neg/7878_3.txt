I never understand the contradictions and leaps caused by the film. Especially in France and neighboring countries (for example, in Belgium, where I live, for example), "Baise-Moi" was declared the most shocking and ill-thought-out social drama you could ever experience. Yeah, of course! Maybe it might be a little shocking, maybe (how often do you see someone getting your ass up?), But a weak and pointless plot certainly didn't cause me to think much. "Baise-Moi" is another of those who blame everything that goes wrong in society, and they are generally not very convincing. About 99% of people in this society work perfectly well, so why would you blame it exactly for the same society on two whims of hopeless nymphs and hopeless deeds? The two main characters and their unhappy life are presented separately and blinking. Nadine killed her roommate; Manu lowered his brother and two met at an abandoned train station late at night. They decide to travel with France, leaving off sex and blood wherever they stop. Although we have been constantly exposed to pornography and violence, this film is very boring. As girls always show themselves, the dialogues are sheep and the people they get (and kill?) Are very uninteresting. If people want to make porn movies, it's good for me, but please don't pretend it's a film of art. If you exclude the work of the church and the hip camera, you can see that it has not attracted pornography. Cool the sound!
