The moon with Crash is not so wrong. Basically it is a Rocky Jones episode, Space Ranger joined the film. However, it is very dated. Winky treatment for Russia is a good example of this. It should be remembered that it was aimed at children in the 1950s. It is a success in this regard. If you like sci-fi for children in the 1950s, look at it. You see John Banner sgt. Schultz's role. He's doing a pretty good job. All in all, I'd give it to 10 out of 10. Not big, but not bad.
