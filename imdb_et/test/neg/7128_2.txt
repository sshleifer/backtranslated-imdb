Although I thought to myself "Oh God why!" At first I thought "The right one might be the medium", but in most parts the acting and the plot is cruel. <br /> <br /> Every part of it was so predictable, though the first film seemed to be a big similar to the circle, it was half a decent movie, but it just seemed to take all the good things first and make them terrible. Some bits changed the audience's wet, eg. This part had fallen off the Geller building. My girlfriend had to tell me I was quietly off because I had to comment on what happened next, and several times less than I was right. <br /> <br /> Why going home makes him come, it makes no sense. It was a bad excuse for many killings and no depth at all. <br /> <br /> You will see everything that has come that just left you feeling there is no point in looking. Oh shes behind ... didn't see one coming to the shoulders *. <br /> <br /> Surely these people have to think ... oh I don't know if you are wearing a knife or at least try and fight back instead of eating, but someone's hair? At best, during the movie I was very scared (and I mean lightly), I just cried for credit because they rolled out a short "Oh thanks to God". If you haven't done it yet, don't waste your time and money on it; pointless, plot less, sorry for the sequel!
