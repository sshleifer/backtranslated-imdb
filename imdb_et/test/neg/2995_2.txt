I should live this movie, but I don't. It has won international awards, it is a stranger (usually I like such films), it's a slow movement (again something I like) and has no free sex or violence. the problem is that it is boring. We have two friends in the same village in Turkey, another "successful". an unsuccessful person arrives in Istanbul to stay successful, trying to get a good job at sea. Both live a life that is unfulfilled, meaningless, and small. <br /> <br /> Well, this is not the first time such a movie has been made. I didn't see anything new about this tired topic. There's a long time, just someone standing and watching the sea or sitting in a cafe or watching TV. I understand that such a thing is to show the emptiness of their love, although it is that I got the idea in the first 15 minutes. In the other two hours I don't have to beat that over. <br /> <br /> Symbolism is also a bit difficult. Fish from Live Minnow Tile, one out of the plate and slipping around in the middle of his death. Symbols are the best if they are not obvious, but there are backgrounds that create mood just below the viewer's awareness. <br /> <br /> The film is so apathetic that it doesn't even reflect the score 1, so I gave it to 2. To evaluate 1 takes talent is bad. This film didn't have so much energy.
