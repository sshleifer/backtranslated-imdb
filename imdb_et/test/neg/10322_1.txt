The purchased DVD version had Sandra Bullock on the cover, but we discovered it was a picture of another movie. Unfortunately, he's very little in this movie. However, you can see how far he has come. <br /> <br /> Another bright spot in the movie, apart from its very small part, was a couple of scenes shot in NYC and New Jersey in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Sound is terrible. Sometimes the background noise is so strong that it is difficult to hear the dialogue. Sometimes the dialogue is changed without background noise, which is disturbing. For example, sometimes when they are in the car, the noise of the car is too loud and then there is no extra noise at all. The director loves the close-ups of the face, and then it is clear that the film is dubbed because the words do not match the lip movement. The majority of the film sounds like the people talking on the tin can. <br /> <br /> Background music, with music, is a nuisance instead of adding a movie. <br /> <br /> The direction is ridiculous. Goofy's camera corners and sound effects make the movie a joke, especially at a time when there should be tension, like in the middle of arms battles. Writing is terrible. There are some subplots that have no meaning, and most of the symbols come out when they are very stupid because their motivation is not at all. The writer / director tries to explain some of the relationships between men in Vietnam but none of this makes sense. These senior assassins and ex-soldiers do not seem to be able to see the shadow of other people or listen to other people moving. Participants move into a peaceful panic and calm down without warning. It's just a combination of poor leadership and poor writing. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are so bad that at first we thought we were stumbling upon someone's film that just happened to Sandra Bullock. If you want to laugh in really badly made student movies, this movie is for you. Otherwise, avoid this movie.
