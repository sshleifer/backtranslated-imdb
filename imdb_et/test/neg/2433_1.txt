I can't believe this show was okay. Initially, J.P. Manoux is doing a terrible job for David Spade and Pacha's voice is too deep compared to John Goodman. Theme song is so annoying and episode plots are so stupid! The only good thing about this show is that Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton will be the voices of Yzma and Kronk. This exhibition is a waste of money and a waste of time. Half of the episodes are copied from the movie. In my opinion, the Emperor's new Groove was one of the best children's films of the year, but they finished Kronk's New Groove and this show. You should look at exhibitions such as Spongebob, Fair Oddparents, Danny Phantom or Kim Possible, but not this show.
