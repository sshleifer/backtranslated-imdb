It's not a big cinema. The film is looted and in many places it is the original copy of Carrie. Parallel to the original film is striking, but there is an improbability that the telenetetics abilities are innate. <br /> <br /> I can't say I didn't like the movie because it was at least a couple of hours past ... but they went along when one read an unwanted book on a long train journey. This book would not be a great literature, but would have absorbed it for some time and soon after that forgot that it merged with numerous other books. Similarly, the film was clever when it lasted, but perhaps it is forgotten. At least I think it is. I can't remind you of it again !!
