The film wasn't really an ATTENTION, especially a plot-wise, but a leading actor (and hairy!) Elected to play a leading role. I would have chosen someone else. The idea of ​​"going to America" ​​was a very brilliant and main character who asked everything he ever felt, made him somewhat pleasurable, but not very much, if the leading actor had a pasty stain. <br /> <br /> The story was interesting. This raises the question of how the issue of cloning will be handled in the future. Certainly, cloning would not be allowed for movie purposes, but it is still the right argument to date. Clones are still people ... right? <br /> <br /> The film was not very special, but it is still much better than the cheese released in the 1970s. Let us not forget the "giant spider invasion". I'll give it to 4, because it wasn't stinky, but the MST3K version does this 10. (I like Dr Super Mario!) You like this movie, but it's not your favorite.
