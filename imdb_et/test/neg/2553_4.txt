I must say that I was disappointed with this film. Although it is well-functioning and targeted, the base story just moves too slowly. <br /> <br /> According to the second mood, I would have liked it better. I swear a lot, but rarely smiled; and there was indeed tension to discover who won. But in contrast to another film that my wife rose on the same day (neither of us had heard before), it was a comparison. <br /> <br /> If you see a lot of movies, watch it all - it's clearly better than your average price. But if you (like me) have a limited time and want to watch only the best and most entertaining, save it later. <br /> <br /> [Price: 7/10]
