This movie was boring from start to finish. Okay, so I welcome Boorman for raising the global recognition of Burma, but that's all he does. About 10 minutes after the movie, I thought "no, here we go again" and I could have told you exactly what will happen in the next 80 minutes. In this role, Patricia Arquette was out of her depth, and her action was woody and convincing. Think about it, being so terribly exhausted with a conventional script, maybe boredom, and it is reflected on the screen. A lot of the movie was just ridiculous. At one stage, Arquette's older companion strikes and is sloping on the ground. In the next scene, he will hit the forest, obviously trying to break the world record of 100 meters! - Or maybe he's just trying to get out of Boron! If you find it hard to sleep at night, play Beyond Rangoon on your VCR and you won't be snoring at any time. I rarely criticize the film as strongly as it does, but in that case it is completely justified.
