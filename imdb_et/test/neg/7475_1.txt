When the open game is seriously disrespectful of the US flag in the United States Marines, the film is facing a difficult road, but unfortunately it was downhill. The military advisor, who is probably a retired US marine environment, is also credited, making it even more amazing that this incredible protocol and law violation has gone unnoticed. What is even more amazing is how they simply exaggerated how the KIA is reported from the sea, then buried in a very short order without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body, or even had a body there. The US government still finds itself lost during World War II and it takes several months to detect the residues. Military landings will remain MIAs for months or years and will only be declared as KIA if the scrap is positively identified or after years of bureaucracy. Here it is assumed that this will happen in a few days or weeks. Maybe it will happen in Denmark, but not in the US. Obviously, none of the people involved ever had any involvement or respect for US military personnel. <br /> <br /> Moreover, there are many other ridiculous moments when characters fail. There had to be really extended meetings between the author and the actors because they tried to find their motivation for such washing. Working with the script may have helped, but it seems to have been done on the ground, working from Cliffs Notes. It is not possible to know whether the script was originally terrible, or if it was the author, or who are middle-class athletes who are responsible. In both cases, this is a terrible movie that you should never have done.
