Though shocked and gore, I found the film at least disappointing. Impacts and puppets were impressive, yes, and humor was well timed, but ... something missing. Look, the first act of the movie is to create the nuances of Jack Jack's character, despite the fact that everything we need to know about our aggression is delivered within minutes of the first title card. As for storytelling and many setbacks: unnecessary. Most of them are focused on eating Freddy Krueger, then vomiting, then eating some more, then screaming hands and saying something gentle or rude. Throughout the time, Jack has scores with short scenes about his rage problems with a therapist. (Certainly the movie has fun scenes - a great dialogue that is worth a lot of laughter.) Then Jack decides that he will kill some monsters. And then it's over. <br /> <br /> First of all, Jack Brooks is a setback for the 1980s horror films: Monster Slayer has many options, but it is purposeful and sticks without conflict or resolution. <br /> <br /> Hopefully these issues will be dealt with before Jack Brooks VII: Jack goes into hell or Jack vs Ash production.
