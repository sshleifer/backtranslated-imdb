I rented it one by one. I picked up the video and looked back and thought "shameless Blair Witch rip-off". Then, from the moment of negligence, I took the "Francisville test" thinking that it was something else. My horror of getting home and understanding my mistake was far more frightening than what this movie offered. Boring Characters, bad functioning and the feeling that we saw the Blair witch project and we can do the same - it works by looking at you quickly on credit. I am not one of the filmmakers guilty of laziness or despair, but after this awakening festival I felt the need to warn everyone: don't waste your time, you have life.
