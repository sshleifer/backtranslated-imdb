This is a very boring and uninteresting action film and without Chuck Norriset it would have been unbearable, plus a low budget shows great time! Some struggles were good, but the story is ridiculous, and there are no dangerous villains at all. The dialogue was ridiculous. I had some difficulty with finishing this film, but Chuck Norris made it a bit more tolerant. I really have nothing to say, because I paid only half the attention because it was so incredibly boring, but it pulled a little bit to the end. The direction is terrible. Don Hulette, doing terrible work here, sad photography, terrible pace and in general the movie seemed boring! No gore. Operation was terrible. Chuck Norris is very good here, he hits this ass and made the movie almost tolerable (Chuck rules!). George Murdock is a terrible villain and very convincing. Terry O'Connor, this is a good chemistry with Chuck. Michael Augenstein, is like a Chuck brother. Generally it is quite easy to open! * 5 (Chuck records this BOMB rating).
