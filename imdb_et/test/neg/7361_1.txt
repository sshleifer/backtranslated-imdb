What begins as a satisfying film degenerates into one of the most inconsistent, insecure, incompetent, foolish trials of recent years. <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible. It is a derivative that hangs on every flick of proper intimidation that you don't think without any intimidation. Does it copy the recent trend of horrible children or ghosts running through the camera or the horror of the old school of the Fulci generation of gates. The worst thing is that even a cat jumps out of a cat. you jump. To avoid.
