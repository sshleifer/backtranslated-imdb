I have seen many Japanese horror films and I have to say that some of them are really interesting, but everything is the same. this is no exception. A ghost is a black haired girl who scares her victims by doing something other than walking and dying. The difference is just a ghost motif. the rest is the same as every time: black hair girl, strange things that happen to some media (photos), horrible action. looking at this flick, I found myself constantly asking why I wasted my time looking at things someone else has done so much before. some scenes that are pretty nice, I give it to 3 out of 10
