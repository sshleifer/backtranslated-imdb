I should know better. I've seen too much Rob Lowe's early work to wait for something good about this movie, even if it's about ice hockey. <br /> <br /> Here's another tired sports theme. Kid has the potential for greatness, it is obvious that it goes a long way when his brilliant attitude does not break things. And the boom, it comes out of it as such a loving player-type champion. Is it all you can say about sports movies? There must also be other competitions that athletes do. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this film must be one of the biggest cheeseballs. Communicating with everyone is just a fool, not a buggy, funny way. And I can't think of any of the secondary features that could boost my position. Not actors (certainly not Swayze, who plays Lowe's reluctant mentor), not the story, not the music and the very few skating sequences. I am usually the infant of the 80's movies, even if they tend to be a little fish (ie North Shore, Karate Kid), but it doesn't even make a good 80's trash. For good 80's sports movies, look elsewhere. There are many of them.
