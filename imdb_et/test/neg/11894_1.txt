It must be the most boring movie I've ever seen. The only positive thing I can say is that fortunately I didn't see it. We were given a free exhibition at the school and all the audience sessions just sat there embarrassingly, wondering how much fun would start. This spam is a badly filmed film, too long. The real idea why it took a movie was about 10 seconds. The only ones interested in this movie are those who lost their job and want to know why. They may find some interviews interesting. A different kind of change could have made this interesting documentary, but I doubt that the interviews made were in no way related. As it is, it's just a tragedy to see and be part of it. OUT OF FILM ALL EXPENDITURE!
