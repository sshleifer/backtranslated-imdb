Ty Cobb is by far the most interesting and harshly crazy athlete ever to live. His baseball career was incomparable to absurd statistics, brilliant strategy, and pure and non-violent violence. Every game he played was human ability and cruelty. So, of course, the film about him touches on it, but focuses on writing his biography from author Al Stump. Now, this is not a theoretically terrible idea, like Cobb himself, moving towards paranoid dementia when the years were progressing and his brutal outbursts even though parents are shocking even with today's desensitized standards. But instead of focusing on those events that I think it was just too interesting, the film is a pseudo-fixed traffic film that has a clich√©-clipped plot that causes knowledgeable Cobb fans to cry vinegar tears. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cobb is doing quite well, but somehow he succeeds in his comics follow. Most of the stories about Cobb are hardly believable, but his even cumbersome looks so impossible as unnecessary. Robert Wuhl, depicting writer Al Stump, is a dark virtue of talent. She sucks life from every scene, trying to turn this movie into her Nagasaki. There's a reason why we don't see him as a leading man (Arliss doesn't read. It's hardly an exhibition). Even Cobb's and Stump's completed, unavoidable "role-shifting" is even worse for his pure inability to express words that don't sound like a weak book with a tape-reading voice. <br /> <br /> While all the terrible writings and wonderful films are made, there is one sequence that stands out so far from the rest of the shortcoming that it is almost impossible to receive the same movie. Strong shine is a hyperstilized flashback sequence that shows Cobb's powerful psychology and brutal athleticism. The camera is moving in a strange way and the whole event seems to be a dream, as the monster Cobb is a unique game style. Changing each slide, stroke and impact becomes even stronger thanks to the enhanced sound and the intensity of the Tommy Lee Jones OWNS master. This makes the viewer beat the possibilities of Cobb's true bio-region with the same actor. It's worth this unique couple of minutes watching this movie to see what might have been. <br /> <br /> I may be a little unfair about this movie because of my knowledge of Ty Cobb and wanting it to be something that is not, but making such a boring movie meaningless. I'm glad that Ron Shelton's career has slipped since then.
