I watched movies on demand and saw Underdog for free and it was only 82 minutes so I decided to watch it. I didn't expect much, but it exceeded my expectations terribly. Everything was worthy of the movie. Dialogue was cruel, including many terrible stoppers. The jokes were also terrible. I found myself screaming and moving my TV screen when I was under the trash. It hit her target very well, but I don't see anyone else enjoying the movie. It made me very angry and almost cry because all this movie was terrible for that. <br /> <br /> The only enjoyable thing about this movie was that he could watch it 1/10 after that. I ask you to avoid it at all costs. I understand that this is done for kids, but it's not pleasant.
