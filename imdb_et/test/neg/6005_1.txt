OKAY. First I said I just wanted to check if the average rating of this movie is down to or exactly -1. But 5.9. It's faster than any killer procedure - -. It made me curious about what people wrote here .. which eventually created me to create an account to give my 2 truths the "fraud" that I find here. <br /> <br /> How dare you even mark this movie in the same sentence as Seven? The only thing they got together is that they show different crimes. That is all. And "Best Thriller 1999!" ? have you even seen another movie this year? Or any other film in your life at all? 1999 is not the year that people are reminded of RESURRECTION ... what are the actual movies like 8mm, wide eyes, Arlington Road, Double Jeopardy? (They are actually more than a "thriller" if it could ever be ..). The resurrection does not deserve even a commitment to the second of 1999. <br /> <br /> Really, you can't be serious. I watched this movie yesterday with my girlfriend, which his friend suggested. "Great movie with Christopher Lambert"! ... what I haven't seen yet? Hmm .. <br /> <br /> First look at the covers: OK, something special. At second glance, you don't have to have supernatural powers to be aware that they just reflect Lambert's head, cut his nose on it and on it, made it a fictional negative pattern to get a killer image of COVER. You could even guess that they had a trainee to eat gallons of marshmallows only in the title that creepy (booooh! -.-) mouth .. whatever. It turned around and the beginning of the plot .. "The harbor in Chicago ... blabber blabber". Hey, six-year-old could have made this statement more exciting. Now, with the tremendous excitement that comes from the amazing presentation of movies. Because it's not so bad that it's still Christopher Lambert. My assumption was wrong. "Proven is wrong", which means that it was brutally made by the worst imaginary deadly mixture ever known to mankind (every actor, but the tops are "I can make 1-Liners!" Police Commissioner, Prudhommes Wife __ actually a better detective than Prudhomme when he brings together several incidents yet to ABSOLUTELY RECOGNIZED HINT !!!! -.- __ and .. yes .. Prudhomme itself) where there is a squadron of inhumane counterfeit feelings, 1 minute logical errors - a cycle, the long-drawn conclusions of the light year, which I think are some thinking human being, and last but not least, a camera that was obviously a hyperventric kangaroo. Well, and if you don't fully brain your brain (these aren't spaces to see it), you should know who is who and what is after you pay. 30 minutes, just because you know each event after the first. It's exciting. It's exciting, because this movie will make you think it will be the future. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: this is the worst movie I remember according to FAR. Trust me, I've seen a lot of terrible movies that were at least just bad experiments or bad copies of another movie. But resurrection is the best example of how to fail in all possible aspects. It was so bad that after she was frightened by her unfairly low quality e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g, I laughed more often than in any recent comedy, just because I was fascinated by the team's Brazilian release of such a co-ordinated film strip. The good thing about Lambert is that he was in Highlander: Let's go a year later, so he can give him grace. ; ^ O <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend watching this movie EVERYONE. Finally, we had great fun watching it: ^ D. I guarantee you, after you have completely watched the Resurrection (be brave, you can do it!), Then you worship the level of action in any day's soap. <br /> <br /> Or look at the highlander one more time ... I'll do it.
