Jesus Christ, what the hell happened here? This is one of the most boring films I've ever seen, how they might have got such a nice idea of ​​a movie. In fact, I was that it was, though it was like Blair Witch, but the creatures of real aliens who drove the camera. Damn, I've been shrinking fast back and forth, sh * t, and I never do it while watching a movie. The high rating IMDb here makes me believe that real aliens are giving this barrel 10. <br /> <br /> Invasion is about well, invasion. The film begins by saying that everything you see is real, blahblahblah. Then they go and tell me about the special camera system used in the car, as if I have to believe their bull * don't enjoy this movie. The next thing you know is that I see the most boring car ever filmed in the woods at night. Is it a movie or a Disney theme park? The first 20 minutes is a boring dialogue between police officers when you see the grass and one straight path with a flashlight. Where the hell were the foreigners? They slept of course! Then we find out that bad behavior has not only been played in high school, because the policeman behind the camera goes out of his car to look for a missing man who was "nighting" and stumbled upon a mysterious meteorite. I don't know what happens to him? No matter where we see the "night night" that walked like a zombie. The police are probably too stupid to notice that there is something wrong with this man. Obviously he was really stupid because a zombie / alien man injects an alien parasite into a policeman's ear, making him a stranger. Then the policeman / alien goes back to his car, looking for a young couple who had sex in the woods for a while, arrives at them, switches to an alien, and then the girl rides in the police car and flees. If this quick introduction to the plot didn't get it with your head that this movie was bad, it would take 40 minutes. Watching this movie is as painful as repeatedly with a plastic fork. The script, which may be interesting on the back of the DVD box, is poorly targeted and unfortunately, we have left another boring dread of the DVD. <br /> <br /> The only thing that woke up to me was that the constant flashing and loud sound effects (painfully). If the same forest trail is not sufficient within 63 minutes, we have to endure the crappy with flashing techniques to "scare" a bad actor who gets old and annoying, rather quick viewer and constant embarrassment. <br /> <br /> Feel that you need to rent it, I'll tell you why? There are better SciFi / Horror movies. Even the frightening body of the Snatcher invasion remake is more interesting. For the love of all things, don't worry about your mess. My eyes were bleeding and for the first time I wanted to commit suicide. 1/10, avoid this as a disease.
