Satiric Film Website Dateline Hollywood funny that "Mask Son" was all the practical joke star Jamie Kennedy, who played "The Jamie Kennedy Experiment" at the New Line Cinema. If only. And if only this movie was half-funny than this satire piece. <br /> <br /> "Mask" was the perfect tool for pulling the face of Jim Carrey, who put so many viewers on it; it also delighted men over the age of 12 by introducing Cameron Diaz. So the follow-up minus both were not a good idea, plus you would have thought that New Line would have learned its lesson after "Dumber and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd." But not ... though fair, all new ones are cast in line with the original comic (where the mask went from owner to owner). According to Lance Khazei, and under the guidance of Lawrence Guterman, there is no counterpart, except for a fairly fairly decent FX, which the ordinary house (industrial light and magic improves on "Ally McBear's dancing baby and their own" Baby's Day Out "with Tippett Studio, Giant Killer For Robot, Digital Dimension, and Other Supported) and Even More Career Challenge when our hero is working in an animation company (responsible for such jewels as "Siamese popeed"), naming his character after Tex Avery and working not only with classic cartoons but with real clips. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the last approach does not work really, partly because most attempts to bring the cups to live in action fall into the apartment (especially cars that are in party mood) and mostly because of Flintstones, Woody Woodpecker, "Duck Amuck" and especially "One Froggy Evening" respect this film's weakness. Plus movie fits shambolic slapstick next to tight sentiment (based on theme story of family, our hero is not ready to be son, and his nemesis - Alan Cumming as Norwegian god Loki - is far from apple odin's eye ... and that's what Bob Hoskins here in Odinina does, even after "Super Mario Bros", is out of me), and Kennedy just isn't in the same league as Carrey's girls bets - though it's not like he gets any help from the script. Also note that unlike Diaz, a very cute Traylor Howard (mother of a woman's son) can't do much; Maybe giving her a mask has helped the film. <br /> <br /> Cumming, Hoskins, Steven Wright and Magda Subanski are still losing points. suspiciously shortened driving time (which would take into account some missing holes in the plot and scenes that seem to be missing); and in an incredibly bad attempt at the inner joke, when our hero does not sell the "green boy" concept in an animated TV series - "Mask" became an animated TV series in real life and was much better to follow than this sequel. The fact that it was actually opened in the UK before the US should tell you everything ... what it and "Blade: Trinity", New Line seems to be intending to market in a curve with a steep aftermath of "Two Guys and A Girl". "What's next," Butterfly Effect 2 with Nathan Fillion? <br /> <br /> Someone will stop it.
