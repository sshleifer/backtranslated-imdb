This film was ridiculous from the start. Let me record this movie all the time. A woman who sells corn oil to local people takes her cousin or nephew, and she persuades her to open her own home cafe. He does and he and his cousin are close. Later, she has a scene where she locks her lips. Later, the woman discovers that the old boy is coming back from the prison and tense between them, folding down and out in the cafe. Woman's cousin / nephew is loved by man. The end was terrible, the story was terrible, and if I could get back the wasted time for this movie, I would appreciate it. Confident skipping.
