The plot has something from white hunters who are white female tribes in the jungle / plains of Africa. It's turkey and some. Indeed, this is an early inappropriate film material from early sound and silent films mixed with poorly shot recent (release), safari, film material from men. In the Gorilla suit, there are seafarers, northern natives of the sea (used to represent people in the middle of Africa), women in bikini, horrible narration and a boy with a cloth that makes up the whole body (racially sensitive). It's a movie to sit and joke, but only with many alcoholic drinks and funny friends. At some other time it can be cleaned up. Its a bad bad movie. Moreover, I am speechless
