The only good thing about this unpleasant dreck is that I didn't have to pay for it. I saw it free in college. And if a college student can't find humor that was free, it's hopeless. <br /> <br /> Fun and poor jokes can't be masked with a great, but amazing design (which goes on the market). I don't know what Michaels Myers did in this movie, but I never do anything depressing. It was nothing but a blatant attempt to take advantage of Grinch's past progress (with his opponents, but I enjoyed it very much). It is not difficult to sit through this failure and ask for better projects to finance it. <br /> <br /> Do you want funny Seussi adaptation? Go to Grinch.
