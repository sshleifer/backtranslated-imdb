I don't see how anyone can say that this was a really good entertaining movie. With some well-known players, it was hard for me to believe that it was only in 2005. The actors are equivalent to amateur drama, with poor amateur knowledge. If you don't want to laugh loudly in an amazing 100 minutes of pure corn, don't worry about downloading or renting the worst I've seen for years. It's been over the days when cowboys took six bullets for six shooters. The more famous the actor, the worse they were, Drury was just sad. I was extremely disappointed with Lee Majors, was he actually against such garbage? It was bad enough when he played six million dollars.
