Two years after this movie, "Juror" appeared. Don't waste your time on it. See "Juror" instead. "Juror" is essentially the same story as "Trial by Jury", which has better action, better targeting and much more engaging aura. William Hurt was not an incredible cop-bad, and Armand Assante, unlike the mob's boss, had dressed him in clown clothing. You didn't get enough of Joann Whalley's character to be disturbed by what happened to him. Nor was it the way he interacted with the jury was convincing or interesting. Kathleen Quinlan's role as a whore / killer was not perfect and, frankly, it was not necessary for the plot.
