What a disaster! Usually, when you criticize a historical film, it is always fun to highlight the inaccuracies that writers usually add to create more "dramatic" situations. But "Imperium: Nerone" is a whole "nuther-type animal. In this movie, you are trying to find something that is confirmed by a historical record in the life of a bad boy-artist-emperor of Rome. Nero is one of Rome's most fascinating. enough to rush into events and interesting people to make a really good movie. The producers of this confusion chose another route that will only lead to scratching the head of an informed viewer. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: <br /> <br /> 1. Nero is depicted as a 6-8-year-old boy, when Caligula is killed by his father for treason, expels his mother Agrippina and sends the boy to the countryside for uplifting by slaves. about six months after Caligula got her four-year term of commencement, and she was only three in murder, Nero's father died for natural reasons, Agrippina was badly behaved in exile, not betrayal; but he had a typical young man in a family of family members. <br /> <br /> 2. Okay, writers say Nero is now about 16 years old when his great uncle Claudius becomes an emperor (in fact he was already 4 years old); Agrippina designs the fall of Empress Messalina and marries Claudius, who accepts Nero. Then he goes to conquer Britain and Agrippina will poison soon after his victory. Nero has been recognized as an emperor, although he is still 18 or 19 years old. Fact: Claudius conquered Britain in the 43's, Two years after the beginning of the reign. He lived until the age of 54. By then, Nero would have had to be 31 years old with any ordinary chronology, but in fact it was a 16-year-old throne. <br /> <br /> History tells us that there were "five good years," where Nero led wisely and well under the guidance of philosopher Seneca and Praetorian commander Burrus. This is shown - sort of - except that the depiction of the Roman Senate as opposed to Nero's good actions is wrong. Senatorial opposition to Nero began only when he started showing madness and began killing senators for a real or imaginary treason. <br /> <br /> 3. Nero's Mother Agrippina is a controlling variety who murdered her uncle's wife to make her son's emperor. After a while Nero heals his confusion and decides to kill him. In the movie, he sends his little Tigellino to death. Everything is true enough, but the reality was so much better! Agrippina was a survivor and did not go easily. Nero tried to poison him three times, but as an old poison he was all good for it and he failed. Then he tried to force him to death when he pulled his bedroom into the ceiling, but it failed. Next he sent him on a trip to a ship that had been deliberately built to break down and sink; when he went, he jumped into the sea and swam to the shore. Eventually he was dead. Now showing everyone who would definitely have improved this movie! <br /> <br /> Other bugs are abundant: Nero's lover Acte was not a slave friend of childhood, he has never rejected him and there is no evidence that he became a Christian. Nero did not commit suicide by grabbing his wrists sitting next to the lake. Etc, etc. etc. The sources of Nero's life are mainly Roman historians Tacitus and Suetonius, both of whom were hostile to him and his memory. However, the evidence shows that he remained very popular with ordinary people, unlike one of the last scenes of anger with the bird, as he leaves the city to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Why did writers and producers take their naturally interesting story with lots of good stuff for every movie and make this piece of piece? Oh, and did I mention how the cheeses and costumes were? Lol. <br /> <br /> An asterisk because it can't be rated lower.
