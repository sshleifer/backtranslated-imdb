<br /> <br /> In Japan and elsewhere in Europe, the new technology allows filmmakers to shop around Hollywood's closed shop and avoid Ed Wood's visible low budget production values ​​to produce compelling films. What is disgraceful is that in the UK we find examples such as "Avatar" (the name of many video games), where brain-dead experiments mimic so many movies and console games that are loved by teenage teenagers - that they are cheap photocopies of clichés are abundant like testosterone kangaroos. Look at some of the summary: <br /> <br /> "The 2024 futuristic London that speaks of a virtual reality virus team facing the ultimate Internet virus." <br /> <br /> Go back and read this quote again - avoid guffawing - and try to find one original idea in it. It should have seemed tired, a sad concept in 1993, never in 2003. Ah, but there is more - the "final virus" has already caused a plane collision, an air traffic control center, and so on. "Child's genius" and it manifests itself as a low-stained, athletic, chest jiggling discount. The Lara Croft imitator, who makes a great line in carving and cod fighting, moves straight from the playground - a product of adolescent fantasy. Oh, and he's accompanied by "Predator" like sound effects to emphasize his remarkable abilities. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is a "futuristic" vision of stunning originality - the Lloyds building was filtered with AfterEffect to look a little green. The budget really shows - what should not be on this day and age. All in all, the useless nonsense of cheese, ham and cliché that Roger Corman would have had in his most disgraceful, desperate moments on the floor of the cutting room. It is a shame that such an alleged love power gave nine minutes of wasted celluloid. <br /> <br />
