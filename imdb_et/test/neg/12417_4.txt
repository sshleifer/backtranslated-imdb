"Wild Rebels" was probably a fun second movie in the trio function of the movie 40 years ago. It is not very outdated, but it was never meant to grow well; it was obviously meant to be a one-time, forgotten amusement for its creation. At this level, this is a good example of the biker flick genre. <br /> <br /> Several elements help to distinguish it from dozens of similar films that are being released at the same time. "Hero", "Rod Tillman" (Steve Alaimo) will be somewhat unimpressive "Everyman" - he is not particularly brave, harsh, talented or beautiful (although he fights the fight against a harsh biker member of the film, and the girl's gang member decides to assist him at the end of the film about his wife. ) The soundtrack is pretty well done with a nice "Ventures" style bass / drum ledge that keeps things moving and saxophones and brass charts that are pretty small in things. And while the script is rather low, all actors act convincingly and with fair energy on their cardboard labels. <br /> <br /> There are many careless technical gases: terrible "day-to-night" scenes that occur in a wide range of daylight, breakage of tires in the swamp, fire sirens that are mistakenly stuck in the track instead of police sirens, a banknote on the ceiling on the ceiling, Luger that sounds like Winchester 30-06. people less than 100 meters away, a detective who kills the biker from the third floor landing with a revolver with a 2-inch barrel. <br /> <br /> There's a whole bunch of buggy stories: Linda (a girl gang member) bans bank protection with a drug-filled syringe, the final shootout is in the lighthouse (!), police traffic blocks won't block you, the police have probably never heard of the fall and the police Detectives have probably never heard of bugs or their secret man around the wire. <br /> <br /> But the plot worships, the cameraman knows what he does, most scenes are amazing quite good, and there are some nice, jerky lining and dialogue here and there that keep energy levels up. (My favorite: "Man, you are messy with private stocks! (St Linda)" No, don't look for it or anything, but if a copy of the MST version should fall into your hands, you should be good, low fun watching it. five hard road "or" hellcats "or even" girl gold boots "(three other MST coated counter culture movies).
