Not every movie about lesbian chicks and vampires that touches our favorite trash / cult game is great. Unfortunately, this film's originality and performances are not in the garbage standards. Show creator's intention to make this cult failed. The trash cans are in the trash because it happens. You can't create such movies with a goal. I don't know if Mr. Creepo is a legend (the first time I heard his name), but if he doesn't know why the reason is ... <br /> <br /> Awful. Even lesbian scenes are pathetic, so all fans of erotic x-plating movies aren't happy because thousands of movies are better than Barely Legal Lesbian Vampires.
