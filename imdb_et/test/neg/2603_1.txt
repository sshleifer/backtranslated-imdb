All of this exhibition is terrible. The prerequisite for this is even that bad writing is a bad laugh. "Dysfunctional family" - this topic has been used too many times, especially by Simpson, which is a great show in great writing and many laughs. Meanwhile, Family Guy has about five minutes in every episode with lots of celebrities jokes and random setbacks. Now, if it was original or funny, I think it would be wise. But no, it's not funny at all. In fact, the only reason why episodes are such is because it is the easiest way to episode after this spam episode easily crank. Much of this show is unigue and what is original is just flat. It is also amazingly raw and uneven, which again may be good if it is still intelligent. Animation is not everything, but from an artistic point of view, this exhibition also fails, proving once again that Family Guy is trying as many cheap jokes and simple shortcuts as possible. People enjoy this example and I don't care about it because people can enjoy everything they want, no matter how much it is for the lowest common denominator. But no, I don't recommend it, especially to anyone who wants to learn a movie or become a writer one day. It is an inexpensive entertainment with a low level of ambition and success. The fact that it is so successful says American things are bad.
