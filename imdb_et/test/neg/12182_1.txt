I can't believe I was sitting through this garbage. The outcrops in D.C. (already mentioned), the seemingly dead body is a bit so obvious that I thought it was RECOGNIZED as a dummy ... until it left a blood ... clean dialogue, a ridiculous plot. I think it is a disgrace that Jill Ireland's last film before her death was a shaker. Don't waste your time - I wouldn't want to. The only saving arm is that it was on the cable, so I didn't waste my money on everything.
