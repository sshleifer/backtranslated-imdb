This movie SUCKS !! It seems they chose scenes at random. Good gore, but a small plot. Sally screams and complains about everything until she becomes a demon. I thought he had PMS. It seemed so. Duplication of this movie is terrible. One scene a woman spoke of and a few seconds before we heard the sound. I knew that at the moment my doubts were correct, not from the US. I tried to follow, but I lost it and found that even for horror movies it was very hard to believe. Some good signs, but not many. It is not worth wasting time.
