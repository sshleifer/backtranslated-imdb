I looked at this series from curiosity who wanted to see if they could, and all this modern technology, Cecil B. DeMille's classical epic of 1956, starring Charleton Heston, Yul Brenner and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. Of course, I was dropped. Yes, they had all the Bible characters right, but they didn't give us any remarkable theater scene that was of interest to you throughout the first movie. If you have a mini-series, then you will need some "rivoting" scenes, "Burning bush", "RED Sea" sharing, "Pharohs Armies" drowning, "Sediment pyramid building", could have been done on today's technology blocks of film scales, like Lord of the Rings or Matrix. Of course, they did not want to leave the following impression of "faith and sacrifice", which is very necessary in these emergency situations.
