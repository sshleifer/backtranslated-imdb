Untold ... Is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story really looks original, but it was bad on the screen. Lance Henriksen, a good actor, came to this. But he did a lot of low budget movies ... you have to pay bills, you know? Kidding. Lance is a great actor, but she got to that stupid participant. Seriously, Andrea Roth was there just for nudity and other actors ... well, they were just there. Editing was lost and it makes me sick! It was the most terrible move that continues to come and it makes you angry. It was also very predictable, boring and slow. It's a weird pace that just goes ... wrong. <br /> <br /> You can't say more ... don't rent it or buy it. You can watch it on TV.
