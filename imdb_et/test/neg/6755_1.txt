I was totally mistaken in commenting on this movie, mostly someone who said they saw it at the film festival and loved it every minute. Waiting for a nice run of an American pie style movie, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all, the camera's work is terrible, I don't think the director knows that cameras can move around scenes rather than stay and act with actors on their own and far. <br /> <br /> Second Landscape! My God, I've seen more furniture in a bird's nest. The club was absolutely convincing when about 3 appendices danced on the back at once. The apartments were bare and lacking in personality. Third, actors. Wow. The director apparently went to the typical "Reaper" character set, the main character with "I don't give f ** k" a character that takes pots. Everything that the protagonist said and did was a chore, so it gave me a boost. <br /> <br /> In general, the plot, allegedly a major revenge issue, lasted about 30 seconds and lacked any real motivation. The characters acted insecurely and didn't seem to be in another relationship. No character was in the depths of them, they could also be cardboard cut away from a static camera. <br /> <br /> Truly terrible piece that is worse than first year students 2 minutes from youtube. Tips for the Director? Change your name and disable any link to a movie that is likely to sell one copy of the yard when selling the yard.
