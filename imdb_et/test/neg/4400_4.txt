The situation in Palestine is fruitful and, to a large extent, necessary for filmmaking. "Divine intervention" strives hard and gives us an incomprehensible look at the almost surreal life of these problems, but the film is a bit more than a handful of (definitely beautiful) visual jokes thrown on the celluloid, while the links between them become increasingly unclear as the film progresses. Missed opportunity to say something more uniformly on a very topical topic.
