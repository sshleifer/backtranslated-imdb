there would be no substance in this "thriller" experiment! Some may say that this movie is "all?" Autism, arson, robbery, lost love, money bag, cutters, murders, blood, nervous revolver, broken teeth, chest (different concepts), big flashlights, tribal peoples, brother duo, trying to imagine "stupid and fucking", "white wolves, "fight scenes that resemble" lucky strikes "," snowshoes ", a large traceable vehicle, and a refurbished motel? All this, to the end of the "Enyanesque" melody ... <br /> <br /> Maybe my rating is a bit tough, but one look is quite reasonable if there is nothing else to do. <br /> <br /> Yeowza!
