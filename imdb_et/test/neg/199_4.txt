I just watched UbuWeb this early experimental short film directed by William Vance and Orson Welles. Yes, you read that right, Orson Welles! Years before he became famous for "World War" and his debut debut at Citizen Kane, Welles was 19 years old, who found his museum. In addition to Vance and Welles, another player here was Virginia Nicholson, who became Orson's first woman. She plays a woman who sits in a sitting courtesy of an African-American servant (on the black surface of Paul Edgerton). During this time, the man (Welles) continues to do so (repetition of the scene). I have nothing more to say, except to tell you how quiet the pictures are when they are constantly cutting. That doesn't mean that it was good, but it was exciting to see even the 2005 Larry Morotta guitar score. Look for Welles enthusiasts and avant-garde enthusiasts.
