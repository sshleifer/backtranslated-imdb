This is probably the worst documentary I've ever seen. It seemed so amateurish. Chris Hegedus was one of the leaders of The War Room, which was a great film (albeit a little one-sided), but it seemed beautiful. Startup.com looked like it was in a box in the basement. The quality was so pathetic that I couldn't see it. I saw about 30 minutes and I had to take it back to Blockbuster and get something else. I don't understand how anyone of such an amateur is like Chris Hegedus. How did hell win prizes at the beginning ??? The War Space certainly earned a prize, as well as another great documentary called the Ameragos (both won prizes). This documentary looked like what Uncle Joe did for the weekends. Shaky, dimly lit, sprawling lighting, bad sound, 10-year-old can make a better movie than this man.
