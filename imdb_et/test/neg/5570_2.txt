I only looked at it because I saw a few good reviews for it, so I was expecting at least a half-cheesy movie. Toybox doesn't even give it. There are so many problems with this flick that I don't even know where to start, so I'll give you some basic problems (again, a spoiler warning. Just read them, it will help you look at this, this movie starts and often mentions Celeste Noir myth) folklore (a witch who claims to be a reincarnation) as well as a middle folker (or something like an evil man who has a big smile who cuts people open with hooks and sells their own in-house pies). , dealing with pies is just enjoyable, but then you watch the movie and it's all that idiot girl and her boyfriend (and what was she dealing with? Was she psychic? Did she have authority? Why did she see the visions that even the so-called witch?) they didn't "know?) and they meet their crazy family, not really crazy, they just argue a lot, this is what most of the movie claims, and they never touch an alleged myth that has ever been. Ile except, except for a couple of confusing scene, you can not make heads or tails of. <br /> <br /> In one scene, Berenice (the main witch-related character) travels and performs some ritual with candle light. It seemed quite important, but absolutely nothing happened after it did, it just wasted more time. <br /> <br /> And who the hell was that dog with his dog? You see him walking in front of the house from the beginning with this evil red-eyed dog, and then he finally gets killed? What the hell ?? Was he medieval? Was his dog? Did anyone kill a dog? They never showed it. Likewise, any scene related to Vicar was completely absurd and only a weak statement. It was like they had all these interesting character ideas and they all went somewhere! A boyfriend who obviously had no powers but never explained them. Grandma, who seemed to have some kind of witch power but never used them. Vicar, who ... OK, never, didn't make any sense at all. And then Berenice and her stupid amulet were. Could he really do magic, or did he just use it to reflect the light and the blind? It was a complete waste of time and the only reason I gave him two letters was that a) Berenice is cute and b) mentioned pies. Save yourself money on renting it and dear God doesn't even think about buying it, when a waste of money is a new fad.
