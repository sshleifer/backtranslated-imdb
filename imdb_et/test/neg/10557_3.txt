How did so many talented or at least charismatic actors stand in this peace? Nothing is very good about this movie, but the worst things are probably scenario and management. <br /> <br /> Probably it's director Damian Niemans, who has both written and directed (and acted). He is himself a card player and seems to have named characters with other famous wizards. It was his first feature film as far as I know, and it's likely it's his last. <br /> <br /> Is it hard to pinpoint what makes it so bad? but i would say that story and characters are not plausible (scenario) and management doesn't give him any boost (director). Plus ?? Poker scenes are bad in the worst Hollywood way (super-hands, Hollywood rules)! The anticipated twists of the film are either entirely predictable or totally unbelievable. They just tie the knot story, which at best can be described as "some decent scene"!
