Okay. I really tried to use the (so-called) foolish and surreal humor that this movie looks like. I have said that the Japanese version of this movie is much shorter than it was delivered to America (go to the figure!), And it's less political. Moreover, I found this sexual / political farce just as boring and pointless as normal porn. Women's central lead is easy for the eyes and can actually work. I would like to see her not in a pink movie, where she could actually bend her muscles (and not, not the ones you mean). It is obvious that Japan can (and does) do as much trouble as other countries. I could not recommend it to anyone how far away there is someone with Asian porn Jones. Go see a real Japanese movie.
