First, they destroy it uniquely with poor animation quality, they get voices that don't sound like the original. They make a lot of movie mistakes. When Sasha sings Count Me Out, the drum disappears and reappears, the Itchy shirt leaves the color unchanged, his hat remains in a changing position, one bridge is white, all the fats appearing in the background, halos colors change, colors change and colors change and appear and disappear. Even the sky seems different. I will not give a damn if it is a low budget movie, they should not cut animations. They completely destroyed the first ADGTH. The only good thing about this movie was sound.
