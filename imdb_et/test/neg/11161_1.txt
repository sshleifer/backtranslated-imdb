The design of this experienced Disney family movie (ad-exec gets its teenage daughter's horse as she wants more than anything else in the world) is just an excuse to shoot a big climatic horse at the end of the show. All the other ingredients (advertising campaign for stomach pills, Kurt Russell as a child's potential boyfriend, Lloyd Bochner as a potential competitor to Dean Jones from Diane Baker's thoughts) have run out to present the horse. More than half of the picture is padded and worse: it's bright and unpleasant. A child is a ninny variety who cries on the couch with his hand to the dog and as usual he gets his way. * from ****
