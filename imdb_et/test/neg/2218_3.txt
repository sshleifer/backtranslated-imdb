"On Earth" was yesterday on television. I was at the computer and happened to look at it and see some of the worst things. I immediately liked the filthy production value of the movie, the terrible behavior (all involved - even Peter Cushing) and the terrible, unintentionally entertaining action and doll companies. <br /> <br /> The film is about a Victorian scholar who takes a stereotypical Buff American Hero on a ground trip to Wales. Little do they know that a big heart strikes the center of the ground .... <br /> <br /> Forget that the title doesn't make sense. (If they were really in the heart of the earth, they would be under 2700 kg / m3 underground and burned alive at the sea of ​​iron or whatever it is.) Forget the dolls used in the producer rally "The Beast Master" for being all the time misleading. No, the real "kernel of the earth" genius is its naïve stupidity - gung-ho action spectacle without actual action and without real spectacle. It's essentially just a gung-ho movie and a stupid one. People who enjoy MST3K-style stuff love it - it is terribly bad and really so bad that it is almost enjoyable in a strange way.
