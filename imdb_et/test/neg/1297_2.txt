This movie was all garbage. I sat watching it totally furious that it was funded. They definitely used their budget for a special FX, not a script writer and director, and some actors. <br /> <br /> First, it was a bliss and a garbage. The story was not sufficiently comparable to the audience. Instead of being from the point of view of the storm peoples, more of the narrative was spoken by the government and the army, which is not really the way to unite them, because most of us hate politicians anyway. The writer attempted to add a human element to unrealistic characters by adding a small sub-block of father and son that failed completely. <br /> <br /> As for leadership ... oh god, his techniques try and create tension and restlessness are recurring and up. Camera movement and sudden flash stops in front of the characters when something terrible has happened, was pathetic. <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched it was to see a special FX. What a bad thing, because a special FX shouldn't make a movie, but should only amplify the story and experience. There was no story. <br /> <br /> I really wouldn't bother about this, the trash and the embarrassment of the British film industry.
