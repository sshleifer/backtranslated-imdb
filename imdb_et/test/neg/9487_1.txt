I've seen this movie and I didn't care about this movie. I don't think of Paris because I don't like that country and the capital of that country. I don't want to learn French anyway because I don't understand their language. Why am I going to France for Germany or the UK? Germany and the United Kingdom are the peoples I tolerate. Obviously, Olsen Twins does not understand French as myself. That's why I don't worry about a trip to France, no matter what. Perhaps I would stay in the UK and meet some women and play video games if there is a video game. That is all.
