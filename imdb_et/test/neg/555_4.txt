I can accept that it was a NEXT karate boy so that Ralph Macchio can retire happily and even though Hillary Swank has a great role to play .... the plot is just terrible. <br /> <br Hr. Miyagi's old friend of World War 2 dies, leaving his widow to take care of his rebellious daughter when his parents die in an accident. The girl has no discipline yet, because the hero is the local ROTC, which I'll explain in a minute to get her. You know that drilling ... Miyagi takes him under his wing, and finally, they beat the bad guys and all live happily. but it is not even long and short. My first case "huh?" why is there a "military division" in high school? I thought the stuff went out in the 1960s, especially in the state school. As far as Michael Ironside begins as his main bearer, when is there a military in high school? My next handle is that during the prom scene, soldiers jump in the bungee to scare people into the mess ... why? What I noticed in all four films was at the end when he suddenly turned the heels after they put them to infinity (Billy Part 1, Sato Part 2, Krees 3). This movie is no different. When Ned and cronies basically sabotage the parental prize, Eric's car is blowing up and threatening Hillary Swank's entire movie ..... Ironside tells them to beat her and they are like "um ... no". Make pathetic facial twists, at least make sure the characters are not too high, such as blowing a hot rod. ... bright but nothing melodramatic, which is the breathing of fresh air from Ralph Macchio, who pulled the first 3 films. I can agree that it is more or less spin off ... but I can't take the whole military thing too rarely to take it seriously. Now that Ironside and his team were a wrestling / football team and he was a coach, it would have been more plausible. <br /> <br /> Ironside and Morita offer merchandise, Swank is OK ... the rest are the same As any other, one pressure is when they blow on hot rods, it has cooled from 4 to 10
