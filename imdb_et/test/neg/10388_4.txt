I have to agree with the previous reviewer. Although Kristin Erikson did an excellent job of playing the conquered girl, I do not really believe that the Isabelle he played was in possession. I've seen people have psychotic interruptions because of sexual abuse and they never explained whether their father had abused him or not. I had to look again at some parts again to explain what the letter said, what the characters are, and I'm still not clear about some of the things that happened, be they real or not. I'm trying to find an "original" story based on a comparison of facts, but I can't find it on the net. <br /> <br /> It wasn't a bad movie, but some of the dialogue was fun. Special effects wise, the movie wasn't much for the B class, and the scenes in their possession were all worth it if it was ... if you had nothing better to do. LOL
