I was on a British Airways flight from London to New York when I saw this movie. I wish I had slept. The story was very thin and the editing team did their best to stretch as long as they did. <br /> <br /> Gary, played by Andy Garcia, was so unlikely that it was difficult for me to support her. Andy's ability to act is good but not good enough to make up for the poor writing of this movie. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell did her job with the romantic interest of Linda, Gary. I can't say anything about Andie, I always enjoy acting. The problem is that romance between Andy and Andie has been proven and unbelievable. These two don't make a big pair on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie was almost as much as the movie itself. Pope and everything is forgiven, come. An event that allows this film to have a happy ending and writers expect us to accept it is pathetic. Gary does not change and only thanks to the dear friend's death, his situation improves. <br /> <br /> There are many great movies that should be seen before. Don't waste your time. <br /> <br />
