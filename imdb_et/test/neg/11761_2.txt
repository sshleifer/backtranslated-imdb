CHE! is a bad movie and deserves this reputation as an unintentionally funny movie. It takes a serious issue and presents it like the Cliff Notes version or Classic Comics, because there is not much emotion or the right narrative - just the episodic segments that are sewn with mostly foolish "real stories" that are said by different tales. /> <br /> This is a movie with earned service because it is poorly written and worked. But what is most interesting about the film is its obvious gay subtitle. Instead of Che Guevarra and Fidel Castro working for Communist Cuba, they seem to be more gay couples - Che acts as a girlfriend and aside and Fidel is terrifying! Again and again the film has big features like Fidel attracts Che "Cuba needs you ... I need you!". I'm not sure if the studio was planning this homosexual down stream, but it doesn't take the brain surgeon to recognize it! I'm very surprised that other reviewers did not manage it. However, if you remember this movie, it makes it much more exciting and even more fun. <br /> <br /> Final note. In recent years, Che has been very chic - even a fashion statement with a brain-dead teenager who has no idea who he was, wearing shirts. Given that he was a cold-blooded killer and nihil (a strange combination for a doctor), this new man is hard to honor. What do they do next, put Hitler or Dr. Mengele on T-shirts and posters? !!? Even conscientious communists should fear the bloodshed. Guevara was responsible and I think it is ironic that people with a computer carry a man who is probably likely to kill them in half! Considering how stupid and unintentionally funny this film is, it does nothing further that Guevara was not a hero. I would like to see a realistic movie of my life - good and bad, but also dialogue and plot that was obviously not created by chimps!
