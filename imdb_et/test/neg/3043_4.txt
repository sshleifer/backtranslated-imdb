This film had the potential to be a good little high school thriller. Instead, we received an award-winning festival that speaks of small, corrupted brat babysitters. The problem was that there were too many unnecessary things. Fighting boy, random friends who come to death. It was obvious that they just killed time. The main character was kind and uninteresting. Camilla Bell had no emotions during the film. He was right there. Another problem was that the killer was not a danger. Children live, so it's clear that they let Jill survive. The only reason it was the fourth was that in the last ten minutes (when the killer came out) it is really exciting. <br /> <br /> 4/10
