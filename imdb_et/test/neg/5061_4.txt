Angel-A is the change of Besson's pace; black and white, mawkish and rather mediocre. It is well photographed in Paris, although the readers of the subtitles should note: a quick fire dialogue and good cinematic art can cause frustrating viewing. <br /> <br /> This movie is not "wish wings" or "wonderful life". Despite his common themes (heavenly intervention prevents suicide, angel / mortal relationship), Besson does nothing to enlighten or inspire us. Even well-functioning, tear-like moments fall quickly on toe-bearing sentimentality. <br /> <br /> The wrong ideology of the movie is irritating; An angel whose message of love and self-esteem is constantly undermined by his own violent and buggy behavior; "Happy End", which denies the hero's expected journey to helpless self-esteem and independence. <br /> <br /> Decision: A pretty nice look, but the confusing moral and philosophical messages are destroying the film where it should look. 4/10
