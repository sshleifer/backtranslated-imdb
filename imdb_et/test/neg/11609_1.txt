After passing the apology of this godly 82-minute film, and having previously wished to see my eyes after looking at another James Toback's confused "When I Love", I have come to the conclusion that he has the best agent in the world. How else could these terribly wrecked, painfully-managed rubbish bins be prepared first. <br /> <br /> I like Robert Downey Jr., but maybe this film is about drug abuse. > <br /> Heather Graham must be embarrassed about his zombie performance. Half of the time the camera is on him, he just looks enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> Such a messy script. Prepare yourself for Hollywood's dropping horrors (an example: five-minute discussions about how Denzel Washington works, etc.). <br /> <br /> Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22 has a great character on Dunbar. He spends most of his time in the novel he punishes. When he asked why he always hates it, if he hates it so much, he replies that it takes time for CREEP and has a longer life. Well .... if you really want to feel the time, check out this movie! I swear ... 82 minutes seems to be longer than 4 hours of David Lean's epic. It continues and continues and continues ... <br /> <br /> I hope I will not watch any James Toback movie yet. If I could give it to NO STARS, I would like to.
