Which Fox charm is with distracting families, consisting of medium, unpleasant, corrupted children, and parents who are determined to be cool, as opposed to a parent? Sorry, I can't. One episode I barely watched was one child who demanded Bar Mitzvah to receive thousands of dollars as a gift. Of course, the mother of the idiots decides that her little junior must have the biggest and untested party, and she has no problem to overthrow 20 grand ambassadors at a big event. A tiny, brain-dead, crazy teenage daughter bounces back and forth between someone who wants to be a Jew and then a Catholic when he sees "cute" religious instructors. <br /> <br /> One border "heart warming" moment in the whole episode was when the father who was always convinced that the bar Mitzvah is just a money-making plan, putz, sees the son studying his Hebrew lessons, and take a moment to think that maybe he is a successor to his companion. being sincere on the right of masculinity. This warm, fuzzy feeling is immediately hanging from his chest when he informs the younger person that, because he does not yet have a brass, a certain procedure must be performed. The Mitzvah bar is called out and the mother has several thousand dollars if the child refuses. <br /> <br /> This show is a garbage and I'm sad that I never get back 23 minutes of my life I wasted a look at this mess because nothing else was on TV ...
