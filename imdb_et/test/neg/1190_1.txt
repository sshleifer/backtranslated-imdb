In the first 25 minutes it turned out that the writers really wanted to create a feature film and they probably enjoyed the whole process, but then it seemed forgotten that he needed a decent piece of land! If the best they could do would be from the 3 most serious characters to enter the real world and have "all kinds of amusing capers", they should have been alone! I didn't laugh once and the whole "Baron Munchausen / Time Bandits" adventure that is going on in the middle was very bad! Counterfeit, viable and very open. It just seemed like a whistle stop course about what they thought it could only work to pull it on. In order to save them, Jeff managed to write himself in the sub-story / time of William and Mary and the era. If he could do this, why didn't they have to write Royston himself - duh ?? And listening to Herr Lipp? What was it for? I mean, what was it? Did he do this and did we hear anything else about it? My main point is that although I loved this series, it was a poorly thought-out, seemingly rushed project. In this way, the plot was so poor that if we didn't already know these signs (and as a fan of loyalty to continue viewing) and we only supported the story itself, it would have fallen flat! At best, it would have gone straight to the video and at worst would never have been done! Or maybe it should be the opposite? Really terrible.
