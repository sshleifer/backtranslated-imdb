I know that commenting on a movie is completely unfair, but can't see the full piece - but I'm going anyway! I was waiting to laugh, I tried to give it time. I think 20 minutes is long enough to wait for a comedy laugh. My laughter never came, so I gave up. <br /> <br /> It is stupid humor, not so stupid that you have to laugh. It's not close to that high class. Let me fix it, it's just * stupid * - not stupid humor. They may be funny for certain scenes, but they weren't. I think if you were really bored, you might want to mix the film with hallucinations and end up with a little fun. <br /> <br /> Very pathetic effort.
