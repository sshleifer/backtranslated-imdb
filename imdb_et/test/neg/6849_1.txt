To really evaluate this movie, you had to be there (act?) Or be a team member. <br /> <br /> Yes, I'm "Selena" and mature aged 42 years have serious doubts about what we did / did. <br /> <br /> It all started to be like the "John Waters" -type thing, friends who do badly in bad movies. Somewhere along the line were fun, people who had to be friends didn't talk anymore, and BAD became worse. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that the bad picture I predicted. Size One Gold Spandex Pants,) <br /> <br /> Besides, the movie SUCKS so badly, I don't even make my mother watching it. <br /> <br /> To my director, cast and team I say, <br /> <br /> "Why can't we just miss everything? <br /> <br /> It's been over twenty years. people !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!
