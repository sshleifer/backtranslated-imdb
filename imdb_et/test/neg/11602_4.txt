It was the third feature of Hitchcock's Hollywood and it seemed that he was still adapting to the pattern of continuity, turning Rebecca's classic novel into a faithful adaptation to an external organizer, and now in the form of "romance comedy" "1930s. <br /> <br /> However, Hitchcock's official method was now consistent, so that he could not (or at least unwanted) deviate from it, then it was pointless to step outside the usual genre and romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate. limited by the source text, forced his technique to make a difficult Gothic drama, but for Mr and Mrs, there is a big contradiction between form and content, in other words, Hitchcock was not Ernst Lubitsch. <br /> <br /> First we look at the romantic corner. in the movies were natural, passionate and lightly dangerous? ‚Äùnever fell in love with someone you didn't peak s? "and he was great to portray it. This is something that makes a lot of the earlier movie Rich and Strange, one of the few Hitchcock non-thrillers that actually work. Hitch is not as good when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story. A light, gentle touch is needed and Hitch doesn't have it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, take the comedy. Of course, Hitchcock movies can be funny? Lady Vanishes is probably the best example? but only when the jokes were sprinkled on the whole story. The medics just aren't enough for the comedy guide to create a movie with funny bones. He cuts scenes like he would in a thriller? a dirty opposite corner of people speaks, put hands and feet close-up, points of view? but it does not allow comic timing or focus on gags. For example, it seems Carole Lombard's outfit that looks like a pair of close relatives, but they are timed more than she would have revealed some important plot points and would not have a comedic effect. Does Hitchcock's style sometimes coincide with comedy? for example, the placement of characters in the club scene, where Robert Montgomery tries to see it as if he were an attractive, experienced woman in the next table? but such moments are little and far. <br /> <br /> Even sir and pr. I'm not sure it was the strength of Robert Montgomery, and he's bored here. It was, of course, exactly where Carole Lombard's strength "Queen of the Screwball" set, but although she is clearly acting, the scenes are not simply aimed at capturing comedy shows. Even Jack Carson, who can be fun if he was allowed to let go of the camera, can't lift things at all. Of course, neither of these will help a fine comedy actor scenario that is not perfect with laughter, even if the main story is a relatively good prerequisite. <br /> <br /> The only complete - Comedy Hitchcock did this after Harry Harry and such a job because he was playing in his familiar stops. But only when the story could be independent of humor, when the basic framework was temporary? like it is in Lady Vanish or Family Plot? that Hitchcock was able to do comedy well.
