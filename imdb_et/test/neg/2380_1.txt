This film gave me the nervous system. When I had recovered from apendicide a few years ago, I just started to teach in high school. All the teaching was a bit nervous for the beginner, but to prepare myself to go back to the class, I decided to watch some pretty terrible movies. Flintstones was one of my chosen films and then I headed "King of The Streets" (United Kingdom title "Alien Warrior"). Immediately before it was finished, I found myself almost in tears when all this was destroyed ... my life, the film stock, which I paid for Blockbuster for a couple of weeks ago, has to be taken to print the art of the sleeve, soundtrack involved in the efforts of editors and musicians (as little as their efforts were) ... the list goes on. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies. Let me make it quite clear - I love to watch crappy movies from Blockbusters. I and my companion Dan sat and looked at many, many cheap horrors and smiled at them. But it was a different funny movie. I don't think anything has come close to it, not even Tobe's Death Trap (which is probably my second worst film in the world). Making the whole car out of abandoned parts almost killed me; Repeating music whenever possible, regardless of the events on the screen; all .... AAAGGGHHHHHHH !!!!! I can't even continue this "critical" dissection when my gag reflex has started. The inexperience of this film, even now, three years after I watched it for the first and last time, still makes me speechless (but I'm still able to write). All the "making of cars from strange parts" I had terrible things to contemplate. <br /> <br /> I ask you if you are interested in watching this movie, but look at the cover of the video and imagine the worst possible version of the back summary. I can almost guarantee that it is not even half as bad as this movie really is. Do not in any way contemplate it for any reason. Not if you are a Christian and you want to see the allegory of Christ; not when you are a bad movie celebrity and you want to experience a trash lower than the real one; even if you want your life to look longer (and believe me every second when this movie looks at least a minute). Don't make that mistake, this movie is holy. This is an antichrist in video format. As Bo Cattlett Get Shorty's said, "I've seen a better movie on teeth."
