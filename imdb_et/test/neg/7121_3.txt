I loved the first Grudge, I watched it in an empty theater, and frankly I was puzzled. Never before had I heard the unique sound of cooling signals, it was truly captivating. and the whole place, a couple of scenes (like a woman who urinates out of fear, or another young woman who drinks milk, then vomiting it again), which really didn't make sense and helps to increase the film's slip factor. In these scenes and on a couple of other occasions, the people who sold the audience were smiling aloud. It was a good indicator to show how this film lacked excitement, chills or slippage. The action was decent, the depicted emotions were plausible, so hats were cast out for the actors, but the confusing story and its absence was something I couldn't shake throughout the film. I had bothered more than anything, the same old fucking thunder, a couple of quick unexpected scenes to jump on, but in general I was very disappointed.
