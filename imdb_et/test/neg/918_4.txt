This experimental silent film made by an independent British film company in Switzerland is considered to be Paul Robeson's first film. It is very artistic because the story often seems to be meaningless, which is quite difficult to understand because there are not enough titles. Robeson's wife, Adah, has been gathered with a white man, Thorne, in an interracial grace. It doesn't bother the owner of cigar-chomping at the bar / hotel where Thorne lives (and he looks like a lesbian relationship with a barmaid), but the old lady expresses the city view with the title: "If I had my way, we wouldn't allow nose here." is also called someone in this bar "nigger lover". Adah tries to settle for Pete (Robeson), but eventually he leaves. Thorne's wife, Astrid, goes deep, denotes a knife, cuts Thorne's hand and cheek, and somehow dies. Thorne must be accused of murder because we learn that he has been acquitted. On Pete, he receives a letter from the mayor telling him he is the best for everyone to leave the city. So the film is nothing more than racism, but the story tells the owner Petele "a sad thing, they think they are right. The meaning of the title is a mystery. It may refer to Adah, who has a mild skin (outline nega), or a borderline of the main characters behavior.
