Dramatic? Yes ...... Historically accurate? Not quite! .... This film tends to detail the Bible by placing Lot at the time of building Noah's building. Lottery to Lot, partly made by NBC! 2136 BCE, 234 years after the flood (2370BCE) .... Thats like George Bush's meeting with William Shakepeare! And what about this man who swims around Noah's items and nicknack? <br /> <br /> You can make a movie based on historical facts dramatic, but don't turn it into the placement of people they were not, especially when it comes to God's Word.
