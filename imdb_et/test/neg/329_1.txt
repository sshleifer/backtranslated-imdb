I've always loved horrors. Some of the usual known "The Exorcist" are less undervalued by some as "Black Christmas" or "Just Before Dawn". But who's kidding people, even calling it a trash b-movie. It's a straight Z-class. Action is the worst on film. Really, I've seen better "Young and Restless" episodes ... SPOILER ... Lookout when a woman comes to talk to them about Jack-o legend. He sometimes stops for a few seconds as someone flashes his smart cards and tries to read his rows. RIOT! <br /> <br /> Oh, and besides bad deeds, absolutely no gore or F / X. And Jack-o looked like a plastic lighted pumpkin. Look at Linnea Quigley at "Night of the Demons" or "Quietly at night, a deadly night," which is much better.
