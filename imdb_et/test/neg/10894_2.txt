This film talks about a young couple who escapes in order to start a new life in LA, who eventually gets into a resting place left by the psycho. In fact, it's just a girl (Nicole) because her boyfriend literally disappears within minutes. The film is going to be very fast and you are already thinking about how it could extend the story to your style. It's not a long time before you realize that a movie does it just by wasting time on unnecessary scenes that don't go anywhere. <br /> <br /> The story is not only thin on paper but unstructured, stupid and inconsistent. A few minutes after the boy and the car disappeared, Nicole finds a moving home from a resting place. She sees the camera blinking and knows that people are inside, but she easily gives up looking for help if nobody meets her door. After the killer has told him that his boyfriend is in danger, he walks over the rest of the stop, doing all kinds of stupid and unnecessary things. It also includes turning on the television (and even looking at the amusement when he thinks he has stumbled on a porn film, even in such a terrible situation), sitting around, wandering and drinking a bottle of bottles for hours. She does all this knowing that her boyfriend has been kidnapped, that the killer is still open and pursuing her and does not take any steps to ensure her immediate security (she does not have to lock or stay alert). Oh yes, he is trying to use the radio to make a call, but why even barely if there is a moving home with people who have the right to stop? It seems that the script writer forgot to write this important part of this story. <br /> <br /> This story has no grip or constant danger. The heroine rides the rest of the buildings freely and around, and the killer rides only occasionally to scare her before she rides again. There's nothing to stop Nicole from just going off (even if the rest of the stop is far away, it's better than sitting), but he decides to stay anyway. At one point in the movie, the main character even recognizes that he can go down, but not. <br /> <br /> The story does not go anywhere and instead jumps useless segment towards a pointless segment. Eventually, Nicole becomes a mobile home and it turns out that the inhabitants are protected, probably inbred or psychotic religious fanatics. They seem involuntarily ignorant or murdering about the actions of their murderers (but there is no sign that they are in any way related to him), and then take Nicole out in a few minutes. <br /> <br /> The main character goes to the bathroom building. He discovers one killer from previous victims (a young woman, Tracy), who is still alive and locked in a closet. For both reasons, Tracy starts to vomit ridiculous amounts of blood. Nicole goes out to pull the door open, and when she returns in a few minutes, both Tracy and her blood have disappeared without explanation. What was the point? Nicole finds a bulletin board that shows many missing persons and sees Tracy disappeared in 1971. So was Tracy a ghost or something? The writer never makes explanations. <br /> <br /> The policeman then appears in the middle of the night in the middle of the man to get to the police station a rest stop that was left unattended for the whole day. Nicole tells her what's going on, and when the killer travels to his truck outside the office, the policeman goes against him. What does a policeman know, knowing that something is seriously wrong? He goes up and speaks peacefully with the killer (who even told Nicole that he was the one who pursued him), and buys the killer that he just drove and needs directions. Seriously. The policeman then talks to Nicole outside, completely unaware of the pickup driving around and running over. <br /> <br /> Police will soon say to Nicole that she is a goner who is "happy to breathe" yet, but she doesn't strangely die for some time. Two of them speak somewhat meaninglessly and all that he has a weapon is not even told for too long. When both eventually tried to use the weapon, Nicole stupidly wastes most of her bullets by blindly shooting at the door when the killer was behind it. With two bullets, police officer Nicole told her that she was using her to euthanize. She burns one mouth and she remains for a while, a blown out piece. Then he suddenly and inexplicably worships "You missed!" and he must shoot him again. Totally cheap test shock. <br /> <br /> Nicole finally ends up with a killer and fails. The movie ends with a scene that does not happen when a woman arrives at a strangely more active resting time. In the bathroom, she hears that Nicole is crying for help in the closet (as Tracy was locked). He gets a policeman to go in and check, but he probably finds a normal and clean cabinet. The policeman is leaving, I thought he was deceiving. Doubling Nicole shows that it has come out of the boxes in some boxes (he would have been easily noticed if the policeman had spent all 10 seconds), probably too stupid to say or do anything with the police. WOW. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably the first new line in the "high quality" DVD movie that is marketed as too extreme for theaters. In fact, it's just more clich√©, B-Movie garbage.
