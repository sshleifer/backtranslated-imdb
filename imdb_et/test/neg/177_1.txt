The film is annoying. <br /> <br /> Technically, there are too many times when you see vague and very roughly modified scenes. You could easily get a cleaner movie using a decent amateur camera and a $ 100 video editing program. On the ground, a man on the street does not mean sloppy editing. Targeted scenes that did not contain a significant statement should have been deleted. The same applies to the object's head / hand / others remaining in the frame. My 8 year old son already knows it. <br /> <br /> The movie is too long. The main point (anti-globalization) is understandable in 30 minutes, why it's all the rest. After interviewing James Suckling, I pressed the "stop" button. Which waist is time. <br /> <br /> The main theme just doesn't work for me anymore. I've seen too many small wine producers that produce mediocre, commercialized wines and many great wine producers that produce great and unique wines. The film identifies small producers as those who produce more identity or terroir wines. Larger blamed for "internationalized" or "commercialized" wines. The film tries to make a black and white statement in the world of gray tones. But the film has not proved this claim. They look at a couple of random examples, "bind" some big producers (Frescobaldi) with fascism, and "interview" with key people. Did all the small producers, on the contrary, spend WWII? Is it important to see Parker having a Bulldog thing? The film is very manipulative and convincing.
