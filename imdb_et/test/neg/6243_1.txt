I hate it when the cinema returns to the screen. This is one of the main reasons I stick to DVDs or videos. I saw clearings on the DVD, but if I had seen it in the movies, I would have to get up and SCREAM "HE IS NOT BIRDS, YOUR MORON!" <br /> <br /> Clearing is another long list of terrible movies with Mr.Redford. Legal eagles, Havana, indecent proposal, close and personal, sneakers, last castle and spy game. When Robert Redford told me I was investing in something I was going to do differently. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing you can do to the audience is this. Say you're kidnapped and your robber has a gun. He keeps it for most of the movie. Turn the boards over her and start strangling her. No matter what you still strain, until it is COMING! Don't just strangle him for ten seconds. Stay with it! At least ten minutes. But Bob stops too fast, walks away and forgets Mr. Kidnapper, until ....... He rises, finds a weapon and keeps it in our hero. Then I wanted Mr Kidnapper to be shot by Robert Redford. More than a few times. And I wanted to shoot him.
