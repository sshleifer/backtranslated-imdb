It is really easy to roast, roast, churn and otherwise burn this movie to all the rich mistakes. This was done by high school students and faculty and the whole community; it shows! Of course, I could look at a script that is just ridiculous. The monster created by the garbage of the growing city of California starts to eat garbage and garbage cans all over the city. Soon this huge beast wings will destroy the destruction of buildings and even play "beauty and beast" with a young high school girl. Fortunately, he has gang boys, his ex boyfriend called "Penguin" and the city is drunk to help him. The direction is terrible, production values ​​are just terrible, non-existent and slow pace. It's hard to sit around the movie. But by saying this, it is also a miracle of the film if you think this thing has been created by the whole community. You can see all the collective images used by the actors, the actual mayor and the real firefighters and police officers. I was also surprised by all the local businesses that were credited at the end of the film, helping to fund or somehow participate in the film. If you look at the film from this point of view, it is indeed quite an achievement. I didn't know anything about it until I sat down and watched it. Now that I know something about it, I'm impressed. But don't make a mistake - I have no ... NO ... desire to sit back.
