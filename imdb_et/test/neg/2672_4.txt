I'm not really sure what to say / think about this movie. Certainly this is not the worst in the series (there's still "Halloween 3"). Style is simply very different and focuses on other elements than its predecessor. He tries to explain why Michael Myers walks to Halloween and starts to beat. Well, all the thing that Michael Myers is a cursed and evil cult was a pretty nice effort, but I didn't buy it. No other installments made in the series tried to find any fictional explanations. <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of gore. In fact, it's a normal carnage. If you haven't seen other Halloween movies, you probably like this blood. But in the case of a real Halloween frieze, this sequel may be too different to be seen as good. The thrill became terror and carnage (you have to explode ..., you get a point). <br /> <br /> The end (theater section) is just terrible. Michael grabs a needle, then beats the pipe, then bounces again, this time with more needles, then beats a little more until his head is lying down (where else did this green stuff come from?). Basically, it's nothing more than $ 5 million. <br /> <br /> However, there was one good thing: Michael's mask! <br /> <br /> Dedicated to Donald Pleasance, quite disgraceful. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 4/10
