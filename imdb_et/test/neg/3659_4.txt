Maybe I saw a cleaned up version, but not a couple of breastfeeds, I'm not sure what those other commentators are saying about upper nudity. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's not as bad as I expected with the previous comments, though the end leaves you thinking ... WTF? It was blind, but not so much that you could not put the scenes out, and I think that just added fear and fear to the situation. <br /> <br /> The quality of the films could have been better, but the action was pretty decent. <br /> <br /> Everything is really creepy (and yes, brutal) with a frustrating ending.
