When I say worse, I mean less to entertain. Todd Sheets seems to have learned stupid camera tricks from the last Zombie Bloodbath, making the film even less acceptable. In the last film there were no special camera effects where we are treated to shake the cam and the constant transition to black and white. This is also called the Zombie Bloodbath, despite the fact that zombies are hardly in it. The film begins in 1945, where some Satanists kill a violent burglar and put him on a scarecrow. Today, some children have a car problem and they go to the house, the same house where the Satanic murder occurred. Some people think that people are trying to rape children (or something), and they bring back the burglar of life, who comes back with some zombies and now talks like Darth Vader. Mr. Sheets raised the language and reduced violence. If you want to see what a bad movie is, check it out! <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 96 minutes. Not rated, includes violence and language.
