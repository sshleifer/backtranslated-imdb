The transformation of the 1942 "The Major and Minor" role switches has made Jerry Lewis the beginning of Ginger Rogers' original play, but unfortunately this anemic outing is much more than just ginger. Lewis tries to hand over the train to the child; he is successful, but fraud leads to a number of comic and romantic confusion. Sidney Sheldon adapted the scenario by dancing musical moments for Dean Martin (playing another in his stable stage of bananas) and jewel-robbery sub-block (which is terrible). Diana Lynn, who played a funny teenager in the original film, plays Lewis' love of interest here. She is cute; Jerry is not. * 1/2 from ****
