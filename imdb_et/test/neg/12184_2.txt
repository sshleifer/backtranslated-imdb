In the eighties of his career, Charles Bronson established a long-term partnership with several directors, notably J. Lee Thompson and Michael Winner. He also made two films for the one-time bond manager Peter Hunt - the first was a decent Death Hunt in 1981, the second was the indifferent political chase thriller. Slaughter is pretty boring when the truth is known, and you get to the end when you find yourself longing for a bit more passion and temptation, such as Wilby Conspiracy (which is similar to the figure). <br /> Bronson dreams through his bodyguard Jay Killian, whose mission is to protect the American president's wife, Lara Royce Craigi (Jill Ireland, Bronson's real woman). Killian believes that Mrs Craig has been targeted by murderers; he thinks he's too defensive, paranoid pessimist. It turns out - a surprise, a surprise - that Killian was right all the time and someone is really losing her. Their couple are going to pay wages, which are being tracked by assassins. Everyone knows that the American president's wife is known as the first lady. For some reason, "One Mama" has been renamed in this movie! It is quite a thought to guess, but it shows the meaninglessness of the film as a whole. Most movie shows are lazy and the script takes a long time to go where it goes. If I had to tag the murder in a particular genre, I would say it should be a "thriller". However, I would say that with some reservations it is said to be a thriller with little excitement.
