I had heard of this infamous movie in a semi-film buffer. I had heard that it was basically a $ 15 million film from the tyrannical rule of Roman Emperor Caligula, with hard pornography. What struck me was that it was a porn movie, but it had big people like Peter O'Toole, John Geilgud, Malcolm McDowell and Hellen Mirren !! A week ago, I saw a documentary about Caligula on the history channel, and this movie came back to my head, and finally, my curiosity became the best for me, foolishly renting a DVD and watching it stupidly. <br /> <br /> During the first 30 minutes I saw sex and especially violence that would serve NC-17 even today. Was it really necessary that the person whose urinary tract would be closed would have come in and then poured a gallon and then cut it with the sword of the stomach (all very graphically). And the scene where the man gets his d *** cut off and fed to the dogs (again very graphically) and it just scratches the surface. The argument of this film for those who like it seems to be the only film that honestly represents the pagan Roman and its superfluous. When actually this movie is, it has been completely used up. From the beginning to the end, nothing but endless torture and imagination and any kind of violence and unimaginable behavior (sadomasochism, rape, necrophelia, it just stopped) can be seen. Caligula has no idea what might have been her crazy, the terrible childhood she was to be a satirical adult. It's not a historical film, it's buggy. Even the porn of this movie stinks and through it, when I didn't loot, I was just incredibly boring. By the time it was over, I was depressed, did not feel much food and this film makes it impossible, it can actually turn you off. <br /> <br /> What were these great actors when they got into it. I read that porn segments were filmed after the main shoot (which explains why none of the main players are in any of these scenes and why the quality of these scenes is so bad). But still and all these participants need to know what they got into. Open Credit says "Penthouse Magazine and Bob Gucionne Presents". And the scenes that the famous actors actually play are completely self-reluctant. Apparently, director Tinto Brass wanted to remove his name from a completely finished film, as did the screenwriter (Gore Vidal from all people). Even John Geilgud and Peter O'tool asked people not to see it at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> For the amount that manufacturers spent on it, the quality of the movie is terrible. Everything is undersized and dark, as if the film had dropped out of sex before development, and it is fortunate to watch a scene that is actually in focus. Sound is poorly dubbed, much of the music is uncomfortable and editing is pious. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I brought this movie to myself. My advice ... don't look at it, don't look at it, don't look at it ...... like me tomorrow night I'll see something easier .... like DAWN OF THE DEAD!
