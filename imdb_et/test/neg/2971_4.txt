The stupid comedy embarrassingly casts Ray Milland as a British officer of World War II, who gets out of German borders and starts a man-hungry gypsy woman played by Marlene Dietrich. Slowly fast, long and uncomfortable: drivers are too old for this type of juvenile feed, although Marlene stands out for her solo moments. It took three screenwriters to adjust the screen book of Yolanda Foldes, but this material must have seemed as early as 1947 - it smells something that Ernst Lubitsch could bring out in 1939. chemistry together. ** from ****
