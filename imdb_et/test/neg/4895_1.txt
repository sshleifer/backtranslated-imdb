How do you make a totally unsuccessful movie about one of America's most famous authors? Watch this movie and explore. Maybe I am a superfluous author of Carson McCullers, but I was impressed by the "heart of a lonely hunter" and hopes for something memorable here. Forget it. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave looks like a short hairstyle and dress. I never found him getting excited about almost every movie. Rod Steiger as a Preacher? How offensive is this? Unlikely characters one after the other. Well, maybe it's a book and I'm unfair about this movie. I don't know anything other than what I saw on the screen and it was such an unappealing movie that I could never recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> This is just one of the backward-facing people in an inverted city. There is nothing to suggest outside of some nice cinematography here and there. How anyone could sit for 100 minutes is amazing. <br /> <br /> I didn't even go for how bad it was. There is good news: it was the only movie Simon Cowell.
