A truly strange, surreal visual idea that apparently seemed extremely amazing on a printed page; just what brought Robert Redford's project will never be known. Sidney J. Furie leads a rider with an egotistical motorcycle who is under the wing of a milquette from under his wing; the boy looks at this hero and finally entices his immorality. Separated and backward - though for some, it can be noted that Redford's vision, which is dazzling, explodes or is abandoned. Lauren Hutton also gets naked, but all the sexy flashes are as prurient; just no story. Perhaps Furie was dealing with an esoteric comment on the 1970s old cyclists and their cattle. * 1/2 from ****
