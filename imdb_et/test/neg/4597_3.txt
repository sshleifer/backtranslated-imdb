After Matt Dillon's phenomenal performance in CRASH, most of the FACTOTUM copies emit to see if Dillon is a real or just a happy backlash from a big script. <br /> <br /> Well, Factotum is definitely its moments, but ... everything is likely to change the viewers. But Dillon shouldn't be taken away. His performance is wonderful and full of humor with excellent humor, which proves that he is a solid actor with remarkable caps; it is just a shame on management and script. <br /> <br /> The story is related to Henry's "Hank" Chinas (Dillon) and his refusal to do something normal. She leaves the job or plays them in just a few minutes to find her back in a terrible pub that even faces sleepy women, trying to write a non-conformist novel. We never know what the novel speaks, except that it covers "everything" (cancer, movies, you, me). <br /> <br /> Continuing from work to work and constant return to Janin (Lili Taylor, HAUNTING), a loser girlfriend who is the same as herself, Hank is trying to find out in vain what her life should be for her. Does he ever learn what it is for interpretation. Some may say that he never does, while others may claim that his life is just a way of uncertainty. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the fact that Matt Dillon's excellent performance does not contain much material for Factotum. The story casts out Hank's life without giving much thought to where to take the audience. And it's a shame. Dillon's performance would have been even brighter if he was given a decent script.
