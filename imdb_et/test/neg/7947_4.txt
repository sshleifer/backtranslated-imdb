I'm sure many guys love this movie. The only woman who shows any "ball" (unfortunate deception) is made to look, speak and feel like a man, the other 2 women are depicted on sexual objects with one thing in their sexual or sexual way as the only attribute and skill (Iris) - or like pretty little princesses who are neuroses, denies any power and professional power they had before all hell break (Doc). The only strength Iris is at the end is the result of the advice of some great strong people. In addition to my negative bowel reaction as a feminist, I have to provide camera props and Ethan Hawke is the very first in the first scene. After that, his force loses steam. Blank entertainment for the brain that wants to make it easy. At least the film is filming a good / bad duality in a criminal mind.
