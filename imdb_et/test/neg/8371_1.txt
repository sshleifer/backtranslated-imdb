Looking at it, I was ready to make blasting, sheepskin about the criticism of this "movie" (that's actually a video), but then I saw someone already did. I quite agree with him. But then again it seems that a lot of work is going on and millions of lira went there, so I think you have to try to give them something. However, it is said that anyone who does not yet know the Lovecraftian world and what they were trying to convey would probably think ... I think it's not just very bad, but it makes absolutely no sense. I thank God for reading some of the second review ("two small, maybe? And saving my idea of ​​further exposure to HP's brightness moisturizing Lovecraft."
