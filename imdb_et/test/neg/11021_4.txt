... BREAKER MORANT and ROMPER STOMPER. It has also given us watching movies like BOOTMEN and ODD ANGRY SHOT. Unfortunately, WOG BOY is not included in any list for anyone involved in this attack. <br /> <br /> I was expecting this movie just because of a politically wrong title so politically wrong that if it was broadcast on BBC 2 late at night, the scientist didn't even mention the name of the movie, so I was expecting something so malevolently anachronistic that my jaw incredibly falls. It was unbelievable, I found that I couldn't believe the financiers thought it was a big international hit. <br /> <br /> The problem is cast and script. I know that Australia with its small population does not have a large number of actors, so I am mostly forgiving, but this does not prevent my criticism of Nick Giannopoulos as Steve. For this type of comedy you are working on, you have to be impressed by the comic skills of the leading actor and I'm sorry to say, but Nick Gil is not just a skill. I would never have heard of him or seen anything else he had, maybe he's a lot better than other shows. Here he is just irritating, not convincing, and I lost that number of times when he closed the camera. The jokes themselves are very flat and predictable, and get back to a script that looks very sophisticated, wondering who thought the female minster Of Work, at the back of the limousine, was funny? You have the feeling that someone in the production should have been more honest and said, "Look at the mate, this scenario is not nearly good enough. Go and make it thinner and more structured" <br /> <br /> toughness. I gave the movie ten out of ten and it would only have been three if it wasn't in one really funny sequence, where Steve looks at the current situation, showing only the blinking on his screen and marking "Dole blodger". This shows that the scriptwriters were aware of the comic timing and social commentary. That's a pity that they didn't come with a much better written film
