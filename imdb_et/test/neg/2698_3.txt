In reality, I trailed the whole review by searching for those that gave less than 5 stars to this film. They were little and far away. What is completely confusing! Yes, I know it's a Disney movie and it's not led by Christopher Nolan, but by the good Lord. This is a direct-advantageous bucket. They should have done this and animated the bloody thing. <br /> <br /> And even worse, IMDb just doesn't let me stop on my beach because my review needs to be longer! <br/> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The weak setup and the big final are the usual boring. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it was the biggest film I've ever seen throughout my life. <br /> <br /> Good, authentic costumes, kits and sports equipment. There I said that.
