We've all started somewhere, in the movies, like Escape In The Fog, so someone like Budd Boetticher could learn their trade before displaying good films. In fact, the film was before it hit the public on 25 June 1945 for the film. <br /> <br /> The war against Europe was almost two months, of course not even Harry Cohn was able to control the history of events. So I don't know why even when the public didn't ask why the Nazi spy ring was helping Japan. Another very bad historical inaccuracy was that the FBI had nothing to do with the Pacific or Asian theater. Carpet and caps were part of the OSS territory of this part of the world. <br /> <br /> If you're a FBI man like William Wright, it's good to have a psychological girl like Nina Foch. He plans to go to the eastern mission to give the names of the main underground leaders to start the Chinese uprising against the Japanese occupation. The Germans who have fallen into the Otto Kruger house learn about it and the whole film is spent with those men who have already lost their war, trying to help their allies. Who by the way, they refer to "Japanese". When Foch travels by the speeding car and knocks him unconsciously, he dreams of Wright's danger and sees what is happening to him on the Golden Gate Bridge. He goes there and fixes the plot. <br /> <br /> All the things you would expect from a nice noir film are the fuzzy atmosphere of San Francisco, the dimly lit kits, the Budd Boetticher have tried their best, just like the cast. But they were just not convincing, probably because they didn't believe in the gap. left on the cutting room floor. I think it was just a weak scenario. <br /> <br /> And Budd and Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures were here for fast moving events.
