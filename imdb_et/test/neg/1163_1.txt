All of the 70's, 80's and even the early 90's horror movies from Psychost, Texas Chainsaw Masacre (the original that didn't warm the WB crap), to the sheep silence. The characters of these films were based on Ed Ge's crimes. Writers and directors used the real story as inspiration to create some of the biggest * fictional * movie killers all the time. <br /> <br /> The old horror movies were great because, although the crimes were loosely based on the facts of Ed Ge's case, they were truly fictitious and far from being true. <br /> <br /> For this movie, they have created a fictional horror film in which they tried to take advantage of the true story of selling a cheap, badly-acting, love story between two characters that nobody really cares about. In fact, these two symbols * good * would have been great victims in the horror film. <br /> <br /> End of lecture ... <br /> <br /> In short, this film was like a nervous underwear in the cold afternoon, tasting a cool cup of chilled vomiting.
