I am a giant fan of both Koyaanisqats and Powaqqats, but this movie is not just good. The reviewer below is absolutely right that the stunning images of the Detroit Station are the first and last memorable scene of the movie. I really wish I had left it after that, instead of continuing to hope in the whole movie. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I felt down. <br /> <br /> The result is almost a complete transformation of the previous two - not necessarily a bad thing if you are a fan, but there is only one piece of it standing fresh for me. But it was good enough that I would probably still be watching the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> But when you see this movie, keep this in mind when you realize you're not enjoying it, going ahead and sharing - you won't miss anything because it doesn't heal. <br /> <br /> Here I also give a summary (warning! spoilers!): many athletes who see Nike's commercial, smiling people, inexplicably eternal head-headed wax mannequins (WTF, who here thought ?)? bitchin '' Photoshop effects, some images designed to compare water, information, money and people comparison (think) ... and then a lot of fast-connected massive violence scenes ... and then a bunch of space. <br /> <br /> I could redo this movie in 10 seconds. Here's my pitch: <br /> <br /> 2 seconds of a happy father with a shaved head and a lycra bike short shorts playing together with a toddler playing a string playing with a kitten; 5 seconds from the "Network" scene where the boy talks about "the elemental forces of nature" and "the money flows, the money flows;" 1 second Reginald Denny, who is burned with brick, and then 3 seconds from Alan Bean, bouncing around the moon. <br /> <br /> There you go - it's 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life I just saved. Of course, I'd get a copy of After Effects and apply a filter or two so it wouldn't look as shameful as it is. If Steven Soderbergh reads this, hey, I don't even need a lot of money for this project ... <br /> <br /> If you ask for "Life as War", I recommend "Bowling for Columbine instead. may not be pseudo-intellectual plywood, which is so fashionable among black thyroid, but at least it's funny.
