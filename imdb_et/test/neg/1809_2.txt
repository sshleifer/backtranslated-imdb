It seemed to be a good way to add more understanding to the book, which was a false premise, for the dark version of the television. The film made it even worse. I was very disappointed in almost every movie. I was hoping that the film would help to assemble the pieces of the book that I did not understand, but that was not the case. It was still confusing and hanging. This is one of those films that makes one feel like watching a movie instead of watching a movie. Not exactly anyone doing it. It was a terrible, boring and slow movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, Nicolas Roeg must have been very desperate when he decided he wanted to make a boring book about the movie. This is a guaranteed loss. It's like fighting a knife, but forgetting a kitchen knife. Knifeless person loses; and the knifeless person was Roeg. Everything I've heard about the movie is bad and the film deserves the bad things to talk about. After watching the movie, I got the impression that the filmmakers just created a book to get the main points. <br /> <br /> Moreover, although the film followed the main story of the book, it left out some details and changed the end. I'm not a fan of it. Roeg disappeared when Marlow and his team reached the Russian seaman camp, and they found a book in that camp. Nor did it show when they came across a sign in the camp, saying, "Wood for you. Hurry. Go carefully" (Conrad 110). At the end of the book, Kurtz also dies in the boat, not in the inn. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, Nicolas Roeg did one good thing about making the film; he managed to hire some games in the movie to be pretty decent. For example, he acquired Tim Roth and John Malkovich, both of whom would later have a successful career. In doing so, he added a little something to the terrible film. Also, although I hang up to break my book, I have respect for it, because it takes a lot of courage to capture the heart of darkness. It's not just the easiest novel to portray a movie. But Twus is a fabulous effort! To sum up, if for some reason someone wants to watch this movie, I suggest you first read the Heart of Darkness. So you get all the scenes left out of the movie and you won't lose it completely. But I really recommend that you don't read the book and that you really don't watch the movie; both are a complete waste of your time. Trust me. I was forced to do my English teacher, and now I want the book and movie not to be. If the book or movie continues, good luck!
