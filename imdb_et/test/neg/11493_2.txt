This is a great example of how a big book has become a bad film. The direction just gives the impression that the movie is ready when they passed, and Patrick Swaze is so wooden that you almost see the doll string on your body. <br /> <br /> Spy Vs Spy movies aren't - or should be - watch out for passenger cars and shooting, the bad guys in this movie are really bad shots and the main characters will not miss, even if they are in the blank space. <br /> <br /> Even action shots are the installation of normal walkways and crashing tables and chairs - awake. <br /> <br /> I went halfway through and turned off - totally boring.
