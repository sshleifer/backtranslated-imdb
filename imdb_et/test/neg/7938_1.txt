I'm the 13th big fan of the original Assault On Precinct. The ice cream scene still haunts me. I'm 33 years old now and I still remember that it's a terrible child. When I heard they restored it, I thought it might be good, but when I saw the movie, it's not 100% the same movie. This is not a remake. This is a bad stolen idea. It was completely destroyed. Majority, Maria Bello, Laurence Fishburne, Ethan Hawke, Gabriel Burne, John Leguizamo and Drea De Matteo are all great actors, but even they couldn't save that movie. It was just wrong. Even the setting was completely the opposite. And how in hell has anyone in this city noticed that there is a war next door? Why not help yourself show up before? Stupid. It makes no sense.
