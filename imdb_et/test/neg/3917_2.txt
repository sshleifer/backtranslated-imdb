Dennis Hopper has to make this movie very hungry. Uneven special effects, very poor writing, cheesy dialogue, foolish face killer-bots. Do not forget to ignore the blatant science. 2 Young Inconvenient Scenes Leads Clothes. The best part of this film was a pull-start in the cyber penis attacked by the captain of the cyborg pirates. 2 out of 10 stars because I am a generous mood.
