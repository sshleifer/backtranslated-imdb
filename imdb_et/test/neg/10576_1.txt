I took my 14-year-old to watch this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was terrible! This movie should be at least R-class. I'm not so tough with movies, but it was just too much. It was a waste of money. I thought it contained some comedy and I knew that comedy would probably be crude, but it was WAY farther than raw. I was sitting there watching and reading (some subtitles at the beginning of the movie was what really got me) and I couldn't believe how sharp it was. I couldn't believe that 13 years old would be reading and viewing this content OK. I don't understand how the rating system works.
