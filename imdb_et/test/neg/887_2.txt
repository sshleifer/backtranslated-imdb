Frankly, I haven't seen this movie for years, but a few times I've been inclined to do some of that memory, like anyone who has seen it. I saw it for the first time at the YMCA Halloween party at the beginning of the sixties, and it frightened us hell. I remember the real anxiety about unknown things that lie in the maze. I can't stop, except to say that it was at least surprising. I vaguely remember the entire audience of young boys who gave out a big scarecrow, followed by laughter, when a terrible secret appeared. Most viewers have seen it as one of the biggest unintentionally funny peaks and somehow strange moves in the film's history film. You have to see it yourself, which is not easy nowadays. I don't know if it is available through home video, but it would still be a great Halloween feature for kids and adults alike.
