Unfortunately, I was unable to accept more recent comments. Frankly, I thought it was worse than Carry's Columbus, though. The last film, usually from the brilliant Charles Hartrey, who looked at humor, had moved to the busy level of buses that films were made at the same time, more honestly funny. Barabara Windsor was embarrassed, as one of your mothers flirt with friends who still think she is eighteen, on vacation with some of the Scotsman, Rab c Nesbit, she's not. The series miraculously tricked duffers like Carry on Behind and Carry on England. Carry on Dick wasn't bad, but really at the end of this movie was a pity, because this movie couldn't imagine that movie before?
