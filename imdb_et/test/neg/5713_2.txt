What is this movie? Does Mr Lyne and his writers think that a sado-masochistic fling between two twisted Yuppies can wear a feature-length movie? Perhaps, if he had some comedy elements (which is not, at least intentionally), or there were some additional dramatic elements (which do not exist) or maybe it would be hardcore. No, it's just the history of the thing; Chronology of R-rated clusters. Ho-hum who cares? "Nine Â½ weeks" deserves every Razzie name. It's a loser. <br /> <br /> And what about Roger Ebert and his rally? Where was he almost in 1986?
