Great disappointment about what has been said as an incredible film. Incredibly bad. Very terrible. It would be nice if someone created a high profile role for a young woman who was not a prostitute. <br /> <br /> We don't know anything about this character except he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic. We don't know why. Nicholas Cage usually becomes excellent, but I feel that role and this script will let him down. And how after he's unable to fill the whole movie, will he get an erection in his dead chamber? Really terrible and I felt like I needed a bath.
