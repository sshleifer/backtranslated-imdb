For several reasons, this film is just terrible. Other posters are listed in some of the historical errors in this movie. Well, I have ignorant knowledge of Roman history and even found that inaccuracies are blatant. I usually make mistakes in historical movies because I understand that the goal is not to educate. And a long saga for two hours requires some, for example, historical licenses. But this film goes beyond just rounding. <br /> <br /> Worse. To talk about a distant era, the film uses setbacks that simply make the story confusing. If viewers do not have prior knowledge of this period, they will be lost quickly. In addition, the film was probably filmed simultaneously in Italian and English, with different actors later named. Sometimes, the actors seem to be in completely different films, which then together. In fact, it is far from wrong. The actors were obviously pasted on a cheesy computer created for ancient Rome. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this boring confusion is all the stars because I always find Peter O'Toole amused. But this is no reason to rent it. If you are curious about Rome's history, much better movies are available.
