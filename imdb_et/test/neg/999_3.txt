The main genre is a thriller that is mixed with awkward time-a-trois. Fellowes has tried to make much more use of it, using the title lies to bring in all sorts of small twists that are always meant to surprise characters more than the audience. <br /> <br /> It's really dirty. Fellowes doesn't care about presenting thriller elements in a way that keeps us on the seat. Rather, he focuses himself on moral preconditions. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is inconsistent, local, native, and with a constant surprise to the realism that the random clich√©-landmine reverses. Although there is no momentum in the locations, so that the actors in their room can handle the existing ones, the terrible score cannot create an extra dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of the given sets. It is also very prosaic, I dare say that the British know filming. I didn't want to see a document of two successful middle-class people who have been struck by an emergency situation, and I wanted to see a story of cozy artificial reading. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is actually a story that allows you to rest. Just as the elements of the intermediate control are fairly flat, this is the story of the asymmetric sum of the sub-blocks of different shapes and sizes, which is woven as a means of checking characters. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with good performances, and John Warnaby's unequaled colleague Simon Wilkinson is welcome to the big edge of the film. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed; not that it is bad, but it could have been much better. 3/10
