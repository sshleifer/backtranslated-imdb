I'm a historian. This movie is so wrong that it hurt. I tried to look open, but if you intend to shoot or do something like this, do some homework at least about history, locations, church records, and more. Please stop playing foolish audiences. There are also those who really put our shoes in and go to the theater when such a city worthy of a theatrical publication comes in. A little research, all I ask. But then again, this book, based on it, is a joke in itself. So, in principle, they took a lot of mistakes with a novel and decided to put this scenario, millions and millions of dollars, and make an incredibly promoted world-wide release and never take the time to do a little research on it. I know a number of my colleagues who would only have done this for credit or at least given it to a student organization for several weeks to explore different aspects? or just pay someone to know a few bucks just run because trust me, there are many hungry historians out there who would have jumped into the opportunity if he had presented himself.
