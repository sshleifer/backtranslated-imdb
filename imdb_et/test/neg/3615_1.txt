Now we know where they got the idea of ​​the snakes on the plane. You don't pay explicitly to see this movie. If you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life, either with a cable or you can choose it for free from NetFlix or Blockbuster. Don't pay to rent it. If you pay, you are one stupid person. The action was terrible, the plot was terrible, everything was terrible, except for the snakes. Whether they were real or CGI, they saw it pretty well. But it is said that this movie must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. Even the scene of naked dance was pretty bad, so I forwarded it quickly. Don't sit what I didn't warn.
