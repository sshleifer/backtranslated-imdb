You know, I hate the IMDb censorship system because my review is almost gone. But here we go. Editing time! <br /> <br /> The holy mole is bad. I thought it might be a cool little movie, evaluating the plot summary, because you know I've rented precious gems like Frailty and American Nightmare. But it's just an abominal. It is a killer who uses Edgar Allen Poe's works to exploit his murders and the story of a detective who has to stop him. Do not these shameful cages get a good movie without attacking the grave of a great horror writer? I mean, the killings here are totally pointless or original, and the references to the store are hockey and fake, without having enough of them. They are low and they shame the store's work. Full of holes with terrible sequencing. Action is also bad, reminding me of the abortion that was known in some third countries as "Fear of X", with all pauses and non-emotional lines. <br /> <br /> I realize it's an indie movie, but it's no excuse. I have seen that high school kids are doing better than those mores, and I myself would have been able to find better kill scenes and a better plot, given enough time. <br /> <br /> There is no reason for this. Avoid at all costs.
