It's beyond doubt what is the absolute worst film I've ever seen. It's been a long time since I've seen it, but the jokes aren't funny, the plot is painstakingly predictable, calling the main characters a fool to dramatically improve your intelligence ... uggh! I just wanted to hit Tom Arnold and shout him because he wasted two hours of my life when I was watching this movie a bit. I don't even know why I ever wanted to watch it, but remember when you see this movie: DO NOT KNOW YOU ARE NOT WARRANTED. <br /> <br /> PS Tom Arnold's character is singing the song "I'm My Grandfather" in this song. Sufficiently said.
