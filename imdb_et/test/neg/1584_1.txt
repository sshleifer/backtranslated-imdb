I'm not surprised when I found the user with comments on a movie that is full of funny nonsense, like the fact that this movie "[proves] that if it is predetermined, love will do." I start this way, not by criticizing a particular reviewer, but because this quote reflects the hyperbolic, critical syrup that was poured on this film, even before it hit theaters. Even the best films do not prove anything or intend. The best films attract and move the viewer and "English patient" fails on both criteria. <br /> <br /> I remember very clearly the promotion of "English Patient" in the studio: "From Amadeus Producers" and "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", he said greatly. An ignorant or negligent listener may omit the decisive word, "manufacturers" from this false statement, and mistakenly associate the director of the "English patient", so very inappropriately, with a great leader Milos Forman. This comparison is offensive to Mr Forman's memory. <br /> <br /> Although Michael Ondaatje's novel, based on the film, is good, it is unfortunate that the film was unable to record any quality. in any way. In addition to the elements of the plot that seem only coincidentally, the film has little resemblance to the novel. Despite hearing that I heard a shamelessly misleading advertisement, I saw it in a movie theater. As it began to open up, I realized that the novel magic of the novel was not successful, that the actors knew their words, but not their characters, and that their characters were flat, boring and loose. The film was the perfect travesty of Ondaatje's novel and an artifact of cinema that was completely born out of the worst description. <br /> <br /> Those who hit this movie are very apt to speak adjectives like "swipe" and "grand" and "hypnotic". Well, that's not one of them. In fact, even Ondaatje's fine novel cannot be described as "sweeping" or "great". This can be called "magical" and "hypnotic" - but these are the qualities that the film could not fully. Almost like Minghella, as a reader, he would have completely lost what was valuable in the novel and could only polish the pale, skeletal version of the celluloid, which not only left the story to the mind, but focused on the wrong characters. He produced a transliteration of the film, which not only respected the metaphor of the story, but also its visibility. <br /> <br /> Minghella focused on Hana and Kip and put it on the patient and Katherine Clifton, thus neglecting both the novel's narrative and its "essence". <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas loose, in uninspirit, enthralling, meaningless performances, which were apparently meant to convey a big, flying, passionate love relationship to the viewer, but which actually only gave an unexplained, perfect bond between two flat, low and an uninteresting adulterer. Both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and vague, and both performances did not give the viewer an excellent emotional response that was obviously intended for the grand and crowded presentation of Minghella. <br /> <br /> The features loved by many non-discriminatory reviewers of this tobefile are simply not. Comparison with David Lean ("Dr. Zhivago") positively offends another major director. Take, for example, the "Patient" Sand Hill scene, which is undoubtedly one where it is believed that these "great, sweeping" qualities have lived (or should have lived): the sand break is not great - it is not even convincing. Subsequent drunkenness in the car and their emergence after the storm, which undoubtedly had to affect the viewer dramatically and emotionally, lacked drama or emotion - in fact, because it was so weak, it was comedy air where comedy was clearly in place. <br /> <br /> This movie failed. It failed as a novel and it didn't work as a movie. This seems to have been the "winning Oscar vehicle of the year" (combining such excess trumpet film clips as "Kramer vs Kramer" or "Endearment Terms"). God can only be thanked for the fact that even the hype-oriented Acadamy had a good idea to give Frances McDormand the best actress award for a truly worthwhile performance in a really great movie "Fargo". The busy "English patient" had no performances that were not so embarrassing (Willem Dafoe) or a truly forgotten, mediocre actor (Fiennes and Scott Thomas). <br /> <br /> Why this non-film's importance preserves the secret of fanatical (and clearly flavored) devotees. Luckily, the sands of the time will permanently burst into the center of this film and fortunately will never ever dig out.
