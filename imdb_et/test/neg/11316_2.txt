Leslie Nielsen is usually someone who really likes movies (even critically, like "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" and "Wrong Accused"). So the fact that I'm "Mr Magoo" slamming, should show that it's a piece of junk. It casts Nielsen's myth as a headline, something is planted on it and it makes everything confusing. It seems that the combination of Nielsen and director Stanley Tong (behind Jackie Chani's two films) would make it one of the most fun movies, but that's not; it looks like they just have something to do, and there's no real humor here. <br /> <br /> So the original cartoon with Jim Backus, which gave the voice, was worth it, so avoid this movie. Leslie Nielsen has also done much better, so there is no reason to waste her time. Also starring Kelly Lynch, Stephen Tobolowsky, Ernie Hudson, Malcolm McDowell and Miguel Ferrer; they probably do not want to emphasize this junk in their career.
