I only comment on very good movies and perfect garbage. My goal is to help people who want to see great movies of their time and money wisely. <br /> <br /> I also want to stop wasting people, and I want to disclose the fact that their manager / producer of a garbage can not get away with it for a long time. We find who you are and who vote with your feet and wallets. <br /> <br /> This movie clearly falls into the garbage category. Director and writer is John Shiban. This is always a bad sign if the writer is also a director. Maybe he wants two payment checks. He shouldn't get anything. So remember the name - John SHIBAN. And if you see something else, forget it. <br /> <br /> I'm not talking about the house - others are already. I'm a little worried about how much she is crying and screaming at the face of a poor girl. These long-lasting shots are a bit worrying and can say something about Mr Shiban's mental state. Maybe he should get psychiatric help. <br /> <br /> It's enough. It's nonsense - don't waste your time.
