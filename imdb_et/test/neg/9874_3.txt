I am almost twenty years old who has read comics for most of his life. I'm not a big fan of Fantastic Four, but I'm quite familiar with them. In 1994, Roger Corman (B-legend) produced the first, I think, feature-length Fantastic Four movie. The result was a clean score he never gave. Nonetheless, there are copies, mainly in the network and in conventions. If you are looking to laugh and find a copy, do it yourself and check it out. <br /> <br /> The film basically features FFi's origins and meeting with Doom and the villain named The Jeweler, essentially Mole Man, who wants small shelters. As with these comic books, everyone has to tie everything up so that FF plays an important role in Dr. Doom's creation and plays an important role in his role. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would just like to mention that despite what went badly in this movie, I liked the one who played Doom. He doesn't get many decent features, but when he hits them. The armor also looks pretty good. <br /> <br /> The rest ... it's a dirty, dirty mess. Bad plots, bad actions, bad effects, bad everything basically. Boos especially to Jay Underwood, bringing a new meaning to the word as Johnny Storm. He is not superfluous, he is supreme. <br /> <br /> As for the FF, they all look right and Sue is a very attractive actor, but they just don't seem like a real team. First, they have no reason to go to Sue and Johnny in space. Early in the year, Ben and Reed visit these two, Johnny is like 8 and Sue is about 12. It only stands for the creation of their romantic couple in a tender party. Thing's costume looks more like a reptile than anything else, not very rocky, and the only time Human Torch is really a human flashlight, it looks like a Silver Surfer that is tinted in red. <br /> <br /> I think the scene that best summarizes is a climatic meeting that includes the above-mentioned non-human flashlight. He drives a laser beam and eventually destroys it with a shot. Yes, punch. Laser beam. With Punch. Then he flies around and goes "Yippeee!" much after which the camera leans down and drives to the ground. Obviously I forgot intellectual Reed Johnny to report that there is no space in the vacuum. This and many other scenes work like Looney, when the character doesn't know they are over the rock, they don't. <br /> <br /> I laughed, shouted, I was glad it wasn't published.
