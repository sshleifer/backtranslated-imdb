Wow. Not thanks to 3-D images that were sometimes well used to provide good deep shapes, but what is the end of the flat! At the end of the film, he seems to be a symbol of himself. This movie must be one of the most boring movie monsters and one of the most pathetic attempts to explain it. This movie is also painful. If you are looking for a laughable 50-year-old sci-fi movie (called "bot fodder"), go to it. Otherwise, look for better movies.
