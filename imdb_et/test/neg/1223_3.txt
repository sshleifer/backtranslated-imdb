I looked at all three segments and am so disappointed with the story. Zahn spends so much time to breastfeed Duvall so she doesn't show anything else. And Tommy Lee Jones would never be as weak as a young man, unlikely yes, but weak never. We never see how or why they go back to Lonesome Dove ... what is the dirt hole in the original ... why would they ever leave Austin where they are heroes to do something during the movie ... At the end of the movie I was Blue Rooting Duck and he was totally wrong. There is no warning about how many segments ... it ends. This mini-series could have been "someone" ... tragic. It seemed that it was led by Parrot and Jag
