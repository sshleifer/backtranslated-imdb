Funny thing. Charlie Sheen, Donald Sutherland, Sam Waterston and Stephen Lang all had incredible performances. Who can forget Sheen as a walk in Wall Street or Sutherland as a cynical Korean surgeon in MASH? Waterston and Lang have both been successful TV and film careers (Law and Order, Killing Fields, De Niro Tribeca, etc.). So, what in the world would be one of those fine actors like it is? The "Shadow Conspiracy" plot of Washington coup is not really so bad, unfair, but not so bad. Of course it's done (seven days in May - fine film!), But doubling it would have been fun. <br /> <br /> Shadow Conspiracy's main problem is execution. Sheen, a political strategist, extremist, ridiculously and incredibly resolves the potential of public relations congression. Later, the news is described as "gang wars" when Lang's muttering striker hits half of what should be Georgetown. Has anyone ever lived in Washington with this film? Sheen is about 20 years too young, too young to be so high in the White House administration. Sheen's response to the political crisis is so wrong with the masseuse, she looks like she attended David Hasselhoff's show school. And when was the last time the gang fought in Georgetown? We are talking about a part of Washington where citizens voted against a metro stop so they can retain their exclusivity. <br /> <br /> I agree with another reviewer that this movie would have been a faster back and forth button. I recorded it from HBO back a year ago and then took 3 separate views to hit it. Don't even rent this movie. If you see it in Blockbuster, run as fast as you can.
