Almost certainly women are being staged, who read the lines (very briefly) and get naked (not very briefly) in the anonymous (and uncontrolled) panel - almost certainly the producer Charles Band. Deep cinema is a random scene of many films (mainly lesbian scenes). Most women like "horses" (Hmmm); there is a Polish woman who seems to have seen an interest in acting despite her hearing; secret; camera that shoots actors behind the screen ... <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Lovell (too built up but still beautiful) introduces a couple of her movie scene and speaks "sexy" with the camera (if you enjoy lesbian scenes, it comes with Lovell and Vanessa Taylor Femalian, and they are probably the best lesbian "couples." A strange excuse for pulling the film and obviously naked women, honestly boring and uninspiring experience.
