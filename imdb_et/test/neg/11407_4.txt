I swear I didn't want to! I just picked it out because it seemed good back! This movie was not at all intimidating and it was really confusing. The demon-wind was used only a few times and people were killed in real fun. One of the main shining places saw Sherri Bendorf playing at the slaughterhouse. Seeing what happened to her, it made me a movie for a small turkey. 3 out of 10. NEXT!
