Such films give the independent films a bad name! It is just a boring composition of the twists that have no structure. I wouldn't be surprised if the screenwriter was completely rocked. If you want to see good stoner comedy, check out "Half Baked". It's not an award winning, but at least it made me laugh. The film was obviously on the micro level. Every scene takes place in someone's house, in someone's apartment or outside. If writing was good and the dialogue would be interesting, I would have ignored the film's budget (as in Edward Burns's films), but apparently this is not the case now. <br /> <br /> I quote Robert DeNiro from "A Bronx Tale" when I say "There is nothing worse in the world than a waste of talent." All cast is talented. Luke Wilson, Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, Jeremy Sisto - All the Talented Performers! And they've all been in much better films. The actors give him everything, but they couldn't go too far with such a flat script. The only scene that was interesting was Jack Black's coat where he sang the song about staying in the woods. And of course, there was a short strip club scene in the beginning, which I found attractive. <br /> <br /> Characters are uninteresting and the story is hardly present. Many movies are terrible, but at least you understand their intentions. What was Bongwater's intention? The world never knows. <br /> <br /> My score: 2 (out of 10)
