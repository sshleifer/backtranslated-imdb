Frankly, I've never been to Congo or even Africa, and after watching the television of the Heart of Darkness, I don't think I would. The film completely shakes the book to the highest possible level. Although the book was not the best I read, it seemed that after watching the film, I rated the book a hundred times more. Film director Nicolas Roeg made a terrifying work that depicted Joseph Conrad's short story as a film. I give Roeg any credit for trying to try it out by making the book a movie, but it may not be his job. The film failed to express some of the short stories except the basics of the plot. The set and the landscape also lacked the beauty of Conrad depicted in Africa. In the book, Marlow had seen so many wonderful wonders, but in the film you didn't get the same experience. No, I don't blame everything the director; acting in the movie was just terrible. All participants were bored and uninteresting. Throughout the film, I felt that the actors put emotional things as if they had read the script all the time. Tim Roth, who plays Marlow, did not depict Marlow's adventure on his journey to the Congo. Marlow's journey had to reveal Kurtz, but I didn't experience it in the movie. I wouldn't want to watch this movie, especially if you've already read the book. It is not close to achieving the justice of Joseph Conrad's short story. Conrad's words grab the reader and take them to Marlow for a trip, trying to find Mr. Kurtz where the film was not. Great short story, but very bad film. The heart of darkness, the film, is based on Joseph Conrad's book, also called the Heart of Darkness.
