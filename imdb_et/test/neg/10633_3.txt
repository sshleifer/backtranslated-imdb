I watched this movie because I thought it was a classic film by Amy Adams. Wow, this movie is so bad on so many levels that it is an imagination. It is poorly designed for one, including the script and the actor is just terrible. But hey even Johnny Deppil is under his belt bad movies. Amy's singing would be the reverse of this movie, and even on this score I could have chosen better songs. Amy is naturally beautiful to see and if you are her hard fan, you look at this title no matter what, just don't wait too much. I wish I could have liked more, but it was just a painful look. I recommend Sunshine Cleaning or Doubt.
