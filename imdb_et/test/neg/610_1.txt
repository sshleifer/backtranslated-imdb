This exhibition uses a rather tired sitomoon form of fatty idiot with a blue collar slob that has a pretty (and sometimes good-looking) wife and crazy in-law (s). With this show, this fat is an unforgettable comedian, Kevin James, as Doug Hefferman, who works as a parcel delivery manager. She has a pretty wife, Carrie (Leah Remini), who works as a legal assistant and an ancient parent, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in her daughters and sons cellar. Kevin James' Doug is your typical beer drinking, sports-loving, TV-watching sitcom spouse who would rather look at the tube than deal with his marriage issues. He also has a couple of idiot friends who give the couple a few fools over the problems that have arisen on the screen. In addition to the few laughs that Jerry Stiller's crazy character showed, this exhibition was generally uncomfortable. The jealous behavior of Kevin James usually caused exhibition problems that were usually solved by his wife. This show continued running sitcoms with fat dumb dad / husband and their pretty women that all seemed to be running ABC for some reason.
