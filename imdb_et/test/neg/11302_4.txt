A typical old b & w movie. Dialogues are sometimes good, but too often - especially on the other side - they get naive, sometimes terribly naive, from time to time near the point where they are involuntarily comic. The first third, whose background information about Ladd Gatsby has been shown with many interesting setbacks, is the best part of the film. But when Gatsby moves to his new villa and makes his movements to Betty Field, the film becomes too melodramatic. The end is another end-end; I don't know if the novel contains this fool, the end of the cliché, or whether the film producer made some changes in it, but I've always considered car accidents a bad way to add the story to drama. I've seen this plot device a million times (or if it's not a car, it's a horse drop); The writer doesn't know how to end the story, but she knows she wants it to be dramatic so she adds to the car accident. Lame. And to make things worse, the accident is terribly casual and uncomfortable, both in terms of parcels and times; a piece because Winters of Field's husband is killed by Field and the fact that Winters is attacking from the gas station to the street as if he had never noticed in the years he lived there, that there was a dangerous road across the house - and, of course, just that at the moment he came out, he sees Ladd's car and makes a mistake in Field's wife's car and then shouts, "Here! I am here! this tragic end! '; from time to time, because Ladd and Field are involved in the accident the same day as they are preparing to tell Field's husband about their case. Basically, this accident is just too much forced and artificial irony. Nor does this film help Winter's wife, Da Silva, go on a revenge mission to kill a man who has run over his wife. he does it mainly by walking like a zombie, a car goes out of the car, looking for scratches and doing very badly. Both Da Silva's behavior and his character's behavior throughout the film are terrible and confusing. <br /> <br /> Scott Fitzgerald was a few times disturbed how Hollywood screenwriters adapted their screen and had died a long time before making this film - he was perhaps right to file a complaint by deciding on the film according to a naive script. Or maybe his novels are even the heralds of this movie and are more naïve and the screen adaptations actually improved it. Or movies are quite similar to novels. Of course, I could read this particular novel to find out, but I just can't bother him. Fitzgerald's name doesn't inspire me to read any of his books (and I don't mean how his name sounds). He was certainly not Heller, Clavell or Twain. More like Hemingway? a lot of noise for nothing.
