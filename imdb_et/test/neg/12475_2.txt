Almodovar's film always sends its backbone. The capitalized publication, which opens up the latest feature of the Spanish author, instantly generates memories of merciful nuns, gentle necrophilia, transsexuals? And I haven't even reached as far as the terrible critical early work of babies. And after a beautiful opening ceremony, where the camera turned over the winds that were animated with widows that were feverishly cleaning the tombstones, I thought Pedro was still under my evil spell. <br /> <br /> Yet when my nostalgia he had shrunk, there was very little to fill that place. For a director who loves humanity for assassins and rapists, he does a very bad job of finding emotional depth or love for his women. Penelope Cruz is Raimunda, a heroine housewife whose life is complicated by the accidental killing of her daughter. Fortunately, he lives in Almodovar, Spain, where your friends are happily helping to destroy the offer of cocktails. Add Raimunda's mother to the ghost and many other matriarchs with an eccentric warm heart. "Volver" literally means returning and Pedro seems to be recycling old material. In the subset of incest, it feels like it is a "taboo". Instead of commenting on this problem or disapproving, as in the treatment of his pedophilia in Bad Education, it seems to be forced and persuasive when the film's chick-flicki sentimentality is. I recommend Almodovar to call his next movie Salir (move on).
