I remember when I first heard of Jack Frost. I was in Miranda at Video Ezy with my family's monthly video tradition. At that time, I made the courage to commit to the store's horror section. Finally, browsing the different titles came to Jack Frost. The cover was enough to convince me that the film was beyond my ways of viewing. Years later, the film disappeared, but replaced the inevitable but unnecessary sequel. I reiterated with the horror section and took only one conclusion: the film would be scary? Jack Frost 2: Killer's Revenge Mutant Snowman (real title) follows where his predecessor left. Sheriff Sam is looking for advice after his trials and Jack is now in an anti-freeze. To escape his past, Sam and his wife go to an island hotel where he has stereotypes of many different films, including busty female models, thick-headed sports jocks, and a Caribbean staff company. But Jack is released from his liquid grave and is back with his icy methods. He leads the island and kills someone who would have been a fantastic death. Only Sam can stop him. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that it's a direct-video movie, so it's definitely bad. But it is terrible even on other eyes. The work of the camera is bad, using a camera that would make the soap opera majestic. Half of the actors look like they have come out of the porn scene and the other side looks like they've come out of the old home, but actually they have come out of the shelter. The film is widely used in special effects that tend to alternate between wonderful doll girls and CGI that a child can improve, and death scenes are mostly off, showing us little about what happened unhappy but worthy of sacrifice. But the film is the most memorable one with a killer liner like "There's something that needs a little Christmas pack" and "I know I pronounce you officially dead!" Ultimately, the purpose of the whole movie, as it is, is to make popcorn close to their boredom on Friday nights and even it fails. In order to keep the film, which was a poorer sliding term, so that the child would find it incredible, must he take some steel nerves? or entire front lobotomy. Directed by Michael Cooney? Thank you for wasting your time. To everyone else? Avoid Arsenic.
