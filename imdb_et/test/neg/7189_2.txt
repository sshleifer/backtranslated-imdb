The creators of this film have to sit one day and say, "Let's joke with the Russians and at the same time show people how far we are (Americans)". The film depicts the Russians as the lower people who cannot understand the brilliant ideas of the Americans. It is true that American campaigns are likely to be based on more professional and costly research than campaigns in other countries. But this film goes a long way and it exaggerates the differences between East and West. It seemed like a propaganda film made during the Cold War.
