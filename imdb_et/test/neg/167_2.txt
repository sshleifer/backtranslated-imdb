This movie is actually so bad in its desperate attempts to be "good at feeling" and casual, it made me look embarrassed. I can't imagine how the inner circle of Norwegian celebrities and journalism should have been felt when trying to pretend it was a starring premiere. His great media reviews are a bad example of how ridiculously small and inbred Norwegian media activity is. If a foreign film of this quality had reached a silver screen, it would have reaped the rain of rotten tomatoes that it really deserves. <br /> <br /> Literally amateur amateurs, home-style visual effects, uncomfortable dialogues, painfully idle attempts at work-class humor, and an overly cozy and pointless plot make it a truly rock-less quality film. Stay away.
