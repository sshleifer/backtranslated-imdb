"I remember waiting for the birth ..." <br /> <br /> "Vision quest that was in the west of America." <br /> <br /> "We went into the psychic ..." <br /> <br /> "I am sure their first reaction is to have a cache" <br /> <br /> ". "The place is haunting ..." <br /> <br /> "I think there is another dimension here." <br /> <br /> Artist (Marta Becket) and her husband left decades ago in New York and culture and moved to Death Valley's 10-seated city of God. There they were renovated as a theatrical painting - it is a very cozy / folk art. And when he finished, he puts dance performances on practically anyone. In many ways, this is reminiscent of Werner Herzog's film FITZCARRALDO or DREAMS - although AMARGOSA is a documentary of a real person, not a mysterious crazy man like Klaus Kinski or Kevin Costner. Eventually, his wife leaves a large part of it, probably because of his chosen lifestyle. So she lives with her ten cats and shelter today with her new male companion, Tom. <br /> <br /> What you think about this document depends on your perspectives. If you are in New Age ideas and open to these feelings, you are more likely to appreciate the film. He talked about how he remembers his birth, ghosts, face-to-face visits, and psychology, honestly a psychology teacher, and it would certainly be for many people. In addition, his tomb is also trying to keep the horses in the desert also for PETA and many other animal lovers, although in my background, in environmental and biology, I see burros and horses as a gulf destroying local plants and animals. So in two different accounts I tend to think of a completely different Martha, who is a more "sensory" and "sensitive" individual. Depending on how you feel it all, color your opinions for sure - and I'm pretty sure most people think it's a genius or a nut! You just have to guess what I think. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the movie is interesting and Marta's life is definitely not boring - especially since in recent years people have actually started traveling in the desert to see her. He and his unusual little world are sure to follow. Although I wouldn't be almost as positive as most of the comments, I can't be as negative as one review, because this bizarre documentary is certain. I like movies about unusual people and Marta is definitely unusual! I also appreciate his love for his art and his happy life - a rare gift. <br /> <br /> I teach psychology at art school and it would be interesting to show it to the workers - where I'm pretty sure we can get a positive and negative reaction to the film - probably depending on whether teachers taught art classes or curriculum! Surely it would be interesting. By the way, and I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but if Martha's husband had things to do with it? After all, they lived in the middle, where and where I was thinking of where to find partners. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you want to see him / her and / or stay with him / her, please visit www.amargosaoperahouse.com/.
