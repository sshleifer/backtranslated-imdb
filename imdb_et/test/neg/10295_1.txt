The film's executive producer is not the messenger of peace through transcendental meditation, directed by David Lynch. I don't know what would have thought of the production of David's guru, His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Here hypocrisy is as reluctant as the film itself. It is sure that Samuel L. Dieteman, Phoenix's serial killer and devotee, would have loved it every minute. <br /> <br /> I doubt if many will carry this film for their cinematic art; at this level it's pretty good. But on a moral level, this is the most unpleasant film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER Come on <br /> <br /> I think this is the phonics of the thing that makes me most sad. Morally dull Generation Xers learns craft and small postmodern aesthetic theory at art and film school, and then participates in the arts and entertainment industry; and here's the result: a movie that splits human suffering, injustice, and carnage, a large part of which is witnessed by a nine-year-old who sees his whole family murdering a murderer in some entertainment-violence that eventually drives to leave the sunset. Narrally, the sadists begin to adore it - why not? But who else? As I noted above, here are some really good movie ships, but good crafts can be applied to any object. Why use it for such things? The film is also very tense, but it does not result from the graphic nature and gravity of the violence; it is tense because it is well targeted and well-functioning. I'm sure Alfred Hitchcock's ghost can explain this much better than I can. And above all why? Yes, our world can be ugly, dirty, even a place of evil, but shouldn't we have to disagree when the "artist" rubs his face off his business? Or worse, to hold the face of those nine-year-olds who, in one way or another, see it at home on DVD? <br /> <br /> I hope people take care of not seeing this baby. Yes i know - dream, bernon ...
