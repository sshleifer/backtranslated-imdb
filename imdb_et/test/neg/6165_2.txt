Sorry, guys, everyone who thought this movie might be great, I'm afraid you would be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The standard, the movie you wanted to set up, has been completely destroyed by a very simple plot. It's so simple that the movie doesn't change to the end. I asked myself if the plot was not an activity, but a main brother (played by Mickey Rourke), but I found that the character was inconsistent - whether he was a professional killer or a fault haunted his brother. But they're not going to come together because the guy he's trying to manage depicts him in dangerous situations where no professional killer himself is. Now, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is a good-looking actor, but he played his character a bit unnaturally. I didn't believe his behavior, it seemed that the director tried to get rid of him, which he couldn't offer. And he didn't have to do it because his less crazy crazy behavior was scary. The only one whose behavior was great was Diane Lane. If not, I'd give this movie one star. <br /> <br /> Finally, I thought I could see some well-played film and an interesting plot. And I blew it with my great expectations.
