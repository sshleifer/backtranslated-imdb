I wanted to like it - the situation was rich and the setting was unusual and interesting. But the story has been broken by elements of childish gothic romance that are hard to swallow. The director is unfairly damaged by "goy" characters - content that allows them to have grotesque cardboard cards - and inexplicably pleasing to the heroine's homewrecking behavior. A potentially interesting power struggle between inventor and governor has not really worked. <br /> <br /> The credibility of feminist filmmakers is greater when they stop manipulating situations in order to throw the hero all the compassion and start honestly with the problems. This film reminds me of "The 7 Pieces of Gold", another serious failure, more than "The Piano" - a real passion.
