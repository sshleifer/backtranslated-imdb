It does not equate to the adventures of space at this time. These are Star Wars and Star Trek. And although I'm not a Star Trek fan, I know this movie is compared to the Trekkies series. In fact, I would put my back and the future into a better room and for travel. <br /> <br /> The story is a boy caught by space bots (pirates). Obviously a fake and endless battle is being conducted by the imprisoned boy with pirates and even helps them. And slowly, one by one, these riders die. Finally, the boy gets home and the last pirates flee seriously wounded. <br /> <br /> The actor wasn't that big. But what is actually clear is the complete lack of interesting dialogue, influence and story. The way they even got it for 80 minutes is farther away from me. <br /> <br /> If you want to do this because it includes space, go ahead. But warn me. "D"
