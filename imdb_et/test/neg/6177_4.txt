Well, Killshot is not terrible, but it's close. Production values ​​are decent, and the main actors do a good job (except Rosario Dawson, who is in a wasted role), but the story is simply pathetic. I don't know if Elmore Leonard's book had such stupid signs because I haven't read it, but I think the book should be at least a little humorous. The film has no detectable humor. After the first twenty minutes screaming on the screen, "Oh, come on! Nobody's stupid!" In a nutshell, and without spoilers, everyone works in a convenient way with no sense. A very depressing and unrealistic film that may think it sits on the shelf as long as it did.
