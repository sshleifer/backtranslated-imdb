It's such a complete failure to make me angry. <br /> <br /> All the nuances and structures of Reggio's early films have disappeared, leaving nothing but dirty images of digital dirt, the only purpose of which seems to be sketchy The bad things people do. Just like Star Trek-like wormhole graphics, slo-mo painted sea views, obviously counterfeit computer screens, and sporting competition shots, which, by the way, have never been able to film Leni Riefenstahl (or even match it) with moving, edited, and video coloring coatings The "Dr. Who" producer of the 1980s would have rejected "too cheesy", plus "civilized violence"? There is no intellectual, emotional, or visceral connection between these pictures and the mutated, and too many digital effect artists and a cautious story I assume he wants to produce. For all the involved "dramaturgic consultants", no one seems to have given his head out of his feelings, said something important, and found that not everyone might say anything new. <br /> <br /> Only people who watch too much television could make such a movie and think it makes sense; it is kindergarten Stan Brakhage and ultimately an endless manifestation. The only irony and tension that is evident here (unlike "Koyaanisqats", where the relentless beauty and oddity of time-consuming traditional images forced you to think about their meaning) was when I looked at the caught DVD. This is for MTV Noam Chomsky crowd, which is based on reflex rather than reflection and does not mean anything. There are two stars for the music that are the best in the glass of the boss-Cesar Franc and have some passionate cello from Yo-Yo Ma. (I hope he didn't have to record his parts for movie playback, there are some things you don't even have to pay for.)
