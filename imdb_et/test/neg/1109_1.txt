Everything I thought of while watching this movie was, "Will it ever end?!" It was an awful boring look. I wished I could just turn it off, but I wanted to do this review fairly, so I fought for a good fight and kept torture watching this movie, so you, good reader, don't have to wear this pain. <br /> < br /> This movie sounds like it's a great prerequisite when you read space on paper. But the real movie doesn't support this assumption at all. <br /> <br /> The opening scene at the beginning of the 1900s is a small bridge where they force children to wear dynamite in tunnels that aren't big enough to fit adults. It seems to create an interesting film premise. But after 4 minutes it turns out that this is not the case. The adults who committed these crimes are never punished; the film has no consequences for these acts. Open scene is different from the rest of the movie and is completely irrelevant. The last time the film was misrepresented at the opening was 28 days later the scene that was the only good scene that * the whole movie. Wicked Little Things / Zombies (a movie that's so dirty that they changed the title to try to hide it and sell it again) is exactly the same. Open scene is the only observable scene in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Instead, the movie blinks to this day. A single mother and her two dirty, unpleasant children. This is where it would have been wise to press the STOP button and never go near the movie. <br /> <br /> In the first hour, zombie kids have hardly seen. They'll get 3 minutes of screen time together. All they do is kill the pig. The rest of the hour is spent showing the stupid mother and her dark kids are buying things at a local shop, riding around the forest and talking to each other. A dark teenage daughter goes and hangs with some other idiot teen and smokes them together. <br /> <br /> There would be no reason to care at all if the zombie children send someone to this movie. Each symbol is so stupid and tedious, not at all redeeming. Not to mention one-dimensional and clich√©. <br /> <br /> This movie would have been * greatly improved * when mother and her dark children were sent to zombie children in the first 10 minutes when they went to their new house, the final credits. This right would instantly change the score 1/10 to 10/10. Honestly! When a stupid mother takes her eyes off the road and almost runs the road to the pedestrian, her daughter strikes her, "You almost killed us, Mom!" Of course, someone with common sense knows that if a mother had hit a pedestrian, it would be a pedestrian who would have died - not people safely * inside the car *. I think this line was put on film to show first that the stupidity of the main characters doesn't know the boundaries and runs in the family. <br /> <br /> Wicked Little Things / Zombies lasts 1 hour and 34 minutes, but it certainly seemed like 5 hours or more. Seeking not to fall asleep was a huge challenge. After only one hour and 34 minutes, zombie kids don't really kill anything. Then the scene shows funny teenagers who drink beer and prepare in the car and say, "If you ever want to get into your pants, you better run the car and get my ass right here." Seriously, it's literally a movie. Teenagers are so cunning, one-dimensional, badly behaved, stupid and annoying that when zombie children finally shoot three of these hackers in 1 hour and 5 minutes, it seems to be the cause of the party. Of course, the main mother's character "Princess" loses a bitter smoky beer drinking loser daughter. What was that? He was on the screen longer than the others, and therefore most annoying of the four, and most worthy of the pixel. The more it should have been sent within the first 10 minutes as mentioned above. In order to keep him still for 1 hour and 5 minutes, it is completely unforgivable. <br /> <br /> The reason is, of course, that feature-length movies must be padded for at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. So, when he has lived for a long time in life, they still have 27 minutes to film with him and his mother passing through the forest. After 1 hour and 22 minutes, this is the second time of the movie * where the annoying daughter is caught in a vehicle where the engine does not start while the zombie children come to her. <br /> <br /> Zombie kids are completely general. Never say anything. None of them mean any character. <br /> <br /> Finally, all three annoying, idiotic characters live. What, in my opinion, is a way for filmmakers to give the bird gesture a final flipping to the audience. In my opinion, filmmakers know for sure that they have come to anyone who has had a great misfortune to watch the whole movie. Why not rub your faces by not even giving them satisfaction when you see the three main characters that should have been sent within the first 10 minutes to die. <br /> <br /> Avoid the evil little things / zombies like Buboon's plague.
