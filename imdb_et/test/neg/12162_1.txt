First, the film's nature is beautiful and there is a bit of Mongolian music. Well, the horses were looking at Mongol and camels, but that's all about Mongol. Oh, Borte plays an Mongolian actress, though it's flat. But he is beautiful, which redeems a little lack of performance. <br /> <br /> But I couldn't figure out what the thought of this painful, 1.30-hour fantasy was. Mr.Bodrov. The plot lacked a sense of total cohesion. There was no logic in plot development. In fact, there was hardly a story, but a number of loosely tied scenes, with a bunch of men in "Mongolian" clothes, talking about a little pajamas that should sound like a Mongolian. Most of the participants were from Japan, Russia or China, most scenes were shot in China, Kazakhstan or Russia, and there were many disturbing sins about what it was "Mongolian". The dialogue is primitive and the scenes with the dialogue are slow. The battle scenes are ridiculous. The whole supernatural sin is flat and is obviously just a story to make up for the absence. <br /> <br /> The Japanese actress was like a wooden doll, and looking at her, there would be no idea how this person could become a leader who could connect nomadic tribes. He looked at dream, softness, rigidity and mercy for most of the film. <br /> <br /> And I don't even want to start the historical significance of this cinematic waste. To see that Chinggis-khan's side of the film is a slave to see his first two children born from other men to see his wife who sells himself to a Tangut merchant ... my blood starts to boil. And where is the beautiful story of the friendship of Temujin and Jamukha? You could make a great movie out of it. Where is the story of the rise of Temujin? From his childhood, his relationship with his family, his brothers, how did he struggle with his family's violent enemies? where is van khan who helped him a lot? where is the portrayal of life in the steppe, the lives of nomads, their traditions, their relationships with other peoples? <br /> <br /> Where is the development of characters? We can't fully see what Temujin and Jamukha brought and what brought them apart and most importantly, how Temujin became Chinggis-khan, how he, who was not rich and military, was able to unite the Mongol tribes and create an organized and effective war machine it crushed one nation and created the largest empire in history. All of this can make many interesting and dramatic stories with complex plots and deep characters, but unfortunately, Bodrov's work did not see any, not even a glimpse.
