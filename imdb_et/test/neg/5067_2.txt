This music is completely immune to the film, now and then, as a vagnani bombast and Lone Ranger, otherwise nonexistent. Acting outside the two principals is non-existent. It would have been a great student film. Russian soldiers are just models that try to act. Continuous interruptions associated with a wow-blast camera and one-time human color clips were quite irritating, but it is just a personal feeling. The story is no worse than the others, actually not worse than most, completely ignoring logic and reason and reality. At least no one was in front of the gun for three minutes without beating. Three top-notch bad guys were campy.
