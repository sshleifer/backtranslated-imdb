The role of Buddy Ackerman is not a stretch for Kevin Spacey. He has played this version of the character for several times as a better film. It is fortunate because it gives your performance a certain resonance, without which Buddy would be as flat and incomplete as any other of its meaningless little farce characters. The script leaves little time to develop a plot or character similar to a porn movie to rush to get "good stuff". The difference is that there are no "good things" here for people who enjoy each other, but for pain, which is why it is suitable for young adults. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is nothing wrong with porn movies if you want to see how people are having sex, and I think "swimming with sharks" is not wrong if you want to see people who have physical, emotional and psychological torture . But if you are looking for sharp satire, interesting signs, or something that even tries to do more than deal with your main passions, you should probably look elsewhere.
