One of my all-time favorite leaders was regrettably doing all the fun jaw looting; Lamberto Bava (here under your John Old Jr. alias). You know how it goes into these cheap European imitations, right? They want their monstrous animal to be bigger, thicker and more intimidating, but it will usually have the opposite effect. Bava is a human devil and it's more than a shark! We are dealing here with a seemingly prehistoric monster with white white jaws and appetite, but it also has tentacles like an octopus! There are a couple of dolphin-loving oceanologists who discover how this monster can survive all those thousands of years. The "Monster Shark" manuscript makes little sense and most of the operations take place on the mainland. Hai himself is an unintentionally ridiculous creature and Lamberto Bava was a sensible decision to show it only vaguely and quickly. Performance shows are above average and underwater photography is surprisingly clear and handy. The plot twists are predictable and you probably have the most fun detailing about the exact facts of the characters. For example: count all the beer cans Dr. Hogan drinks throughout the movie!
