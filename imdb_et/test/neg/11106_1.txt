A scary script that was probably run by ... anyone? The Navy cannot crush the monster with machine pistols, but it will be removed when a 15-year-old girl in karate begins to face it a few times. It should be a luxurious lining, but Fancy's dining room looks like a cafe in a hospital. They seem to have rented a summer school and pulled a chair and stuff to decorate the set. Finally, they were pulled from the water and from the boat and in less than 3 seconds later they were probably about two miles from the ship when it drowned. I think someone can be in the movie these days. Aaron James, NYC
