I can't believe I let myself rent this garbage! Action was so poor, my grandmother could have done better. The shocks thrown into the movies were not somewhere near the snowball. The movie got home to see! <br /> <br /> So this baseball ring group decides to go to risk, even after they didn't keep the consequences there. So of course they're still going. They decide to link the loser to the so-called peacekeeping. When the loser's best friend becomes aware of it, he and his girlfriend are going to save him. <br /> <br /> The child knows that he has diabetes and is in the hospital while jocks go to the next day. The scarecrow finds them there and kills them all pretty much. <br /> <br /> I'm sure you really don't care. Anyway, with the scarecrow, the link to the "Diabetes Boy" will come and the boy will stop the work of peacemaking when the scarecrow is killed. Yes, it's really cheesy. <br /> <br /> It thought this movie was full of bullsh * t. Sooner or later, the only ones who live (of course) are a boyfriend and a girlfriend who are the main characters :) Then the boy-boy goes and he kills himself in order to break the curse, so that no one else will fall. Hey? No, don't waste your hard earned money, I'll give him one score because it is the lowest, otherwise it won't even earn so much.
