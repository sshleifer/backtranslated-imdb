It's too kind to call this Barker's gang a "fancy" account. They got the names right, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> Russell is still hot, I'll give you this, but it's not the real Ma Barker who basically took care of the boys in cooking and helping them when they moved around the country, not in planning or participating in crimes. I think it would have been more interesting to present the true story of a medieval woman who has received her children and their chronic crimes. <br /> <br /> I also have to agree with those reviewers who found that shooting scenes are absolutely incredible. The victims of Barker / Karpis were a combination of innocent and law enforcement officers who did them, but they certainly did not release one and a half thousand FBI agents each time they were at an angle. (On the other hand, as several recent books have linked, the FBI of this era emphasized that agents come from legal or accounting backgrounds only to the extent that many agents had very little law enforcement or firearm experience. - educated representatives we see today.) <Br /> <br /> The worst sin of all is that the film is essentially pure. No one changes, no one grows. We know the end of the road, we just don't know what the shooting game is. <br /> <br /> Only for dead Russell fans.
