It must be the most divine-scary cinema I ever watched. This makes Mel Brooks the Oscar of the movie. Jim VanBebber must be publicly defeated to try to pass it on in NO entertainment. While some may say that this movie is a low budget genre of such classics as "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" or "Living Dead Night", the value of the production is not questionable. VanBebber's ability to cast and present a credible story. he would choose the first actor he saw with beard and long hair. Don't forget that this actor's hair came to the back, (Manson never went beyond his shoulders), this actor spoke in a terrible monotone without being part of the person Steve Railsback or even Jeremy Davies depicted his Manson. "" Tex "The actor chosen to play Watson had straight dark hair instead of a curly blonde, who knows that anyone who has shown even the most distant interest in the Manson case, looks like a farmer in Minnesota." In the Small House at Prairie. The actor who plays Susan Atkins is wider than Oprah, while family members are familiar in. miracles know that "Clem" was considered somewhat slowed down, the actor who depicted him did this campy, the Chaplinesque tea was like watching an old Vaudev act. Instead of seeing Sharon Tate look like a pretty pregnant woman, the actor seemed to have swelled the trash of an alcoholic trailer. VanBebber accelerates filming in some places for an artistic effect, but this technique has not proved to be very useful as "Munsters". The final credits are listed by all known family members, but we have never been introduced to most of them and the ones we introduce are not sure who they are. <br /> <br /> The facts are also destroyed in this movie. "Lotsapoppa" did not die in real life, Steven Parent was shot four times, not twice, Abagail Folger had no throat slit with Mary Brunner and Bruce Davis at Himnan's murder? Patricia Krenwinkel has never played "Dorothy Hamill" hair style. <br /> <br /> The most striking aspect of this movie is what did the "freaks" of today have to do with this movie? Why was the girl stuck with a rubber mask dildo? What was their problem with the journalist? What was the meaning or purpose of the final confrontation? Why were they involved, period? The viewer never knows! <br /> <br /> Holy mackerel, I could go ahead and go ahead, but space hinders it. Don't try to eat popcorn during this garbage because your hand is too busy to scratch your head when you repeatedly say, "What f ---?"
