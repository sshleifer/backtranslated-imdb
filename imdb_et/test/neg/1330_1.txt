This movie was terrible! My friend and I were so bored, we quickly transmitted the movie to the last to see what happened. It's a typical sport thing, it wins or loses. The only remarkably interesting thing was when one man refers to someone on the Veg-e-tab. It's my friend's line and I'll bring it up for years, reminding us of the waste of this colossal cheesy cliche
