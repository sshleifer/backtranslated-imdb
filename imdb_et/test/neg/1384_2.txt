Carlos Mencia (Mr Holness, apologize to me) has done a lot of other cartoon material theft. Heck, even before Joe Rogan hit him on stage, I knew Carlos Mensteala swept material from Cosby and Kinison and many others. <br /> <br /> To combine his theft crime, he made them comic BADLY jokes. <br /> <br /> And this is the crime he continues at this show. I'm sure the series's writers will have to share some of the accusations - this must be a daily joke writing ... but that's why people can pay so much to do that! These serial writers have to go back to their day jobs where burgers or what they did before they decided to start an intellectual theft career. <br /> <br /> Don't say he steals all his material. You can say when he has made fun of himself, if what you look at just goes horrible and goes directly to a terrible bad territory. <br /> <br /> Because he likes people to call b *** h at his show, ten-year-olds call him a genius. They grow up from one of these days, Carlos, and when they do, you dry and blow.
