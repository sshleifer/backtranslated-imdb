ATTENTION: ***** Works **** just forget *** that is a little little ** ** Lace <br /> <br /> Based on another Stephen King's long short story, it takes place in the stunning New England town of Castle In Rock (also the name of the film production company!), Where a new antique shop was opened, namely Needful Things. The owner and owner, Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow) hides, can tell you a devilish secret. There is one thing in his shop that all people in a small town want to require a small cash price first before asking for much more blind prices. Due to doubt, hate and madness, separate the city separately, police chief Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) has to restore order and save the city from the frightening end ... <br /> <br /> I read the necessary novel Things that this year was, and wanted watch the movie customization again to compare them (as it was any competition!) but it was deleted on video and DVD and I couldn't find it anywhere. So I was happy when I finally found it in a flea market during a shopping trip ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most cruel irons the king's novels are usually best to read, but when they adjust nine times out of ten, when they are full spam like here. For some reason, the material that makes her books big does not change the film script very well. And I think there is always a question: why look at this when I could read the book again? <br /> <br /> I appreciate that some of them are just too long (ie, Stand) to be done in full screen, working with all involved situations and letters, but there is no reason it could not be included book material. As a result, many key symbols of the book (ie Ace Merrill) are not included at all and we have a terrible development of character, which means that we don't care about character characters because they are so deep and motivated - for example, one of the books, Danforth Keaton, who murders to the end of the woman, but we did not show the structure to suggest for some reason that she did not get hated or hated with her, and that she has any effect when it happens, unlike a book that invested a lot of depth and it really brought you to find out what happened to the cases. The entire script material that you want is really stupid and horny to fill the cracks, and typically funny things that are added to such King's adjustments. <br /> <br /> Most of the film's problems are that it is so far away from the book, but there are also some terrible actions that obviously don't feel like it has asked for the material they are asked to fill. In the 1990s, much of the king's work began to skip the cinema and just made a television or video show. Such garbage must definitely indicate why. **
