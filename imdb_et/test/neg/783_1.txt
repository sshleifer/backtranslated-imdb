If it is really sad that it pulled out of the same mind as Donnie Darko, perhaps one of the best films in this genre. Where do I even start? I think one of the main shameful aspects of the film is that we should criticize humanity, but we do not see any humanity in the film. No more than 5 minutes of the film will be spent on the possible death of another person. These are terrible cuts of one dimensional cardboard from people. Unfortunately, they are played with what can only be described as terrible action. Is this really how Kelly sees humanity? Looking at the reaction of the viewers, it is a terrible encapsulation of humanity. Why don't the characters in the movie ask all the viewers? This is not the accusation of mankind. It is a culprit that Kelly puts a base that is almost unlike the real people in such a situation. <br /> <br /> For those who say it was a great thought-provoking movie, what do you compare? Armageddon? I even saw someone comparing it to Kurosawa's work. If you really take it away, you have to think that it would promote good existential discussion? For everyone that is good in the movie! Even an indecent proposal is ten times the accusation of humanity that it is. There we see people who are really embarrassed about greed and human condition. Yes, even the Human proposition puts this film into a philosophical debate to shame, and yet it is 5.3 vs 6.0 for this frantic fear. <br /> <br /> Rarely have I seen more pretentious, embarrassing and self-defeating, eye-catching film. It has the depth and poorness of the high school film project. Indeed, it is about the level of debate advocated by this film. If you want to see a good psychological movie, do it yourself and watch Das Experiment. If The Box had even achieved this goal, I would have been willing to forgive some cruel action, a cracking plot hole, and just a pointless talk. Unfortunately, it can't even do that. <br /> <br /> The real charge of humanity is that there are people who think this film is a deeply intimidating introspective look into a person's condition. It's not Sartre! It's not even the version of Sartre's Cliff Notes! It's a quick-to-understand, Hack-written 9th grade paper for Sartre, based on some Internet message boards. When Sartre was alive, he complained about Kelly's defamation.
