Even if the trailer and poster of this film indicate that Sally Hemmings was an important character, I may not be so shocked to discover that he was just a minor (and I mean a small one) character when this film was a family by Sally himself ! I want to say that if you talk about a story that has been ignored in the history of your family member, would you really say to the man who remained in the main symbol of his generation? His second lover (who happens to be white) as a real love interest? I know I'm not! I'm so pale as they come and usually a big fan of the Merchent ~ Ivory flick, but I couldn't steal this movie to treat bad Sally Hemmings.
