Wow ... not good. <br /> <br /> I can't believe people dig it in the trash. Most TV shows are pretty bad, and this has been a trend for some time - they're just getting worse, but Las Vegas will definitely take it home. What a terrible exhibition ... <br /> <br /> Actors are a bunch of C-losers who have never gone anywhere (except James Caan ... who knows what he meant when he signed up for this position) it is not their fault that this exhibition sucks. They just can't help it. Blame manufacturers and writers. I can't believe they shot it and were really proud of their job.
