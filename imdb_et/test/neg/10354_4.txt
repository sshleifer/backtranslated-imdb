I was from Australia and I love this series, I didn't expect much from Kati and Kim from the American version, but I thought I was looking at the first episode to see if it was really that bad. <br /> <br /> Well what to say there. This is nothing special. Blair is OK as Kim and they really had some good features, but Molly Shannon is not good at Kath. The good thing about Jane Turner Kath is that when she speaks with all her funny accents (for example, when she says Yumor or Noice), it sounds just in the natural way she speaks, but when Shannon has the pressure, she obviously acts and tries be the same as Turner. And it really shows that Sharon or another doesn't give us a laugh because this version of Kal and Craig's characters isn't really funny. <br /> <br /> So far, only the first episode has appeared, not obviously in line with the Aussie version standards, although if it were a standalone TV show with a different name, it would not be comparable to the Aussie version, it might be a little better. But if there's nothing else to do on Sunday night (or Thursday night in America), you can't do much damage to it or put it on some of the Aussie versions if you have it.
