Like many other people, I've heard "more" and I wanted to watch it with Pink Floyd's music. I have to say that I was really disappointed not about music but about the film itself. it is a boring cunning movie with no rhythm. Where does this disappointment come from? In my opinion, different things. First of all, in the movie theme, the drug is associated with badly unexpected sunny atmosphere in the movie. It should have been in areas of danger to Paris and should have given birth, for example, to a dark and helpless climate. What's more, it should say a descent to hell, but this descent is softened and barely sketched. Barbet Schroeder does not demand enough of a dramatic story. You could have wished for a little bit more mad, cutting. On the other hand, Schroeder has not managed to achieve the audience's emotions and detention against the stress of two main characters. You look at your research with drugs. As two main players, they are completely inaccurate and especially evolving during the movie, especially Mimsy Farmer. Finally, you will only preserve the beauty of mediterranean landscapes flooded with sunlight. The film created a great hour in 1969. Today it seems to have been dated. Hippie culture is nothing more than distant memory.
