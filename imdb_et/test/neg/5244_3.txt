Another B-film for teenagers, based mainly on CGI effects, an industrial soundtrack and some medieval images. It's funny that the Beowulf legend is being used in such an unintentional way. I am a fan of Christopher Lambert, but I must admit that he is also deeply involved with the actor and his films. Rent if you are just a teenager.
