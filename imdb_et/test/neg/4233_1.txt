I saw this movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival and didn't recommend it. It is two and a half hours long, during which there is nothing much of a poisonous porridge speed. <br /> <br /> The main characters are not charisma or personality. No one would smile at all during the film (so wouldn't I, if I had my life), and although Domino seems to be a healthy sexual appetite, he doesn't seem to be at all pleasant at all. <br /> <br /> The whole experience is frustrating and embarrassing, the director runs over each scene so that I run rather mad than the beauty of my technique. <br /> <br /> Too many questions in my mind: why did he smell the head of an Algerian man? Why does he slip? What does he look at over the distribution line? Why does he kiss Joseph? Why did we go and see this rubbish instead of ordering another bottle of wine at Bouzy Rouges?
