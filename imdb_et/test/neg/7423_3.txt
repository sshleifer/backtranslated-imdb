Lance used high quality support from James Cameron. Heck, he even had a coupl'a season for his TV show (Millenium). Why does he do that? Could he not pay his bills better? <br /> <br /> I love a good low budget movie. Some of them may just laugh simply because of their ridiculous assumption, the textbook stereotypical characters, or often because the actors are related to the director / producers. But this film has no redemption value. I didn't laugh. I didn't cry. I only had this sick feeling in the stomach. This feeling was quickly recognized as regrettable. At one point, Lance Henriksen was a supporter of the A list. He has been in Terminator (he intended to stop BE before Arnold appeared), Aliens, AliensIII, the classic B-film Pumpkinhead, among so many others! I wanted to send him money for that. Maybe we should start a Lance fund or something like that. <br /> <br /> Then, to do this thing ... maybe not.
