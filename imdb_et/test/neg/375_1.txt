This time Beastmaster (Marc Singer) returns only to the new enemy Arrow (Wings Hauser), but because of the irritating teenager (Kari Wuher) they are transported to the future where they call. There's a lot of (flat) fish jokes. You honestly can't get the descendants of this rotten core. Beastmaster 2 is a painful movie to see. Links and "hipness" film the film badly (it was done in 1991) and really who wants to see the Beastmaster at this time? It is also remarkable that Wings Hauser is an embarrassing performance that is simply the best of the movie. The singer seems uncomfortable, Wuher is irritating and the whole 1991 slang makes the film invisible. It's just one of the worst films ever made. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * 4 (awful)
