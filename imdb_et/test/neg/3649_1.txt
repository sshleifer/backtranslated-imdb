Topic: Worth acting: Fair (part of it) Plot: Ridiculous <br /> <br /> Details: Sound goes astonishingly almost obscene; music is not totally terrible (but mostly it is); dialogue and characterization are ridiculous; the main character's discovery process is blatantly obvious to everyone, but itself (and the writer, probably); animal scenes are just fools (song "Moon River" unlocked, forgotten lyrics, silly duet "flock" for feral pigs for hours). Finally, the "wet t-shirt" competition is so overwhelming that it must be believed. (Hint: "The girl" who wins is not ... well, I won't give it away.)
