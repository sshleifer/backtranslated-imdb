Chupacabra is a mysterious mystery <br /> <br /> creature that kills and eats spanish goats in Latin. One has crossed the border to South Texas and the lovely intrepid cryptozoologist (no, I didn't make that word) to go to one of the beaches to find one. His uncle <br /> <br /> was killed by the creature and some terrifying video material <br /> <br /> exists. He takes a chewing gum with a gun and two cameramen (for easy editable coverage) and they will entice you to <br /> <br /> chupacabras. Ten minutes of the movie they find it. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie has a team of documentaries attacking a bloody monster and a dirty dialogue. At one point, the team manages a couple of pairs of witches to guide them to the <br /> <br /> chupacabra nest ... $ 100. If only the FBI knew how <br /> <br /> cheap Tex-Mex witches could become informants. Whole <br /> <br /> decades of mythical beast reports can be emptied <br /> <br /> with empty controls. does not give goat patrol, chupacabra is caught, killed and <br /> <br /> automatic. The Autopsy scene is the only point to emphasize the efforts of the Makeup Department in such a cheap movie. <br /> <br /> Film is a video clip, like "BWP", yet the operators' <br /> <br /> characters will not recharge their tapes or load their cameras. <br /> <br /> Batteries. The leading actor is terrible here. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the average "BWP" was improvisation during its use. <br /> <br /> Here are all lines written and delivered as badly <br / <br /> <br /> The film is also against racism. The only afro-american <br /> <br /> here is a loose gun nut. At one point when the team leaves <br /> <br /> the abandoned house, they will find a trio of illegal immigrants asking them if they are from INS. Chortle, chortle. <br /> <br /> The monster itself is a rubber litter and nothing else. <br /> <br /> For such a despicable and uncomfortable beast he can jump <br /> <br /> quietly, regardless of whether they are idiotically locked <br /> <br /> in the giant cage as a feed or they can't seem to get it. <br /> <br /> Just start the vehicle. <br /> <br /> Gore is tough, but surrounded by <br /> <foolishness, it loses all its effectiveness. I don't know if it was done before or after "BWP", but I can honestly say it is the worst <br /> <br /> film ever made on the mythical beast in southern Texas. Pray <br /> <br /> There is no queue, I start with writing a campaign <br /> <br /> Troma. <br /> <br /> It is rated (R) for strong physical violence, weapon violence, strong <br /> <br /> gore and embarrassment. <br /> <br />
