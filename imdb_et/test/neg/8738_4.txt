MASTER PLAN: Win a winning team with a deadly tournament. One of the many martial arts action attempts to hit the famous "Enter the Dragon" taste since '73 is South Africa's effort. Kaaburi Castle is a bit different, with white flower-shaped fortresses in the middle of the desert. The scammer himself, baron or general, is a slightly more perverted version of the Captain's smell of "Dr.No" or Han's, which has strange setbacks to the Nazi German glory. At some points, he wears a full regal Nazi form. His main ambition in life is to hold an illegal martial arts contest / tournament against his Japanese rival, expanding their involvement in World War II (my army is better than your army). It sounds stupid and it is, though, it wants to work crazy and crazy about the mechanism. The central hero, Steve Chase (Ryan), resembles a white "Bruce Lee" character that has a similar lean, conformational, albeit obviously not the same level of martial arts knowledge. I thought he would be a secret government agent here, but apparently not. He and his girlfriend have joined the Baron Fighters team but decide to give up (what did they think they were?). Of course, it's not that easy. There's an odd order that can get through a car that has been crushed through the desert - these winds of desert winds can do wonders for driving, it seems. <br /> <br /> Plot shocks on the other side, like a hero joining a rogue competitor team and a girlfriend holding a girlfriend in a cell, at risk of rape with a hero rival. The most interesting character is Chico, a dwarf who is a villain assistant; he is loyal to the baron, but is sympathetic to the hero's situation. Much of the struggle uses the hero's ballet-like abilities, with lots of leaps and slow motion. Sound FX is also magnified and exaggerated, trying to influence the impact more. During the tournament, there are some good struggles toward the climax, but none of them really seem. If somebody had to choose, I think the best thing about the Brutal Brutal Revenge of the Muscle Men, who is late for the story (he raises one point behind the car). You do not know how the hero will eventually take him out because it seems that most of the shocks are twisted. Action is very mediocre, falls to camp until a girl who tends to laugh without reason, as if she is a tall grass, although she is very cute. Some training scenes are also campy, especially for all those boys running into the desert or rolling into the desert. And with such a title, there are surprisingly few real killings. Ryan, like Steve Chase, returned a "Kill and Kill again" as a traditional agent.
