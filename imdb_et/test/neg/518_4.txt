"Underwater" is definitely not the "worst film ever". It has its drawbacks, such as borrowed shots, crazy script and no special effects (the worst), but it also has some good points. The action is surprisingly good, there are many familiar faces you probably know when you're a b-movie fan like me. <br /> <br /> I was very happy to see Brent Huff playing one hero, mostly knowing him about his 80-year-old movies, and I have to admit he's not a bad actor at all. Fred Williamson, Maxwell Caulfield, and Tim Thomerson are getting limited in time, but they are credible in their parts. "Fredrik Ray Ray" in the movie "Eye Candies" Yvette Nipar and Nicole Eggert, both of whom look very sexy and very meaningful. Michael Bailey Smith adds some muscles to the background as a naval SEAL. Unfortunately, the only member who (in my opinion) is totally inappropriate is Coolio. He doesn't act at all, says he's not even reading the script and being disappointed at the beginning of the movie, he can beat like a wimp one hour later. Not a good choice. <br /> <br /> To summarize this movie - it's not that bad choice for late night entertainment. If you get special effects (so many weapons, so much fire and no wound), Coolio's annoying performance and Airport 77's recycled materials, you may like this no-brainer.
