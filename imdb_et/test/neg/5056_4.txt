The historic teacher, Mrs Tingle, seems to be the student of Leigh Ann Watson, who has a school scholarship close to her heart. He gets another low class from Tingle that doesn't help. If one of her classmates, Luke, steals the final paper of history exams and jumps it into her bags, Ms. Tingle finds it out. He threatens three to go to the principal, but he is not available. So before he announces it next morning. Leigh, his friend Jo Lynn and Scott drove to this evening and were trying to convince him not to tell the principal. But thanks to Tingle's stubbornness, which turns back to drastic action to stop it. <br /> <br /> Didn't I see it for the first time I saw it for the first time, and after the second look I'm still not one. Writer Kevin Williamson was in a roll after the horror films of successful modern teenagers; "Scream (1996)", "I know what you did last summer (1997)", "Scream 2 (1997)" and "Faculty (1998)". He drove to success (not to forget Dawson's Creek TV show), but this project would be the last shot. The difference compared to this entry was other than writing a scenario, he did the debut as well. The odd thing, however, was that I found his direction competently made, but the material he smelled and tired of. It seems that both black comedy and straight thriller play have been played without making it a gel. The script is full of quick, ongoing gags, trivial stretches, and tricks for other movies, but the problem is that it is too much soaked with so many evolved developments and delicate moral currents that disrupt the flow. The broken script was supposed to be stronger and stronger because it is a small-scale production that feels like you are watching your productions, because it is mostly limited. He tries to play with the minds of the characters, but these moments are to serve only the story of the stupidity and meaninglessness of bad progress. The end of the film takes the cake. Williamson's polished direction is sound, but even more so is the pedestrian path and therefore it is not tense and the pace even with tense surroundings can really go on. Finally, you will feel it after the half-mark, and it shows how small the story is. The performances are quite tolerable, though if Helen Mirren's stylish, icy manipulative ability, like Mrs. Tingle and the floating Marisa Coughlan, were stuck, we would look at the fabulous nice gift Katie Holmes. Barry Watson is modest, but Molly Ringwald has a smaller role. The music is packing enough energy, but I found that it was terribly burned and out of shape in my choices. <br /> <br /> Traceable but mechanical.
