There seem to be many fans in this movie, but I found it boring, slow, prone and pointless. And I watch and enjoy a lot of art and independent films, so I didn't expect an action movie. I didn't dare against either character. The man from the earth was a bad guest and didn't seem to have tried to find a job and his relative in Istanbul was humorous and emotionally closed. <br /> <br /> In an interview on a DVD, the director says that the film is a common situation in Turkey - a person leaving the country because there are no jobs and Istanbul is not coming and staying with relatives when trying to find a job. This in itself is interesting, but the film was not.
