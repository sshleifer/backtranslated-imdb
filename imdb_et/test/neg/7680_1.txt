There are bad movies, movies that are terrible, and then there is a small, rare film that is so terribly bad that even after they have only seen them once, it is impossible to forget them even decades later. This is precisely such a movie, and it's hard to believe that the original film of this series was actually pretty good. Let's see, George Kennedy, the hard-core guy of the original cigar, has somehow promoted the captain of the airline, and after Concorde's missile attack (don't ask), he's staying at the stunts like shooting a firing game through the cockpit window, though (probably) Drive in Mach 2, while at the same time making natural high G levels that would have lifted wings on board the aircraft, never mind the impact of passengers! But the absolute worst part of the film, at least for its dedicated air blowers, is that this cruelty "celebrated" one of the coolest, sexiest and technologically most notable planes. Concorde (or simply "Concorde" when its pilots point to it) earned much better, this abomination is equivalent to high-end beauty like Audrey Hepburn and her "Porky" sequel. Fortunately, a more fun "plane" is released! next year, the entire "airport" franchise brought a well-earned stop, because anyone who even weighs the fifth installment would laugh at the studios as well as the movie fans. <br /> <br /> 1/10
