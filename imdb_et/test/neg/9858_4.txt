This documentary was not professionally or objectively made. The whole thing looked like the IBM conspiracy theory to win this game just to make money. Garry Kasparov has an ego problem. He had fasted before the game and he didn't like it when he lost. I remember playing the computer while playing the 80s and it wasn't too hard to win. As time passed, I began to lose and dislike. Today, I just don't play with computers anymore because they're just too good. Not only that, games are uninteresting and lacking in the attractiveness of human games, where both sides are more likely to be mistaken and open the game with exciting opportunities. This documentary shows us pictures of Turkey, an ancient chess playing machine that was really humanly controlled. From the beginning to the end, we are convinced that IBM cannot literally hide human GM on the back of its computer. I'm a computer scientist and I'm attacking the idea that just because Garry lost, IBM must be cheated. I know how computers play chess. It's not magic and it's not a mystery. They can be trained, have enormous chess knowledge, and they will definitely see views and opportunities compared to the unprecedented detail of people. It's not surprising that Deep Blue won. Maybe at the time it was. If this happens today, taking into account the continuous processing capacity of the machines; people are not flashing. If the machine could not be controlled by GM today, people would think the program was weak.
