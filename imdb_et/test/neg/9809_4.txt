A pretty twisted Horror movie with some good moments here and there, with some scary blood transfusion scenes, but it's just too boring because it's good. All the characters are correct and the story with lots of potential is quite boring, but the blood transfusion scenes seemed intimidating and as a result they were extremely disturbing. It's well done and well written, and it started really interesting, but it just couldn't keep pace. Linnea Quigley does not have such a small role, so I was also disappointed, and Stephen Knight does a good job as a leader because he was quite twisted, plus I got it in the DVD horror set A Taste Evil, along with a number of other Horror films. There is a lot of blood, but it is not all that it is small and, for this small budget, it was pretty well done, but as I said, it couldn't keep that interest. This is a pretty twisted Horror movie that has some good moments here and there, with some scary blood transfusion scenes, but it's just too boring for it, but I think it's worth checking out if you have nothing better to do. The direction is OK. Elly Kenner & Norman Thaddeus Vane work here for a decent camera work and do a good job with this low budget, but I think the pace is too controversial. The action is actually in order. Stephen Knight is great as a leader, he was horrible, twisted, sick and gave a very horrible idea, the most terrible thing, although he seemed to be a normal person. Linnea Quigley played a small role. Christopher McDonald is OK, I think sin in his short time. The rest of the cast is also good. I would generally move, but I think it's worth checking out if you have nothing better. * 1/2 out of 5
