I saw this movie partly because of positive comments on IMDb. After wanting to have these 90 minutes back from my life, I feel it is my duty here to speak and say ... Don't bother watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I can't challenge the efforts of the participants - they did what they could give, but this material is terrible. This pace was deadly - slow, bent and you saw everything in about an hour, and then it lasted forever. The dialogue was boring, pointless, not at all funny. The characters were all atypical. And in my opinion, cinematography was a very low quality - "the character's clich√© uses a home video machine!" had a very bad effect. Yes, Jeri Ryan is a cool person. Don't let this sucker waste time with this movie.
