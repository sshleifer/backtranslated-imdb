Another flat attempt to make the movie "sharp" and "provoking thinking" - whatever hell it means. They have said that Al Pacino says a lot of words, such as: "Television killed football." Yes, whatever. This is another film that introduces Oliver Stone's Grandus quarrels. If Stone is trying to show us that football is our fall or something, why does it require sport to romanticize its stylish camera movement and Kid Rock songs? He even throws Cameron Dias a little for aesthetic reasons. It is a shame that Diaz and Pacino have to meet with such a bad film. <br /> <br /> Since "The Woman's Fragrance", writers and directors have used Pacino to romanticize their pathetic rhythms. His characters are nothing more than loudspeakers - their voices cover what would normally be superfluous and trite. He must figure himself out, showing how he can act without being scared. He must stop knowing bad hokey scripts, such as "Organized Football is Confused," and a good story.
