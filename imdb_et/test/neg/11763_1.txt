35 years after Castro reigned, it still dominates. Unfortunately, we have been scratching our heads, wondering how the maniac of Twilight, played by Jack Palance, was so dull as it did in 1960. I recently hit it and was entertained when I noticed the incomparable Sid Haig and "B" favorite Paul (Untouchables) among Picern rebels. Fleischer was obviously in front of his prime minister when he led this stupidity. Some lines are classic "Did he really say that way?" The second thing I just noticed is that the score and the sound (NO dialogue) are really great - the only first-class elements of the whole production. if you feel you are watching it as stupid, bring beer and have fun.
