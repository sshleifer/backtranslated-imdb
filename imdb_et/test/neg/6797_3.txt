It was a funny show. In short, this was the child called Doug, who was guilty of a lot. Seriously, he may feel guilty of killing the flight, guilty of knowing he was guilty of killing flights and so on. The animation was grate and unpleasant, and the jokes were cheap. <br /> <br /> It appeared here in Sweden as part of "Disney Time" and I remember that I liked what then, but then I turned 13. <br /> <br /> I never got why some the characters were also green and purple. What was it with? <br /> <br /> Really terrible show. Obviously, it created a movie I've never seen, but I don't have any great expectations.
