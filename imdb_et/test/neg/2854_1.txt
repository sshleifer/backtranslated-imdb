Before watching this film (screened by the director himself), it was announced that it won a short film award at Galway Film Fleadh. Surely this result gives the filmmakers hope that everyone can do it better! <br /> <br /> How no one can notice Donnie Darko's dirty hanging on what I never know. The film is a clean generation, a working cardboard, a ridiculous dialogue, and only an apartment ends! The only comfort we enjoyed after seeing the garbage was to loudly comment on how terrible it was before the director! Yes, it was average but released! <br /> <br /> Producing at least Irish movies can't be downgraded!
