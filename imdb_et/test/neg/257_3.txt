In 1932, Humphrey Bogart was relatively unknown - an unproven actor who was one of his first films starring. And because he was unknown, what he gave was clearly a B-film - with the relatively low expectations of a fast movie. After I saw it, I can see why it was Bogart and another film studio for many years before he got the household name. Though the film is not terrible, it is definitely not good - it's more curious than anything else to see today. <br /> <br /> Bogart is a pilot who has dreams of building his own aircraft engine company. However, when the liberated rich playgirl comes on her way, her dreams seem to be constantly on hold. Like one of the characters in the movie, the combination of the two is like oil and water - they just don't mix. Although Bogart throws away his promising career, his sister goes on a full-fledged road to Skankville - having met a slippery guy who persuades him to sleep with rich boys so they can shake them in time! Bogey has no idea that his sister is not the actor he claims to be, and does not understand later that his loving rich woman leaves him in the same man whose lover is ... Bogart's SISTER !!! All this leads to a finale that is reasonably enjoyable. Here is one of the most stupid scenes I've been watching for a long time! Now, the rich lady does not talk to Bogey's sister with a sleeping bag, but because she is now bad and is not good for Bogart, she starts flying and killing. Bogey discovers, flies the plane, jumps on the plane when it takes off, and climbs up the body to drive the plane and save him! It's so stupid and ridiculous, I found myself laughing loudly. Until then, I could take it to 4 or 5 - it watched the movie 3 (how one reviewer did it over 8). <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that it was a talking and silly film. In addition, everything is wrong for Bogarti because the hero and simpering lover at the end is a terrible response to a person who was so wonderfully created in the early 40s. Man and man fit for human - one of America's great actors, but clearly out of their element. <br /> <br /> By the way, those who love the prefix and their very adult feelings can see it. Practically all the people in the film believe and practice before marriage and Bogey's letters - things you would not have seen after a hardened and moral production guide in 1934.
