If you have been in the eastern part of Europe (or even in their armed forces), you may find it interesting. I do not know why this is called comedy (sure there are some funny moments there), but this is not a good movie, if one of the regular officials speaks for 15 minutes of socialist achievements at Christmas dinner and officers generally act like funny oaks, soldiers run to the base to meet your girls at night, and surprise, surprise, one of the girls is the daughter's daughter. The East German Army was known for its violent and humiliating service to its hidden men, and the comedy was not filmed mainly in facilities or equipment to make the East German Army a good movie and their time passed. Nonetheless, some actors and actors tried to do well, but it only came out of the roles they are familiar with in East German television and some small movies. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, it was basically boring and very cheap.
