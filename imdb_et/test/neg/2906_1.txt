This is still the worst movie ever. I have no doubt. I've seen such a mess like Manos, Space Mutiny, and something, and I can honestly say they don't have the science of Crazed candle. <br /> <br /> Science Crazed has no inseparable plot. Something like a boy who prepares a woman with a turkey strap, and a baby who was born * hrs * later, is fully grown and ready to kill. Of course, if this is a newborn, he will take people for about an hour. The filmmaker strikes the film continuously and takes about 15 minutes to set an uncomfortable death. There is a dialogue page for the whole movie, but the dialogue will arrive in about a minute. <br /> <br /> Scene scene: The monster runs through the hall. We know that because it's about ten minutes from his feet. There are two women between the eyes who work out. Repeat the ad museum for about 20 minutes. When a monster appears, nobody moves, and everyone looks like deer in headlamps because the monster takes another 10 minutes to kill them. By the level of the actors, you think people are already dead. <br /> <br /> I know my description doesn't look too bad, but trust me, I can't fully describe science. Crazed. <br /> <br /> Stop and boycott all the video stores that carry it. :) <br /> <br />
