This was called the continuation of Crash Dive, a very good film in the low budget category. I expected this movie to be good, but the boy was wrong. First of all, this film has nothing to do with Crash Dive, except for those that take place on submarines. Second, the plot may be slow, tedious, and in some cases completely unpleasant. <br /> <br /> This movie does not hold the attention of most people. (I remember reading a book during a slow, boring scene.) There are scenes that should be used for a dramatic effect that makes the viewer laugh out loud. Corkscrew is definitely one. After I got over my initial shock that someone slipped it and didn't know that people wouldn't just believe it but laugh at it, I could find humor in it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see MD in good sub-clips, watch Crash Dive and leave this flat movie on the shelf.
