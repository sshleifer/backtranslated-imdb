The Altman Quintet has to deal with more than just flaws: As many other reviewers have pointed out, the ideas behind the film, even some of the choices in depicting these ideas, should work - and very little in this difficult movie. Partially blurry camera lens - I noticed to my wife that this must be the most annoying director I've ever seen - I never let the film "in" the world. <br /> <br /> In general, there are serious problems with the working scene here. It is clear that no small number of thoughts went into such factors as costume and product development, but neither is very effective in waking the believer's world. Maybe it's on a scale; the film has been so staged that I laughed loudly when it was mentioned that "five million" people lived in the city. (Yes, I understand the limitations of the film budget. Matte's paintings here and there have helped.) In all the disappointing Altman films I've ever seen. Great ideas and great metaphors do not always come through in art - it's just a part of the game.
