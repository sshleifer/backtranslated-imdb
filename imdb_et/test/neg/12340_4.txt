Rather than Paul Newman and Steve McQueen with their racing car films, it appears on Robert Redford's "boyies" project as he gets uphill and downhill skiing in the alpine sunlight. <br /> <br /> The story is as easy as powdery snow with Redford's small-town boy David Chappellet (what's the leading name?), who with his eyes on the Olympic Honor Award rises his coach's nose, not in any order from his father and teammates. Women in their island region are merely side-by-side, as evidenced by the rather unpleasant pick-up scene, with an old girlfriend in her hometown and then her selfishly deceptive pursuit of heaven above, free thinking, an independent woman played by Camilla Sparv. The skiing sequences are good, with good stunt work, which includes a number of shocks and scratches, but their effectiveness is obscured by our later TV show skiing events to this day. Plus I'm not convinced that the Winter Olympics have the same mass identity with the public as the summer games, so when Redford finally won his gold medal in the final roll, I didn't really get excited about it in one way or another. others. <br /> <br /> Redford, the best profile, doesn't have to do much and really doesn't, while Gene Hackman does just as little material. Ms. Sparv is also a female female who treats Redford the way she undoubtedly treated every other woman in her chauvinistic way. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it does not have all the dramatic tension for which action takes place and does not fully compensate you for any leading character in the line. One of those films where the actors apparently enjoyed it more than the viewers watched it.
