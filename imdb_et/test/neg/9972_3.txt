This film is about a woman who loves a friend of her friend. Since then he has to share his time with two boyfriends: Jack during the day and Joseph at night. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to have been made with a minimum budget. Most of the film is placed in a minimal furniture flat. There are only three main participants, all other participants in the credit list are only short-term. The designer of the wardrobes does not seem to do much because the actors wear a lot of clothes and in fact they are mostly naked. <br /> <br /> The film is very difficult, which should have overcome the shortcomings described above. However, dialogues sound too compact and uncomfortable. At the beginning of the film, most of the dialogue is a person who says a very long sentence, and then the person also tells me. After the fatigue, the dialogue falls into a confused and confused dialogue with the salad. <br /> <br /> The only false thing I think of this movie is that it works as a feminist point of sale, which shows that it's not just men who can be unreliable. <br /> <br /> This movie is a big disappointment.
