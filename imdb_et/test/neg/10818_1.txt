It may be unfair to comment on this movie about me because I first turned off the movie because it was so bad. I can watch something, but this movie was so boring. I was bored before I put on a DVD and thought it might be a ridiculous movie of fear / action that eases the mood. It's not even that, it's a device that increases the level of boredom with 100's of power. It was turned off after 45 minutes because everything that happened at that time was some people diving and a big mole was discovered. Seriously, this movie is not worth the time, even if you can enjoy a bad movie as I can, avoid the movie like a plague.
