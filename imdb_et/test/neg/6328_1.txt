I hit this movie late on television. Honestly I saw most of it and all the time when I sat in complete and perfect disbelief. <br /> <br /> Is there a genre that is useless as a soft core porn? If I don't want to know about it. Softcore porn combines all the horrors of pornography (bad product values, terribly dirty, dirty scripts) with the usual scenes of sex movies. So the end result has aroused neither fun. This film has a rather strange approach to scientific literature and it works terribly. The whole sex is done in a virtual reality, where the future team becomes acquainted with physical love. And yes, it is about as confusing and silly as it sounds. <br /> <br /> But there must be some positive points, right? Well, there is one ... Krista Allen is amazingly hot. This is the only thing that was less terrible in this movie. I don't know what he is, but he has an amazing sex appeal. The remaining cast looks like a regular porn-cast. Rather unpleasant women with badly made fake breasts, and men who have spent too much time in the gym, toning themselves in the grotesque. Probably a gym in Germany, also appreciating discounts and clothes. <br /> <br /> In summary. If you enjoy the presence of Krista Allens on the screen, you can watch it in short moments where she shows some of her seductive potential (usually she tries to form a dirty dialogue). If you don't enjoy Krista Allen, you can also stay away. <br /> <br /> I appreciate it for the Krista Allens sex appeal, 1/10 for all other and 2/10 entertainment values ​​as it is a unique crappy porn / science fiction hybrid that isn't really something I I've ever seen.
