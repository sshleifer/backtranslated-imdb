It has been a long time for me and my wife not to see such a boring thriller. This is certainly not a thrilling story and it is so slow that we almost fell asleep. It could be a series of very low budget television crime. There are some ridiculous scenes, such as where the mafia head Pirano wants to see a jury lady in red or some other mafioso can't think of her and so on. Okay, that should have been a romantic thriller, but believe me you won't miss anything. We gave 4/10.
