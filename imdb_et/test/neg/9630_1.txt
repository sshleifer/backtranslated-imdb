There are no rescue drawings that remind you of the "Red Heads Attack"! <br /> <br /> Although this movie has some big stars, the actor is almost equally horrible. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, usually a modest man, beats this forced emotion. <br /> <br /> Donna Reed is so overflowing as ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielson is disgracefully unsuccessful and terrible. <br /> <br /> The son is such a repulsive little, I found myself rooting for the robbers. <br /> <br /> The only dignified power in this mish-mash is the relatively small role of the meatboy. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too harsh on the actors that all they did was read the rows given to them in the script. Ah, the script, this stormy piece that wants to pull the strings of your heart, but changes the stomach.
