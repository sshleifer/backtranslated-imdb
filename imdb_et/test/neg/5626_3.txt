Let the circle of freedom probably make the best intentions, but it will send a curious mixed message in the final product. <br /> <br /> People in the western city where the railway passes are resurrected on the train staff of immigrants who work on the railroad, funded by the Edward Arnold robber. There are some shepherds and farmers whose land is on the railways and these people are summing up with the men hired by Arnold. One man who doesn't give it is Lionel Barrymore, whose son has come home from Harvard's attorney and is ready for a livestock farmer. <br /> <br /> Only Nelson Eddy decides that the best way to fight is to go to Zorro for bad guys. But besides Charles Butterworth, no one knows he is Wasp (a very interesting choice of names). <br /> <br /> What Arnold has done is to use the tried and true methods of East Political Chiefs to get immigrants to vote. The idea of ​​Nelson is simple when the immigrants knew only the truth about what a bad man, Arnold, is, and they vote against the original settlers and break out the alien's urban policy machine. He kidnaps Raymond Walburn, the editor of the newspaper, and takes him to the press in a mountainous area where some subversive newspapers are printed and distributed. <br /> <br /> Railway workers are a real group of combined immigrants, not Ireland, working in the West or working in the East when history is. It is a true United Nations organization that works on Arnold's railways. Workers are held by Victor McLaglen, and Nelson has the unintentional task of beating something in his way, as John Wayne did with a quiet man. <br /> <br /> Of all the Jeanette and Nelson films, and certainly this historic duo, it was the worst thing they did in MGM. Nelson is hanging out with Barrymore for the best crimes, but definitely not worth it. And Virginia Bruce, a Nelson girlfriend, saves the day with the immigrants joining it. Arnold is packed rationally with the immigrant voter rebellion and leaves the city to build his own railway elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I'm not doing you, it's the end here. What is the message, vote for the settlers and lose your job with Arnold? But somehow you get here? <br /> <br /> I sometimes wonder when 20 years after the events of this film and the city is populated by a sleepy western, while some of the cities where the railway has passed are now cities that the good citizens of this city have not rethinked, what Nelson Eddy did. If they do, they will probably run off the rail. <br /> <br /> Nelson is, of course, with a good voice and has a variety of concerts and popular songs that sing with Miguel Romberg. , Where else, but here. The song is a cordial tribute to the immigrant who made good in his country. Too bad it didn't have a better place. And I'm sure Jeanette MacDonald was just as happy that she wasn't in the West with Nelson on this trip.
