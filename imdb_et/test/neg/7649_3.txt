I do not consider myself conservative, so this film was not personally offended, but it was quite clear that the film and the character of the film were next to the message. And the message is that all conservatives are either bad or stupid (or both). The characters are one-dimensional - either good, freedom-loving Americans or brains, greedy, evil conservatives. There is nothing clever or creative, just conservative. I did not think about political prejudice myself, but it should not be the only purpose behind the film. And it certainly is. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the cast is excellent and Chris Cooper's impression of W is funny in the first two or three times, but after that it's just the same old joke and so if you really hate conservatives, you probably enjoy it movie, but if you are looking for something realistic characters and a story that is less black and white then you would be better off looking at something else.
