This film spends a lot of time proclaiming marijuana. For the plot and visual images, it's so bad that it seems to be a LSD poster-child. <br /> <br /> Plot: Michael's heroic struggle when he fights his drug addiction while being humiliated by the likes of Winnie Pooh and Papa Smurf. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, there's a good message, but it's hidden from the fact that the writers have taken a pretty outdated PSA idea and tried to stretch it to 30. minutes. This includes a song sequence that says there are a million rational ways to say "No!" like "I can't smoke in the pot, I have homework!" <br /> <br /> Writers are unable to make their thoughts on what to do with the characters they have put into action. First of all, we can see that everyone has to hide people's characters, but after five minutes we will see them all if no one notices. Soon, they will begin to interact with human pain, and the only thing that will even bother about it is drug abusers, a little sister who talks about her teddy bear (by the way, Pooh). Drug Demon. Because you know, pushers don't give drugs to children. He is also vague - although he may be a symbol of Michael's addiction, and so he should not see other people, he is late and haunted Corey to become drugs. So I think he's ... uhhh ..... moving on! <br /> <br /> The whole plot will eventually culminate in a crazy sequence where Michael is in what seems to be a Saturday morning soul carnival, namely a theme park hell where different comic characters beat him and ignore him and things. For example, Miss Piggy eats her on a sandwich and spits her out. If the writers did not write it, I have to recommend that they try to raise themselves because they can't do it. Of course, the fact that Michael has two years of height at this point is ignored by the film, so why this intimidation is frightening him is behind me. <br /> <br /> I know I'm completely whaling with this movie, but I just saw it again because I went through eBay's trick in tracking it because it's a disgrace that you're a BAD comic. The level of involuntary humor is great. Take this scene for example - Michael's father takes the beer with a freezer. He notices that many of them have disappeared and mention it to his wife. An increasingly attentive mother tells her "don't worry, you just took football the last night." While we probably should learn that Michael is drinking beer (in addition to the pot and crack), we read and understand - Hey kids, it's good to have chemical addictions as long as you are grown up! Such scenes are worth the price of this film. Oh yes, and the fact that you hear Simon Chipmunki say, "Marijuana."
