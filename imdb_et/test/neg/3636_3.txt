The only time I see this smile when I see it is when I am having fun. Jamie Lynn Spears was only working for her bigger sister, and I don't think anyone could argue against it. She has no expression EVER (even if she smiles) - just look at the example and see what I mean. Let's talk about the show now. Zoey 101 is one of the most unrealistic shows I've ever seen! As many people have already said, Zoey Brooks is absolutely perfect: everyone loves him, he's a straight A-student and all the guys think he's "hot". PCA is a full-time school for children with flat screen TVs and laptops that offer sushi bar sushi. In a new episode, Zoey is totally helpless and thinks Chase is not in love with her and acts like she doesn't want Chase to love her. When he goes to Chase's dormitory to prove his friends wrong, he finds Chase, who can call this girl Rebecca. Zoey, of course, speaks, probably because he likes Chase's attention. Anyway, look at this example only if you have nothing else to do and television is the only thing Zoey 101. You can at least laugh at how unrealistic it is!
