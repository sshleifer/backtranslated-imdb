This movie was extremely disappointing, I thought it would be another "marijuana comedy," but don't be mistaken, it's not at all. Barely touching jokes that come to mind are hardly, I don't even think they have any weeds in this movie. Marijuana Field is just a plot device. <br /> <br /> My impression after seeing this movie was that four friends eternalized one summer and decided to write a script full of (their idea) funny dialogue and make Film. The product is a boring dialogue supported by mediocre action, saying that this film has no "hook", is a huge underestimation. Don't waste your time or money.
