Bloody terrible! There is no other way to put it. In fact, it is ** SO ** bad that the only reason I waste this word is to warn other sensible viewers who want to intelligently entertain. You lose I.Q. looking at it. Think about it, it's not even suitable for watching irritation, because it is an irritant. There is no guilty pleasure of seeing such incompetence. it's just a pointlessly sloppy, lazy fantasy. <br /> <br /> 2) It's the sport of FX, which is incredible cheese. Not even the cheesy-kitch, which is prominent and nodding, like vintage doctor who, but just cheap and filthy up to the offensive point. FX is so bad that they are not even ridiculous. They spent about a dollar-fifty, not more. dreamer through his roles, although Catherine McCormack still made some effort, probably in principle and despite the director. What's more, this is not Peter Hyams' only bad movie: his flubs far outweigh all the barely slip waves Timecop was the last, and it was 15 years before it was written. he had nothing semi-decent because (at the end of the days it was so dirty, Arnold was the only drawing and he needed a much stronger direction than Hyams). Hyams keeps everyone more and more useless to consider more work for him. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, Ray Bradbury's stories are much better. Refusing to watch this movie sends this message, not that Hollywood is especially audible. <br /> <br /> Look at your own responsibility. If you do, and it turns you off, you are guilty only of you (and Hyams) because you are more than enough warned.
