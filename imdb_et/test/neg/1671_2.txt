What a truly moral movie I can say is that the writer must be very fond of magical mushrooms and LSD because it must be the result of one of his "trips". <br /> <br /> You watch the whole movie thinking Alright it's very weird, but hey, I'm sure there's a good explanation about it ... Just to be disappointed if you can't find it, there's no explanation And twisting at the end makes it even more complicated to create confusion. At the end of the film, you probably have the same facial expression when you stand for Que who would pay you for the groceries, and the merchant told you it was 11.95. reason. There are so many factors in this movie that are inexplicable and I think it leaves the viewer's imagination completely odd. Don't do me the wrong way I like wonderful movies, "Cell" could easily be described as weird and twisted, but in my eyes, this is a great movie (despite choosing J-Lo, whom I don't like the maximum level that couldn't make my opinion ). This is not one of those films, and I think you should take into account the characteristics of their film. I can tell you that they are probably people who would go to an art exhibition, see a white dove's faeces and say, "Oooooh what a masterpiece, the artist has truly found a unique opportunity to portray eternity" is it all, is it, the bird's stool on the table. <br /> <br /> Keep this movie in mind with the last thing in mind, <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading!
