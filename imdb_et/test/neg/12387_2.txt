I have not read this book and do not worry about this adaptation. I hated all the symbols of this exhibition - Miranda was filthy, selfish, and embarrassed through a terrible dialogue, her sister was a complete spirit, and it was the worst manic depression I've ever seen. I have a degree in psychology and it was not accurate. In fact, until it was mentioned, I didn't know that Troy was supposed to be bipolar - I thought he was a normal, slightly terrible teenager. <br /> <br /> The only rescue arm in this stupid stage was David Tennant, whose excellent psychotic performance was the only thing that started looking at the other side. It is clear that the writers and producers of this exhibition have not done any research - Troy's mental problems are far from accurate, nor is the "twist" of forensics involved (and if you did not see that mile off, you are a big dummy!) < br /> <br /> Use garbage.
