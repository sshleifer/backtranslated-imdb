After watching all the episodes of the Star Trek series since the 1960s, most of them are pretty good, and very few are mediocre, I think it's the worst. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think it's so badly done to be embarrassing. It is not that the story is so bad, though it is not in any way particularly prominent, but acting is just a part of two guides, which means those who are not ordinary in this case. Barbara Anderson gives her the weakest performance as a massacre daughter and a sort of missionary. He calls the role of the phone practically and does not show any real emotional ability here. Although in most cases he has mostly not used his film / TV roles, usually in small parts, he has never done much better than ever before. <br /> <br /> Arnold Moss as his father gives a new meaning to the term Ham and is the only actor ever to have been in the 1960s Star Trek episode that surpasses William Shatner in this field and makes Shatner excellent when compared. And he can play Shakespeare's actress no less, giving him more momentum to overestimate, and he does it. <br /> <br /> If these two are not so weak, this is a story that makes sense for anyone to say who the killer is in the first 15 minutes. I say this because I told my brother the whole plot that ended on the first business break when we watched the original broadcast of 1966. His answer was, yes, you're right. <br /> <br /> Leave it out and see the much better Menagerie episodes that were originally on TV right before.
