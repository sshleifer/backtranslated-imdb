Seriously, people ... I was ready to write to the Razzie Council and recommend this movie to Razzie Champion by 2007 ... until I got IMDb.com and realized that the copyright date was 2006 and not 2007. year. this movie could have been Razzie Champ. This movie was a miracle! Even though the World War II missed even for the Razzie nomination in 2006, it is farther away from me because it could have competed in principle, it smells too, at the 2006 Razzie Championship. <br /> <br /> I rented this movie on the recommendation of my wife's neighbor, who told me, "Oh my God, after seeing this movie, it's a long, long time before I ever stop at a break!" I couldn't believe how this scary and terrible movie was! The possible spoilers below, not that you have something left behind. <br /> <br /> OK, first ... the problem ... the rest stops. Obviously, the first thing about this devil's manager is not about women. The rest of the toilets were at the same level as Trainspotting. I do not claim to know what is known to women, but one thing I know is that women are mostly full and complete gentlemen of hygiene / cleanliness. Considering the choice that any of the toilets can cool and possibly catch something or squat in the woods, the woman chooses to squat in the woods. I know, because I've been with them before, and they don't have problems squatting in the forest. So there ... the main plot hole and wrong. <br /> <br /> Second ... he leaves the rest of the stop and his boy who drove the car is nowhere to be found, neither him nor his car. He just left. He starts shouting his name to think where he is. Ummm ... hello? You stand on a wet mud ... have you ever had some tire traces? I mean, his car has gone ... it just doesn't rise and flew away. And actually, it makes me think ... I was actually looking at his feet and the mud was not in the pattern. How ... exactly ... did it happen? <br /> <br /> The Third ... The Bible strikes the family of mobile home with the inverted stick, taking Polaroid pictures ... Wtf!?!?!? ? They didn't make any sense at all, and just as the director just threw in to be weird. They didn't make any sense at all, and they didn't even have a movie. <br /> <br /> Fourth ... Oh God, this ... I mean, finally ... the end of the movie. .. finally sees the escape hatch in the ceiling inside the rest stop. I like, "You ... stupid ... bi ** h. You're locked up to stop this holiday all the time ... and you just ... now ... look ... get out of the hatch?" I mean ... it's like they threw it just because the killer threw gasoline through the window and was ready to match the game. So he must get to the ground to avoid burning, and ... oh, look! The perfect reason he gets to the ground! The escape hatch on the ceiling! It's like ... Why didn't he go through it before? Most people in such a situation would have seen that, from the moment they were at that resting position, they stopped and took out f ** k from the DD. When they showed the escape hatch at the end of the movie, I was like, "You have to joke me." <br /> <br /> Fifth ... what was it with all the people he'd ever disappear? The girl in the bone in the cabinet rest stop? Blank cop? Did he create the movie at the end when he got himself into the bones? It was never explained. Personally, I thought myself, "Christ is a cracker, it's him. He's a killer. Wonderful. He killed all those people, can't remember it, and the writers of this movie just ripped off a certain French horror flick that I can't mention in IMDb.com or I'm on the blacklist to give away the end (that movie suck, by the way, the people). "But it wasn't. He was not a killer, and all dealing with dead people never disappeared, ever. Oh, God's love, people, stay away from this movie! This movie sucks balls and I now have a serious bone to pick for my neighbor. It's about $ 1 per rack in family video, don't even rent it if someone gives it for free!
