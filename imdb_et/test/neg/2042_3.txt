I just can't get it, the planet is talking about what needs to be seen, they even dare to call it (s) to exploit because the overwhelming girl seduces priests and masturbates all the time. Don't let me laugh. I watched a movie, seducing is just at the end of the movie and don't call it seducing, it's just a bad language that she's talking. And masturbation is also a big laughter, she is trying to masturbate by attracting her father, let me be clear, her clothes pervert there. It's not blood or bloody at all, everything is threatening outside the door, well, let me tell you that one is better for me than this flick. Only the last 5 minutes have vomiting and weird eyes. If I knew it was so bad, I would never have copied it. If you really don't see exorcism, look at Angel Above, Devil Under, or other cheesy ones. this is the waist.
