This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Thank God I saw it for free. I would have hated to waste my money. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is no character in the movie that is somehow pleasant. Michael Caine is close, but even he's pretty wrong. The rest of the "commandos" form reluctant ex-minuses. There are two gay Arabs and three men trying to rape a red cross and a leader who has no problems with their men to kill him so he can escape. <br /> <br /> The "mission is something seemingly. They have to blow up the fuel trash. It looks exciting, right? Well, the footage follows them through endless sand hills and fixed flat tires. Yes, you read this right." In fact, let's look at them to change something in the 12 apartments like the way. This is an incredibly exciting movie. <br /> <br /> They get to the height of fuel to find that it is a decoy. And at that time, the British Army decides they don't need these men anymore, and from now on the radio from their location to the Germans to kill them. <br /> <br /> Now, at least do I have an exciting freedom fight? But when they get there, they went down the road cable and the Germans came to them - calling out their names through the loudspeaker. <br /> <br /> Really weird when the Germans knew where they were and where they go l ksid, why they had before they "trap?" Rather than waiting for them getting into the fuel tank and put all charges. Yes, yes. Right. That would happen. <br /> <br /> So they blow the dump, the leader sells all his men except Michael Caine, because he has been offered $ 2000 to bring him back. <br /> OK ... so men are all betrayed and killed, and Michael Caine and Nigel Davenport survive. British troops come with tanks and they decide to save. Because they wear German uniforms (they wore them to the dump), they bind a flag around a white flag and walk along the road. death. Authors roll. <br /> <br /> Yes. The two "heroes" of the movie die as a result of accidental violence. <br /> <br /> It's almost the same as the movie ended unexpectedly and decided, "It's wrapping. Go home." I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this tireless, unimaginable, and completely unrealistic movie ending with a bomb graceful .
