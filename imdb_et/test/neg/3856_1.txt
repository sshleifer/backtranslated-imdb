My friend who has a mysterious ability to find and - horror! - Recommend bad movies to recommend "Pest." At this time, knowing how truly pathetic his taste in films was, I decided to try it. <br /> <br /> Bad error. <br /> <br /> The story, although it is clearly ripped out of any sixth grade English textbook, as far as the "manhunter" theme goes, would be entertaining in the right conditions - good actors, writer, director, wardrobe and so on and so on almost infinitely further. It is clear that there are no such factors. <br /> <br /> Pest should be funny. I say "think" because I finished something more than a light smile in the film. Not a innocent, not a laugh, not a smile, not even a smile. At best, smile. And it happened so rarely when I watched this movie, as I even remember how often I smile - maybe 3 or 4 times at best. <br /> <br /> So make yourself huge. Never look at this movie. Avoid at all costs.
