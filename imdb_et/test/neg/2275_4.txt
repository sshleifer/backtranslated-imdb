Well, if you discount the value of the production, the ugly outfit and the big hair, this adaptation is much lower than the 90's. The first Ann Firbank (played by Anne Elliot) is literally ten years old to play this role and her actor leaves much to be desired. Amanda Root (playing the same role in 90's) can express more in her big brown eyes than Firbank gets full-face in four hours. Anne has become a dirty, bulging and boring character (and what was the "long walk" scene where she stopped to pull poetry?). Henrietta and Louisa saw so much that the only time I could tell each other was when they stood next to each other (Henrietta was higher). If Louisa! There was never any more unpleasant character there! It was ridiculous to think that Wentworth should be interested in him. He should have a high level of peace of mind and beautiful and charming, not stupid and silly, with a ridiculous laugh that is like chalkboard nails. When he starts singing, "Lyme to Lyme," I started shouting, "shut, shut, shut!" The best part of the movie was when Louisa fell on their three feet because I knew I shouldn't see her again in the movie. Talking about the decline in the cobb's scene; it was a badly behaved, poorly directed and edited scene throughout the movie. How does a person fall under three feet, lands on his feet and is still unconscious? <br /> <br /> The plus size was much closer to Elizabeth's book than in the 90's. Finally, they created many more scenes with Anne and Frederick. <br /> <br /> I testify that I've bought this movie, even though I knew how it was, but I'm a big Austen fan so I buy a movie tailored to one of his novels. Check out this movement if you are curiously curious or even more in the 90s. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this version can follow a novel, but in the 90's, the spirit follows.
