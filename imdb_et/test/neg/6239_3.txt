Don't look at this movie, see something else ... I was very disappointed, I couldn't judge this movie better than 3. The actor was pretty good and I liked William Dafoe as a villain, but I don't understand why this movie made it big on the screen. The story was old and is shown in 100+ other films and 1000+ TV series / movies. The main problem was basically: nothing happens. Take the robbery, let the runner make the money of the abducted husband, make the police fool and bored, and extend it for 95 minutes, you got your "clearing" movie. The only 2 reasons I did not evaluate it a 1 was a) Dafoe and b) "plan-B-end". There is not much end to what you can give a robbery movie ... 75% of them end with A, 20% end-B and 1% end with something unforeseen. Bored, boring, boring.
