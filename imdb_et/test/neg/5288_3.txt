Dr Chopper starts soon after the teenager Nicholas' (Robert Adamson) mother is dead, she is still trimmed, but every cloud has a silver lining and in that case it seems her mother owns Tatonka Lake log house. "a friendly place for lucky people" he didn't tell him. Both Nicholas with his girlfriend Jessica (Chelsey Crisp) and three friends, Jimmy (Butch Hansen), Reese (Chase Hoyt) and Tamara (Ashley McCarthy) will have a fun weekend there. Unfortunately, things do not go as planned, the cabin turns out to be little more than downstream and their neighbors turn out to be Dr. Chopper (Ed Brigadier) and his two sisters who are killing someone they use in terrible trials ... <br /> <br /> video / DVD dr. Chopper was edited and directed by Lewis Schoenburn, and this film seems to be a hard time in some beautiful harsh reviews in IMDb, although I think Dr Chopper is worthless for the horror film. I do not believe that some of the criticisms that have been made are fully justified. A script that takes itself very seriously is credited to Ian Holt (whether he likes it or not), who has the role of Detective Crocker on the film, according to the IMDb cast list, although I don't remember any of that name Maybe he was one of the police at first? Anyway, the basic story is boring, I think that although it's boring and lasts too long, it's a typical ticket price with some evil character that runs around our annoying American teen cast. In addition to some short and undeveloped nonsense about Dr. Chopper using body parts to supplement his worsening body, there is not much of a story here and the script seems to exist only to invent situations for girls to drop their tops, there is inevitable sex Scenes, a queue where some girls have to finish a corporate house topless and here are even a couple of lesbians, one of whom is seen without his full joy. Oh, and when I say topless I mean they don't suffer any top, but they all keep their bras so you can remember that Dr. Chopper doesn't have any real nudity at all. So you really have it, this is an average story that is somewhat surprising at the end of the twist that is wasted, inhabited by a bad clich√© that exists only to present some of the cheap gore scenes and bra girls. Frankly, I'm looking a bit more for my movies, but maybe I'm just picky. <br /> <br /> Director Schoenburn does it really, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, though it's still cheap. There's no style here, I didn't think it was scary or atmosphere. Gore is restrained and confined to some corpses and broken limbs, with nothing new or particularly convincing special effects. Dr Chopper is also one of those films where the characteristic decisions and motivations are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's a little rough around the edges, but it's pretty well done on what was probably a very small budget, forest locations are appropriately isolated, although the police office looks like someone's front and two sister outfits look like stripper equipment. The actor is fine, it may be better, but I'm definitely worse. <br /> <br /> Dr Chopper does indeed have a doctor who drives a chopper around the motorcycle, but unfortunately it is not enough to satisfy me, even though it is a reasonably qualified production, it pulls a real cage, nudity or decent lack of plot traces.
