This is a funny movie that I have no idea how it got to the shelves, they have to pay for the movie shop to put them in there! The story does not make any sense, if you are not on some heavy drugs, you would definitely need something to look at all the garbage so you don't care about what was on the TV because you're almost coma. Writing sounds like a 5-year-old and the actor is worse than a classroom game. The funny special effects they were trying to make are so stupid they spent the whole $ 5 to make the movie, it looks! Oh, this scene with an old woman who has an 80-year-old hairstyle and ugly girls in rubber costumes, me and my friends laughed so hard. Did anyone think it's a good idea to make it a movie? I find it hard to believe!
