I made this mistake because I collect movies inspired by the comic book. Even at $ 6, it was too expensive. I thought there might be some fun fun, "so bad" that it could be a good vibe, I was wrong. I looked at it long ago and didn't remember it. Now I know why. I was longing for and looking at the disturbing things to do something else. I'm all for grrrrl power, punk attitude and absurd humor, but Tank Girl doesn't work any way. The script is bad, you don't care about the characters and humor is usually flat, except for some amusing lumps. Special effects or locations are poor or often replaced by cartoon panels or animations that are too active compared to live action. It's like they had no money to shoot cool stuff and so used the drawings but cool they could be (uncensored animated feature would be the way to better Tank Girl now that I mean it). Action scenes were cheesy but not fun in a b-movie manner. The tank itself was far from impressive or dynamic, although it was interestingly decorated. In fact, the best scenes associated with the tank were in animation. <br /> <br /> It has some interesting songs from well-known artists like Bjork, Hole and Portishead, but they don't fit most of the time instead of improving the atmosphere. If they even broke a ridiculous song and dance number that was just pointless and terrible. I think when I completely tuned. I think Lori Petty's Tank Girl sees the trashy point, but his "attitude" and sometimes hardly entertaining retorts are more two-dimensional and superficial than the worst comic book. Naomi, played by Naomi Watts, is probably the only rescue grace on the film, and it's amazing how such a good actor was in this mess. Malcolm McDowell did not play his usual villain role. For some, this may be a cult film, but please note that it is different from the original independent comedians and the original creators were disappointed with the film itself (see a tank girl in Wikipedia).
