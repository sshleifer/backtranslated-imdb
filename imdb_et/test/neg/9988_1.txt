I am currently slipping through the fall and fall of the Gibbon Roman Empire, so I have all the things Roman thinks of me. I'm not very far away, maybe two hundred plus pages, but it's amazing how many of these Roman emperors were killed. I believe I have read through up to 15 emperors so far and only Antonius, Trajan and Hadrian have not been killed or at least suspected of being killed. I am also fascinated by the madness of many of these Roman princes. Their least practitioner was not Caligula. This brings me to the movie. I think of the film historically, as far as I understand the explanation of Gibbon Rome, as well as other studies of good websites and some fictional history related to time. <br /> <br /> My idea is that I don't think this movie is what many of its supporters think. I do not believe that the mismatch resulting from the sex and terrible violence of this film is accurate. The general ideas of the film seem accurate. Caligula is grown on the island, banished with his family and, in essence, fear that the increasingly mad, suspicious and strange emperor kills Tiberius. She grows paranoid and fears and will never shake her cutesy nickname given to her defenders, small boots, which will help her grow up feeling abused and powerless. He is given to the empire after the death of Tiberius, the Senate, hoping that he will lead away from the informers' teams that brought death to the former misleading paranoid tyrant and lead Rome away from the madness that the dictator had put into it. Caligula begins as decent as the Emperor, but becomes ill, almost dies, and comes back from a fatal death monster. His perverts with his sisters begin here, if not before. He has killed a macro and many others who were his supporters. The madness did not seem to be the murders of Caligula as much as his new thinking about himself as a living God. He saw Jupiter's shape as an equal condemnation. His violent cries would still have condemned him and for three years it seems to be a fairly decent move for the Tiberius descendants. Well, the film tends to go to those lines if it succeeds to be cohesive, which is not common, because it tries to shock the public, every single scene asks the film to be outrageous. Ancient Rome. Shocking scenes are what this film is completely structured and where it completely fails. There is too much to see that successive rulers have a man after murder, rape, torture for some reason, but fancy. Images of violence are likely but not likely to be accurate. The murder was certainly another day in the Roman Empire, torture was before. But the director's vision of these deaths and their main characters' dull entertainment, while the bystanders look at the mismatch, I just don't see it exactly that. The death mechanism, the viewer, is definitely something you have never seen in movies, and something you've ever seen may never be forgotten, even if I do what you want. Drinking wine while crimping your penis is the same as you have seen this shame, it is yours forever. These things tell me about the fantasy of the director and its pornography. They went out of their ill-conceived imagination and no proven record. <br /> <br /> Actress is pretty good. I think Mcdowell is the weakest link here. Mirren always has something to see, and she's great and beautiful in her youthful years. The images of Nerva and Tiberius are very well respected by their respected actors. The film could have said so much better, it is a failure that it is just another layer of what it was shame. For example, he could have given an opinion on how and why Caligula went crazy or showed that he was mad, paranoid before his illness, and that the fever broke the mental restraint he had before. It could have shown Claudius' weakness and the wonders he had survived over Caligula. It may have these and many other things, but it stayed at this sad nightmare. <br /> <br /> Finally, sex. This is porn. This shows that many people do all the acts of sex in the palaces. Male man, female female, male female. It's passionate, hateful. Sex, if your thing is to get out of it, I seriously doubt. Both Tiberius and Caligula could have been sex addicts, and the orgy could have been fairly common, but the visions in this film seem to resemble more Greek time than Rome. I don't think that accepting homosexuality or organs openly was common until Elgabal was strange, lost, and he was killed for it. <br /> <br /> This movie should probably be seen when your curious, let it go. This is something I said earlier, if you look at it, unfortunately, your sick vision will remain in the future. I don't think this is an accurate historical picture, even if it is all historical.
