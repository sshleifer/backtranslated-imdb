I sincerely wonder why this film has ever been made. Bulgarian-Italian co-production in the Berlin version, where all Germans speak English with a German accent, and all Turks speak English with some Turkish words, is hardly believable. English vocabulary is basically limited to "fucking, shit" and the actor is worse than one can imagine. In addition, Germany may have an interesting topic of racial tension, but I know in Germany that there is no clear gang in the middle of the street in the daylight. And if all that is not enough, there will be a successive killer who kills Turkish children and color them white. In order to create tension, we see the serialist and hear him humorous with Schubert's lullaby, but we don't see his face. <br /> <br /> I don't even think they actually shot in Germany. There are obviously some street paintings in Berlin, but there are no participants in the shooting. Bulgaria is probably where there are some German marks here and there.
