This is one of those movies that is so bad that it's awesome! It has all the movies needed in the early eighties: burnt pants, big mustache, chicks with Farrah hair and most importantly, NINJAS !!!! I have some options for your recant. A Cole Army friend is a strange monkey-like face and always seems to be talking without moving his jaw. She gets her ass on her every other scene that has wanted her land so she drunk through the whole movie. At one point, his farm workers will return after the gangs of the gangsters and the outflow of Frank, I think his name is Frank, so moved that he punishes the whole group "Lets Have A Cock Fight !!" and they all went to the battlefield of the flock to begin the sanctuaries. It's funny at every possible level. Do you take it dirty or literally warm my heart. Another funny thing is Sho Kosuk's small suitcases and animated ninja style moves. I remember this guy when I was a kid, and he had said before that he was the only real ninja in the world (he had ads in martial arts magazines) when I remember correctly. My friends and I were a bit ninja mad at the announcement of this movie and I remember it in the local theater several times. I thought when I looked at Starz last night, why all butterflies on American gangsters always have a Filipino fortress and wear a white Steve Martin suit. In fact, this guy goes beyond demanding that all his thongs wear a white Steve Martin suit. There is a scene where it seems that 20 Steve Martin impersonators are attacking the 1970s Sears underwear model (Cole). When we finish the final battle, Cole breaks very terribly into the home and immediately sees the secretary, who in turn warns the guard who is burning off the pump, not 30 meters away from the bad guys, and someone seems noticeable or caring. Cole, wearing a completely white ninja outfit, continues to pull up the staircase, then the flap goes directly to the area where all the bad guys are. The other responsible tells him that he doesn't have to kill everyone when they waited for him, and he gives him a huge Cock Fighting Arena for the bad guys. Don't ask why Cock Fighting is a big part of this movie, but that's it. When they arrive, Cole still carries her ninjas, although all the actors know what she looks like. The final battle is approaching when Cole has killed everyone, and now Sho, as I like to name him, shows that he has kidnapped Cole's lady aka Frank's wife and meets in the scene most seen in the snazziest. Then, Shoo, very politely, I can add, release that lady and the battle begins. They make their worship and start to ride each other. When they struggle, it turns out that Cole turns into a funny spoof of "Finishing The Game" by Bruce Lee's "Death Game". Cole gets to the end, Kills Sho, who dies with the rank because he's destroyed and everything is fine. Next we see Cole, after the destruction of every person's life, the city begins to redistribute it, but not before he foresees a fat guy who is hooked by hand, brutally dead, and then inexplicably tends to camera, freeze frame, credit, credit.
