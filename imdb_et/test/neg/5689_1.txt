Please, believe me when I say it is a terrible, terrible, sci-fi movie. It was so bad that a large part of the film was playing inadvertent surrealism and its 100% wastage. Awful, but somehow deeply failed. I looked at it as a double function with "Recon 2020: Caprin Massacre" and although "Battlespace" was an incredibly good movie, it doesn't talk much. The "Battlespace" plot is so complex that it is impossible to follow. The narrative is secretive, often meaningless, seemingly endless and exhausting. Literally half of the film is a female lead who looks like Brian Bosworth walking in the desert. The movie actually starts in the cool bay, but then reaches the city center and somehow worsens after a minute. Absolutely terrible and truly absurd endurance test. Zero stars. --- | --- Reviews Flak Magnet
