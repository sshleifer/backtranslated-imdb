This movie is a group of people who are infected with a powerful man-made virus. Government men follow them in the desert. <br /> <br /> The film's premise is quite interesting, but it is hampered by the fact that delivery is very boring. At some point, the film will not be played with the viewer at any level. The alleged budget is a problem, but it is not the reason for the film's failure. Much more is to blame for a very clean delivery. There is a lot of narration, but unfortunately, the narrator is an exciting dramatic voice. It seems that there is very little happening to these people, and before the end you have to take on the men of the governments - the faster they kill the protagonists, the faster the movie ends. A much better title for this movie would have been four people who had been in the desert with a helicopter. In general, it is very annoying.
