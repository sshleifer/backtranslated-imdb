I was so much more than what I got from watching this movie. It is not that I express objections to a literary license (if it should be mentioned), especially if there is no firm attempt to say "on the basis of a true story". But this film is about Beethoven - a real historical person who is so widely known and so deeply integrated into our musical experience, and I was expecting this film to be historical for at least the primary elements. This film was such a big exception to the historical record that it was just a disappointment. <br /> <br /> My premise (because I hadn't studied the movie at all) was that it was true. Halfway I stopped searching for a movie on IMDb. The rest of the film was a very different experience. I was relieved that it was not accurate in history because it was so hard to believe most of this story. To enjoy this movie, I had to admit it as a fantasy, "if it was such a story". The film lacked this honest responsibility clause. <br /> <br /> What cheated me the most was the fictional management of the 9th Symphony. The concept depicted in the film stretched my imagination to disbelief. Finally, I doubted that something other than Ludwig van Beethoven and his relationship with Karl van Beethoven was true. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed Ed Harris, an extraordinary actor who knows how to play a role by keeping yourself out of it and that is what I give him 3/10. <br /> <br /> Those who show this movie as good or better than Amadeus don't know if the composers' life is just looking for what that movie really is because it was finally a new story - cellulose fiction.
