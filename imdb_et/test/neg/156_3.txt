Jack Bender's "Tempest" is an adaptation of Shakespeare's "Tempest" game. Bender transports the plot from medieval Italy to Mississippi during the American Civil War. It includes the role of slavery and the role of retaliation in wartime. <br /> <br /> Prospero, named Gideon Prosper, is not the Duke of Milan, but the landowner of Mississippi. She is studying voodoo magic from a female slave, Mambo Azaleigh. He rescues his son Ariel, who accompanies him to the refugee. The island is not at sea, but near the banks of Mississippi. There lives the Alligator hunter, the so-called "Gator-Man", who later tries to rape the daughter of Prospero Miranda. During the war, Ariel wants to join forces with the Union to help fight slavery. Prospero doesn't care about war. He is only interested in his personal revenge against his brother Antony. When Antony and his accountant Willi Gonzo (Gonzalo) try to cross the river, Prospero raises the storm. Union soldier Frederick will disappear in the swamp and eventually the island will arrive. He and Miranda fall in love with each other, but Prospero does not accept it. In the meantime, Ariel explains what Prospero has changed into a clown that Antony has been trying to communicate with the alliance, but plans to betray him. Antony and Gonzo meet with Gator Man in the sex and communicate with Prospero. They kidnap Miranda and Ariel, but Prospero freezes them and helps the European Union hit the southern army. Finally, Ariel is free, Frederick and Miranda have to get married, Prospero returns to the plantation and Gator Man gets back to the island. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda represents Gideon Prosper vigorously and convincingly, while Antony's character remains flat. It was not a bad idea to make a temple before the Civil War, but perhaps the driver has risked too much. In some respects, the story seems to be built or comic. For example, Gator Man appears without explanation. That it needs kidnapping to bring Prospero to his mind and loses his power of trust, shows that Bender tried to make Prospero more human, but made him a weak old man without his magic. Prospero's original authority and wisdom are not explained. <br /> <br /> ------------- End of Part 1 --------------- ---------- ---
