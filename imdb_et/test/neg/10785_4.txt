I can't believe some of the scores that this movie gets on the IMDb website! Have I been issued a special edition of naff? Bernard Matthews's film, edited by Dewhurst, should be housed in Batterseas. I am sorry for all UK-centric references, but if you are elsewhere and you have no cuts to cut them or you have not received a catalog of breweries, this film may be worth 90 minutes of your remaining life (as long as you has not looked at the color for drying). The plot has more holes than the pair of fishnets and the direction and editing are amazingly ham. What on earth are irons in this movie?
