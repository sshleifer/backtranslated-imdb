I understand that this is a small statistical sample (8 votes for posting it) but 5.9 out of 10? I give this movie 3 and even it is generous. I've been trying to watch this movie three times now (Saturday night at 9.00 am on a Sci-Fi channel and Saturday night at 1pm and on Saturday night, and I have slept all three times before the end of the movie). What leaves me with a list of missed questions. For example, should Lance Henriksen, who made an effort for money, keep supporting roles in these pious "Pumpkinhead" stairs? Is Henriksen banned from making "Pumpkinhead" movies? Do the creators of this franchise get better than a monster that looks like a geriatric, alienated "Alien" who walks like he's stuck **? When will the hick characters in these films realize that handguns and rifles do not damage "Pumpkinhead"? Why don't they try to mix another thing instead of **? And finally, have the writers of this film creatively disputed that they could not find two hostile family names that were more original than Hatfields and McCoys? When not to write about a fictional president and call him George Bush? One day I may have mental stamina to watch this movie all the time without bedtime. So far, if anyone has answers, please let me know.
