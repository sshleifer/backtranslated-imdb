Yes, it is true that it was Jessica Alba who takes me to this movie because without her I would have had to choose it. I thought this story was full of clich√©s and guiding very boring. So it was a surprise to see that the director and the writer are the same person. I have to notice that I remember to avoid all my next movies. how to open your soul and at the same time he found a suitable movie. Bob Hoskins shows great experience and should have won this role. In South Asia, you don't know exactly where! Ah, a small flight with a red line in Indiana Jones movie !!!
