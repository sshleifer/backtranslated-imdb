I love Ustinov's special, literate. And photography is quiet. We put the film on our 3.5-year-old who looked in and out of the room. So we only saw about 1/3 of our first watch and we were pretty charming. When we looked again, we sat down for a family, we were all dead in the violence and life-threatening situations that the poor otter got into. About half of the film is dead, bloody hairy. A lot of blood, not just a little. Finally, with the dog, there is a wild struggle; You think it's G-rated, all you see ... that they'd be one animal dead. No. They drag the carcass out of the water and clearly show it for several traumatic seconds. Personally, as an adult, I love horror films and am a very violent film scene in Scorsese, Cronenberg, Tarantino. Heck, I love ultra violent Battle Royale. But these are not child's films and are not advertised as such. If you deliberately grow your youngsters to see the harsh realities of a cute animal life, this is a movie for you. If you are like me and my wife, you could save your child from nightmares and avoid it.
