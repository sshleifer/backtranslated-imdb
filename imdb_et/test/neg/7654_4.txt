(May contain spoiler) This film is a strange thing. I hired this hope for the movie so bad that it would be funny. However, I cannot honestly say whether this film was intended to be scary or humorous. It combines emotions quite disturbingly. Obviously, it is trying to be smart, but it really isn't. For example, when a knife comes out and tries to kill a teacher, he starts to play happy music. When we go to Toxico, we have a surprise, quasi-gentleman. Roger's Neighborhood Music. However, when a little boy dreams of falling into "blood" and when he finds his foot, they are clearly intended to be a tension. Watch this movie and decide for yourself. It's too weird to describe the words and that's what I say, costumes. <br /> <br /> "Nose Diving ... WOW!"
