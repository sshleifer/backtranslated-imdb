This movie was the 67 best 71 pictures I've seen the worst. First of all, I found the plot's features somewhat absurd - a missing spouse 25 years / still in love / not even a letter! Leave me alone. And why was the man who had been absent for so long, accidentally working on an oil table next to a congressional party? This film also showed some of the worst stereotypes of African Americans I've ever seen. This makes Gone With the Wind (see Prissy) as progressive! I've hardly seen a movie that I didn't like. UGH!
