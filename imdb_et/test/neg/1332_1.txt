Woa, talk awfully. Don't waste your time. I wish I had seen other usage comments. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I didn't look at the whole thing. It was just terrible. The worst, bogus dialogue ... I could go on. But what really made it invisible was the direction. Poor participants. You can't even tell if he has any talents because they have not only pathetic lines, but the director did not give them any action. If you check the filmography of the director of this site, you can see why this film did not have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> It wouldn't be good if it was made for a TV strike. <br /> <br /> Ouch!
