Reba is very stupid. You can predict pretty much anything that happens. Barbra Jean is just too stupid. It's like he's not even a character. Such an exhibition should at least have SAMEONE, who resembles a real person. I think Barbra Jean represents a slower person. Keira or her name, Reba, Brock, they're all stupid! Keira is the smartest person in the show and she's still stupid. ALL ARE STUPLE! This is my opinion about Reba. Since I have said everything I can say about this exhibition, I will just take the next few lines of text, saying what I am saying now and do it up to 10 lines. There. Reba gets 2/10.
