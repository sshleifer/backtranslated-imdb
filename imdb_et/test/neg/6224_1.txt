The HORRENDOUS experience is not better to look at Mamma Mia: Hitler has to look up by telling Pseudo-director Phyllida Lloyd 'You a monster what you've done?' <br /> <br /> Everything the movie is wrong with. Just ??? Wrong! Even the success that is inexplicable. I understand if these buggy parody films, such as Epic Movie, make their minimum amount of money and make a profit just because they are cheap (of course they are!). But if anything makes Mamma Mia with $ 450 million worldwide, do you think "what the hell is wrong in the world?" <br /> <br /> And think we have Meryl Streep, one of the world's largest living actors, in this? What did he mean? "I need money," he said. Well, then sell one of your grandchildren, even it would be less embarrassing. Meryl is not a good catastrophe, a mistake, a movie. He's also catastrophic! When he sings, though he has a vocal, it is ridiculous. Worse than her only Pierce Brosnan. He was James Bond. Now he sings at the worst movie credit at Abba lilla spandex. Really? And when I mention Abbat, I have nothing against the band and their music. Although it doesn't help them when the actors started to sing (badly), dancing (worse), and the appendices then joined (They jump out now!) Repeatedly submit one dreaded musician. You want to cry when music starts. And I love musicals! But this is the first in the genre where you PRAY for real silence. <br /> <br /> I could continue. The list goes on forever. You could write Stephen King's novel with a complete list of mistakes in this movie. <br /> <br /> To sum up: go see it! Really! You have to understand! And because it is already a huge success, who cares about whether it will make a few more dollars? And it doesn't like selling your soul to the devil. Meryl did it before. All for humanity. And now the world must end, because we are committed to the ultimate evil and we must destroy it.
