Apparently, there are a whole host of people who have seen it. The original title of "Cottonmouth Joe" would have put things in a better perspective for the audience. I have personally experienced the state of cotton (often accompanied by a very bad ghost after the weekend) and it is really much like the film Skeleton Man - a dry, crazy film that regrets recent choices and mild heat. It is unfortunate that for the title, a distributor was chosen as the "Skeleton Man" option (probably some Hollywood interventions that are not a studio that just didn't get it) and not "Cottonmouth Joe". Those of us who saw the movie know that the skeleton is actually Cottonmouth Joe (a skeletal-man revelation, not a real skeleton man). The fraudulent marketing of this film is unforgivable and I cannot give this film a high rating. Imagine: if future filmmakers create a movie of a true final skeleton and need a title, they will be completely screwed and we will all be as serious fans of the genre as it has fallen for it. <br /> <br /> Cottonmouth Joe could have turned into a horror movie icon right there with Madman Marz, Black Claw, Mansquito, Humongous, Nature Boy Billy Conners, Mortyi Wooden Doll, Boogen, Eegah, Moon Beast, Bloody Bill, Driller Killer, Mickey Rooney, and so on, but he must always be remembered as a sword-shaped encapsulated dummy that faces the horse's skeleton. <br /> <br /> It's too bad.
