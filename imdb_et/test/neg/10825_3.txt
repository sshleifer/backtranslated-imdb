The more frightening this fear film is that the end refers to the sequel. "Cave" is really a disappointing movie. The team of under and underwater scientists goes to Romania (one of those cheap places to make a movie at least for now) and after the destroyed church, enter the cave that is in the area of ​​underground monsters. Or are they demons? The film never determines whether it wants to be an action, a scientific literature or a horror, it's a mixture of all without salt or fun and it was wood. The best thing about the film is cinematography, but even the dark landscape of the cave will soon be boring because the film has no tempo and the characters just aren't interesting. Waste of time.
