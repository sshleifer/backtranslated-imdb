I wasn't very excited to see this movie first, but a group of us decided to open it at night. I felt like I got up and walked and tried to get my money back to that movie in 20 minutes. I felt the film was very boring, uninteresting and not true in many respects, including "playing". I tried my best to fall asleep when I watched one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. The scary movie series was more sensitive to this movie. The sad attempt to draw a Gothic girl, a overworked businessman, and a 15-year-old geek and some casual guy in a video game that kills you is a bad start at first. Then they try to throw a very horrible scene of love, where the main character is capable of another girl after 10 minutes of her murder. The theater was packed when the film ended in just over half of the people who had gone before. If you feel the need to waste only 1 hour and 16 minutes of your time watching this movie ... get ready to feel cheated.
