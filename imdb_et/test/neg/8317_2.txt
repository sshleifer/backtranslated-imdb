I don't know which neighborhoods people who wrote the rave comments on this movie are living, but I'm glad I'm not there if they haven't commented on the comic sensitivity of this thing. Okay, we learn to stop our beliefs in movies like the "Die Hard" series, but seeing a little Jodie captures the gang of the street with Glock when NOVICE is still ... c'mon. All he needed was a bald head and a ripped T-shirt and he would be BE Bruce Willis. Apparently, Jodie, as the executive producer, dazzled him with the money and the waste of that money. Or he lived out of some sort of fantasy where he was the only blonde and everyone else was a brunette black or a spanish. Even the dog is black. Little Blondie is the only good and (with the exception of a black police officer) all the other professional minorities in the city to get her. Is your fear of your ability to act so far that you think the only way you notice is the only bright place (literally) in the dark, frightening and harsh neighborhood / film / cast? He probably thought he was in the wrong movie ... Dark knight. Ridiculous plot holes, furniture chewing, free violence ("Look at girls! Now you can do it!"). ..Use time with your family instead of watching this drama.
