If you are an average man like me and I enjoy good action, good plot, good scripts, novel ideas or entertainment, you might miss it. I was honestly bored with credit, but I tried to give the film a chance and looked at it all the time - I was disappointed at every step. <br /> <br /> Action was incredibly sub par, but I'm not sure if the actors themselves are guilty or if it was a ridiculously woody and terrible dialogue with a worse script. The plot is very vague and underdeveloped and I think the audience should have a somewhat deeper meaning or be able to look at it somehow, but to be honest, it would be a waste of time. The film has a distinctive sexuality that has no other purpose than to show some tattoos and lingerie. No one seems to be motivated, except for buying out some sort of "investment" transaction that is never explained. The links between the characters are not very clear and the development of the character is scarce. <br /> <br /> This is either a subculture film designed for a very specific audience to enjoy or absolute crap, but you can decide for yourself. <br /> <br /> I gave it to 2 because it is definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but probably not the worst.
