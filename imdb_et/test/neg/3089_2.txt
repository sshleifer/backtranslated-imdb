I wanted to love this movie so badly ... really. But it was a terrible disappointment. <br /> <br /> I read Jennifer Egan's novel in 1996 and this fascinating story. In fact, it remains one of my favorite books. Remember that the book had much more depth than the film, on the plot and on emotional resonance. It's MADE when you care about the characters. He painted a complete picture of Phoebe, unlike the very bad character of the young girl in the movie. <br /> <br /> Although beautiful and shows that * some promises during his growing career, Jordana Brewster was flat and hollow like a script. And Christopher Eccleston (Wolf) was just the choice of fear for Wolf's role both physically and logistically. Which awkward looking couple. The wolf should have been a bunch of physics in the dark and physically appealing as it was in the book. Moreover, the chemistry of the two participants was painfully forced. <br /> <br /> Cameron Diaz still deserves praise for his actions. He took a mediocre script and gave him a characteristic life, a true spirit. She is just proud and her careful manners make her very faithful as a hippie. It's too bad when his talent was destroyed by this forgotten movie. <br /> <br /> The category book-movie has this terrible translation that is almost as bad as the message on the bottle with Kevin Costner. But don't get me started on it ... <br /> <br /> I am not so harsh in my criticism, but here I was so disappointed because I cared about the story and wanted to see it right. It didn't give ... <br /> <br />
