The film uses historical occasional events with nilly-nilly criss-nylly, and its three average characters. What purpose can be asked? The problem with this movie is that the script becomes a "story", not a character or their life. <br /> <br /> It starts with a lot of rich, meaningless college children (and a couple of not so rich) pulled into Naxal's movement. There is an affair, rejection and separation. People go their way seemingly. Only until the heroine reaches them. Not once, twice. After a break from "Movement", the next obstacle to these 3 is the Emergency State established by Indira Gandhi. Many political persons migrate for obvious reasons. Sub-plots are too constructed and do not add logic to create. <br /> <br /> The film tries to put the wrong pace, but never reaches a true rhythm. From time to time, the three former colleagues in the circle of friends have not been fairly even and steady. Even after they are supposed to be married, busy, settled, or whatever, they are quite eager to simply ditch the entire ditch and visit the village to have sex with a former lover or a former flame. What a fruitful imagination is on the screen writer. So many 4-letter words are used without any rhyme or reason to be abusive! <br /> <br /> Chitrangda Singh has a terrible American accent that he is not trying to hide. His dirty hearing in his mouth clich√©-driven dialogue like "What is it? I didn't think you were coming" (this after a hellish nightmare he's just gone through) or at first "I appreciate your concern, but I can take care of myself "Yikes. What clown did this dialogue write? He calls his friend to have a cup of" south indian "(no less) coffee, someone wants a good morning and then wants someone else in the family good night. that?!? <br /> <br /> countless uncredited villagers and tribals are the best actors. Editing is too uncertain with too many cuts. Obviously, the hard daring statement will be made by Sudhir Misra with that time for a long time.
