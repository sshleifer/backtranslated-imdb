it is one of the most stupid movies ever, not the foolish mind, but one of the stupid ones. It is 96 1/2 minutes of sleep-inducing material. Probably Jim Varney's worst movie ever. The last 30 seconds of the movie is the best and the funniest part, but hardly worth the whole movie. On the other hand, if you are a fan of Jim Varney / Ernest, like me, you have to add this movie to your collection. It is a short and rare sense of humor, although they are little and far away. The mere fact that it is so difficult to find this film makes it a collector and must be necessary for your collection. I was happy to find this movie online for a few years ago at a cheap price. I believe I paid for 1.99 plus shipping. And that was the only copy I found everywhere. Even if it is really a terrible movie, it's still a must if you're a fan of Jim Varney and a filmmaker from Ernest, for example I. On scale 1 to 10 I'll give this movie 2, but just because I've never seen 1 before;
