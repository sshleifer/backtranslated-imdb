One of the few films filmed at the Coronado High School in Scottsdale in the late 1980s, as well as one of the boys, Bill and Ted's great adventure and just perfect (which was the segment film that was played during the Mickey Mouse Club.) it's pretty right. <br /> <br /> Over the past few years, Coronado has undergone a major overhaul and many of the buildings in this movie have now disappeared. In the area where they are trying, there is a football field that is one of the few areas that still exist. The inner scenes near the interior design chambers, which they believed were in the old 200 buildings. <br /> <br /> If it is not played late night on the Disney channel, it may be very difficult to find a flick. How they did this queue is outside of me.
