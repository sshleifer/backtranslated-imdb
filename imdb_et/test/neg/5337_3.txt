Oh noes one of those Japanese ghost girls' attacks ... I don't even remember how much I've seen. maybe it sells ... but not me. not scary at all. Japanese horror movies have been very similar since the first one ... of the child's drawing. I have seen so many horror films pulled the scene so many times. The cell phone scene is also nothing new ... the drama of the man hit by the train ... I mean, it didn't have all the drama ... OK, this is for 14-16 year olds who listen to Japanese rock and think they are so unique ... let me tell you. there are a million people = D it's one of them. 3/10 I've seen it worse, but you can't see anything unless you see it!
