(This review has some very obvious spoilers so be careful.) <br /> <br /> A friend brought it over and we did it in 45 minutes before deciding that the 8x speed was successful so that this movie should be viewed. There were points when we watched the movie at the normal speed from which I left, making some of the lunch and back to find that nothing literally happened. Two unnecessary lines of dialogue were exchanged. Nothing happened in the background, no significant facial gestures, nothing other than the awkward uncomfortable silence. <br /> <br /> It's not how a thoughtful movie is made, especially if the movie's graph follows the same Hollywood core movie ropes. If I told you that Disney made a movie about 4 girls starting a band, and the singer was a French exchange student, what would you expect as "conflicts" that arise? <br /> <br /> Should a singer cross the stage? Someone to say no to break? The ensemble is late for its activities and the sideline has to buy that time? <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * <br /> <br /> All these things happen in this movie. <Br / / <br /> In this film, there is no concern at any time that these girls are unable to fulfill their purpose. <br /> <br /> I like Japanese movies. I've spent a lot of time in Japan. I work for a Japanese company. Heck, I even know that all the bands that are referred to in the record collections and MDs that they pass through, and I have sung with the title track with their karaoke friends. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst film I have ever seen from Japan. Don't mix. Although characters are in a movie where they do typical Japanese high school things, this is not the usual day of the "movie". It's "the life of four very random, strongly contradictory, uncomfortable Japanese students." <br /> <br /> There are also noticeable problems with a DVD. Viz decided that a big extra would be the manufacturer who read aloud the Wikipedia record of blue hearts. What a value! In addition, they care so little about the subtitles that the band's name in the subtitles "Paran Maum" is different than in the "Paran Marum" menu selection. The scene of the final audience has a very visible reflection / amazing effect on everything, but it seems to be the original film's mistake. <br /> <br /> 2/10, DON'T look if you don't absolutely love discomfort.
