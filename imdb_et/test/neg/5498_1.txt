Fans honored their unusually charming creativity and Hollywood for their softball, user-friendly film making techniques, Tim Burton pulled the scales too far from his new cinematic legend Sleepy Hollow. After Ichabod crane search? played by Johnny Depp, offering this tough movie with only a bright spot? In the heart of the seemingly casual and terrifying murder of the city, which is by chance a halting rider, the story plays as if deliberately trying to mislead. The daunting introduction of the child at bedtime is blessed with exciting exciting, non-interesting scenes that, along with undeveloped characters, flee their lives, produce about as much fear and excitement as Nightmare before Christmas. Toss's endless old tree bundle with atmosphere and wide eyes, a great-looking blonde love (Christina Reechi) and Burton have a film that takes Sleepy Hollow out of the old legend and managed to do it like a Disney movie without charm or captivity.

Even with the support of Emmanuel Lubezki, the most sought-after operator of Hollywood today, in the astonishment of Depp's and Burton's astonishing name recognition, Sleepy Hollow has nothing to lose.
