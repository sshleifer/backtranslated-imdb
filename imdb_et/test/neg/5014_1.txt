This movie was a waste of my money. it was both disgusting and disturbing. honestly, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. who thinks of a movie where a girl blows her dog? seriously ... it was a waste of my time. I watched the movie hoping it would improve and the plot would appear, but it never happened. would appreciate the movie F-. This film should have been rated by R for its disturbing character. I will never let this age of children see this movie. this movie sucks. this movie is terrible. this movie was a waste of my time. I could have spent the night instead of renting this movie. this movie was a waste of gas money to reach the store and it was definitely a waste of two dollars to watch it. pretty much, no one should watch this movie. this movie should be banned and burned.
