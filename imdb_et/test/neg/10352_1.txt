The best thing about the American version is that Jane Turner and Gina Reilly have to kidnap this mess. Yes, the American rip-off was shown in about two episodes in Australia but was not rated; probably curious viewers who thought how bad it would be. Answer: AVAILABLE, complete waste of time. The actors are relatively unknown and they do not take the nuances of Australia's written script. Bad luck for them because they are forced to fall with this turkey. I have no tips for US viewers. <br /> <br /> Americans should be the best to find an eBays ORIGINAL VERSION DVD, but remember that some DVDs are available in different zone formats in the US. Otherwise, some DVD players will work with discs from both / all zones.
