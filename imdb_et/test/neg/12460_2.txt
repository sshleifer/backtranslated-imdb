SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I gave this movie from 2 out of 10 to 2 scenes that I will never forget ..... by the way, my husband leased this surprising non-blow-em river to almost chick look flick ... but i thought why when i saw the cover .... girls in school uniforms .... duh .... lol .... ah, men if you can't beat 'em. .... ;-) <br /> <br /> Bijou Philips, one of my favorites on the indie screen ... too cute ...... not only gets into love (his toy dog ​​is the best in the lesbian city according to his bubbly frightening character) .. this would be the first valuable scene. <br /> <br /> Then she enters the toilet in a beautiful dress and goes down. goes up, goes to the party where he and the sadly sad "Cat" character is, and gives the party a silver ice pot at the party ... the host looks at his precious silver ice bucket and says, "Oh my god it is poo." <br /> <br / > I love Bijou Phillips for his creativity and unusual film choices, it would definitely be one of them ... and um, I'd rent this poo scene if I were you ..... I'm not a big fan of jokes, but it definitely makes "party" in their place (they weren't seeing that they would have a good time anyway ..... lol) ... you don't forget these two scenes ... hmm, but what do we want in our databases? .... Maybe you shouldn't follow my advice at all .... lol <br /> <br /> Dominique Swain is kind of sad and sad in her confusing sense of 'Tart'. I don't know, I can't decide if I like it because he's so indie in movies? Indie movies are fantastic and all, but could he choose a couple of good ones? I still look at some of his movies and reserve a judgment .... but it was, (forgive the reference to animals) dog .....
