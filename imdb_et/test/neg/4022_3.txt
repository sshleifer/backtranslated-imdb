What was it, Zucker's brothers movie? I don't mind my humor in my Holmes (I'm a big fan of Billy Wilder's "SH's private life"), but this version of "Four Signs" seems like a Grand-Guignol-esque episode "Murder, She Wrote" (right from the beginning, which is the worst) as possible: film scene editing), as directed by Mel Brooks. Ian Richardson is a beautiful actor and definitely seems like this part (he has died around the drawings that are from Strand!), But his interpretation of character is all wrong and too humorous. Drug Holmes had taken into account the comic stiffness of cocaine, not weeds, in their carnival sequences. Not to mention that if she conceals herself as an old man, she is so uplifted that we feel her immediately, despite the subtle makeup. David Healy is unmemorable, but given the circumstances, acceptable to Watson, and not too much buffalo ... at least no more than the rest of the characters. Cherie Lunghi (Excalibur) plays Mary Morstan in an exaggerated way directly from the Vaudeville of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> The story is meaningless, there are some pointless additions (like giving Tonga vampire teeth, raw meat of meals and a carnival place to live, turning him into a blow from Dr. Moreau) and we have even denied discovering a mystery beside Holmes because we we know everything before Holmes discovers. And it's full of tired clich√©s: not only can we get the notorious vocabulary "Elementary, my dear Watson" (which like any Sherlockian knows, Conan Doyle never wrote), but we're open to such blatant traditional places like Hindi music pop out somewhere when Holmes goes to see a white man in Hindi clothing. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: In the eighties, two competing TVs in the UK attempted to create a long-lasting series of Sherlock Holmes adaptations and made potential TVs as potential pilots. One of them was Ian Richardson, the other star was Jeremy Brett. Fortunately, the one who got the way through several episodes was good! <br /> <br /> 3/10 Travesty.
