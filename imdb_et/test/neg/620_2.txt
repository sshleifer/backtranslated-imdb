I couldn't. I was bored, not only because the action was terrible and the tragic story was just a b-film whose plot was all cannibalism, but the fact that I watched a subtitle foreign film that didn't disturb me at all, but was STILL duplicated. <br /> <br /> "Special Effects" were terrible. When the back of the plane leaves, you can see that the model is hollow because it "breaks" into fake. Most of the film takes place on a soundtrack that is obviously not real and looks like a game because all the snow's "sounds" are heard, but not really scenes. <br /> <br /> "But what do they eat? They have no food" one soldier (it is never clear what this man is doing or why he is responsible) says what I'm sure nobody really is actually said or even thought about food because they were worried when the people were alive, not how they would eat. It was just a stupid line that was written to point out that yes, they must eat the corpses to survive. <br /> <br /> When they finally decide to eat the body, one man finds a body without a shirt that, despite being in the snow but not far frozen, has a very flexible and fresh flesh. She cuts the fresh meat behind her, it is neither frozen nor cold again, and this scene continues for five minutes. There I had to stop. Transformation "Alive" was a much better film to try to survive in a terrible situation where I'm sure the real survivors praised, while I can't imagine that any of them would be good for this version. It was just eating corpses and everything else was secondary. Avoid.
