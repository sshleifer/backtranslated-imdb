It's not "so bad it's good" - it's "so bad, it violates the prohibition of the brutal and unusual punishment of the Geneva Convention"! Only by reading the summary, you can even find out the disaster of this straight "plot" video. It is a witty stock that has been put together with the worst of all times. Compared to this incompetent, decaying and humorous confusion with "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid" is like saying "Gigli" is like "Citizen Kane". Talentless cast is a costume cheap, J.C. Penney "Goin" church "clothing, and there is not the slightest test period haircut or make-up.If you really want to see how such" respect "can be used, see" Missing Cadavra lost bone "- it's smart, well-written and best of all, what are the real actors who are not seeing such torture, so look for the work of Phoenix artist Paul Wilson, whose Sci-Fi short "70-meter football attack", keeps this movie dusty. sound like they've been pulled out of the street and given their scripts to read and take only one, this is an insult to Bela Lugos, Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney, and someone else involved in the movies they suffered to make this shock shock! is not a problem - much can be spent a lot. Good script, decent actors and higher class Z costumes and production design should have been given before the so-called director created this cinematic movie We hope that the promise of "promise" will not be fulfilled - it was by far the most frightening thing shown in the whole movie !!
