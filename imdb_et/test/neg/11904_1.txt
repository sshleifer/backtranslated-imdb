I watched this movie on television at random and it was so incredibly terrible that I couldn't turn it off. Every single wisdom and intelligence is removed by the Oscar Wilde story by an inert scenario writer. It's hardly important, because terribly working, clich√©-working camera work and sticking music would still have destroyed something like a decent script. The worst performance comes from Patrick Stewart, who is the most hammam, talented, ghost look at Shakespeare's nincompope. "Get out of here!" he screams at one stage while throwing his hand like a pantomime villain. A really terrible movie and why wonder why Stewart, who demands it, has moistened his reputation by making such and valuable pieces of XMen.
