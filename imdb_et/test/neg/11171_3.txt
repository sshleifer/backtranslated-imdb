It is really sad to see that once a great director, such as Deodato, gives such a second degree giall like this one. This movie was so terrible that he ended his film career. The box is located, it's not an "erotic thriller", during the 97-minute hell movie, Charlotte Lewis hardly shows us one nipple! I thought it would come after William Burger appeared (with one of his last roles), but his character was killed quite sharply and lamely. This movie doesn't quite succeed. The music of Claudio Simonetti is a little more than the noise and the plot was very little. For some reason, Lewis is terrorized by a ghost that attacks the use of phones. (?) After all, all the characters seem to have forgotten the previous 90-minute hell they went through, and randomly laugh when they sick the evil spirits to someone else, a former Lewis boy. What?!? This movie made me a little angry and carried me half a death. For the 80's Deodato amusements, see BARBARIANS or ATLANTIS INTERCEPTORS, let's get it on the video store shelf. Argento could do better than this!
