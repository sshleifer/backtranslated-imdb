I see most of the comments so far have been, or are not very positive, at least positive. I don't understand that. The only explanation I find is that the people who commented had something to do with the film because it is one of the worst films I've ever seen. This makes Boggy Creek II and Mutant look like horror masterpieces. Operation is at best shaky and mostly terrible. The whole movie is almost black, probably so they can get it all over the same place. The monster looks like something from Roger Corman's worst films. And the plot ... well, the less you talk about it, the better. <br /> <br /> One to avoid at all costs.
