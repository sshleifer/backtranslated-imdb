John Sayles, what have you done? <br /> <br /> Silver City was in moments when I saw good hopes of a good story, well-drawn signs, a provocative dialogue. And then these moments would quickly cover the poor writing layers, the clumsy direction and the debilitating behavior. I love almost all of John Sayles's work, but "Silver City" is strange. <br /> <br /> I had the feeling that Sayles might have worked at the beginning of an illegal work and industrial story. the lines of the corruption area, but then he hastened and stuck the line of the second plot that sat down on the Bush administration. The two stories do not match and the weaker elements of the political theme dominate the film from the first 3/4, causing me to lose the affair with the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Another big drawback is the action of Danny Huston. His dialogue in each scene is equipped with gentleness, regardless of its suitability for mood. I hated this chain by the end of the movie, reminding me of every bad actor in every high school game I've ever seen. If I didn't see Huston anything else, I don't know whether to blame him or to blame him for more. Regardless, he is an unfortunate contact point for a very unfortunate movie. <br /> <br /> Right before the last sledgehammer-fine last scene I was disappointed with "Silver City". Sayles is his best or heck, even Sayles mediocre, can be so much better than this film. Instead, see HOW his other works. It's not even worth renting.
