Acts 10, Script 1. "Hurlyburly" comes from this unfortunate postmodern theater school that has proclaimed something like a story or a ban on a plot. While people can come out on the stage, the film is deadly or at least deadly. We have a number of great actors who talk about a dialogue that is perfectly written, but nothing. Worse still, every person speaks with the same voice, regardless of their background. The only attempt to distinguish is that Anna Paquin would use the word "not". <br /> <br /> Don't forget that characters are extreme losers, but the camera works as a slug, and (LA residents) the geographical meaning is ridiculous. (Hint: Sean Penni's front window view is about eight miles from the back of the window and you can't drive through Hollywood to the south and stop Glendale from pretending to be Burbank.) Okay, suspending belief and everything - and I usually don't pay attention to such small things because they are just nuances of production. But the fact that they set up so much, regardless of pyrotechnics on the screen, tells a lot about the weakest element of the company - the script. <br /> <br /> In short, even leave it on the video. Rabe chose the wrong quotation from the Scottish game for her name; Hurlyburly would have been a better name for the "Idiot that is full of sound and rage that doesn't mean anything." Perhaps the customer is a bit long - but at least it would be a fair ad.
