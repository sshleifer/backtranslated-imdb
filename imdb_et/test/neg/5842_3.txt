Mind-numbingly boring, completely predictable and finally just ridiculous. All in all, it is a disaster that is an indecent proposal. Starting with a decent presumption, the whole thing just goes away and becomes a complete confusion. Basically, this story tells you, "Would you let your wife sleep with another man for one million dollars?" Of course the answer is yes, otherwise we would not have a movie. Frankly, we would've been better off if we didn't have a movie. <br /> <br /> Our married (and financially challenging) pair is played by Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. They're going to get rich in Vegas. Yes, it works. Anyway, a billionaire, played by Robert Redford, loves a woman and makes a million dollar offer. For one night with his wife, he gives them a financial guarantee. The consequence of this one night is what the film really touches. Unfortunately, nothing like this is the least fun. The script is so predictable that characters can be marked before they are made. Performances leave much to be desired. Harrelson would be better off with comedies because this serious action attempt leaves the mark completely behind. Anguish is not something he can imagine. And it's pretty safe to say that Demi Moore will never have to get his home home empty. Why did he redefine the movie star? In a part that should be full of emotions, it doesn't give anything. Only Redford flees mostly unharmed. She is slim enough, but suave and clearly the best actor of the bunch. But he can't save that movie. Awful script, sad action, comforting tempo, zero entertainment ... indecent proposal is awful.
