What a great casting and a pathetic attempt to film. The script is full of holes from start to finish. Uniform, not uniform ... totally ridiculous. One of the most talented / beautiful actors in the world (and I'm talking about Nastassja Kinsk) is here one of the most memorable lines. Worse still, she stains her hair halfway between the films, but it is obvious that she just wears a cheap black wig bought from a cheap queen costume store. The best moments will be given to the character's actress and his dog in the apartment house where actor Peter Coyote lives. The Fairuza Balk is poorly photographed to launch it. She looks like an overweight gateway who is too much an all-you-eat-student-cafe-snack. I was so expecting this movie. I wanted to like it, but I think I'd rather look at Nastassia to read her phonebook with her hair.
