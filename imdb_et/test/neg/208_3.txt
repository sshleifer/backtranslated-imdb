The film had those moments but was disappointing in my eyes. It was the reprocessing of Trespass (Walter Hill) and the treasure of Sierra Madre, with fewer tensions, bites and human emotions. There were some nice things to do there, but the story was slippery and there was no real depth. I watched the film for Mr. Reno and Mr. Fishburn, neither were they inspired and had little to say or to leave their skin. This movie has been made dead in the past and does not have to be done, eating money that could be used for better films. It was little for the action film and the thriller didn't burn. Better than snow falling, but not for me.
