In general, it's a pretty bad movie. But $ 5 in PathMark wasn't all the waste. <br /> <br /> The whole scenario is related to a man who is a lady who has been infected with snakes, allegedly a magic curse. Actors / actors are not big names (although some look like TV shows), so I'm not doing my usual Troy McClure thing. <br /> <br /> After a while, the film will be of interest to the couple jumping on the train and going to LA to see the shaman to take the curse back. There's another plot here too; like two female smuggling. <br /> <br /> But in the last 20 minutes, it turns out to be let down. As the whole movie is violent and spooky, the final is just animated with a computer. <br /> <br /> I saw an invaluable version with tons of language, gore, blood, violence, everything! Bonus features were OK. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: D-
