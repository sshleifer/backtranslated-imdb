This film begins with a man who seems to be some kind of sportsman. He meets a force that includes an arrogant boss, an obvious idiot, a fat boy who never speaks, and a woman who spins between the three. The group, called the angels of Satan, wants the leader, the leader, to be their personal leader. He says no, but then says yes, after the authorities make him a spy to control them. They ridiculously grab a gun shop from the missing scene. The scene includes a woman entering a shop with long hair in her neck and large round glasses. He says he wants protection and wants the shopkeeper to load the gun to show him how. Then he takes it from the shopkeeper and lets him. The other three gangs (except Rod) run to the store. They take everything off the walls and then play with them like kids who get their toys on Christmas Day. <br /> <br /> This movie will certainly not waste valuable time on the plot.
