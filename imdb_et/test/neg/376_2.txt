This is the biggest example I think to prove the theory that if Hollywood has a good idea, they will make a terrible sequel and destroy the first. Now don't get me wrong, I love the first Beastmaster; I even liked the third, but this movie is cruel. I am a huge fan of fantasy / sword and witchcraft and I hated to see such a classic as the first Beastmaster. Why do I hate this movie so much? Well, where do I start? First, the whole idea of ​​the film is ridiculous. Dar and his evil older brother Arklon (who wasn't mentioned in the first movie.)? I see that Earth is just as parallel to the alternate plane as the Dar world. If, in the first film, you think the film is in the past, but what you see is a completely different world ... it's just one of the many things I hated about it. It didn't work with "Universe Masters" and it certainly doesn't work here! Such films should take place and remain within your schedule and your usual surroundings. For Christ, what's next? Hercules in New York ... er, uh..bad example! Moving on ... <br /> <br /> Arklon after the device is called a neutron detonator to use its kingdom to threaten its enemies. So, this is Dar, his ferrets, an eagle and his tiger (not this time sprayed with paint) to save the world ... but by the way they are young, cool, and hip daughter of senator who is in the mess he reaches out and shows that he is around LA, takes him to his BMW and helps him out of it and out of tight situations. How convenient is it? And when you talked about comfort, I found that Arklon was terribly comfortable and easy to get into a highly guarded military base and get away with a stolen, highly destructive nuclear weapon ... even half the US Army and L.A.P.D. After Him .... waaaaay easy, even evil barbarian witch from another world. There's so much land that I don't know where to start; Why at the end of the Arklon movie was L.A. to the zoo?!? He has no reason to go there; and wouldn't it be like the last place to attract your biggest enemy, just like you have the ability to control animals? <br /> <br /> And don't you just love movies where the police are all idiots, and even if one and a half policemen unleash one man, they can't beat him? The police of this movie belong to the "Police Academy" series! They are just as useful in this movie that reading glasses are for the blind! Even the title of the movie doesn't make sense: "Beastmaster 2: through the portal" they never went through the "portal" portal, because the film is not set for the future of Dari world, it is a parallel world at our astral level, so they never go through time, only the world with its dimensions; so NO TRAVELING TIME! This movie is trying to come funny and it's not ... not because of humor, but because it's just so bad ... and it's easy. Functioning, dialogues, plots, characters and end are as fun as fun. What else can I expect from this guy who brought us "Swampthing's return" (another bad sequel)? Don Coscarelli's wonderful leader and serious feeling of the first !! Avoid stinking rubbish like a bubble herb and paste what is first and possibly third if T.V has nothing better.
