Yes, yes. Destruction and killing of the Norwegian language takes two big books and concepts that would work well for the film - this film is indeed the slowest Swedish film. I hated it so badly that I even thought about what I never did. But it was so terrible that I was almost convincing. I just had to sit down. Like some of the early 80's Stallone's action roll, it really takes Swedish action back to the Stone Age. So full of logical mistakes and foolish mistakes that it is almost amusing - but who can ever see good dreadful action, Mark Hamill's surviving mining field or buggy, useless and irrational activity? <br /> <br /> Allow me to ask you: are we going through a zero clock from whom the hero escapes from time and two friends are finally becoming enemies? STUPID !!!! <br /> <br /> And another thing: this movie's product placement is incredible. Other countries have realized that this should not be so good that the Swedish film industry has probably not understood at all: just look at the credit card that Hamilton uses to open the window? Or or ... this film makes me crazy.
