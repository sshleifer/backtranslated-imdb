Lonely, a divorced, middle-class housewife in the midst of divorce, is looking for comfort in her near future thinking. At bed and breakfast (well, literally at sea) there is an ocean that has some odd reason for its owner. Enter lonely, arrogant Richard Gere. He's a plastic surgeon. She is the only guesthouse on the sea. Diane Lane is a lonely housewife. You don't think these two will fall in love immediately. Tropical storm makes them real lovers. <br /> <br /> This melodram subfields make little or no sense. Locations, photography is fine. Gere is still a cinema among the most overrated players and does not disappoint. Mrs Lane needs the money, but the phones are her gracious.
