This film serves its 3 evil letters, bad technical qualities and consistency problems. Some people have given this movie 10 - and maybe it's okay if you just appreciate it from your fun factor. Technically, it is a series of unsuccessful films from start to finish - produced by 3rd-class writers, actors and the team. This was true for almost all series, as they were intended for small entertainments that are aimed primarily at children. And there's nothing wrong with that, but it's not "high art"! Compared to other serials, Spy Smasher earns a lower than average score because it is even lower quality and has major consistency issues - even serial. It was common for the series to have a "cliff" - ie at the end of an episode that looked like a good boy dies, but strangely survives at the beginning of the next episode. BUT, this movie is hockey and ridiculous. You would literally see that the hero dies in the last episode, but next they shot the scene again and showed that he did not die (although they clearly showed him that he was buying a farm)! He dies again and again in SPY SMASHER, but in the next episode they show it from other corners and he somehow avoided death - even if he fell to 1500 feet, he fell into the buzz or whatever. > <br /> Watch this movie not for its quality, but to laugh or learn what was going to go to the movies decades ago on Saturday morning.
