B. Kennedy tried to make a sequel, exaggerating and amplifying the gigantic left west (not both the left and the sequel of G. Kennedy that came after it). <br /> <br /> This is the toughest movie the two sequels are very ugly. It's slapdash. B. Kennedy made it more powerful, but without genius. Hundreds of peonies, hundreds of Mexican _computers, hundreds of women, desert, fruitless landscapes, the biggest scale race. <br /> <br /> All this clumsy order that is only pleasant in a strange way is fake <br /> <br /> The film itself is very ugly. Brynner, who made the best part of the first film, doesn't see it at all. <br /> <br /> Rey plays the priest; he is a political leader, Quintero, franchise in the next stage. <br /> <br /> It's true that if you have so many characters, you may not have a very interesting story; sometimes. For example, Brynner meets McQueen; then they choose other "compressors"; or B. Spencer meets Coburn; etc. It's fun to see where and how they meet the rest of the team, and so on. But you need at least these characters. Unfortunately, the contribution of Burt Kennedy in this respect is not very good. Seven returns (1966) begin with bullfighting. Vin and Chris meet there; They decide to rescue the third survivor of the original Magnificents Chico, who belongs to a huge group of 300 peons kidnapped by Mexican bandits. We find Chico's tempting wife named Petra. Chris must rebuild a small army and here we have a dirty decade Chris chooses from convicted offenders. Another team member is a woman who takes care of spouses without spouses. Sexual humor is particularly bad and terrible in this film. He's trying to look smart and spicy; it is just outrageous and stupid and harsh. <br /> <br /> Selecting a small army was one of the greatest joy of McQueen. Unfortunately, the top three are the top three teams that have been put together under excellent seven names. <br /> <br /> Robert Fuller makes evil "Vin", Oates is a laughing woman. In this gigantic experiment, the Mexican revolutionary leader has a huge plan, he robs 300 peons and uses them to build a village and a church in memory of his missing sons. (It is useless to say that this crazy Mexican revolutionary is not equal to the part of Wallach in the first film.) B. Kennedy only contributes to the camp and top things: ugly landscapes, thunderstorms, huge lightning, desert. A huge battle between emancipated peons and the revolutionary vaquer. Of course, the seven returns (1966) completely abandoned the good idea of ​​McQueen's film. <br /> <br /> It is especially shocking that this sequel came quite quickly after the original movie. a way to change the Western.
