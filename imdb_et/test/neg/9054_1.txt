One IMDb reviewer calls Eaten Alive a "cannibalist" satisfactory film. Are there such people? I did not know. But if you are one of them, hey, then the ball. The rest of you can swallow it a little hard (it is intended), even if you, like me, consider yourself a horror movie. I've been a terribly spooky fan for about 15 years, though I didn't get to the cannibal subgenus a couple of weeks ago, and I think I owe it strangely to their short-term interests in the odd way of China. full disregard of copyright laws. I saw that I bought a 20-yen (about $ 2.75) two-disc DVD collection of two Wesley Snips films, which turned out to be the last cannibal world, the cannibal God's Hill, to eat, the cannibal holocaust, next to Nicholas Cage and something called the Voodoo Lagoon , with Blade 1-3 in Chinese. Great. <br /> <br /> Being in the second order, I immediately felt drowned when the movie was opened with cannibal street dresses that traveled around large American cities, photographing unsuspecting Americans with venom darts and then mixing at full speed. Since the cannibals in the film are scary, it seems that they have now landed. Later, you may be shocked to find out that this man is "training". Lock your daughters! <br /> <br /> Before long, the film lives on the old lost sister's routine, as a young blonde woman named Sheila starts her research on the disappearance of her sister who doesn't see anything like her, but she's ready to spend most of the movie naked, so I think it's not important. It seemed that after taking one of our victims, we drove on the road and unlucky we met at an early age, not in the big city. <br /> <br /> A great police force will find a mysterious movie, showing Sheila's sister who was involved in some strange ritual behavior, but after the film, this man is a complete secret. Like the fucking police chief, "we don't know anything about him except he's dead!" Poor man, he has to get all this headache. I recommend sleeping. Fortunately, Sheila is such a girl who can throw away tens of thousands of dollars as she is not looking for her sister. It is perfect for renting a terrible back cartoon because the police are clearly not helpful. <br /> <br /> Of course, nothing new is added to this little sub-genre. On the contrary, cannibalism seems to be almost a background to a completely different bad film, to save a missing person from dangerous elements. The thickening of this washing line plot is not complicated, but to add comic people who follow a man who calls himself Jonas, who believes that pain is used in a way that connects people with nature, the process, call for cleansing. Personally, I prefer only occasional peeing. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite movies is when Sheila is caught by a single cult member - an overweight man who looks like he took a three-day weekend from the office in this movie. If he pulls his trusted medical kit to give him an injection, he warns him, "If you don't believe in Jonas and cleanse (through pain), God will help you." He then gives him a picture and if he wins a small pinch, he apologizes politely. I know the real believer this man! in life, so I think the movie's name lives there. Action is amazingly bad, as you might expect, and it is also interesting that editing is also remarkable, but still weird. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think you need to be able to communicate with people who believe in a totally crazy cult to interact with someone's movie. There are many extreme religious ceremonies that make it increasingly difficult to understand why Sheila's sister decided to return to normal society. I'm all for individualism and doing things, but come in. After a while, the film goes even further away from its mainstream workflow before we see Glory, Glory Hallelujah's most wildly inappropriate rendition in the film's history. WOW. <br /> <br /> Note: In this movie, a woman is raped by a broken snake. If you have no reason to ever look at it, look for professional help. Avoid this confusion at all costs.
