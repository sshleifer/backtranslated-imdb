I saw this movie VHS some time ago (January 27, 2003), thanks to Paul Rudd's name. I liked his performance in "My Object of Love" very much and I really look forward to a good job. But I found the complete confusion of this movie. The story is very confused and the characters are not well developed. In addition, special effects with a low budget do not help much. I don't know the previous generation of Gen-Y Cops, but this next generation is not good. I don't remember exactly why I gave this class (and I'm not going to see this movie again), but my voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Gen-Y Cops A Nova Geração '(` Gen-Y Cops Next Generation')
