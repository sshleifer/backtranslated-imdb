Al Pacino was once an actor who was able to play a role without being constantly exploited. In other words, if he could act, he didn't have to talk like a street junkie. McConaughey must have impressed Pacino because he also became an F-word promoter. It may be a society in which they actually live, but most of us have a common determination to see what we say in a mixed company. I don't remember the exact words the professor used to explain the constant use of torture, but that was something. "It shows a lack of intelligence, poor language skills and disrespect for all those who have to listen." Perhaps it is time for Al to take some action courses again to sharpen their talent. Oh yes, the film ... Probably the worse thing McConaughey has played. Hopefully, her next role will be in the talented people's company. Rene Russo was always hot.
