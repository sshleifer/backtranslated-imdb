Starting from where the last AVP came out, the Predator's spacecraft, the Predator, will appear as an alien "chestburster" and will cause the Predator spaceship to collide with today's Gunnison Colorado, where it will pull many more aliens who are about to destroy. The Predator Competition sends an individual to a very experienced and armed Predator to "cleanse the mess". Our human characters have been caught in the midst of an intergalactic battle. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie is pace. This movie is moving too fast. Opening credits are still rolled and the Predator ship is already falling on Earth after the alien grows completely, the hunter and son are introduced to the character, but before we even know their names, both are killed, we see the Predator Home World and the leader Predator flying against the alien's infection, and it all happens in the first five minutes. This unnatural pace does not allow the entire film to be; The national guard arrives in the city, but within two minutes everyone is killed without seeing each other's sight, the pizza store manager can only develop the character of the scene if he is killed the next time we see him once without learning his name, accidental deaths hobbies, cafe waiters, and cook again without learning their names. At one point, our main characters are at home, the next running city, the second in the arms shop, the next in APC, and the random amount that jumps over and over does not allow the audience to miss the time to grab them. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the settings and schedule. The film is set in today's Gunnison Colorado. Every other alien and Predator movie was filmed in tempting devices like industrial space ships, rainforest zone rainforests, alien planets and underground labyrinths. Now comes the AVP-R, which is housed in a small contemporary American town with "highlights" including a sports shop, parking spaces, pizza shops and a small girls' bedroom. I was wondering if they were actually trying to see the movie in the darkest, drab and uninteresting? It is difficult for these monsters to be perceived as frightening creatures when they stand next to the Reebox shelf or hide the bushes outside the girls' bedrooms. <br /> <br /> Consistency is a big problem with this movie. A series of aliens was created in the future, no one was even alien before the first film, and foreigners had never been on Earth, but once they reached Earth, humanity was destroyed. This film destroys the whole concept of modern setting, where the average Joes see foreigners all over the place, and at the end of the movie, humanity is not destroyed, even without suffering what could be considered smaller losses. It pisses the whole concept of this movie. Attempts to maintain consistency are made with the massive Deus Ex Machina. The Predator just happens to wear a bottle of unlimited magical blue liquid that just melts all the single drops, the army at the end of the movie just goes too drastic and drops a nuclear explosive that simply comfortably deletes all evidence of aliens, despite the fact that there were many accidents who are witnesses, and many more bad attempts have been made when it is impossible to fill the plot holes. <br /> <br /> "The Verses" movie, this is an unreliable bias for the Predators. For most movies, a single Predator manages to kill dozens, if not dozens of aliens, all within the mêlée, barely one of zero, while aliens are killed to the left and center like clay pigeons, but wait to turn Predator killed without trying to kill defend yourself. This movie should not be called "Alien vs Predator" as far as it should be "Predator massacres Aliens". I mean, how can you have tension and tension in two types of struggle when depicted in a larger scale than others? <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are one of the biggest mistakes. Not only are they pale compared to previous foreigners and Predator movie characters, but even as an independent film, they are blissful, tough, and sometimes worthy. The characters in this movie are made up of my child you don't want, horny couples wanting to shoot, pizza delivery boys, blonde bimbos, high school bully, kids and dirty copying and pasting work on Ripley and Newt; worst and most cliché signs. Not only that, but all the above-mentioned characters behave as teenagers. While teenage casting is an obvious attempt to attract younger people, its only effect is the appearance of the film and the feeling of being a typical teenybopper film, where the participants who are too young to learn convincing results have mostly empty facial expressions that give a monotonous dialogue. Not only this, but these characters are doing some kinematically slowed things, for example using Predator weapons, commenting on abilities, if it has been for hours, after getting stupid to get out of town, not just getting out of town quickly and just so many other idiots what the movie had to disappoint in my theater. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is just a terrible B movie that deserves a direct DVD category. The fact that this film was a theatrical edition amazes me, because every part of the film is only part of an amateur work.
