Before "Imet 34th Street", Maureen O'Hara and John Payne did it, this, this movie. I was going to describe it, but I can't find words about the bad thing about this movie. The issue of receiving a child and Maureen's disease is both very serious and sensitive, but it could have been done much better than it was. It was so extreme in his imagination that it wasn't real at all. Probably this problem started with a weak script. <br /> <br /> Another example of a scriptwriter who takes a novel and writes a weak movie. (See my review of "A Stranger in My Arms.") The beautiful O'Hara was often blended with such clunkers, the other being a banned street (Britannica Mews), which I finally look at. <br /> <br /> If you have emotional ties to this from childhood, then this is a rather inanimate, colorless and weak film. But something like this, maybe you can find your TV movie remake. It must be better. It must be.
