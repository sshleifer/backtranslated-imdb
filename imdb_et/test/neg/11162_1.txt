Love TPBs, but it was a flat episode. It was not the same to feel that the series or film is. It seemed that it was rushed. I didn't enjoy it at all. The so-called actor was terrible. The cast seemed as though they knew it was an episode of grabbing money to quickly enter the market. I hope we don't have a special Easter yet because it's for me. Writing this episode was definitely the worst in Mike Clattenburg's history. The direction was much to be desired and I felt that this weak test at Christmas was wrong and bad for the team. As I said, I love TPBs, but it goes to the trash.
