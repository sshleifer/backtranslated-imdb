I liked this move when I was a kid, but now, when I'm older, I see how absurd the plot really is. If you have not read the previous comments, then it is a teenage and air force colonel who steals two full F-16s to save a teenage father. <br /> <br /> It has some nice air strikes, even if the accompanying dialog is basically a teckno babel. <br /> <br /> Some unintended humor in the edited version of TV. If the hero's father is in Iran, then I'm talking about an unnamed country and his prisoners ask him for a confession (about why he's been stuck, don't worry exactly why or what they want to confuse.) He says, "Tell him he's can take my testimony and pull it down. " But his lips and the more admirable explains what movement and part of the anatomy he really meant.
