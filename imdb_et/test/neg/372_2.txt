I did it for about 8 minutes as "Steel Frontier" before I turned it off. Then I looked at the punishment that I was, the next day a little more. Today I had to dress the ironwork, so I decided to finish the movie and it was his own punishment. Here's what I don't understand: Robert Rodriguez and Shane Carruth spent $ 7,000 on their debut features and created two remarkable films. But here we have two directors with undoubtedly more money, and they are dragging out a big, steaming mess. Let me see if I can understand the logic: "It's a Road Warrior, but it's like a future West. We get the cheapest" actors "we find, we have a crazy challenge cousin to write a script and we spend a budget on a series of explosions We can't lose! "<br /> <br /> Seriously. I don't think even MST3K guys could fix it. But if you look at it, I would recommend a very drunk first.
