Crash is burned, over-thoughtful, and burned. An excellent example of how to make a bouncy message and a movie of its own. Haggis tries too hard to make his point and crosses almost every movie category. It is very in love with a sense of social importance and has a surprising whole skull. Of course, racial relationships affect everyone and there is a lot of ambiguity on this issue, but the Crashi universe is acting to assume we are all victims of our own competition. It is a tiring thread that repeats the ad museum and carries it in the first 30 minutes. I found that the results of the characters were surprising and forced, and the film was taken out forever and died. The fact that this film is the IMDb's 50 best films is testimony to the public's willingness to receive the Hollywood Malware. <br /> <br /> Indeed, if you want a real "Crash", check out one of David Cronenberg's dark, twisted and original. This film plays as preaching, tiring and masochistic.
