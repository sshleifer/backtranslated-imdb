go to your camcorder, to your little brother and to the neighboring disturbing neighbor who throws boiling water in the raccoons; and you got a movie! Well, these are the guys. it was so bad that I don't even remember most of it except the setbacks that are comparable to those of "Namis". Despite the real glorious name, terrible quality, terrible actors and clich√© writing, I think this movie is not the worst I've ever seen. I save this nest with everything from steven pigs, chuck norris and jean-claude van dam. anyway, if you are on the lookout for new "horror movies" that you haven't seen 1000 times (as I was) and you are discussing it, I would miss it. he had no redemption property. this nice thriller of serum killer was a weak, embarrassing attempt even on B-film. if they are really happy, it can make wal-mart $ 4.50 in the trash. but I doubt it.
