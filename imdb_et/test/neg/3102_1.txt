I saw this movie some time ago because some of my friends wanted to rent it and I voted down. I tried as well as I got to get the story because some moviemag had said it would be a movie that would be Rob Lowe was that Pulp Fiction was for John Travolta ... Well .. we all see that he not only failed but he fell down. It's actually the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies.
