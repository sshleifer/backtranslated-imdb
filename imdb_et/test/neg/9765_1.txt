What is disappointing. Forget this crippling movie and keep the TV series instead. What is on earth when they made the American president relatively reasonable? All politicians would have had to worship buffers (Peter Cook for British PM). There is no biting satire of the original, which goes for the "lowest common denominator". 1 out of 10 if I'm generous! Unfortunately, this is another example of a novelty that missed the original point, the difference being that both were written by the same people.
