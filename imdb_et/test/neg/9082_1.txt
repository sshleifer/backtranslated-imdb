It's hard to believe that there are some people in the world who think it's worth Charles Bronson's vehicle. <br /> <br /> Bronson is a good actor who can do more than a gun and hit bad guys. He stared quietly at the TV movie "Yes Virginia, There's Santa Claus" and showed Sean Penn-staged "The Indian Runner" a lot of class and style. <br /> <br /> In The Evil These Men Do, but Bronson plays again a character that sees injustice and puts it right into fists, knives and, of course, weapons. Wait, I'll take it back, this must be the most sadistic and repressively violent film that Bronson has ever abandoned. What did blue blue do here? !! I mean he won the Oscar, shouted loud !!! <br /> <br /> Okay, sorry for this outbreak. Let me just say "evil what men do" must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen based on a book. Yes that's right. I don't know if it's written with Bronson? <br /> <br /> No letters. Look instead of "Death Wish." IT was topical.
