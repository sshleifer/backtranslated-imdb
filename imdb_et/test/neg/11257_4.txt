I saw this movie last night in the city of Berlin as part of the competition. It was an invoice by the recipient of the film "World Premiere" (although it seems that people here have seen it before). I have to say that I still don't know what to do with the movie. I don't know this book, I bought the ticket just two hours earlier and I had only limited knowledge of the plot. It's not enough, as it seems, because I had problems getting into the movie. The film is sometimes told about the character of Jones, but it was somehow inappropriate for me. And I really can't say whether some of the laughs that the movie received were calculated or not. The cuts were steep and disturbing, the scenes seemed somehow beaten, and storytelling was not always sensible (even when the supernatural parts came out) - the actors were really good but couldn't save the film. It was entertaining, but sometimes only in the sense that I sat there thinking about the technical details of making a film and what went wrong with it. I still don't know what mood the director intended to get the movie. It was a strange light, dark and supernatural mixture. Unfortunately, it doesn't pull me at all and I looked at it with a technical eye. But thinking about what is wrong with watching a movie is the best sign that the film has failed. I'd definitely have waited for something other than those participants ... too bad!
