I didn't care much about that. If they had been released from comedy / slapstick and focused on the dramatic / philosophical aspects of the script, it could have been helpful. <br /> <br /> The more the movie went, the less I liked the main character / postman. He has interesting things to say, but he is also a hypocrite, insecure jerk. <br /> <br /> 3/10
