If movies where virtual reality characters start to live and they are all men, harsh or female eyes, it sounds good, maybe this film may not be the whole movie. Needless to say, the vast majority of people find this to be an absolute clean, little acting talent and even less script. Yes, Athena Massey is nice to look at, but this is the only positive thing I can say about this disaster.
