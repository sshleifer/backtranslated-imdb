I liked the Takashi Miike movies I saw so far, but I found it quite disappointing. I bought it, but I don't keep it. <br /> <br /> I saw it on an Adness DVD with only two episodes. In the first case, the killer robs the women, cuts off their skulls and lets the brain reveal, grows them up to the chin and raises the brain to the flower. This can be said from the DVD box. In the film, the static picture of the television is clouded digitally. If you hadn't seen a DVD box, the viewer did not know what people watched until the young young policeman was a small model of the body. Strangely enough, the woman's head also has a flash frame and is not censored. Besides, I'm not quite sure what's going on. Some women receive phone calls, and when that happens, it is a visual animated character. Sometimes an animated character appears on the TV screens. It is unclear whether anyone sees it. <br /> <br /> In the second episode, pregnant women find themselves open and their children are missing. Again, the policeman produces a model of the bodies that are useful because the actual body is actually censored. The film also has natural birth, but even this child and the umbilical cord are censored! According to the DVD box, uncensored versions were not retained when originally made. Maybe even if they had, if they knew they were censored, maybe they didn't really bother to show anything ...? Not sure. <br /> <br /> If I hear that later episodes are better, I'll find them. As it is, I don't bother.
