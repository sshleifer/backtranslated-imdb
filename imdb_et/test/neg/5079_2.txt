I went to see it because of the snip / stath, but frankly, chaos is terrible. There is nothing in this film that does not go - it shouldn't have been done. <br /> <br /> Do not read this review if you do not want to read the spoiler, because I'm going to have a lot of holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> First, the opening plan. This is a big big event that made two semiconductor characters (Statham and Snipes) difficult. But it's boring and boring. Only at the end will we be able to see what really happened and by the time you no longer care. Also the whole event where one bad boy and his hostage killing is barely a big news to fill hundreds of newspaper items, as mentioned in the movie. <br /> <br /> Then bank work - it's not t break earth. The bank robber makes some necessary references to the chaos theory (which by the way is not at all related to the whole story). The way that Statham is called is very embarrassing with revenge, but more boring. Then things in the bank are strange and meaningless. - What's in the safe. There seems to be a plot, but it doesn't. -Why go through the effort of two people if it brings something? It involves a lot of preparations and is not used at all! -Why does the head of SWAT not listen to the responsible officer when he tells them they are standing? <br /> <br /> And it's just the first 10 minutes. It worsens and worsens. <br /> <br /> -The whole romantic / love story (with "he wasn't just a better cop, he was a better man" note to finish it) is painful to watch. It's just pointless - Why Statham's character should mark the change in the camera's footage in the film material viewed from the bank. It essentially involves finding a virus that gives it all the money. -Why go through the forging of some sons and the difficulty of killing him, but then NOT killing this man who can identify you. <br /> <br /> I could go to age (really), but it's like this movie is ... pointless. The whole script is confusing. Smart references to chaos theory are really ridiculous and quite pathetic. The plot shifts can be seen miles away, and the signs appear to be errors all the time. It really hurts to look at a movie where the audience is taken for granted by the foolish people that the director hopes they will not see all the holes in the plot and the ridiculous script. The final "clarification state" adds only insult. It's really not a good movie. In some way. <br /> <br /> People who come to watch a movie won't get what they're coming from. People who come to the police movie won't get it. People who come to the smart thriller won't get it. In essence, everyone gets the same - great disappointment and waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and skip it.
