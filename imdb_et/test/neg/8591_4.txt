Beautiful pictures, propaganda and history as a toy. The components of this film are good, interesting, but with many shadows. Political shadows. Jefferson is more than a mythical American hero. He is a vision of life and society, an extraordinary thinker, a great part of a North American teacher. There's only Superman in the movie. The delicate contour of ideas is broken. The subtle childbirth of essential truth is forgotten. And Jefferson is the basic tool for creating a good reputation for American reality. The end, triumph and fake, romance and heroic, is a weapon suicide story that can be higher and more wisdom. And the "Avatar" war is another gray color. One who has heard nothing about Jefferson is a good start. For others - disappointing. It's like silk worthy of tailoring. But the tailor is silk and the clothes are just ordinary cloths. So, sad experience. Slices of beauty and boring lakes, patriotic lesson and expectation. A film that is impressive. And the story of the ashes that could be great.
