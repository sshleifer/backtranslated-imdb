Why, oh, why this garbage is considered classic? I've seen Simpson's episodes have a higher body. Practically nothing is happening in this film and much of it is filled with an almost intolerable melodrama, which is explicitly mentioned in a small tenancy. <br /> <br /> The Trenton family goes through difficult times and when the father is away and the little boy goes to fix the car. But when they reach the ranch, they discover that the guard dog has gone mad. The rest of the movie is just for those who sit in the car while slobbering at St. Bernard circulates them over and over again. <br /> <br /> With a child, I've never seen a more annoying child in my life in my life. And apparently he is completely arryan because blonde hair and blue eyes on kids, like Kinder's chocolate packaging, are probably more sympathetic than brown eyes and dark-haired people like me. Everything he does is cry and plywood. The same goes for mommy. She gets out of the car, she gets in the car, she gets out of the car, she gets in the car. <br /> <br /> I know it was made in 1983, but I just got sick of the death films, where the characters make foolish, illogical decisions. If Mommy just used some common sense, she would be able to get away from the dog. <br /> <br /> It's very badly written and has zero voltages. If you want to see a good "bad dog" movie, check out John Lafia's best friend. It's funny, inventive, has a better dog, a higher body count and more engaging story. Leave this garbage.
