ALL GUN CAN PLAY (2 of 5 Stars) Totally routine "Spaghetti West", starring "Kookie" "77 Sunset Strip". The plot has some stolen gold coins and the murder of various armed weapons with suspicious motivations. This is one of those "light" westerns that means a lot of troubled experiments in "comedy" ... and some real frightening music during most of the action phases (you don't know it's not Ennio Morricone's work). George Hilton plays the ledger "Stranger" ... but he doesn't leave much impression ... he's just not the style of Clint Eastwood or Franco Nero who can do a lot of sparsely-written character. The end is the perfect respect for the ending of the "Good, the Bad and the Ugly" ... although it is hardly fun that it is considered a "parody". Highlighting the movie is the first 5 minutes ... characterizing actors by Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and others (should he be Eli Wallach? Franco Nero? Not very clear ...) facing Stranger. It's fun for fans of Sergio Leone fans and western spaghetti fans ... but I think no one else would see that point.
