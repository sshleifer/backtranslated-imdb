It started as a good sketch of comedy. The first few exhibitions were very good and I waited a long time. What was really funny was the Mariah Carey imitation and the Beverly Hills 90210 haircut competition. Delta Burke vs William Conrad heavyweight battle was also good. Unfortunately, the following exhibitions went relatively quickly. Writing changed uninspired and so predictable as this exhibition would have acquired a culture that followed a young term. Something fresh was not offered and the repeated sketches were boring. One example is the family of weapons (or whatever it was called) that became a weekly function. This sketch was not all funny to say that it was a normal function. An example of a quick promising start and a sharp drop.
