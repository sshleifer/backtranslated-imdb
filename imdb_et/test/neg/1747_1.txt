Though the actor was great, I spent the whole movie on a nasty son who caused so many symbols for so many characters, got my final genius and instead suffered all the others except him and he gets the work of his spouse whose death he causes while his friends are absent , wins the girl she gave overdose and tried to rape. Even his friend gives money to his father, but the butterfly effect cannot fully return. <br /> <br /> This is a very dark film because every affected character will ever suffer from endless depression. None of the normal remedies seems to be effective and the only thing the authorities seem to be giving out is the amount of stress pills. <br /> <br /> If this is normal behavior in Finland, I will never go back if I have such an immoral butterfly and it will be destroyed when the characters in this movie were.
