This movie is almost a waste of time. I study the English A-level book and the film only contributes in one way, and it is changing that the whole scenario is set for the rural idyll. Acting is wood, filmography is ridiculous, and so-called dramatic scenes on film were most of my class (including myself) texts. The book, though not my favorite choice of literature, is miles better than film, and the sound is just irritating. Don't look at this movie if you are looking for a timeless, high-quality story that has become a waste of media.
