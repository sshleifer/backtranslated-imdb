I went through this terrible movie for almost ninety minutes, waiting for some dance or spirit or inspiration or something and gave up! What was the filmmakers doing? This is an old talent with a limited talent who is obsessed with himself and nothing else. Fill the story without a point, we get some things about other people who are in his time, his help to the burros and of course his ten cats! Don't look at this movie. And nobody has anything to do with someone who loved it - they have no idea. There are exciting people in this world who have wonderful stories to tell and share - but Marta Becket is not one of them. The people I picked up for this movie say they have forgiven me - but that they never stop me joking about it.
