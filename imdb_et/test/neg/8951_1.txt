Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows in the last 10 years. The James 'Jimmy' Trivette Handbook, Walker's Sidekick, is about as miserably written as Wesley Crusher in Star Trek TNG and is played with about the same number of convictions. <br /> <br /> Do not react to how people react in real life - all polarized - everything is either a good boy or a totally bad guy (if Walker doesn't have a 2-minute conversation with them and then they will change right away). It's not how life works, it's not how people are. This exhibition does not take place in such a reality. <br /> <br /> The plot lines are about as realistic as the Murder She Wrote, which shows that a lofty old woman can just walk into people's houses without being angry and she may require police officers to do what she wants, and he bends him upside down. With Walker, all participants in the exhibition, including "bad guys", behave like a hero made of myths and fairy tales, and the time is self-defeating. The lines that have come out of the mouth of this exhibition are ridiculous. Just like the part of Wesley Crusher (ie for "serious" parts) and Bob Saget's more fun video scriptwriter (for "humor" parts), all the scripts from this show joined and wrote. > <br /> This show is for people who think good is always evil. It is for the elderly. It is for those who want it. It is for people who want to have a happy ending. It's for people who want to forget. It is for people whose choice is on their television. <br /> <br /> I miss every time I see a commercial for this show. In my opinion, the worst show in television has been in the last ten years. <br /> <br /> I liked Chuck Norris, but this exhibition has forever disproved him. I can't even watch my older movies without showing it.
