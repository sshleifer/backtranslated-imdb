I know that the original Psycho was classic and remake was a mistake. I think the rest of the remarks have more or less proved here. But there is a lot more to this movie than just that. <br /> <br /> The first problem is color. The original film was filmed in black and white, but few people realize that the original was photographed after a color film was invented. The choice of black and white film was partly a budget problem, but it was also a stylish choice for Hitchcock. Now it doesn't mean that the remake should have been black and white, but the colors of this movie are too wrong. The film's most dominant colors are orange and green, especially on Marion, who doesn't have to be glowing. Vivid colors make this a beautiful movie, and if these color schemes happen terribly, it looks like a cartoon more than anything and the audience tends to laugh rather than smile. <br /> <br /> Another problem is lighting. This is a dark dark story that should be highlighted in low light, but this remake seemed not just a failure but it seemed to be going towards OPPOSITE. Most scenes are brightly lit even when it's illogical because it's at night! <br /> <br /> Another obvious problem is Vince Vaughni's performance. Yes, he pulls Norman Bate's inconvenience and madness quite well, I don't deny it. But there is one element to the character that he didn't show: softness. At least in the beginning, the character should have some kind of deceptive friendliness, which then disappears when we understand the truth about him. In addition to being a feature of Norman Bates, it is all a recognized feature of PSYCHOPATES !!!! <br /> <br /> There are some good aspects to this movie. Some shows are great. As I said, Vince Vaughn came very close to drawing Norman Bates's proper depiction. Viggo Mortensen and Juliane Moore were great together and their chemistry was very different from the original characters, which was a welcome change. Anne Heche might have been frightening, but unlike Janet Leigh, who was wrongly advertised as one of the biggest stars in the film, Anne Heche was given the last credit card credit. <br /> <br /> I read a copy of Psycho's novel, which Gus Van Sant claimed was not a remake of the Hitchcock movie, but a new custom of the original novel. Now I want to have bought and commented on this book because after this movie, this comment is probably the most fun thing I've ever seen. In this film, it was not attempted to hide that it was a hanging of the original, and it would be much more plausible if Van Sant had tried to tell us that he was really a three-ton monkey from the planet Zafroomulax. So many shots were copied exactly without real reason why Hitchcock had made the original picture in this way. Like a scene where Sam and Lila speak, while their faces are completely hidden. Hitchcock covered these actors' faces in the shade because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their face so no one could see their terrible performances for any artistic or stylistic purpose. <br /> <br /> In other words, my review is about as meaningless as the film itself, because it repeats something that has already been said. Like everyone else here, I suggest that you don't waste your time with this movie and get the original.
