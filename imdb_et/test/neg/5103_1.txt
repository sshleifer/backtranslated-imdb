The film itself is only a set of scenes that have no intrinsic meaning to anyone living outside of Russia. I do not deny that some images and techniques were quite revolutionary at that time (filmed in 1928), but the problem with the film is that it does not interest intellectual or ordinary people. We only look at the organized images that extend from one hand that strikes the horse until it engulfs a soldier in war. All in the meantime is inconvenient, casual, and quite unnecessary. It would have been possible to invent a forum that keeps the viewer interesting, but that would not be the case, although the director's method is quite brilliant. <br /> <br /> First of all, you should look at it as an art of hallucinogenic drugs or before a pre-Preevian cinema student.
