I just looked at the National Lampon Christmas Holiday 2 DVD, hoping to see something at least close to the original, great holiday holiday "Christmas Holiday". I didn't see anything like that. You can say right from the start that this movie didn't think. It is too bad that it has a title that links it to the original Christmas. It's really sad. The film cannot stand on its own. I think too many people look at the strength of the movie title and it doesn't come close to that comedy level. After the title, the film is very little connected to the original "Christmas Holiday" and even less to Christmas. Comedy is very simple and the plot is poor. Children can find humor here, but most adults here and there are just ridiculous. This movie is a flop. Don't waste your time with it.
