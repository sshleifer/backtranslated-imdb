OK see that this show is the worst show nick @ night. I love so many exhibitions on nick @ night and I love them. When this show came nick @ night, I was so annoyed. It's such a boring show and it's horny. Of all the times I looked, I found one episode a little funny. There are never the most unpleasant and stupid jokes at this show. It shows terrible things. Give fresh Bel Airs Prince and George Lopez. This exhibition is boring and not less clever. This show should have been canceled much earlier. I don't think it deserves to be a nick @ night with some great classic shows. This exhibition lacks wisdom, good jokes and style.
