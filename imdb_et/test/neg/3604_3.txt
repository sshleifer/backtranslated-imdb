I really liked the movie "The Emporer New Groove," but looking at it was like coming home and having a woman with a lama. Seriously, this movie was bad. It's like Club Dread after Super Troopers. I have to write 10 lines, but I don't even know what else to say. I laughed a few times, but only because I watered. Such a movie should be at least as funny as your drunk. It wasn't. Maybe smiles are just funny and normal cartoons aren't. If you want a funny, comic, lama-themed movie, then just with Emporer's new Groove. Line 10 is this line here.
