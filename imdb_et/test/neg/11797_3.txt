Of course, someone looked at the "Blair Witch" wave. <br /> <br /> This movie was created as all the "reality" haunting exhibitions that have recently opened on television (and I must admit to get out of them), but this movie is another cheesier! Probably the first three quarters of the film are full of "participants" who go through the house, WHINING. Leave me alone! Spending 10 minutes in the attic is not my good idea. All paranormal events are blatant settings. There are no strings, but caught too well to be real. "Participants" were not very pleasant either. Two bachelors who don't take it seriously, one girl who scares the drops of the hat, and the main overpowered "paranormal" person. Will it become a clich√© of the ghost film? <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the last 15 minutes were pure tensions. They took the tension of every sleep in the movie and stuck in 15 minutes. I testify that I spent that timing in the kitchen. I really wouldn't want this movie for younger viewers even when it's PG13. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for some entertainment if you do not take it seriously, you will be thrown out of this movie. There are many situations to crack! If you are looking for a great story ... look elsewhere;)
