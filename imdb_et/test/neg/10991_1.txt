As other comments say, it may be surprising to those who have not seen the work of Jeunet & Caro or Emir Kusturica. But have you ever seen Delicatessen, there's nothing new in this movie. I thought Delicatessen was great when it came out, but this movie arrives too late to be interesting. I don't think this is a worse film than Delicatessen, but it's boring to see it now, as it would probably be to see Delicatessen again. The film really doesn't make any sense, something that really is or will remain with you. The Kusturica films may have a distant resemblance, but she is really in a different league, so you should rather watch your movies while wasting your time in Tuvalu.
