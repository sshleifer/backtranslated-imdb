In 1995, Barry Sonnenfeld directed a film that ended with a list of critics when printed a year ago in entertainment publications. The film was Get Shorty, and it gave John Travolt a second big hit for many years after putting Pulp Fiction back in front of the paparazzi lenses. Elmore Leonard's novel focused on the film for wise Chili Palmer (Travolta) and his efforts to get into the film. I, one, was completely detained for the various characters and crisp dialogue of the original. So much so that when I heard there was a sequel, I seemed to give up my usual trembling when the studio tries to reconsider what was a good idea in ten years. Next, based also on Leonard's novel, this time is led by F. Gary Gray, who was an Italian job in 2003, one of the biggest gross images of the year. A couple of things that have now expanded to Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Cedric's entertainer, Rock, Vince Vaugh, and James Woods, and you have all the great sequels of using the more interesting characters of the 1990s. This time we pick up when Chili (Travolta) leaves the film industry, being disappointed both by himself and the industry to participate in his successful first film. A small part thanks to his friend Tommy Athens (Woods) and the failure of his death, Chili decides to explore a lucrative and dangerous music industry. First of all, it leads to the famous Viper club where Chili meets with song lyrics Linda Moon (Christina Milian), who heads the trio, can strike out stories like Whitney Houston (ie Whitney, before Bobby Brown started small packages). sugar). Linda has signed with Raji (Vaughn), who intends to ensure that Linda will complete her contract for the last five years, even if it means bringing Chili to the ice, with her excessive gay bodyguard Elliot Wilhelm (The Rock). So, in terms of Linda's future balance, Chili is making an interesting web, including a record producer (Thurman), a gangsta sound mixer (Cedric), a Russian mob, a police, an Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler, and a whole series of angry weapons. Woo-Wheee! It sounds exciting. Why not? Be Cool is trying too well to be cool. But the result is a film that, unlike the original, is not heart and soul. Be Cool feels instead of being run by a Saturday Night Live producer because there are single scenes or sketches that don't share the whole movie. Take the scene where Travolta and Thurman dance for the first time after Pulp Fiction, as Black Eyed Peas lives in the background. The scene is forced and should reach the floor of the cutting room. Instead, it is connected to two other unnecessary chapters that do nothing to delay the story with a real push. Aerosmith's concert and The Rock's journey to the boot chamber are also the main examples of individual moments that have not been put together in a large number of films. However, these are not the only problems in the queue - which can probably be called product placement with the 2-way and diet-Pepsi number, which will make you look much sharper than Chili's serious look. The story contains almost every imaginable stereotype and everyone has enough time to get a little offensive or embarrassing. Whether it is a gangsta escort or a gel muscle, who has a poster on the wall of Sylvester Stallone's Rhinestone movie, there is no sign that offers us something we haven't seen many times before and in much better films. With the magic that has just gone to the first movie, we will get a worse product, the second film in the last six months (the second is the ocean 13) that will only spin the end of the stars onto the tent. a movie that no actress would open. Be Cool was a great disappointment. I wanted it to be the new millennium Get Shorty, and I came to a movie where the outflows must be gas, but the experience remained with me.
