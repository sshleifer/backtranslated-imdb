I would like to sit down and write a smart, thoughtful overview, but I feel I would spend more time writing than filmmakers. I live in Los Angeles and I am sorry to say that the characters seemed just as much as the underworkers and too much of the ego pumped ACTORS. The film had no moment when I could not escape the feeling that I was watching the glaring conversation of unemployed actors in a hipster LA cafe. One of the worst "indie" movies I ever so little recommend that winning Sundance actually lose any of the prior interest that I can go, much less considering the positive perception of Sundance. See at your own risk.
