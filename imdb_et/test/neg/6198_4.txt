The movie is nice Well photographed but no originality ... <br /> <br /> This movie is copied directly from Hitch, where Salman plays like Dr Dr like Will Smith, and Govinda like some fat jerk who is desperately in love With her boss to bring the film to an old Indian flim style, the bride's father does not like the bride's lover and gets another groom, and Govinda's bride's lover ends and saves her new groom and fancy dance and things. <br /> <br /> Comedy was really good, undoubtedly, if the hitch meets the price, it would be more funny ... <br /> <br /> Ultimately it is worth a look, but if the TV is in a few months ...
