Dumb is right: Tom and Jerry are reaching their goal to stop air transport to Africa, but then worry about getting mixed up with natives. They laid the surface on a "black surface", trying to survive on a floating plane in the ocean and then live on wild animals as they arrive on land. <br /> <br /> Having read some comments before seeing it, I knew what to expect. It was these two men who made the impressions of Amose and Andy / Stepin Fetchit. Dirty? Of course, but that's for you in the 1930s. Some of their lines were funny, some were stupid. The main mistake I had with this comic was sound because it was often not easy to understand what the two men said. <br /> <br /> Generally there is curiosity, but don't let racism stop you from controlling it. At least it gives you an idea of ​​how times have changed.
