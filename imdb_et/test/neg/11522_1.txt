Hired this tonic from my local video store. It was titled "Black Horizon". I think somebody felt that it was good enough for the 2004 reopening ... <br /> <br /> Micheal Dudikoff is still not a ninja in this movie, one of the main bugs in this movie right from the bat. Another big mistake would be that the scenes of Ice-t's action are stolen from other movies, especially the first scene of his rescue, which is directly from Wesley Snippes' The War of War, where Ice-T was delivered. this frame is paid for. <br /> <br /> The plot is terrible, the special effects were little tense for them (they love wires kept in space), the actor is wood (I also love these New York / Russian accents). Ice-T is meaningless in the movie. These men also forgot the fact that there is no difficulty in space, but I think they were not concerned about it. <br /> <br /> Micheal Dudikoff should go back to what he's doing "good" and doing the American ninja 6.
