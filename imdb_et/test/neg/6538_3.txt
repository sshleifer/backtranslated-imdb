I saw it in an independent cinema in my city - no surprise, because no mainstream theater wants its fingerprints to break this train. <br /> <br /> Camera operation is very disturbing. Continuous displacement, inversion, and zooming can cause a sensitive person to suffer from lack of movement. It looks like a film student rather than a serious film. <br /> <br /> Although this is a good thing, characters are unlikely. Josh is annoyed, always trying to manipulate situations and people to his advantage. Without any contexts, Emily and Josh, as a tiny, insecure girl, desires to marry. Rhett is an emotional child who is unable to understand human interaction. Without any redemptive qualities, I don't care about what happened to them. <br /> <br /> Probably some people liked this movie because the couple behind me smiled hysterically. Of course, they could just have fun. I couldn't blame them.
