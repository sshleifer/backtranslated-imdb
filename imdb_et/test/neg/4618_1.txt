** Some light spoilers may be considered, but no more than anyone in this movie review. it was a film of social criticism rather than a fire at the gym. Carrie White was "a victim", and her story led to the helplessness that she must truly exploit. Anyone who held "Rachel" character for "Rageni" must "Carrie." To be able to truly share the victim's rage, the audience must be a sympathetic character - a real emigration who is more a victim of circumstances than his own vices. Rachel is completely uncomfortable to convey the emotional depth and connection of Sissy Spacek's "Carrie". And she looks and acts like she should be right and the popular brigade that she comes to fire. He, like the rest, is a soul that is a bit corrupt, while Carrie was completely innocent. <br /> <br /> It just doesn't work. Not happy to see real children - not even a "Home Improvement" boy - to get off the film in the climate. And it is so unnecessary! The burning gym did not see the actual bloodshed! <br /> <br /> And especially, this movie shouldn't have any will to kill ... but I won't tell you who it is. If you have seen the original "Carrie", it is a kind of person who dies unfairly. <br /> <br /> At the very least, they make a connection with Carrie appropriately; it has been explained as it should. But this, and the hand tattoo that was done quite nicely, is almost the only thing this film has done for it. <br /> <br /> Another terrible "Scream" strikes and keeps one of the films on offer. Rating: 1 out of 10. I didn't expect much, but I was still very disappointed. Symptomatic character, a series of irritating pop culture references that have been thrown away without cause, and an end scene comparable to the "Carrie" tombstone shock.
