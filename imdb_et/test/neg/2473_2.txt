I can't believe I'm actually sitting through this movie! It was absolutely terrible and completely worthwhile, but I sat through it and thought it was going to get better. It wasn't and I've wasted 2 hours of my life. Will Smith is a lot better off in the movies - I loved her I, Robot, State and Independence Day enemy - and I don't think she can really assume that the whole movie as a romantic lead will be taken away by Cary Grant. Then the script was terribly awful and the dialogue was so fun. <br /> <br /> I didn't like everyone except Albert's character, and even what I found was done with a heavy hand. If you want to see a contemporary romantic comedy for a good feeling of yourself, look at something like losing a man in ten days or when Harry met Sally. The 40-year-old virgin stayed on my face with a smile. I even preferred music and lyrics over it - and yes, I know it's cheesy, but at least it didn't take itself seriously and was sweet. I also didn't like the main female leader - and she wasn't convinced of the chemistry between her and Will Smith's character. <br /> <br /> I think I had two scenes that I liked (and certainly not the end that was nausea and convincing!) - Hitch called Sarah if she hadn't given her a number, was pretty sweet and - No, sorry, this is the only thing I liked about the whole movie. Don't waste your time.
