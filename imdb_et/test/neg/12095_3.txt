Think "I Know All" The action hero illuminates a cigarette in the dark. While trying to hide / look for bad guys. (Obviously I'll give you a signal light here that I came) <br /> <br /> This is one of the 100 scenes you can laugh at. (I think the movie should be in the comedy category.) <br /> <br /> Amazing management, terrible script, poor performance, cheap special effects. (They used the tunnel to hide in the darkness there). <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (including looking at them as they look at the pathetic mistakes)
