Although I've been watching Salo, I don't know if the stool tastes sour. If this is the case, this "film" is exactly labeled. So many pastures, so little substance, it's the equivalent of celery cellulose, but it doesn't clean the palate. It leaves a waste of time in the mouth of the mind, and if I could vomit it and get it back, I would like it. Detention was more exciting. The director should be forced to wear dunce capi and Ed Woodi Jr. Waste of time, despair. ** Don't be overwhelmed by the tooth Dominique Swain: The competent eye-candy he had in Lolita's remake was less tragic and more economical than Sue Lyon, though in no way better. However, a prior art screw does not make it a skilled craftsman. To do this you need craft, not the crap that is this movie. The rollers are in the girls' bathroom, rinsed up until the breaking of the tubes, while the director / conductor Christina Wayne should be in 5-10. Look at something else and pass on this class forever!
