To get started, I'm not a person who would appreciate the movies I've never seen, or the person who appreciates movies 1 if they don't deserve it. This movie was really so bad. The basic piece was extremely formal, and although it wasn't great, the plot earned 5. The part that bothered me was swimming in the movie. I made a short list of things that are wrong about the swimming aspects of this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. No character. 2. Time doesn't know. 3. Completely inaccurate swimming scenes containing: a. The team of six swimmers goes for something called "citizen" and "regional", without mentioning how they qualify. b. This same team is going to hell it will meet without a real meeting at any point in the movie. c. The competition program goes back to high school from the high school and then to the club club. d. In the scene where Ellis interviews, banners show high school victory and placements for citizens, but the team consists of only 5 to 12 swimmers, whichever comes in. e. A team of 5 men and girls will compete with all citizens / regions. f. This girl wins men's 100 butterfly events. g. In this competition, the girl who won two teams from the team, who last year was in the top ten, said. h. The listener changes from 200 races to 100 busts back to 200 again in about 45 seconds. i. The final relay, the 4X100, which is swimming in a 50-meter course pool, shows one swimmer doing two turns. j. In the same relay the teams anchor the freaks of the swimmer and step out of the blocks, forcing the inspirational stick to talk about two and a half minutes or about 3 times as long as the foot meets a national caliber. k. The film starts in July or August, assuming Ellis was a candidate before the school year, and the pool was closed for 3 months, assuming that these things were true, swimmers went out to swim to the winning citizens / regional, in less than two, as the pool came and the kids didn't start practicing for a while. l. I'm sure there are a couple hundred more, I'm just trying to prevent them from my memory. 4. There is no time for swimmers throughout the film. 5. If you have a movie about swimming, it would be a good idea to hire to swim well. 6. A scene where a boy is underwater is physically impossible. <br /> <br /> I said all the swimming scenes were too slow, swimmers had a terrible technique, and the idea of ​​getting a national meeting in three months after learning to swim is just an insult to swimming everywhere. <br /> <br /> OK, if you still don't believe me, let me say that this movie is one of the five worst films I've ever seen, and it comes from a man owned by Gigli, Soul Plane, Manos : Fate, Skullduggery and any other collection that has been put on the film. Please don't go!
