If you are in the mood to laugh at a really bad movie (badly like Ken Russell only), you have to try it. It will make you feel like you just grounded in a .25 porn bus and you get almost no odor on the floor. Kathleen Turner pulls a blonde wig to get her bangs "pretending" to be a double whore (she really has a good job in the clothing industry and she has hurt her so badly that it's the only way she can connect), and Tony Perkins plays a hysterical "priest" who might kill him (another movie ending with Tony Perkins). Annie Potts shows up and can't give an ounce of her usual sense of reason to hate this movie. Kinky loves sex scenes, so rent out the RED version of RED so you can see Turner giving the police his billy club taste (I had to stop the VCR until we stopped laughing).
