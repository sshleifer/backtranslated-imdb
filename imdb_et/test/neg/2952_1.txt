Open the scene makes you feel like you're watching high school playing. But I've seen high school play better! Each line was delivered so obviously that I felt I was looking at the work of the actors instead of seeing the actors. I found that character development is poor and acting very forced! I found that 25 minutes of the movie, I really don't care about what happened anymore because the plot was too obvious and I was bored. I held it there, waiting for the film to redeem itself, but it didn't happen. Sister Theresa was sweetly sweet, even for a nun, but seemed impulsive and slightly manipulative. All in all, I was mighty disappointed.
