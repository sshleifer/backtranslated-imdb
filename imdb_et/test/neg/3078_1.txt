Another character study, the COMMITTED film, is just another relationship that is related to special decorations for the target audience of young people. The direction seems very common, the obvious dramatic irony and the lost loser classic case compared to the reluctance. APPROVED is occasionally observable and Lisa Krueger has a little sense of originality. <br /> <br /> EXPOSURE is completely unintended in the first 20 minutes. Introducing Jolini, but the movie will pick up when his wife disappears. Joline refuses to find her. <br /> <br /> Some parts are strange. Other times drags the movie. The other half is more humorous when we see that Joline's spiritual antics are intensifying. The pesky guitar music is terrible, but perhaps the evil that COMMITTED offers is very little. The middle film, which is hampered by some totally pointless moments, is the only property of COMMITTED Heather Graham and Patricia Velazquez.
