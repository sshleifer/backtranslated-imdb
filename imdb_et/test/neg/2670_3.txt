Avoid it! It's a terrible movie. What if it's very exciting? All this is just pointless murders. And the whole thing with the curse of Thorn and Michael was the absolute worst thing they could do to the series! Why couldn't they keep Michael's story secret? He should be Boogeyman, not part of a foolish cult !! Ugh! Thanks to God for the Halloween H20 that destroyed Halloween 3-6! They all suck! But still, when you see this movie, wait not only for meaningless murders and gore.
