Director Nico Mastorakis has made a cynical money handler (under his promise) that is too cynical to impress anyone but not the genre genre in general. <br /> <br /> The most extreme, facing genre of images that paraphrase VIDEODROME, "is philosophy"; it makes them dangerous. <br /> <br /> The word WORD philosophy is to throw many "shocking" elements into a cinematic mixture and mix slowly. The result is a tasteless but ugly-looking dish. <br /> <br /> Don't be confused with Serrador's brilliant WHO who could kill the child? (sometimes referred to as ISLAND OF DEATH), Mastorakis's aspirations are set on the Greek island, which is a stage in various forms of killing, with little creativity and some wholesale perversion. <br /> <br /> Everything moves at butterfly pace and violent sets are poorly controlled. <br /> <br /> This is "In a movie that censors didn't want you to see," I thought it was dangerous to think that the censors never saw it, they just read the press until their knees pulled up.
