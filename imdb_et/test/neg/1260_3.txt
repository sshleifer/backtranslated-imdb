It was a love story rather than an angel coming down to the earth, although both corners of this story are a good part of the film. <br /> <br /> When I took this movie to heart, if someone who knows and believes in the Bible, I would have preserved it quite quickly, but I don't think the general atmosphere was either enchanting or blasphemous. It was just ridiculous or just stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean, John Travolta, as a grubby angel? Smoking? Scratching his groin? Quoting to the Beatles? "Warring Angel" who doesn't know anything about Heaven? An angel flirting with all women? Yes, it is all absurd and certainly biblical. <br /> <br /> I can tolerate all this, but I don't know how many people, regardless of their beliefs, could be a boring film that turned out to be on the other side. It starts to drag when romance begins between William Hurt and Andie MacDowell. Some dialogues during this romance are so stupid that it offends any discriminating viewer. <br /> <br /> This is another Nora Efron-based film. Man, I can't believe how many incredibly stupid movies this woman has written or directed. At least he is consistent.
