Cavern: 2 out of 10: Blair Witch meets the cave and gives me a headache. <br /> <br /> I have something to ask all film schools if you could teach future managers how to keep the camera constantly. Beating the camera like a Bunt aunt with 12 drinks is a headache inducing. <br /> <br /> The film is also primarily a visual middle manager who may wish to direct his camera in the general direction of action. The film also requires light work. You might need to use a light source to see what's happening on the screen. I know it's a cave movie, but there's nothing terrifying to see the dark dirt at once. <br /> <br /> The thing that shows the movie upside down does not point to confusion on the screen, which shows confusion in the editing cabinet. <br /> <br /> Last Note to the Director I'm sure there was a good reason to have a terribly fake CGI campfire. I cannot honestly say that my life would be one. <br /> <br /> It is now a screenwriter. Try at least one character. I would prefer two or more but one decent person I can root or care for. Even if you have feedback, they are relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> If you have a surprise, it is probably best if it is not in conflict with every thing in front of it. And try to add some fancy conditions to the cave movie. Maybe you wanted to start playing a game. <br /> <br /> Cavern is a pretty bad film that has been poorly photographed with a confusing, improbable, and antimicrobial ending.
