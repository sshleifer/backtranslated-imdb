After the armed forces scene, I felt that the film was a celluloid residue. Robert Duvall, Kevin Costner, and Annette Bening could have played this dream. The dialogue was quite tolerable (and there was a lot - somebody sat quietly in this movie), the plot was over the map, because if they couldn't decide how many topics to capture the story, there was no fineness at all - the fortunes hit you and they took you through the nose of most of the story (I think they added all the dialogue to make sure nothing left), and editing really needed (each actor's screen time was more than quality - again too much dialogue.) <br /> < The whole story took place in a few days, but everything that happened took epic proportions, much like the everyday events you felt in high school, but it wasn't really important in the big picture. Yes, the bad guys beat and killed Mose, they beat Button, they killed the dog - everything that would have got Boss and Charley's blood. But all the "deep, meaningful" conversations that dominated most movies reduced the importance. These guys worked together for 10 years and they're talking about this thing right now? The only time there wasn't much dialogue was the armed forces scene - which I probably liked. <br /> <br /> Finally, someone gives Annette Bening a hairbrush! Her face is surrounded by rodent hair, which was (I think) to make her a little more romantic, she was a little open. If he were working outside the home, it would have made more sense. And why wasn't he already married? It seems that besides the citizen and his crowns, there were several "gentle and gentle" (his words) single men in the city. In fact, it seemed that no bad guys wanted him either (the usual plot device in other films). He stayed in the house in most times and seemed to have little contact with the city people. Makes it wonder ...... <br /> <br /> The film was too long, too dirty and too natural for me. It seemed like a letterhead that had a lot of time on the screen for the big stars, but not enough for the depth of the sign to interest me, despite all the dialogues.
