This film was a pure genius. John Waters is great. It's fun and I'm not sick even after I saw it about 20 times after I bought it a few months ago. The show is great, although Lake Rick could have been better. And Johnny Depp is great. He is such a beautiful man and a very talented actor. And seeing most of Johnny's movies, it's probably my favorite. I'll give it 9.5 / 10. Rent it today!
