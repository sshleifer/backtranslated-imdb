Of course, this movie was slowed down. But you waited for the moment you look at the cover box. This is the B-film and the R & D factor that this movie delivered. True, it was more fun than expected. Although it was not at all a comic genius such as "The Party Animal" or "Orgazmo", watching B-films was worth watching if you still had things of that kind. <br /> Christians and morally oriented parent groups are adult entertainment. If you do not want your children to look at sexual content and nudity, you must keep your children away from this movie.
