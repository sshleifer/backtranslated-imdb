Unobtrusive, ill-managed, and cruelly written, it's traceable if you have an hour or two to kill or suffer from insomnia, but just right. Robert Carlyle fully understands his potential as the highest mediocre actor, who has only one expression in his repertoire (a chronically constipated soccer bully who cares for a debilitating inferiority complex), which he sometimes places a silver yellow tooth on the burning of a few nostrils and next to a row (it shows anger, tenderness, grief, surprise, horror, fun, compassion, etc.). He is just as convincing as his neighbor's cat, his role as the "Best Marine Engineer in the UK" and as a university professor. Tom Courtenay, which is equally uneven, slippery, and every line, seems to be permanently enthusiastic in the eyes and no longer seems to be able to tell its urine bottle flood when it stops. All in all, Britain's second silly attempt to imitate Hollywood pulp most. Dialogue is a series of badly transmitted clich√©s; the activity is separated; the plot is meaningless and amputated; and characters, if you can name them, do not even do it in the basic two-dimensional sphere of your American counterparts.
