I saw this movie because of the strength of a positive review, and I can only imagine that this man is a shill. <br /> <br /> Female lead action is actually pretty good, but the whole movie is just so scary boring that I barely sit down. This is the concept of boredom. <br /> <br /> So far this movie has been rated 8 out of 10 out of 7. This must mean that the director, the girlfriend of the director, the producer, the actress and the drinking buddies have given their film 10. <br /> <br /> For the rest of you who just want to be entertaining or a good story, avoid it. <br /> <br /> This guy on the street gives him 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> FDA Note: Although this movie can be used to get a good night's sleep, no medical value is offered or offered.
