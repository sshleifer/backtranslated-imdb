This manager of cellulose waste specializes in horrible exploitation films, all of which are biased; last year he made a "Dangerous Shut Down", whose good idea (which affects too much power in schools and the editor of a school paper) was diving into the sea, and he continued "Cyborg", the worst film by Jean Claude Van Damme is not at all. This comedy about the girl - Kathy Ireland's film debut - who is a complete schlump, whose inner babe is awakened only after she falls into the middle of the Earth and has a lot of badly filmed, impossible-to-follow adventures (mainly involving dwarf groups who want her because she's big Broom Indicator!) Before returning home to become better, it is not funny, engaging or more fun at the slightest. And anyone who looks at it to force Miss Ireland to be pushed too far - not because of her voice, but because she spends most of the film buried under clothes with a ton of bags. No wonder Cannon, the manufacturers, is not working. Amazingly, Kathy Ireland has made better movies ever since ... or maybe it's not that amazing. Next to it is "Barb Wire" "Aliens".
