Like the previous film commentator, I sometimes found tears in this movie. Sometimes I wonder how this awe-inspiring terrible movie appears. From the first moment our protagonist wakes up in his New York apartment between the subway train dreams that are intertwined with horses. And it doesn't get much better. <br /> <br /> Returning to the 1950s to Ireland, we enter a world where everyone speaks without intonation and only about Irish civil war. Pupils go to school to learn about civil war. Pub drinkers share themselves with the source of their civil war. Memories are made for people who died in the civil war. The city is divided between those who believe we should remember and those who want to forget ... civil war. Every look and conversation drips in the sense of following a civil war. <br /> <br /> The bursting of the Broken Harvest video cube indicates that the film is a parable of today's Irish worries. The only parallel that strikes me is that today the Dublin conversation is dominated by one thing: house prices. If he plans to give some insight into Ireland's past, it is not unhappy. It is surprising how few Irish films have dealt with the Irish Civil War and its legacy. Nevertheless, it takes a much more subtle and intelligent film to tell us something about the permanent effects of such a traumatic event on the people's psyche. the film evokes the atmosphere of Ireland in the 1950s: it is not. In the 1950s, Ireland was a terrible hole in sexual repression and misery that had been the subject of poverty, and young people fled. However, there was more than one conversation topic.
