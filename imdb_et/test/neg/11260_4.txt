This is the disappointment of James Lee Burke's "Electrical Fog of Confederate Dead". Rather, it has worked badly mainly because of the failure of the main players. Tommy Lee Jones, usually a good actor, just didn't hit Burke 'Dave Robicheaux. Like Robicheaux's main nemesis, John Goodman makes a dumb job as "heavy". The man who plays the Robicheaux actor-friend does not see a former A-lizard man. The rest of the film is mostly cast without names for the locals, who simply do not make rights to a great time novel. The Robicheaux Burke novel series gives the feeling that it fits in most of its environment, being modest and slow. It's like deep in southern and southern Louisiana. Then Robicheaux is sometimes manic in its loads. Jones moves through the movie quickly. He's no different. Ned Beatty is wasted. Mary Steenburgen is inappropriate. The only good thing about this is the setting. The whole movie gives the impression of a TV movie.
