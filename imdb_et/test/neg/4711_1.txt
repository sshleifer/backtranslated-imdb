Terrible action, terrible script, totally unreal. In any case, Bumblebee flies examples of clich√©s and sentimentalism that film studios love to attract the viewer's throat. Elijah Wood's primary role is unimaginably poor and the plot points are lively and delicate. The relationship between Cook and Wood is at best ridiculous. But the worst element of the bumble bee is the script. This is some of the most spiritual and bad dialogue I've ever heard. Bumblebees, who really climb in my ears and scold ears, would be better for Elijah Wood to hear that they shined their pseudo-deep lines. I wish to be presented with the "Bumblebee Project" so that I would not be able to commemorate this strange commemoration.
