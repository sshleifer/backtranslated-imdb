I hang my brain, but I can't see another movie like Gwang Valley. Western Dinosaurs? What could be more natural? You have to wonder why John Ford and / or John Wayne never tried it! <br /> <br /> Plot? In search of a mythical miniature horse for his circus, TJ Breckenridge (Gila Golan), Tuck Kirby (James Franciscus) and the rest of the characters / characters enter the strange, lost valley. There they find not only miniature horses, but also other, more frightening creatures. Dinosaurs dominate this place. Now wouldn't it be attractive to the TJ circus? drilled T-Rex? It's not that I find Gwang org is a bad film, I just didn't feel like I enjoyed it as many others who commented on the movie. There are some parts that I almost never see. In the first half of the film, it doesn't seem to happen much. I wasn't necessarily bored, but I wanted something to happen. Plodding would be an adjective I would use. Moreover, the film has a very understandable love story. It seems to be forced, as if the writers had decided that the male and female leaders had to come together. But the Gwang valley is not all waste. There are moments that I really enjoyed. Who can't get a shot out of bicycle scenes trying to lasso T-Rex. You just don't see such things every day. The creatures of Ray Harryhausen are impressive. There are some very cool pictures of communicating with people and horses in Harryhausen. It may not be the best for his job, but the effect is very nice. But at least in my opinion, these good moments are not enough to find negative solutions. As far as I hate to do this, I have to evaluate the Gwang Valley 4/10.
