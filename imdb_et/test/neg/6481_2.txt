The film is not too bad until ... <br /> <br /> The main problem is the end, so it's a pretty big spoiler ... <br /> <br /> All the time it's a pretty movie, and gets a lot of it right. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the Samis book, the dream, succeeds and lives, while the movie, he gives up and returns to the city, completely destroying the subject of the book, "you can do what you put in your mind." <br /> <br /> This movie is desecration, and instead of doing classics that don't need it again, Hollywood types who don't have better ideas should do that just this time.
