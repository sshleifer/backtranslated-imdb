Dean Koontz's "Watchers" book is one of the best books I've read. Unfortunately, this movie is a sad cartoon. A frustrated middle-aged hero and lonely spinster with whom he finds meaning in his life, transformed into a couple of stupid teenagers, a stoic security agent and a conscientious sheriff combined with a farcical villain - you get the picture? The designers have taken the moving story of love, horror and adventure and made it a Z-class horror strike aimed at - very badly - the merit market. <br /> <br /> Buy a book and enjoy reading a lot of hours - it's much more cost-effective than watching a movie. <br /> <br />
