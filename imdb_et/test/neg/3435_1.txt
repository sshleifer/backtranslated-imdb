Ten years ago I wanted to see this movie in the cinema. But I forgot about it and forgot about it. Oh boy, I'm glad the movie didn't get back to my teen eyes. <br /> <br /> I saw it yesterday and seriously that it should be one of the 10 worst films. And I'm talking about movies that have paid too much attention, like these great trailers on TVs and too much money for actors and making a movie. <br /> <br /> Script sucks and works sucks even worse, do I have to say more? <br /> <br /> Please, Hollywood, NOT ARNOLD!
