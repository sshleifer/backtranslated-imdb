This movie has disturbed me! When I think of a cat hat. I mean cat in hat books. You know, a couple of years ago, that parents read their children. Well, though, this movie would be so much! But my surprise was nothing like books! It is a humor film for young people. In one part, the cat speaks with a garden tool (hoe) with which the cat speaks, as it is in her hoof (adult humor). naming his car I was all so little about the children's film. According to the assessment you will find: a light humor and some double participants. I think it means adult humor. I wish I could bring this movie back! wal-mart said they were not because the film was open. If you think about buying it, I suggest you buy before you buy.
