Death Island is not really a good movie, any standard, but it's curious. Imagine if a natural born killer would have been made 20 years too early, like the Greek Eurotrashi porn movie. This is what you get here - a wonderful story of a young sociopathic British couple who cuts a deadly tough, cute little Greek island population. <br /> <br /> I'll save you a detailed breakdown of the plot; it is not really important except the creation of ever more perverse or violent sexual scenes, followed by the disturbingly brutal murders often captured by our charming young couple for their offspring. It could have been great, in a sick and disgusting way, but instead ... <br /> <br /> I found myself impatiently checking the time and chapter index to see how long the parade had to go last. Slow temple and hopeless, strange behavior even make whistle perversions blunt and associate scenes with eternal fright. Ah, well. You can't win everything.
