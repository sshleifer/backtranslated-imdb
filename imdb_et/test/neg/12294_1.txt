In order to name this film, a complete waste of cellulose would be inaccurate. <br /> <br /> The actors were not the least convincing, especially by actor Craig Fong, who couldn't be more rigid. What's the story ... well ... what's the story? The film is about Harry Lee, a Chinese-born Malaysian who comes back to his homeland after every course he took and tries to start the band. <br /> <br /> The film will ever have a clich√© you may think of - sex, tension among band members, and a bit of racial tension that has been thrown. <br /> <br /> The problem is that even on the subject that is best covered by amateur leaders, this movie is all over the place and the whole thing just feels like these are the parts that make even the most hardened reviewers' hair end of the year. <br /> <br />
