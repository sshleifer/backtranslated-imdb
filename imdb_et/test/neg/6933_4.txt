The four-and-a-half-hour O'Neill game is cooked just under two, and much of that time is devoted to actors who have frozen expressions on their faces when they read the thoughts of their characters over the voices. . It may work on stage, but with soap opera adaptation it seems a lot of fun, which softens your hero's bad behavior and never explains why so many people are so excited. Norma Shearer and Alexander Kirkland, who are moving ridiculously over, are natural Clark Gable - he is the only one who is working on a frozen facial technique. It gets even more fun when Shearer and Gabi's son, a tough moppet, makes a frozen face. There is also Frank Morgan's brother Ralph, who has failed, giving "poor Charlie!" time and again, and young Robert Young and Maureen O'Sullivan. By the time they appear, voice commands are mostly abandoned and played as a mature soap, with a sentimental fadeout actually playing as "Silver Threads of the Gold". Robert Leonard's direction is outrageous and he has little chance of reinventing in hyperactive participants. It's definitely fun - there's nothing other than reading the Groucho satirical parody of "Animal Crackers" or the old Mad Magazine satire that gave Shirley Booth's sitcom "Hazel" a "Strange Interlude". But that's not good.
