I have very little to add to what all other reviewers have already done more than clear! This movie is terrible! In addition to the terrible ... In fact, it is so troublesome that they are not yet a concept to describe the fear that is "skeleton man". If you expect your movies to have a minimal logic and plot, you should stay as far away as humanly possible. Of course, by the skeleton doll that carries a ridiculous cape, many people are killing, but no one is disturbing what he is from where he is or why he is so angry with the world. He looks like a crossroads between Sideretor and the rider of "Universe Masters" and "Sleepy Hollow" and runs amok in some godless desert. The "Skeleton Man" setting is another completely slowed aspect! For almost half an hour, I expected the film to take place on a small isolated island, but it just plays on the continent where fancy roads cross the forest and power plants are at the end of the forests! Ah? Why do everyone pretend they are trapped when there are a million millions of escape routes? Anyway, after a couple of totally casual killings, the monster arrives, driven by poor, rotten Michael Rooker commands. Really fun is how each member of this team introduces itself as an expert in a particular field (we have a sniper specialist, a tracking genius, a drill teacher ...), but they all die before anyone can show their allegedly masterful skills! The terrible Gods really have to hate Casper Van Dien as he is again, depicting a heroic soldier who steals a truck for no apparent reason, runs on the highway but somehow gets back to the middle of the forest to die there. True, it makes sense ... In addition, the characters from the "Predator" steal cool single-layered, the horse's horse changes the colors constantly, the helicopters are lowered with bow and arrows, the usual bullets cause the blast of the tree and completely pointless Vietnamese rebound with Michael Rooker. I say we all join forces and vote with this pathetic flick on the top 100 ASAP of the IMDb!
