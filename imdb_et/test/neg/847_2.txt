I'm really looking forward to this movie. Having read several reviews before release, it seemed like a really nice movie that was beautifully filmed and one of the most interesting pains (Nicholas Cage, Penelope Cruz and John Hurt.) Well, it could have been all these things But it is so boring that I am almost against everyone to sit through it completely and keep attention. Cage's attempt to speak with an Italian accent is also embarrassingly bad. He's such a good actor that I chuckle every time he spoke in this movie. <br /> <br /> 'Disappointment' seems to be the most commonly used word used by appraisers to describe the film, and I totally agree. <br /> <br /> I think it won't take a long time to get out of how bad this movie was, because like Cage's accent, it didn't work well.
