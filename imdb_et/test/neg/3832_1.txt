This movie was very disappointing and didn't fly for a few moments. More than anything, it was just stupid. The music was bad bad and the plot played like BYU bowl game? very predictable (avoiding embarrassment by fraud, subsequent gambling escalation, a rally that is short and causing losses). Essentially a semi-childish / semi-skinned Will (a filmmaker) and his faithfully confused brother Danny (we call him just a democrat), we treat Kirby ("Sweet Spirit"), their 3rd member. an unhappy Mormon "boy band", like the devil, until the man and father of the movie (directed by Jill) speaks to Will and stretches him out. Will will probably change his personality by 180 degrees, and he is a mature and self-conscious leader of the band. It would be a lovely, maybe funny, 10-minute dance show, but the fact that the movie is 93 minutes really sucks your life when you look at it. My advice? take the money you would normally spend on renting this exhibition and burn it in your fireplace or rinse it out of the toilet? more entertainment in much less time. If you want to watch a better movie from the same genre, get the holidays and soldiers? not a comedy but an endlessly better show (in fact, Kirby has more fun things in the saints than in the SOP).
