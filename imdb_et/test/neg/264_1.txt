Oh, how the critics fell to praise their goldsmith Paul Schrader (author of taxi drivers) when this movie came out. I never saw the features they discovered when I looked back at this movie, so I looked at it again to see if I got it wrong. Mishima is extremely uninteresting. This is a nice, unobtrusive film about the author who lives / works in a cold abstract culture. Apartments do not keep your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy. And the rest of it just sits awfully ... with the soldiers who sing songs about their masculinity that they promise, from hair purity, sword admiration, etc. <br /> <br /> It must be a triumph when you learn that you've landed Philip Glass; but then you have to get something out of him. The result of the glasses does not distinguish the other works, nor does it give the film any noticeable value. In 2010, it should be clear to everyone that Schrader has killed his career for work or impact (cat people, auto focus, light sleeping place, Patty Hearst, American gigolo). He can bring you into pieces and kill the film more quickly than anyone else. Schrader has made full of fun, amateur movies again.
