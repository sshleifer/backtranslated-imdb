First I just looked at the movie SHOWTIME called Survival Island. He says it was a 2006 film with Billy Zane and because I like him and couldn't sleep, I thought I'd control it. I looked interesting. I looked at it and decided to look for an IMDb who was the new face of Juan Pablo Di Pace and OMG, which I couldn't believe it, this movie has been renamed into three and this is a new film? He plays again in 1 hour and 30 minutes on Showtime Channel, and that date is May 28th and EDT or Florida time. You can view your showtime lists by title and view it. I can't get into the details so you can see the movie, but at one point the white bikini is the lady who goes with the water that takes it away, you see her naked body .... when she runs back from the water you see her bottom. There are also many other confusions. I can't believe randomly that I decided to look for this movie ... Go figur! I wonder if people renaming it sold it to some of the studios, but they're already playing Showtime, ha ha. Good laughter. I'll give him 1-1 / 2 stars. C, D + film.
