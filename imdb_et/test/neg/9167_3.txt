Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate are planning to occupy the casino, the area "Ocean 11" and affirm its hell Angels. Bad movement. For a movie with the words Hell's Angels AND number 69 AND where there are the actual angels of hell, this film is surprisingly happening. Hell angels really deserve a better movie among them. Not that snoorefest. Luckily, this is one of the DVDs with Joe Bob Briggs comments, so the pain to overcome it is greatly alleviated. If you look at it in another way, let me suggest something to you. DO NOT !! My Class: D <br /> <br /> Add-ons for DVDs: Comment by Joe Bob Brigg; Conny Van Dyke's message to his fans (he has more than one?); Photo gallery; Theatrical trailer; and Trailers "Blood Attack", "Hell High", "Samurai Police" and "The Hollywood Strangler"
