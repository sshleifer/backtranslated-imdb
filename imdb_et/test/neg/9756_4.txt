I entered the film with the right expectations, I liked this movie. Like most of the viewers who have seen this film, I totally agree that the plot was a thin, cliche of a razor, and I can predict each film from the beginning. But the dance series were very well done and I really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance (both of which I look at). The movie's music / soundtrack was also very good, making the "drama" scenes more acceptable. Leaders (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) were good actors, but their dancing throughout the film was impressive and mesmerizing. and this film is a lot better than "You got it" in the plot and drama. Then, it doesn't say much, is it? = P
