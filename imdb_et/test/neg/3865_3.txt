It was such a terrible film, almost noir in the comedy drawing of the movie. The budget was low compared to blocking, but still higher than most.But where they have decided to cut costs, which is completely weird.Some participants are less competent, while others look like they just pulled out of the street. actress, she's so bad that I've ever said anything (she's talking through the ENTIRE movie). It's a weird costume selection At the beginning of the movie, all the characters wear clothes from the 1930s. They drive in a classic car, but the background is the windmill of today, boldly modern. And costumes and some settings continue to follow the noir theme of this 30th movie. Then BAM drives a brand new escalator with 24-inch rims .... WTF.We'll get it again, if the boy is on his rifle at night, you'll miss it. His goal is to mp5 and tactical man even in strange contrast to places shining and seem h Ave cost more than the whole movie. Camera shots / corners are very good and show these scenes perfectly in scenes. The director has a sharp eye for a good-looking single image, but has no idea how much more to do. <br /> <br /> People who should be taken off this movie ▼ <br /> <br /> Writer Director Casting Agent Costume Designer <br /> <br /> People who should be tortured to death for these monotonous, monotonous nails crystal board ▼ <br /> <br /> Anton Pardoe - Head Actor, Writer, Manufacturer If you ever saw a movie hostel, I would like it to happen to this man, but he won't be able to.
