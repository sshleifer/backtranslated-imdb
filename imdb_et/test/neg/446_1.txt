A terrible and unnecessary order for the bonafics classics. The American werewolf was undoubtedly a pearl of the movie in London: humorous, demented, but a dash of romance and so much, very British, it made me want to get up and sing the Queen of God to save every time the film ended. Then it came to abomination. You know that you have real problems when leaders are so unlikely that you are joyful when they are killed, and actually lycanthropes will rejoice. Tell you the truth, people, I got this CGI-travesty just half way before I lost the will to live and turn it off. Absolutely pathetic and a waste of time.
