When my mother went to the video store to rent her night in the evening, I learned a sister lesson to always be my mother to her video store! In fact, the only reason he chose this was because Colin Firth was in it and he * cough * thinks he's a good actor! <br /> <br /> It starts with some beautiful water from Africa and then goes down and down AND DOWN and DOWN. After this movie, I was very surprised that Colin Firth got as much as he did because this meaningless film could destroy all the career of the participants. <br /> <br /> The story is separated from the women who are trying to match him with a man named Matthew Fields who met his friends because of his big house. <br /> <br /> The name Divorce doesn't like Matthew at all and goes through a local vicar who doesn't like his son John. ... and the same with him! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if you don't agree with me and I hope I haven't offended you, but for all the people who haven't seen this movie, I'll leave you with one warning word, DON'T SEE THE FILM !!!! !
