There seems to be a whole cheap and tired old sex "comedies" that say the same old things about middle-class couples. Like friends, but softer porn and not. This movie is no exception - it was so familiar that I died of deja vu. People were sitting on the couch, tearing clich√©s about sex and relationships? Check it out. Monogamia versus cheating with a few women / men who would never see twice a second woman / husband in reality? Check it out. PORNES GROUPS !!!! Check it out. Some guy / girl in what happens is the only reason you look at this garbage? Check it out. The lesson seems to be - as in doubt - tired of the old sex "comedy" of people who no one cares about making a statement that everyone has already heard about three thousand times before. This will get your movie. It even attracts some sitcom's bad wig!
