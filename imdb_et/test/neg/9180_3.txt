Unlike most of the critics of this movie, I'm not quite a fan of Cynthia Rothrock. But when I saw Fred Williamson and Robert Forster (both big actors) in the movie, I just had to watch the movie. Williamson is Dakota Smith, an alcoholic policeman who has been reduced toothbrush-cleaned toilets, and even worse, the captain (Robert Forster) has to come together with Cynthia at the request. Forster is always traceable, it's just a shameful shame that the film itself is both a fucking trick and a clich√©. It also has one of the least frightening villains ever dedicated to cellulose. Williamson returns to Dakota in another movie, next is "Down N Dirty" <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nina Richardson shows some R&D; Mary Kapper Goes Topless <br /> <br /> My Class: D <br /> <br /> Where Did I See: Showtime Extreme
