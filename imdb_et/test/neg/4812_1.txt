Why? Why? Why doesn't anyone tell the truth about this terrible HORRIBLE movie on earth? I always wake up in the morning and ask God why he didn't stop me from seeing this controversial "comedy". I don't think I'm PAID to see my cinematic taste. I'm starting to think that 5 stars are Martha's cigarette nudity and all the men who can't buy a porn movie and avoid it ... I call it "thing." insult to the Mexican film industry. Characters are a big clich√©, acting causes unintentional laugh and the script is ... well, I don't think a person has written it. And just when you thought you were tortured, the last half hour was so painful that I wanted to throw my eyes out. The only good thing I can say is that it only lasts 90 minutes (it seems for centuries, but still). Really, OUT OR !!!
