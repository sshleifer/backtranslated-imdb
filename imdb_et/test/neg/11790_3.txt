I'm sure any legal submarine will happily fly out to USOS Seaview (yes, SOS ...) Why, you could play full-time basketball in the torpedo room, that's so big. And how are the cool windows inside the bow, the better is the giant squid or minefields that appear somewhere? Did I mention a colored crappy priest on a parrot shoulder? And the admiral's office, which seems to be the attic? Great bleeding ... <br /> <br /> OK, ok ... it's never won the award for authenticity. And if the sub is ridiculous, the plot is even worse. In any case, Van Allen's hoops are hundreds of miles in space with a "fire" that begins to see global warming like a dish. The pompous admiral Nelson (Walter Pidgeon) with his liaison with Lucius (Peter Lorre, who is looking for an uncomfortable discomfort) strikes the scheme to kick out the fire, putting the rocket at its center. <br /> <br /> sic) along the way, born revived (and also his little dog!) two "dames" who can never leave well enough on the "red shirts" passport, and the plot holes, big enough to walk Godzilla. Thrill to sea view, followed by what looks like 60 miles per hour, with another sub-subsidy, without the need for an advanced sonar if you can follow from 100 feet. <br /> <br /> The film is maintained by one rock cliff; Profitability is so unlikely that it is pointless, certainly not worth 1 hour and 50 minutes to wait. <br /> <br /> The technical advisor for this shipwreck must be a 14-year-old boy with popular mechanics. magazines. It is worth watching if you just riff it.
