Why do I hate this? Let me list the ways: <br /> <br /> I am not against Mary Pickford, but a 32-year-old woman who is 12 years old is just stupid. <br /> <br /> There's a fighting scene where kids throw bricks at each other and find it funny --- and it goes on for 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Strangely, no child even hurt remotely <br /> <br /> Headline Cards contain a lot of racial and ethnic dragons <br /> <br /> For the "Family" movie, the struggles for WAY were too violent (loved it when Pickford knocks it out with a little boy) and humor was just stupid <br / Seriously, after 40 minutes I gave up and turned it off. I got the cracks, racism and little kids who ordered one after the other. There was also no plot I saw. The only thing worth seeing in this film was William Haines, who was the leading man in the quiet era. <br /> <br /> Just hurt. Avoid.
