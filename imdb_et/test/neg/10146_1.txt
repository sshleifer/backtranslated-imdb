In my opinion, the whole video of this movie was an absolute trash from this movie !!!! However, the soundtrack used included a heavy metal rock band music, I felt that music was a band called Firstryke and the album was "Just a Nightmare" and it was very well written !! and I'm curious to see what the rest of the movies are thinking about when you remember that I appreciate this feedback, collect the old movie and hide the sound of the movie. This is a very time consuming hobby, but it is very rewarding. I've seen this band music sold in Germany for about fifty dollars per album. Not Bad Hugh?
