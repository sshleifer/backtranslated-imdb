I fully understand why this film is made. The silence of lamb was an incredible movie - an amazing thriller with a great story and a great jumping factor .... <br /> <br /> I don't understand why this movie was made ... and why Anthony Hopkins agreed to play his role as Hannibal Cannibal in this terrible and in a satisfied movie. <br /> <br /> It is not possible to spoil a movie if it could be seen, but for those who prefer to waste money, DO NOT READ. The film is absolutely terrible. It is so bad that the transition from Jodie Foster to Julianne Moore becomes illegal. <br /> <br /> The only way to really enjoy the movie is to set the clock and leave the theater for exactly two hours, because until then it's a pretty thriller. The repertoire between Moore and Hopkins is comparable to Hopkins and Foster, and the performances of other characters are pretty good. But literally, in a two-week mark, the film breaks nothing but a chewing D-Class horror ... it's sick, and it's stupid and almost like the team ran out of filming time and threw up filming until the end of one day. <br /> <br /> Initial buzz by Ridley Scot, a dissatisfied and bizarre leader of Thomas Harris's book, to order a rewrite ... and frankly a movie and read the book's finals, I don't know what's worse. <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your money OR time on this film if you are not ready to leave for exactly two hours as it is the only way. It feels satisfied with Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter's saga ... wait for it, so big.
