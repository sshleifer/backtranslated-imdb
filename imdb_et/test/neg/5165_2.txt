For all of your wonderful images, it just comes out for your good intentions as yet another offensive, one-sided, glorified, self-promoting propaganda. <br /> <br /> The message is simple, "All Japanese Fighting Kokoda rails were sadistic, malevolent f *** sticks who enjoyed breaking each last Aussie force by cutting their throat before they were attacked." "The only mistake (that the enemy is a face, anonymous and probably an inhumane), but manages to prove the opposite to Weir's masterpiece. Instead of giving us the perfect movie with one mistake, we have a terrible mess with one redemption function. <br /> <br /> Let's start with this: we're comfortable with these characters without any customization. apparently quite retrospective, two-dimensional people we never have ... NO EYE. We are so far away that even if we could be so involved with the characters, they find a way to keep us. This alone is scattering because it takes us very out of the plot, helps the terrible pace leave us with a lasting impression and makes it so much easier to see the contrast openly to the sentimental end and the otherwise empty body. In other words, it pulls us through a painful journey (not just for us, but probably for them) and just as it should end, we are thrown into another confusion that ends quicker than it started. So, still STILL unknown: if it should end, it will start again and will only end if we wait more. S ***! It's just a confusing and embarrassing tempo! <br /> <br /> What brings me to ultimatum: it is meant to educate us about the events of the Kokoda track. It's not close. Not only does it specify a very small, insignificant part of the campaign (sprinkled a little on the "matehip" to make it relevant), but it manages to do one thing that is as important as it should be, it doesn't care for us. <br /> <br /> Frankly, my eyes were constantly glued all the time at my watch. The audience around me, all proudly Australian, tend to come when they came, how big the movie was, bowed, moaned and frustrated, because every ninety-five minutes drove (short time) it seemed that the Apocalypse is now: the difference is that by now Apocalypse was a good movie and deserved three hours of it) and the point where suicide could be an alternative if it was mandatory. Although, considering how much the TV has advertised on this trash, I would say that it is mandatory in the subconscious sense. <br /> <br /> See if you like real pictures. Although you look better at Constant Gardener or Gallipoli because they have good cinematography and ACTUAL plots. <br /> <br /> Generally: *
