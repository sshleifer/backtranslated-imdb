What am I saying about this? Such a big Prestige production - but at the end? Stoned time, wasted money. <br /> <br /> This work is a disaster that is historically visible. Just a few examples: <br /> <br /> * Augustus is often called "Gaius" - his first name (Pronomen). But the old Romans didn't use that name. The correct name would be the surname (Nomen Gentile and Cognomen) or "Octavian", "Caesar", "Augustus". <br /> <br /> * Livia was a tyrannical woman. But this was historically wrong. <br /> <br /> * Iulia was a beautiful young woman - but she wasn't one. Adultery and (perhaps?) Prostitution and arrogant behavior were the cause of his deception. <br /> <br /> * He was not dying in his father's bed. He could never leave. And he was about 50 years old at that time! Not as young as he was shown. That same year, Augustus died of suicide because Tiberius stopped giving his pension. <br /> <br /> * Augustus was much filmed when this movie showed. But the author and the director seem to believe that Augustus is his "Res Gestae". <br /> <br /> What's up? Historically extremely suspicious, bad behavior, poorly built, and equipment - 2 out of 10 - one for Peter O'Toole.
