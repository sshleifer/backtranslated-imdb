There is no way to put in words how bad, how unformed, uneasy and ridiculous these "Vice Academy" movies really are. You have to experience yourself. For the third time in a row, writer-director Rick Sloane does not even write an ounce in writing or give talent. There is nothing here that a person over 5 years of age believes or laughs, but (very short) nudity and other "plot" elements make movies unsuitable for children. This makes me believe they are really targeted at 5-year-old adults with mental abilities. Elizabeth Kaitan makes more than a welcome substitute for Linnea Quigley - she is a successful effervescent and cute, and her wonderful big smile is the only thing that can make the viewer smile. But watching her and the other girls in this film is like watching a bouquet in the wilderness covered with flower manure. (*)
