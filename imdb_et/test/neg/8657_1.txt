Yash Raj films are so funny, no matter what works they follow, but they are called the best production buildings. <br /> <br /> Seeing that Bhatti's movies are working, they copied the formula, bikini and everything plus show low actors like Uday and Tanishaa The film is so terrible that it makes you frustrate <br /> /> jokes are so bad and hornyed that makes you beat them Uday remembers gay plus monkey <br /> <br /> Tanishaa recalls idiot <br /> <br /> The director thinks we are all idiots Arjun Sablok takes the audience self-evident Music saves grace Camera work is good <br /> <br /> Uday Chopra's gifts like idiot Tanishaa looks like Kajol in K3g, when Kajol was annoying, Tanishaa is worse, the rest is okay
