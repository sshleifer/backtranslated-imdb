With all the chance to get a good movie for its beautiful equipment, cast and cinematography, this film's weak script, the pace of lead and wood performances were just a big disappointment. Thanks to proper direction, editing and musical score, it would have been a good movie, maybe Blake Edward's '10 'dark version, instead of Ron Howard's' Splash' rodent version.
