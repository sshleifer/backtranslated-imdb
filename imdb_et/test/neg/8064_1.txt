How bad? Well, compared to this movie, Cannibal Holocaust Citizen Kane. There's dirty action, cruel dialogue, half-baked plot, and much too much of his companion to kill animals on the screen. Unlike the Holocaust, the Ferox film is direct. It is not a pseudo documentary. There are some ways that make production so sharp that the film is sharp and sharp compared to the holocaust grain. Unfortunately, we are again being given a group of people who are morally understandable. They torture the natives and essentially bring everything they can themselves. There is really nothing in this movie that would make your time worthwhile. I was relatively gentle about my Holocaust review due to some real aspiration and style, but Ferox has no reason to look at it if you can't just go off the blood and gore.
