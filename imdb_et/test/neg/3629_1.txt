Zeoy101 ?? Indeed, it must be one of the most stupid attempts to get people into the attention of their age group. It's about some preppy girl named Zeoy and her friends who attend school. CAUSING !!! All he does is whine and complain and behave like a corrupted idiot. I remember that this exhibition came out in 2005, I was 13 years old, 14 and even then I thought it was pointless. The only episode I ever liked was when the boys hid the camera in the girls' dormitory. That's it. Anyway, I just don't understand why Nickel-Oh my annoyed Nick feels the need to syndicate this bad excuse for "entertainment". serious this decade is becoming a joke every year and it becomes worst and worst. What is this generation? <br /> <br /> Anyway, R.I.P. Nickelodeon 1979-1998? / 2005?
