The necessary roughness (1991) was a bad comedy / drama that tried to film at every level hard on college football. At one of the comic highlights of the film, many current and former superstars appeared in this production. Other than this is a very mediocre movie. They should just have to shut up to make a comedy that was not realistic. Instead, filmmakers try to play both out and stick to the short end. When does someone make a decent film about college football that is funny and realistic? <br /> <br /> Not recommended if it's not free
