Jackie Chan's early film, where there is no sign of Chan. This is Chan's full-featured traditional revenge that was cloned and cloned with a number of manufacturers and studios across Hong Kong via Taiwan and Mainland China. This is a very serious story that does not show any humor and warmth that would make Jackie Chani extremely strong. It is also clear that if he did not find himself again, we would never have known him because his career would have been painfully short. The film's own power is a good-looking, but quite remarkable film. I watched it in the middle of a marathon of martial arts all day, and it would have interfered with every other movie I watched on the same day when I didn't notice Jackie in the movie. To be honest, I don't think the film is really cumbersome (there are many other better variations) unless you are interested in starting Jackie Chan.
