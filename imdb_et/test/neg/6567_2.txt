Although Star Trek movie was mostly boring, Star Trek Final Frontier is bad. In this terrible order, the team has left the shore when they receive a signal from the federation that the ambassadors of Earth, Romulus, and Kronos (in Klingon's homeland) have been abducted from the Vulcan Renegade, who wanted to get into a big barrier in their quest to reach their full-length risk. There he hopes to find God. Through mysticism and poor writing, he persuades many of the company's senior officers to betray the Church and keep the ship. They get inside a big barrier and find a planet where they meet a godlike alien. It's so bad that it's hard to figure out where to start. At the heart is a good idea that has never really been developed. The plot does not go anywhere, instead of where no person has ever been. It's almost like the writers didn't know how to end this fiasco. The action scenes have no tension on Kahn's anger, the philosophy is boring and humor is hidden. Now I will focus most of my anger on William Shatner. When he takes the director's chair, the ego becomes bigger. Most focus on him, Spock and McCoy, but don't give others enough. Besides, although Shatner is usually guilty of previous movies and television spots, he is just bad about it. Now Kirk is careless, practical jokes and silly. One of the worst scenes is the song of three leader songs at the campfire "Row Row Row your Boat". In any case, it is the worst of the Star Trek franchise. I should have given him three out of ten instead of five.
