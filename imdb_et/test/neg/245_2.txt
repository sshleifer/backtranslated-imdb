The first two-thirds of this movie were not similar to those of the 30s and 40s American moms. Two ancient Mexican lovers dared to humiliate the law and die. It became the Aztec mummy whose mission was to guard the holy treasure and his love. And the lady was reincarnated today and the mummy attracted her naturally. So far this is a typical mummy movie ... though it's slower and duller than American versions. Oh, and, of course, atsteekimummi seemed really, really messy. <br /> <br /> This traditional but boring movie has a super-villain. Why? I can't - it certainly didn't make any sense. It seems that this villain wants treasures and he can make the lady hypnotize and show them where the Aztec treasure is buried. Why does he need treasure? Well, buy the equipment you need to make an atomic robot army! But first he has to build one mommy to win the mummy because the mummy is still unstoppable. Flash Gordon and other series robots, but they have a rubber head supposedly dead boy inside! They really look funny funny and see the conclusion that a devastating mommy and a huge battle is equally slow robot, which is worth the rest of the dull movie. So fighting in super-slow motion, as they are swimming in taffeta ... and it's done in such a fashionable and stupid way that it's forced to cause a woman - certainly not excitement. The film is a terribly boring and confusing confusion - especially at the end. But for bad movie fans, it's a must-have - it's bad, but inadvertently funny and big to watch and laugh with friends.
