One only has to read the cast list and credit spit while waiting for this DAVID COPPERFIELD, but unfortunately unfortunately! How many main actors and directors could have made the richest stories of literature into such a monumental BORE, totally over me. It's pretty nice to see photos, especially Yarmouth sequences, but JUST PLAIN DULL !!! No need to go! Leave it out and watch Selznicki or the wonderful BBC mini-series of the 1980s.
