When a stupid group of children (including an unlikely racist female) stays in an old house, she awakens the four murderers of the Toltec spirit. Does Lash La Rue save the day? Can you look up to the end thanks to the terrible comedy. <br /> <br /> "Dark Power" is such a really bad horror / comedy hybrid Troma that is used regularly. The thing is, they weren't. release it. It doesn't excuse the whole thing because it has a terrible synthesizer score (including bad experiments in Native American music and even worse "comedy" music), bad effects (basically Halloween masks) and cruel actions (Ok, a fatty man was fine, though everyone else is terrible, and the western film veterinarian La Rue seems embarrassed to be there, not because I really blame him.) <br /> <br /> The comedy aspects are the worst. Of course, the dark teenagers are one thing, but when the film speaks of Toltec's spirits as if they were the ultimate evil, only to make them terribly annoying, a foolish fool, all hope is broken. Combining fear and comedy takes at least some skill. There's no skill here because it's all just stupid and not "so stupid it's fun". I mean "smoking a pot and listening to the bad Punk Rock I'm not stupid" stupid. <br /> <br /> Even a decent ripped off face and chick with little clothes will not save this catastrophe. Terrible movie and even not worthy of renting.
