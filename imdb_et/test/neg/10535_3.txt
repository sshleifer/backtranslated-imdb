I saw this movie yesterday, and as most allrdy wrote "I also wait for Steven's movie," God I love this man just because his fighting style is unique and very humerous. There was little doubt that I read "And the rule" was playing in it, but I thought they hoped they would give him a ridiculous role, so I wouldn't be upset about him. Conversely, on the contrary, goooooooooooooooooooood steven, what the hell you meant, goes to this sry *** team. Steven broke and needed money? bah = (which is a big dissapointment. If you like Steven's movie, please leave this one between pure drama, you will only get some special effects that made me vote 3/10. talk aswel your friend kurupt his irritating hood. br /> <br /> My beer went out of taste with fresh water we make dishes. The story wasn't "good" about it. I felt it was 3 years old. <br /> <br /> Hopefully Steven will put me in the future movie again People who don't even want to rent it. <br /> <br /> Bad and pitty :-)
