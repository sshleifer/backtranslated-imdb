The VIP keys are just another awful T.V. that shows you and you can see at this station. The show is terrible when boys say they are competing real players (two of them competing in every episode) in foolish games where they try to talk to girls at girls' numbers and so on. The judges are four other men who claim they are also experts in collecting artists, but they look just like big d-bags like contestants. The show is not funny at all and is not even interesting, it is just boring to see that these boys are desperately trying to convince us which awesome players they are (they speak about four other judges than competitors). Something funny is not even shown what I looked at, and the exhibitions are obviously related. Do you really think they have invited all of these people to the club, I could sign them, and sent them to the tape when these guys make the same fool games with them? It's not a reality, it's just a fool, it's probably even tapes during the day. Someone else here wrote about how they knew about an exhibition, and it was all fake, which is obvious, it is fake and even with actors who are still not funny. One of the worst shows I've ever seen.
