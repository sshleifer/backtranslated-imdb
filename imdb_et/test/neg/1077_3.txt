"Italian Work" is a whimsical film with numbers. Riding behind the clichés of each caper rises to the height and is the footnote of the movie at the end of the month. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that "Italian work" is not imaginative at all. I've seen it before and done it better. Action is good if cinematic art is perfectly acceptable, but this film does not break any new ground. <br /> <br /> We mark the clichés: <br /> <br /> - The indicator of the "old school" criminal father and his protege <br /> <br /> - another gang member who takes care of jealousy > <br /> - Double Cross <br /> <br /> - Only bad guys use weapons while good criminals don't need <br /> <br /> - Good criminals always cross bad guys <br /> <br /> And it's about 15 minutes. Everything is so predictable. Even hunting scenes and car chasing scenes, probably highlighting the film, seem quite common. This is especially true because they appeared on movie trailers so I already knew what to look for. <br /> <br /> For me, the capricious film only works if it has an element of realism - perhaps it may perhaps be pulled out without having to rely on deux ex machina or "just because". The parts of "Italian Work" simply throw it out of the window, the computers do things that the computers can't do, the good guys do not hit anyone who is driving (especially down the stairs) and not one police car that meets the street explosions, reckless minis or even small a flying helicopter. There must be a city heck that these things will not respond. <br /> <br /> Operation is satisfactory, the team (Seth Green, Jason Stratham and Mos Def) is at least fun to watch. Mark Wahlberg is just too funny as a "nice boy" hero, while Charlize Theron is the only participant who has called to show any choice. Donald Sutherland is a class that acts as always and shows Wahlberg's shortcomings every moment they are together. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a rather uninteresting movie. Given IMDb ratings, there are girls who love this movie, which I understand somewhat, but there are such better capri films - even the recent "Ocean Eleven" vapidness is beyond the "" work of Italy. "<br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> Finally, think about what happens to Norton's character. Do we want to rejoice at the good guys that cause his death, especially since it seems to be long and painful? , forcing him to crawl that he was. <br /> <br /> *** END SPOILER ***
