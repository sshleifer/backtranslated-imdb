The first two Bring It On movies were both pretty good in their own way. The first one was quite serious, the second one was satirical - and the third one chose the usual idiotic small-eyed comedy that we always see in the totally crazy movies Hollywood has come out of wood. The whole point of this movie was that cheerleaders have heads of heads who hardly know enough to continue a common conversation, and that is the scope of the comedy of this movie. Ha ha. No it is not. <br /> <br /> There is no wisdom in this movie, no topic, no subtitle, no one with half the brain for entertainment (and certainly I couldn't sit it all)). If you are a person who is attracted to joking, this movie is for you. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
