A forgotten (AKA: don't look in the basement) is a very cheap and very old-looking movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very slow and never gets anything that is excited. <Br /> <br /> Patients in the shelter are embarrassingly funny, especially Sam and old women who always quote an old saying to everyone. (See how a little bit he goes near the camera, tell me you can watch without a smile!). <br /> <br /> Now the gate is very bad and the blood is looking pink in many scenes, so don't deserve your place in the video nasties list! <br /> <br /> Generally, if you are not looking for a fantastic horror movie and you have time to save, you should check out.
