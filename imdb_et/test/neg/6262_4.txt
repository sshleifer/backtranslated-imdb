I've never been expecting too much movie from trashy B movie director Jim Wynorsk's film: foolish premise, some cheap effects and some nudity from some busty babes, and I'm usually pretty happy. Well, the Cheerleader massacre is sent by the former and certainly the last, but unfortunately it is a light when it comes to a splatter. And if the film has the word "massacre" in the title and the elbow, then in Houston, we have a problem. <br /> <br /> The Wynorsk Film Center focuses on a group of cheerleaders who, together with their teacher, have a mini-bus driver and a couple of boys in the mountains during snow storms. They walk along an abandoned mountainous area where they find food and shelter. And a crazy killer who wants them all dead! Good old Jim ensures from the start that his film has many R & D-loaded scenes, and it includes a mandatory shower scene with numerous other moments when tasty women get some (including at times soft soft porn and very free) -babes-in-a -hot-tub scene). No woman sees young enough to be cheerleaders (and never even see their outfits), but who cares about such details when they're too prepared to remove it for art? <br /> <br /> However, I care about the movie's numerous bad deaths. With such an extremely clandestine title, I had hoped that some of the bleeds that were invented would go with all the knees, shrubs and breasts; Instead, almost all killings occur alongside a screen or function that is not gore. Only the silly post-decapitation scene (achieved with cheap CGI chips) comes close to the delivery of the goods. <br /> <br /> However, if you feel a title or a bit of a sense of slasher's stupidity minus grue, after 82 minutes, at least the Cheerleader massacre will not waste too much time.
