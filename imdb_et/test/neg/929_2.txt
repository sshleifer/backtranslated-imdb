Is it a game for FMV or film? Frankly, I looked at this lack of choice. This is a huge waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> HK movies seem to be moving in the opposite direction of the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Try to put more effort and money into production and we want to look at us, not something we want us to look at. <br /> <br /> Graphics are as terrible as the low-resolution games of the early 90's (Compared to today). <br /> <br /> The way they did this movie is almost exactly what they did in the 90s Wing Commander, namely the third part of the series. Stop the regression and make us as bad as the great weapons of Hollywood in Asia. <br /> <br /> Of course! They have big budgets and better participants. But we have some of the oldest history, myths and legends, the best technophiles, and perhaps the world's biggest computer graphics! So what went wrong? Did you start using the same old companies that have made so many movies with you? Please stop wasting your time and money. This is why HK movies are moving so fast downhill. Didn't you claim to be a friend of Hollywood? Guess.
