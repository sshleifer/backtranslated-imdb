The knowledge of the Greek parts of the film was very beautiful and photography received all my voices and it is about the scope of my film. I found that all the characters were Nazi archetypes that were so often found and low and uninteresting in American culture. Susan Sarandon and Gena Rowlands are easy to see, but I found their characters very narcissistic and unlikely for many other reasons. When Gena Rowlands sings at the party, she made me think about how this woman could think of her as a competent star in the production. I was tempted to hit the MUTE button until it ended the song. Molly Ringwald was herself and Raul Julia's character was so ugly that she was totally horrible. The film was too long for me, and I couldn't even sit at the gun.
