I have lived in Istanbul for 24 years and I (39 years of experience) know what Istanbul has been through all these years. <br /> <br /> Faith Akin is still fairly young (born in 1973) and falling into a big mistake ORIENTALIST when looking at Turkey (just like his second movie Gegen Die Wand made this movie) LOOBUS LACK modern city -Turkey Life AND MISLEADS when they give out (pretty wrong) clues about the geographical and cultural distribution of Istanbul. <br /> <br /> Anyone who can speak Turkish can easily prove that many of the underground bands and groups depicted in the movie (Siyasiyabend for one) are so violent and their members can't even speak the right language they cannot become the "representatives" of modern Turkish music. Much less chicks that many Turkish listeners don't even know at all. <br /> <br /> The Turks have long been accustomed to the "superficious" Westerners who look at Turkey with some oriental point of view: the real picture of Turkey fits into its mind forms. It is a new fact in this film that now the Turkish-born director (Faith Akin) made the same mistake: looking at Turkey with some false western glass and scrambling it to portray it when he understands better. Ask all your Turkish friends: What kind of musical documentary is it, unnamed names: Zeki Muren, Baris Manco, Ajda Pekkan, Teoman, Muslum Gurses, Ibrahim Tatlis, Ferdi Ozbeg? .. and many others who have so far made SHAPED the real music we are listening to today? <br /> <br /> Faith Akin has a long lesson before learning and mixing up other people's thoughts with contemporary Turkish music.
