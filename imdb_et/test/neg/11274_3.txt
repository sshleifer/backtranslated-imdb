Thank God, I have a quick move. I think it's a movie of a man who rises and falls. Whatever: this is a stupid clich√©. It doesn't change anything. There's the man, Javier Bardem, who builds buildings or something. It doesn't matter. She's beautiful, it's Javier Bardem. Who cares? I think there is a car wreck, but I looked at it quickly, so ... who cares? Car wrecks and beautiful heroes fighting against them smell my melodrama. Javier likes someone, but he marries Maria de Madeira instead. He is perfectly, poetically beautiful, with a heart-shaped face. Then Javier has an oral interface with Maribel Verdo, who is washing his vulva for some reason. You think Maribel Verdu, his hand-washed vulva, would be sexy. He's not. This is a tedious story of people who don't care about me. Javier, Maribel and Mary have three: how bored. This movie is annoying. I think this may be a small topic for some (Spanish) films: the rise of a little boy and the predictable drop that will succeed. Let me just put it down: it's a high-level melodrama or soap opera. It's not worth your time, except to laugh.
