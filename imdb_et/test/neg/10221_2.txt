I found the first stop motion animation with intriguing and mostly lively action in the short time the girl went, no matter which country she was interested in, but the other 11 odd short shorts didn't really interest me and I mean nothing. The music and the 8 mm film seemed so random that everything just seemed random. I don't recommend it to anyone unless you see it for free. <br /> <br /> What happens to music in a way that doesn't come across. I rented a DVD because I thought it was all a stop motion animation or a SMA that was mixed with a real-time action and only the first short was SMA, the other one had a little stopping movement that was mostly mixed with live action. One page had a paper cutter, the rest was 8 mm out of the camera with a music bed. I just didn't have any meaning.
