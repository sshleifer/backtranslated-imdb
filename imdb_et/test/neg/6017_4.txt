Christopher Guest is the master of mockumentary. Werner Herzog is one of many documentaries. Zak Penn is also not good, but he can certainly learn from others. The guest often plays with reality and fiction, but the line between them is always a clear, peculiar mocumentary in his films. Penn could also learn from the Blair witch project. Even if you knew it was a fake documentary for you, it was bought by filmmakers from all over the world. It seems to the public that when the whole thing is real, even though you know deep, you look at fiction. In other words, it was a literally hidden truth in fiction. In fact, many early viewers who saw it at Sundance and other premieres were real. The penny whose forte is allowed to write on the screen should probably stay with it. Obviously, there is no documentary or movie (and it's hard to say where one starts and the other ends with this movie). <br /> <br /> The penn sets the stage he is trying to sell as a documentary film of a documentary, a meta-documentary. The penny, however, confuses the audience and loses confidence when he goes to Herzog's house before filming Herzog's "Enigma of Loch Ness" on a Loch Ness monster myth (a film that probably was never ready for Penn's intervention). Although Penn is probably the director of the movie he is watching, he starts watching the cameras and says, "What does the film crew do here?" and starts to tremble for them. He does so in a few other cases. He stops and tells the cameras to stop filming, forcing the camera boy to hide the shadows to pull the dialogues between Herzog and Penn. It seems to be a trick, but it has never been made clear, and Penn will probably keep us deliberately in the dark. That leaves the audience with their own thought: "Who's here?" When Penn works against his film crew, which world are we? This is just one of many examples of how it interferes with the line between reality and fiction. <br /> <br /> Penn seems to be entering a fully imagined world (think) when the team has observations that appear to be a Loch Ness monster. But by the time the monster makes his first appearance, we are completely invented by the fictional world that Penn has tried to create, so it all feels stupid and meaningless. <br /> <br /> This is a potentially fascinating movie and a real missed opportunity for Penn to document a champion at work but lose full focus and become a movie instead of filming Penn and his antiques. documentary. Penn's presence begins to hide and overshadow all the things in the movie. <br /> <br /> Herzog interviews are convincing and we believe he will not act. We even start to think about whether Penn, as much as the audience is, will put him and his other team members, but you will never be sure. In his interviews with the camera, Penn tries to be selfless and unintentionally funny, such as characters surveyed in guest poisoning, but he only succeeds in disturbing him. In the guest film, this effect is fun, while here it falls because you are never sure what Penn is. As a result, we, the audience, do not like him as much as the team apparently does. In addition to the beautiful scenery and the superficial look that is nowhere near beautiful, the beautiful model thrown into the movie spice is a little recommended here. Perhaps its only redeeming quality (inadvertent) is that it is a great example of why the audience is important; and ignoring completely the storytelling conventions you make for their service. For this reason alone, do I think it would be a good film for film students? a kind of movie "what not to do". I have nothing against the film that has been said in an unusual way as long as it is skillfully done, with a thematic base to give it content. This movie is completely missing. <br /> <br /> I would like to call it a brave effort, but I'm not sure what it is except for the complete confusion and the waste of time. <br /> <br /> (As a note: it seems like a bad art is always good to remember. This movie made me think of Lillian Ross's book "Picture." Ross followed John Huston's "Courage red symbol" and documented it perfectly In fact, this would be a great movie. If you want an excellent meta-art show, read it.)
