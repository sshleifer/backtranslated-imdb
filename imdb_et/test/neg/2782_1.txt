I knew it well when I rented this DVD so that it could be one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. But by saying that it was one of the worst films I've ever seen, it would be easy. I don't know if there are some legal measures that could be taken against individuals who promised to produce this movie. I mean, financing was supposed to come from somewhere, somebody had to offer that money !! ?? but this film violated all the universe production standards. I couldn't do it through the whole movie because I started stunning filming techniques. I can't tell you how many scenes I just finished because there has been an inexplicably horrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that I am constantly in love with life. If you watch this movie before you get this warning, you should think about starting a support group with the poor people who saw this monster.
