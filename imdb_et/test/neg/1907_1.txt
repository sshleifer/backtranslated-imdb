Interference begins as unemployed Martin Sanders (Andres Bagg) hears something strange on his phone, a mysterious man who talks to a prostitute Diana and organizes a meeting. Soon after Martin reads the local paper and sees the story of the murder of a prostitute and thinks back what he heard. Martin trusts his friends Laura (Virginia Lustig) and Aaron (Oliver Kolker), but they don't believe him. Soon after, the same thing happens, a phone call, a man, a prostitute, and his death. Martin decides he must find a killer and stop his killing, but who is it? <br /> <br /> This Argentine production, which was apparently fired in just eight days (why so long?) about $ 3,000 (why so much?) was written and staged by Sergio Esquenaz and I can't believe some glow Comments Interference is on IMDb. Of the 195 user ratings when I write it out of 113, I appreciate it from 10 out of 10, I'm sorry, but nobody should give this movie quite literally perfect for 10 out of 10. The IMDb movie score is fixed, it is not right, I do not think that if you showed Interferencia to 195 middle people, more than 100 of them would appreciate it absolutely perfect, somehow on Earth. User comments are also amazingly positive, all IMDb users who have written comments on only one movie. One user (besides me) who wrote more than one comment gave him 10 of the bottom stones that sounds almost right. Everyone has the right to an opinion, but I would make my life contribute to the fact that most of these positive comments come from counterfeit accounts that have been created purely large. Where do I start? How can I describe enough on Earth how bad Interference is? The plot is a confusion that basically lives or dies because of its terrible twists, while most of the twists and turns will turn it on the top of the head and change everything that has gone intelligently and appropriately, and which are real surprises here in Interferen. in the first half of the movie, and it's totally pointless "it didn't really happen" as it is, and writhing is so badly handled that it leaves you with more questions than it answers. What made Martin mad? Why did he imagine phone calls? Why did he imagine the murder? Why did he portray newspaper headlines? There is no explanation for Martin's behavior during the first hour of the film, but the absurd revelation that it was all in his sense and that's all, it's the whole exposition. Then Martin's missing wife and her lover before Martin's plot, which causes unexplained reasons to kill her friends for no apparent reason. I'm sorry, but Interferencia is so bad, it's so boring, it's so badly written and thought that nothing can be said honestly. Sorry, dude, but that's how I feel, just Interferencia is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and it's a common sense both conceptually and technically. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, Interferencia was just eight days of hot, frankly, not familiar at all. No, it seems more than it was shot in five days! The whole movie is outstanding, Interferencia is probably the worst nightlife I've ever seen. It's like not making any attempt to illuminate the scene, it's like the makers just went into the dark room or basement or whatever and just shot the scene, regardless of whether you see anything. Scenes placed outside during the day, this terrible unnatural blue green tone for them is a visible cause that just looks and becomes more and more irritating. This strange tone is not repeated indoors, so they are quite jarring and noticeable. There is no real horror or fear, in fact, I would say that Interferencia is a thriller rather than a horror. As far as gore goes, there are two decapitated heads in the refrigerator, the knife is stuck in the mouth and nothing else. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, its budget was about $ 3,000, making Interferencia one of the lowest budget films ever released commercially? Some people think that just because a movie is a low budget, all reasonable standards of observation should go out of the window and we should accept any old mess, wrong! To watch it on DVD, you still have to pay good money and I personally think we have the right to wait for some good product. If it can get rid of and praise it as it is worth the Oscar, we can all release the video footage of our camcorder (including the embarrassing karaoke material and the scenes of complete dirt when we forget to remove the lens cap) and win the best prizes at the next Cannes Film Festival! Action is terrible, although the female leader Virginia Lustig is actually quite sexy and helps to relieve the pain of the last twenty minutes if she has a little bit. <br /> <br /> Interference is an absolutely terrible movie, seriously praying you must not deceive all the false positive comments, there is no one who would not participate in it or have some kind of agenda, give him 10 out of 10 or 10 of. through. Sorry, but this is the way I see it, sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind ... you are warned!
