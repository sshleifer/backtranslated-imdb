I've spent the last 5 years in an entertainment company and lately found myself for the company that makes this movie, which is a real pity, because I like these people, I just can't believe anyone could do anything bad like this? !!!! It was from all angles. One of the worst films I've ever seen was from camera work to dialogue until costumes and production. The actors in this film saw that they had been taken out of porn shot in the San Fernando Valley and set up with even less talented teams. <br /> <br /> I just can't get over the fact that I'm sitting on some of the best material I've ever read and contacting industry that could help me dream into reality and hit all possible obstacles? But the people behind this film have no problems together and actually sleep even after release. <br /> <br /> Life That Way!
