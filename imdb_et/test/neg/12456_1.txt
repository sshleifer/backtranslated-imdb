I don't even waste more time describing how bad this film is. Bottom line: it was terrible, it had huge plot holes and went down completely. The only good thing was what my digital cable gave to the movie: "A married man who has trouble doing business burns with his secretary." Ah ?? Obviously the wrong film is, although it may be a little more interesting if any description is true. <br /> <br /> - Shelly
