Some of the better changes (special effects are more complicated), some worse (Scott Grimes, the pleasant child of the original, have become an uncomfortable teenager), but in general, this is another original - which doesn't say much. The PG-13 rating is questionable; Although the film is not at all scary, there is some short but quite explicit gore and some inappropriate nudity. (* 1/2)
