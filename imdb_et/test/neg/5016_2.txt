I'm not so old that I don't remember Bobcat Goldthwait laughing a few times. However, some of them, during the years of drug abuse, lost both their sense of humor and their brain cells. <br /> <br /> Since this movie opened, there is no compassion or empathy for a woman's lead. Also, you won't find anything funny when you listen to the opening line. Goldthwait probably hates himself so much that he needs to get worse to feel better - even if he worsens his own imaginary signs. <br /> <br /> If you ever saw a clown shake, you know how unusual Bobcat was 15 years ago ... this movie is worse. It wasn't even casually funny. It's sad, pathetic and a waste of time. May May Goldthwait's hands paralyze him so he can't write another script. Hit your language so that it can't dictate another unusual scene. He is sad and pathetic and needs new talent to enter Hollywood
