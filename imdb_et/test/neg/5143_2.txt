The film's plot seems to have been built from a unique dream. There is not enough realism to keep the viewer interested. The Vermont Farm scene was an unfortunate opportunity to show how farms were established and the farm family lived, which would have been interesting and fun. The period of whiskey bootlegging-trade was not studied at all or not at all. Canadian costumes looked like a French revolution, which was absolutely incredible. The fig was a good and time-consuming, but Chris's movements, when supposedly played, were incredible. The appearance of the owls was once explained by the secret, and the train lost too much air. I couldn't understand how the life of the trout was frozen and why two men in the wilderness would eat good food without food.
