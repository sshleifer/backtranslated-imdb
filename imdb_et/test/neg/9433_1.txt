Meet Cosmoga (Jason Priestley), a young bookstore whose bored life hits numbers on the mobile and lives in a tough basement in the center of older citizens. His only holiday is watching television and occasionally trying Honey (Janeane Garofalo) with his peculiar prostitute. But one day, all this will change if the mobile phone is killed and well thought out by Cosmo, chosen by a smooth and convincing new leader, Gordon (Robert Loggia), to get a full hit. It's an offer that reluctant Cosmo can't repeat, can't be refused, and he sells quickly in his daily, lonely existence career revenge under the veteran mobstri Steve (Peter Riegert), a relaxed, suburban bonus city who enjoys maximum work pay and minimum hours. At some point, Cosmo will surprise himself and his mentor Steve, showing an absolutely unattractive fit to work. Although he has never been in contact with a weapon before, Cosmo proves to be both a cracker and an initial wave of moral hesitation. Soon, Cosmo will quickly and stylishly send to customers whose natural thrill with the gun will quickly create an invaluable addition to Gordon's mobile. <br /> <br /> Reality goes as if one night while being massaged by Honey, Cosmo admits that you feel a little bit upright and he suggests trying to relax yoga. Cosmo takes advice and joins a nearby yoga class taught by a beautiful young woman named Jasmine (Kimberly Williams). Cosmo is taken immediately with the delicate and delicate Jasmine, who quickly gets to Cosmo. Now that he can get rid of his irritating, malicious boyfriend, Randy (Josh Charles), maybe he and Cosmo can actually get started. Cosmo, using some of his new trade skills, finally convinces Randy to disappear and his relationship with Jasmine. <br /> <br /> Writer / director M. Wallace Wolodarksy, Double Emmy Award - "Tracy Ullman show" and "Simpson" winner have designed a script that combines his three genres: "I like comedies, gangsters, and romances, "explained Wolodarsky," so I broke all three of the stories in this movie. "But what he has highlighted is a movie that is so divorced and unlikely to look like a very long sketch on Saturday night. This is a monotonous tone that does not fit so lazy with a sense of humor as to emphasize the fact that Jason Priestly spent a lot of money on his vehicle, that his beautiful guy who fails because he plays his nature is not a joke but a laconic zombie. The kidney may be naive, but the kidney has a passion. Passion for inward-looking things. But Priestly plays her character mentally deficient, almost as an anti-Forrest gump. Unfortunately, "cold blood" does not have any scope to actually get the Forrest Gump against BE. <br /> <br /> Peter Riegert (the local hero, the animal house) is getting well and Kimberly Williams is doing his best, but Janeane Garofalo (HBO Larry Sanders Show) is practically his Cosmo friend. Probably not long. Garofal has all the waiting for the apples and it's just a matter of time before being given a plump role, hopefully dealing with Marisa Tome with the label team. <br /> <br />
