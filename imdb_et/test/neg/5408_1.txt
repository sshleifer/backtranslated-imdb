Although Casper van Dien and Michael Rooker are usually shot for B-films, they are even above that movie. It doesn't even transmit the slightest excitement, fear or fear - unless you read the fear of sitting through the rest of this garbage. The direction is amateurish and tedious cuts and a nervous movement that hides the fact that the killer is not near the victims during the attacks. And what a killer he is: a cheap skull mask and a black hood. I liked it better when he fought with He-Man. This is one of the biggest jobs I've seen. It's Skeletor! And he's on the horse! It should be a scary, supernatural creature? How should we take it seriously? All we get is the guy that drives his horse around the forest - which he can hardly miss - confused with the scenes of randomly firing soldiers, thinking they can shoot with a ghost. Sometimes Skeletor lets someone drive with an arrow or drive and pull someone, revealing the real consequences. I usually enjoy the Sci Fi channel fare at the base cheese level, but this movie is too enjoyable. Where is Dolph Lundgren when you need him?
