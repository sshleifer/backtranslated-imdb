This film was an in-depth slideshow. The story didn't develop. Viewers were thrown into the story without explanation and left to look after themselves, trying to work out what was going on. The sequences were okay but confusing. They weren't a Matrix and they weren't tigers. This movie is best left to cable TV where you don't have to pay to see it or convince a friend that they should hire it and then go out and watch. Like a huge Jet Li fan, I waited more. How can someone who is tied to China at one time put his name on it?
