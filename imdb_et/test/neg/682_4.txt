After seeing the film, I feel that father and mother are such a reasonable person, though not perfect. On the contrary, I don't like the author and his two sisters. <br /> <br /> Is the human magazine an exact portrait? No. Most of the time people write problems with their magazine because they want to solve the problem. So the magazine is always the negative side of the human being. In this film, the author evaluates his mother's life in his magazine. Not a wise choice. <br /> <br /> The author's older sister is so ugly, outer and inner. First, he said that his father's second marriage was not fair to his mother. Then he said he didn't love his mother. So he doesn't love both father and mother. I doubt he loves anyone in the world. His face is so ugly, but his heart's reflection. Through the film, I feel that the author and his sisters lack love and respect for their parents. But I feel that Dad is a mother who is very loving to his children, even if the author tries to portray them as a cold, deceptive person.
