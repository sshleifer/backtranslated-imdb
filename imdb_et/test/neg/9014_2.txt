The second gray, terrible band of the Corman family. The first space capsule in the outer space lands back to Earth (with some of the worst special effects) and the pilot seems dead. However, appearances can be deceptive. He's actually more alive than the rest of the cast, including the patronizing misogynist old doctor (who also really is really boring), a fatty man who looks like he is at an angle to the hair oil market. even make a lot of impression, a female scientist who never seems to be a ward of an old boy, and a female photographer Farah Fawcett's haircut (of course, ahead of Farah) and about the same liveliness as a dead duck. <br /> <br /> What are the names of these people? I think it was Steve. Apparently, all the cast persons, including women, were named Steve. Anyway, the dead pilot Steve turns out not only to be alive, but to incubate a child's aliens (or seahorses or shrimp or any) inside his torso. The Momma beast, who implanted these little critteries, looks like a giant bald parrot with candles. Once again, I am impressed by the magic of the monsters created by the Corman House. Venus's conquered carrot in the world is still officially the worst, most laughing monster I've ever seen, but Cormans can always offer bad, cheesy-looking monsters. They also managed to offer other brands; that is, boring, confusing plot, long gray shots (thanks to God Corman made most of his films in black and white, because his color things still look gray in color) two or three locations max, stupid and flat props and special effects, and much and boring dialogue. There are only two deaths in the movie (if you don't read the roasted parrot..err..a blood of the beast that is broken at the end of the movie). Good ground through, I'm sure if an alien hangs on the head of an old doctor and eats it (probably). Now you can speak English and have a doctor's memory. He can also move a pregnant astronaut as if he were Pinnochio. Monster's obvious intention is to restore his race by using people as food and giant females. At the end, there is a bit of confusion (well, confusing than usual), where the creature tries to explain why it does, but it makes no sense. Something about how mankind will follow and destroy something that they will soon create in the footsteps of their race. It never said what it was. It could have been anything from toaster ovens to digital watches that knows. Its babysitter picks itself up rather than letting the alien's shrimp climb out of his body and the oily guy (and the other boy) burning the parrot with a Molotov alien cocktail. Ahh, roasted chicken smell. The end of the story where the rest of the characters are robbing and leaving their dead comrades rotten. Oh, hell, why not save yourself at the funeral? I'm sure Corman thought when he tried to cut the corner and make his scenes as low as possible.
