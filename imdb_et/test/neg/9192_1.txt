One of the worst movies. Let's start superficially: Joaquin Phoenix is ​​first too greasy to be a rookie firefighter. NYFD doesn't take Pillsbury dough boys to work. John Travolt has a poor color job and the strange shine in his eyes throughout the film made me think he was some kind of expanded Scientology bender. Plot hits on all ropes and clichés that average Joe believes life is like a firefighter: they're all drunk, get into a fight, have a hard time expressing their emotions, their wives are all crying at home, they all have father questions, everyone has a Boston accent, etc. . Suffering a piece of schwarmeri playing our permanent cultural hero worshiping firefighters after 9-11. Years, by the way, was a valid cultural hero. Unfortunately, this film does not offer worshipable heroes.
