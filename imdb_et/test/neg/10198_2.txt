Unfortunately, I went to this movie for entertainment purposes, based on the limited information I saw on Fandangos. Since I'm a sci-fi buff, I thought about the idea of ​​a UFO movie. <br /> <br /> Instead, this movie quickly appeared as an evangelical Christian propaganda bode. Suitable for like-minded people, but very Christian, who want to use a movie center scene and announce to an unsuspecting audience, especially considering the cost of tickets and concessions. Shame on you! At least the Da Vinci code did not respect its wild madness. <br /> <br /> Thus, the production of this Class B movie (and I'm kind) is judged in churches with similar beliefs, probably on Wednesday and Sunday night in youth groups. But if you are a Christian or a non-Christian, you are not comfortable.
