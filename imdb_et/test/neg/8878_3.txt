It's not exactly a complicated story. It is not a mystery or a plot you need to look at because you have missed the inner part of the dialogue. Filming must be visible several times because it can be very small, but it is not one of them. These types of films have content and are so involved that it is important to ignore a significant part of the dialogue or the subtle nuances that the details you have ignored. This is not the case with Goya Ghosts. The main mistake of this film is the lack of details. It jumps from one character to another, giving enough scenes to any scene to allow them to be viewed. That's why you don't combine any characters. You won't reach the point where you care. Has the main actor gone just like the film seems to be redeeming himself, or their actions are despicable and you do not want anyway. A good example is Goya's refusal to go far into Ines. His refusal to allow himself reflects his overall tone. The only characters you can feel for a moment are Ines when she is questioned and then tortured. After Lorenzo's rape, any focus on his character is pretty much lost. As a result, the only deep participation in the film's best scene, at the heart of Lorenzo's invitation to dinner with Inese's family, and his fathers tried to force Lorenzo into a false confession and his daughter's return. Then, as things develop again, they have disappeared from the movie. I've read a lot of comments here about how the film didn't know what it wanted to be, etc. I found that in principle I managed to do a lot. When Lorenzo came back and Inese's daughter Goya accidentally looked, everything seemed nothing but poor. Without any major incident, there was no effort to really explore the unrest they lived. Who did not have Goya's character, apart from his actions or lack thereof, which proved to be more self-centered than anything else. As for his art, the intention of the film seemed to look at some of the land he did, but again hit another opportunity to explore the reactions of this work as work itself. All in all, there was no cohesion in the film, there was no serious substance in the historical environment it covered, and after you finished, I felt that what you just saw was an interrupted attempt to break the viewer. exchanging one thing from another without the observer being sufficiently connected with any of them. You won't be able to view this multiple times, waiting for it to improve with the additional exam. It is not enough simply to waste time. This is not the case if you missed out on something, it would be just more proof that the ingredients needed to make this movie just exist. Like the best film ever made? It's not even the best movie I watched today.
