The story was separate, it wasn't a rock. More of a real pilot than a real movie. I wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't find it. Whatever it was that made the missing boys so pleasant, there probably wasn't. Altho tried hard. The plot hooks were placed in the middle of the dark, which could have been the episode of the dawsons stream with dark clothes, and the story immediately passed. Very disappointing for me. The end of the scenes were special effects driven by comfort and how the villain in the story planned throughout his plan .. who he was (or he) trying to child, talk naive. Watch movies of this genre from the eighties when they had more ideas.
