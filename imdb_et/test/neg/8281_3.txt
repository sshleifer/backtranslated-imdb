This movie is slow. This movie is cheap. This movie will be on Friday 13. looks like the best picture. Action is a mess. Special effects are nonsense. No one dies like 40 minutes and all people do it badly. The only thing that saves you is that it is able to make you laugh. The funniest part looks at the heroine attacker. He had to be trained, but he was fighting like 70 years old. They spend unnecessary scenes on people who do not die and are not scenes for people who die in a place where you don't even know why they die. I love slasher, but it's just a mess.
