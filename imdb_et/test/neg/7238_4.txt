When I saw the first octagonal film, I laughed to see cheesy and terrible effects. This movie seemed to work, but not special effects. Jawide and Piranha, why not make a killer octopus movie? Octopus penetrates New York waters, where 2 police investigators try to stop ramping the beast before July 4th. <br /> <br /> Pretty clean plot and landing habits, but the octopus was pretty terrible, nice to see they did it this time, but it seemed to be plastic ... It's really great on a big budget, this movie might have been good to watch. There is a constant set of errors if I am not surprised if they do not explore the octopus lifestyle ... <br /> <br /> See if you like a cheap DVD order, otherwise your better views.
