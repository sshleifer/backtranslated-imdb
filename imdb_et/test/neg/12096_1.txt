This is perhaps the worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen over 300 movies in my lifetime. It seems that the acting scary, the only bright spot is the assessment of the anatomical capacity of the judge's wife. After watching the movie, it is recommended that the viewer does not use a heavy machine or drive for at least 24 hours. It would also be advisable to have a bottle of Valium, so you won't feel so bad for 100 minutes. The plot is nothing original, the dialogue is amazing, and even the guns look below. Benefit and go to your local Blockbuster and burn copies of this knocking film.
