As a Christian, I found this film completely embarrassing. Actors wonders, writing sucked, cinematography sucked and the story was so typical. I could not say that this is a great witness tool because I was too embarrassed to show me my unsaved friends. Hollywood has much better things and because they invest the best. Christians put their * tty job and think it is OK because "it's lord". In the Old Testament, people spent a lot of money to bring offerings to God. David (or Saul .. I don't remember) spent what would be about $ 50 billion for today's money to build God's temple. However, spending these days, which seems to be about $ 30,000, is simply pathetic to people "making" a movie. It's a person, not a product that affects anyone. Don't waste your time trying to convert your friends into a waste of one and a half hours. If you want to have a positive impact on people, show them movies like The Matrix, American Beauty, Braveheart, etc.
