My boss at this time and showed it at our office at the Halloween party. He is Chris Huntley, who wrote and acted on it. He knows it's bad, we know it's bad and we all agree that the monster sees WAY too much like a vagina to be a coincidence. Maybe it was from a gynecological experiment that went wrong. <br /> <br /> It was a very small budget and the actors were all friends, so what you have here is "hey gang, lets show". <br /> <br /> Nobody hurt and this was the first attempt. There's nothing wrong with that. It all gave us a good laugh and it is a great movie to watch with friends and entertain. :-)
