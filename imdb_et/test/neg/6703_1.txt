Hi guys, this is my first review and I should have chosen the worst movie. Because I watched it for just 5 minutes, but trust me that this movie doesn't look anywhere. Action was unfortunate, the camera's work and lighting seemed to be like a 10-year package. No violation of the 10-year-olds. I just couldn't go any more when I got off the couch, picked up Adam's house DVD from the DVD player and threw it in the garbage. Perhaps, if you are a fan of Colin Farrell, this movie may be of interest to you because the film's character Anthony is Colin Farrell. But that's as far as it goes, he certainly never gets Col's to act on his abilities. I gave this movie a rating of 1 (terrible) just because there were no drawbacks from the drop-down menu.
