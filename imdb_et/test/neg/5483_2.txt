Comments left for this show are more fun than the show itself and everything is accurate. I know exactly how I am very disappointed how far Rick Mercer has fallen, when he really felt great things for that hour, 22 minutes, but now he's talking about clowns, places and people. He does some things in the studio about things in the news, but they're not funny at all, but very sad and predictable jokes about titles. Most of his exhibitions are going to talk to people somewhere, for example, this week he's rodeo and video games are all that make funny faces and scare wild horses, etc. has become less funny because he leaves that hour 22 minutes and this show is no longer funny. Now that Air Farce is out of the air (ultimately thanks for the goodness!) Mercer and this lesson will be next to the church in 22 minutes, but an old tired, predictable comedy that almost no one is funny anymore. It's really sad, given that Rick Mercer was a more fun man of Canadian television!
