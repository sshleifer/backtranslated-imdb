I really should give this smell more credit for 1 star because the film has so many eye-running features that it is almost worth the rent. <br /> <br /> Acting if you want to call it is so clean and conceivable that it will make Ed Wood actors alive. "Sammy", a lonely black character, must be Mimi's husband in real life because he appears in his other films, but he has zero capability. His lines are invaluable because of his absurd surrender, although I suspect that he was going to create a sympathetic character. His old man forms his second turkey ("Pushed To The Limit") is not a budget, junior high school quality, cotton eyebrow and white spray painted hair. <br /> <br /> I can't really understand anyone buying this video unless people want to throw their Mystery Science Theater parties and need something like that. It's really a farther away - it's actually more fun.
