What a waste of big pain. I thought I'd look at it because it looked like a good stoner comedy with a lot of well-known actors. What was proved was a meaningless collection of boring interwoven stories associated with multiple characters with minimal links to each other. Characters who look like human beings, but cannot find any pleasant or interesting character among them. Calling this comedy was also stretching ... the only thing that made me fool was the Jack Black song, which was basically Tenacious D. I was expecting something big, but it happened that I didn't waste more than 97 minutes of my life. .
