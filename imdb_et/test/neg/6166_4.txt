By the same name as Elmore Leonard's novel, Killshot suffers from lack of focus, direction and creativity? all the elements that the original story was likely to have, and the negative tests forced serious changes (including the perfect character) that resulted in a film that looks almost like the story of Leonard. Too many characters are in a too simple and understandable way (not a typical feature of the author's work) and the focus is constantly changing between the two caught men who are hard to please, and the worrying couple who do not attend our compassion. Although the story itself offers valuable little turns, the end of the movie is still a secret. <br /> <br /> Armand The Blackbird Washed Shock Catcher Degas (Mickey Rourke) follows a strict code during his missions that involuntarily captures his last mission. Now that he was in his former employer, he accidentally connects with violence that violates Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to get quick money in violation of a wealthy real estate agent. When the couples Carmen and Wayne Colson (Diane Lane and Thomas Jane) fought, they were stolen from thefts because they were forced to hide because the crazy killers did not let the two witnesses remain silent. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> </p> Movie characters, situations, and even resolutions are all tired and unrelenting, and nothing more than a haphazard hint. It is not that there was no potential there, especially when Rourke black, calm and collected assassin perfectly fills the hit in the opening picture? the goal and the principals are simply left aside every minute. Style and the way each character is introduced is the most interesting; visually, Bird's and even Wayne's roles are perfectly presented, giving immediate interest and depth to those who usually end up with a creative impasse. <br /> <br /> Cold bonding and computing Black Bird with irrational and explosive effects Richie is an appealing combination (comparisons with Fargo would be extremely benign), except that each character seems to be a slow sign of the qualities that were initially interesting to them. When Richie begins to experience the habits of the more experienced killer, Bird loosens his own method of murder. Regardless of what he sees as Donna (Rosario Dawson )'s current state of affairs, it is hard to imagine that his final confrontation with Panic Carmen would testify to his true nature and the subsequent negligence, which has a significant impact on his outcome. Probably or not, is Killshot's unfortunate decline? little entertainment can be gathered from those characters who are constantly losing their originality, constantly contrasting the habits that made them intriguing. <br /> <br /> - Massie twins
