****************** SPOILER ******************** SPOILER ********** ********** This movie collided. Let me now say that I fully agree with what the carissaphillips said about it. What was Sam thinking? He was with a man who told him he loved him (three times in total), was extremely hot and was trying to get him (Josh Hartnett). But he decided to break him, not to deceive him with a snob, ugly, spoiled, rich jerk loser who didn't say he loved him in the whole movie (wait, he wrote on the wall, does it read?), And he left the time he needed because he was scared (Chris LOSER Klein). Who would you like to be? The only reason I sat the whole movie was because it was Josh Hartnett and hoping he could eventually die. I wanted Jasper to get another girlfriend who was really worth her. The whole thing about your "mother" was funny. I enjoyed it. I hate it when the people here say it, but I think Kelley deserves it. Jasper should have said that to Sam, he needed a good blow. How romance began to be a mystery to me. They never said anything to each other, so I don't understand how they came together. "I was thinking of the cheese sandwich you gave me ... whether you had mustard or mayonnaise or ....." Oh, what comes. Allegedly romantic lines were so stupid. Plus he's a whispered UGLY! I have to admit that I called in this movie. For a long time, really hard. Not because he died, but because he broke Jasper's heart. He shouted this movie so many times ... he tried to smile at him, but he couldn't stop tears. He cried when 1) He told him he loved him 2) He got sick 3) Chris Klein came back and saw how happy he was 4) he died. I cried as he cried because he loved him all his life and told him, and yet he was stupid enough not to care and love a man who left him during his needs and who was NOT in the funeral. 1 1/2 stars only because I love JOSH HARTNET! Oh, by the way, Chris Klein, your mother! -Wiley sis
