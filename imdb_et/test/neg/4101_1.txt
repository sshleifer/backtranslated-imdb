What might have been a good story was destroyed by a ridiculous time scenario. If something was changed in the past that changed evolution and people never developed, the time machine would never be built. If anything brought about by the past, it would have no effect on the past. <br /> <br /> I really want filmmakers to guide their actual scientist before finalizing the script. Even if you stop the reality and assume that travel is possible, you need to stay logic. <br /> <br /> OTOH, Ben Kingsley seemed to have a great time with his excellence. All other participants seemed to have done the best. It was the letter that left them in the wind. <br /> <br /> "Back to the Future" handled it better.
