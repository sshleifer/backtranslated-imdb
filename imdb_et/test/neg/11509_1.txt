Of course, Sadie sucks a lot of time, I have no idea what people thought about writing this garbage. It is not funny, in no way a shape or a form of cute, it's just disturbing and a waste of money. Sadie is such a bad actor. I lost all my brain cells looking at this example, honestly it seemed like this exhibition was forced, it was such a big surprise. The waste of this time and the money do not bother watching this garbage. The characters are so stupid and ridiculous. In the first season, it was just stupid and stupid when I saw another season that I just couldn't take away, it made me want to kill Charlotte Arnold. Another season is Disney's shameful.
