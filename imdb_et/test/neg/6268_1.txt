Do you hear that sound? This is the sound of H.G. Wells in his grave, between this version and Spielberg's cinematic abortion, is a difficult year for the classical novel. But at least Steven got a couple of things compared to this crapper. Hi, the ships were not big insects, they had names. They were statues and foreigners worked thirty. Ships and foreigners were all wrong, you can't finally see the aliens. Impact and cast work are good. But these actors are much better than this "film" deserves. If not all the films are a larger number of Howell, who wonders through one person, they joined him and he loses them for one reason or another. The camera has no more than two people, though most of the movie. It's like when they filmed three times at a time, it would put the movie over budget or something. So fat is the only one and the only guarded adjustment for the World War season is the GEORGE PAL version back in the 1950s. BLACK HOLE.
