My reasoning for watching this movie (even though it was free) was more or less curious ... little, little curiosity ... I wasn't all familiar with this direct video "biographically" Given Mr. Gein and discovered the open credit At the time, he played starring in the fear icon of Kane Hodder. My emotions turned not only to curiosity, but now to a glimpse of the glow of how his image of Gein appears. Also in credits (among the bad pictures of some of Ed's crimes) was Michael Berryman and Priscilla Barns. "Okay," I thought ... "It might be a little fun". As the film started and slowed down (slowly), the film's microscopic trust (or, if I call it, "micro-hope") disappeared completely and I was stuck because I died a little inside so I looked at a bunch of manure. Hodder, who is widely known for his previous work and an unstoppable serum killer, incorrectly puts this game here - making Eddie Gein a soft visa as an extraordinarily dead machine. He casts out at night, killing caretakers of cemeteries, robbing friends and teenage girls, leaving Plainfield in panic because the local sheriff department does nothing to adjust to the dangerous situation. The deputy and his mother have a warm, small relationship that gave me the inside (or could have been the pill of the cyanide that I used half of this turkey). I'm not sure what the idea of ​​this movie was, and apparently the director didn't know anything about him with which he worked. The story of Gein is already so many movies that if "Ed Gein Snuff Footage" is not discovered, I don't want to see them on the shelves anymore. If you want a more authentic film of this kind than to watch the 2001 Ed Gin (called Moon Light).
