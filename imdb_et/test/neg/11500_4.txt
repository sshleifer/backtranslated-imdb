Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and serve it so I am happy to see their films. Ollie is recovering from a broken leg in the hospital and Stan does not decide to visit her or take her boiled eggs and nuts. Chaos begins with Stan, which draws an interesting Ollie bike, and succeeds in pushing the doctor out (Billy Gilbert) out of the window, fixing it to get the Ollie ceiling. When the situation calms down, Stan Ollie gets the clothes because the doctor wants them both to leave, and also manages to sit on a syringe that the nurse has accidentally fallen asleep with a drug that comes into force while driving (which can be said to be carried on a large screen by car. slapstiga and not too bad (though repetitive and predictable) classic comedy, it's not great, but it's a black and white film Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were comedian comedians of the 7th.
