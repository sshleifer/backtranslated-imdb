Congo is another multidimensional adaptation of Crichton's works. Like Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Sphere, and others, the film was raped with a book of its true meaning and nature. I'll make that short and point. The landscape is beautiful. Actors, well that's the best they can do. Script? Try loading hundreds of pages over an hour and a half of a movie. Finally, you get confused, but if the mess is what counts and Congo falls somewhere below. Were there some foolish moments, why did killer gorillas decide to jump into the stage? By people surrounded by people, Amy, surrounded by people, can scare dozens of killer monkeys around him? What is common sense? What brings me to it. If every movie had a tedious character, Amy is one of them. You see, Amy is this naive little female monkey who can talk to a special backpack and harness attached to her. Nice idea, but after a while hear his speech. Congo is a worthwhile, but not unfortunate, but certainly not a memorable film.
