Ha ha! First of all, if you have never seen "Dimension Film" that is really nice for you! Known mainly for SUPER LOW BUDGET Horror / Slasher films, "Beowulf" was no exception. <br /> <br /> But this video was rather ultra-smooth. I abandoned the K-R-A-F-T label. <br /> <br /> Think of anachronisms! <br /> <br /> We had: candles, armor, swords .... <br /> <br /> Yet we saw: telescopes, soled shoes, cigarette lighters, loudspeakers, electricity, body bags, aluminum foils and spoons / forks. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad thing that happens like in the 8th century! <br /> <br /> It's not a horror movie, it's a terrible movie. Its very ridiculous. It's really a comedy that looks like a horror movie! I couldn't stop laughing! <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert ("The Highlander Series") - must be really a drum in his career when he works on "Dimension Films". <br /> <br /> I've learned my lesson. I'm watching video studios, LOT more now. If you want to laugh, it's hard to go to work! <br /> <br /> This move was somewhat mottled - especially the blond bimbett! <br /> <br /> Wayno <br /> <br />
