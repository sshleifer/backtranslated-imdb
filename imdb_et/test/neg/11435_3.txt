I was told that Joni had some spiritual experience for a while. I thought the film was interesting. In fact, it is not at all. Not so deep on such a subject. "eternity" endless life. Experience after death and "dejava". The film is not comedy, but not funny, at least not yet expressed. It's so naive. Charming movie, but naive film. Must be avoided. Medieval sequences seem to come straight from fairy tales and this is not a question at all. Eileen Davidson is so charming and Voight is doing her best. The common producer and scriptwriter of this movie is the usual one. The movie was launched directly on video to discover it from a video store. I'm sorry, because I know well that Voight is seriously related to spirituality and the film is not so deep.
