Why did they release this movie for us? They seem to have put this movie together with Anne Rice and every self-respecting Vampire Chronicles fan. It ignores the ground work done on the Vampire interview, violates the plot of the novel, and has stuart Townsend stumbled drunk. <br /> <br /> Stuart is not our Lest! Our prince, our adventurous insurgent fucking humor. Stuart IS is the second rate that dracula's black leather drill. He didn't read the books and didn't know that character ... was he illiterate? Tom Cruise is dyslexic and still made books to read and feel Lestat. <br /> <br /> Don't joke, it's not a "Stand Alone" vampire.
