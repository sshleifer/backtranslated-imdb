After watching Avalon (which was only very nice because of the very nice digital fx) and several Oshii-written anime movies, including Jin-Rohi (which is fantastic), I decided to review the Oshii movie trilogy set. As the red glasses and a number of dogs are interlinked, I comment on both. And let me tell you that this was one of the biggest waste of money I've spent for a while. I first looked at Stray Dogs and then the Red Glasses. I'm sorry to say that these movies are quite boring for the two most movies I've ever seen. Only about 10 minutes in every movie you can see some of the activities between the characters who are just "Panzer Cop" outfitted for some short scenes. In the rest of the time, you will see some scenes that are somewhat drawn in less than impressive places, full of boring dialogue. I do not really understand the motivation of these two films. I love Wolf Brigade equipment and the idea, but the films themselves leave much to be desired. I would recommend not watching these movies and definitely not buying such a box like me if you don't waste money. Oh, and if you don't know what I think about the 3rd film, the driver said, I couldn't even look at it before I caught my DVD collection on eBay with a loss of $ 20. If you want to cool Japanese live activities, check out Returner or Ichii the Killer or the Zeiram series.
