The film was supposed to be released in 2002 and was expected due to ads, but was finally released in 2003 after the manufacturer's death. <br /> <br /> The film is partly good, but it is generally not <br /> <br /> <br /> Scenes between Rani and Ajay are okay, but the other scenes are not well handled <br /> < br /> The film is too similar to BOLLYWOOD Hollywood, and although it was planned before it was first released, originality is lost <br /> <br /> Milan Luthria disappears generally after KACHCHE DAAGE. <br /> <br /> The music is good, but too many songs <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan looks like jaded and his looks make the movie late and his action seems boring too Rani is good Sonali is a good too rest is okay
