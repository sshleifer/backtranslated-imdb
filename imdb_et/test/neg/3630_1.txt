Blonde main character, always believes in everyone and when you get together you can do something! Shy guy best friend curly hair (rip off Gordo) wants to be a movie director at secret crush zoey. Spain's best friend (hanging from Miranda) A strange smart girl Quinn (ripping Lary Tudgemen) and popular stock preparation Logan (tearing off the cover) And Zoey's little brother Max, annoying (cut off from Matt) <br /> <br /> Zoey's half a popular girl with two best friends. The only thing that was missing was the funny little ecclesiastical comic by Lizzie Mcguire, and Hillary Duff was much nicer. Jamie Lynn Spears looks more like a toothpick on the head.
