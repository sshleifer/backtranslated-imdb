A boring, completely predictable soap opera. Mary Tyler Moore is married to Ted Danson, who communicates with Christine Laht. Moore is loose with friends and doesn't know about cheating. Danson dies in an accident and Lahti is pregnant with a child. YAWN! <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to say that I paid the money to see it in the theater in 1986. I know I knew what would happen. As the second poster said, it plays like a lifelong movie called PG. Also there are meaningless shots of topless women who play football (!!!). Other than it's TV-friendly. The only good thing about this was Timothy Gibbs, who played Moore and Danson's teenage son. Very beautiful and quite good actor. This does not support anything. You've seen it ... and done better. It's probably forgotten. Skip it.
