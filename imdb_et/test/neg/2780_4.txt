Dark Harvest is a very low budget production made by a number of sorted amateurs who can come up with a kind of semi-professional film. Unfortunately, this bad effect, the woody and superstitious story at best makes it a very mediocre horror. Under no circumstances is Dark Harvest the worst horror film I've ever seen, it's just something special and it has nothing to justify another look or hope. You know that the director has doubts about his horror film when a) has nonsense nudity, and b) the film is so short that they end up with a rather boring ending that no one cares about because the film wasn't that good! The slightly better film I can't feel was inspired by Dark Harvest's eighties film "Scarecrows", which is OK, but still quite average. <br /> <br /> Dark Harvest is not as bad as some other comments say it is, but does not believe that you will be offered entertainment. One thing I have to comment on is the character of Angela, who really has a terrible English accent! What was in that sense?! Maybe for him a certain class of touch? Yeah, of course! English people don't say "WAAHTAAH" if they want to say "water" and I don't care what part of England they come from! If you can't find a real English actress or non-English actress who can put a brilliant English accent (not many of them), DON'T KNOW! Sheesh! Final Score: 4/10
