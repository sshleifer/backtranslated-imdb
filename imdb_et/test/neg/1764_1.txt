*** MILD SPOILERS *** Dear Inman, The words of Gloves are just for me hard to find for the description of the film I just got for you. Problems are far-reaching and painful to understand me again. . . but I feel I have to, if I would, not only that others would not suffer the same anguish as I do. It's not a movie for under 50s, it's sloooowwwww, soooooo slowwww, and when the big reunion of Ada and Inman takes place. . The biggest and most important scene of the film, NOTHING happens, is an epic decline. Now, as the director should have done, I keep my words short and finished with this warning, your movie is divorced, boring, no flow, and Jude Law is tragically wrong, he showed more emotion than robot A.I. - Be warned that the movie must be taken back. . . A boring mountain. Love, Ada
