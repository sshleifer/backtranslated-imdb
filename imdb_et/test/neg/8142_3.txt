The film is a pathetic attempt to bring Ingmar Bergman's "Autumn Sonata" (1978) around Ingrid Bergman, Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson. It didn't take me more than 5 minutes to figure it out. <br /> <br /> It's time Movie journalists like Khalid Mohammad took some time to make some creative thoughts. This makes me sad when potentially good filmmakers are wasting their talents by making poor quality remakes of Hollywood and European films. <br /> <br /> You have to give the filmmaker something. The film chosen to make a copy is one of Bergman's classics and is easily one of the best cases of intense human relationships in European cinema.
