As a fan of Genghis Khan, I was expecting this movie. After reading and reading the historical records of Conn Igguldens' epic novels in Genghis, I feel I know something about this subject and was glad to share my knowledge with friends through this movie ... <br /> <br /> It turned out to be a scam. This film is practically composed from start to finish. There are some things that seem right, but in most cases it is the faith of the writers. It doesn't have to be a problem, I like good entertainment like someone else, unfortunately it's mostly boring. There's nothing about the size in this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie if you know something about this topic.
