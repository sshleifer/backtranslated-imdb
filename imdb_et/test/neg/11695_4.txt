As far as the Asian horror is concerned, I have seen the share of my disappointments with some unthinkable sh * t imagination. It had a few moments of tension and it was interesting to look at, but I couldn't believe that there should have been more for this story. The film deals with a couple without children who decides to have a child, who seems to be excited about the disability. He develops his yard's communications with acacia trees and seems to be communicating with it. Then, during the fight with her mother, she rushes with her new birth for a child when she threatens to find a dead mother who is now a tree. If he doesn't come back, the parents will send the report and wait while the neighbor girl believes he lives in the Acacia tree. Stimulation is rather slow, and the end is a bit strange, but I have to recommend it for a bit more enjoyable effort, although the story seems a bit flat. Hell, I can't really understand it ...
