Despite being one of John Cusack's and Demi Moore's early films, it is even one of the most difficult fans if they don't have to completely stop the collection. I have some rare moments where I can handle Better Off Dead, but this movie is finally worse. I'm not just a Savage Steve Dutch fan, and he did both movies. So if you don't like cheese, casual comedy and amateur animation, beware of it. FYI even for Demi Moore fans: he can't sing and the 80s synthesizers won't save him. Too many predictable twists and too easy jokes. I think if you want meaningless entertainment or something that you can leave behind and ignore when you do something productive, go to it. Otherwise, don't look at this movie. If John Cusack (or Demi Moore) couldn't save it, you know it's gonna be bad. These are the only reasons I didn't give this movie a 1.
