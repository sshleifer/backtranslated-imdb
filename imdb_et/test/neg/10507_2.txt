As I said, sometimes a low budget is good. You can see a good movie without much additional features that can hide otherwise the penis. Well ... it was this mess. If anything, I thought it had humor, unfortunately humor was unintentional. The only semi-delightful act came from Bill Smith and his part was cut out (this is a joke). There was never Bill Smith or anyone who could act. Even Gerald Okamura wonders and he's in most 40 movies. The fighting scenes were comic and made me feel like I could beat all my $% # @ # $. The sound was terrible as if all the sound was recorded in the set. My 10-year-old could have written a better script ... BTW, my 10-year-old old sleep ... is no joke. I'll give B + only 90 minutes to cut the movie ... 60 minutes would have been A +.
