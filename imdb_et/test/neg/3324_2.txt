I should have known when I heard about the departure of Anne Rice from the project so the film would betray me. I would not have been able to predict that one year after its release, thinking of the film is still thinking. The novels are amazing, and although I understand that the screen is going to be lost when translating the screen, this movie was a big finger for its original work. I hope one day somebody will try again, the right way, starting with Vampire Lestat. They change the role and appearance of both important and small characters without good reason. They destroy the history of Lestat. Queen's behavior is exaggerated for comedy, but I just can't laugh. The charm and enthusiasm of the novels is simply not there. The film is a bad excuse to bring as many musicians and "dark" images into one movie, hoping that the American goths would shut it down. Part of the complaint about the first movie of Louis's story is that he was caught between his humanity and his curse. Lesta should take over and show the magic and excitement of the vampire world. Thank you, I read books for the first time or I have never touched them for a movie.
