This film was one of those films in which he deceived me completely to think that it was the cover of the jaws of the 1980s, which was based on the lid, but it was not. It was probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. The picture on the cover did not match any part of the film or scene; In fact, it does not include a chainsaw. Not even the tag line fits the film. In the movie, there are a group of cheerleaders and two potheads who flee from an abandoned cabin, a cold forest, a weekend getaway. But things get a premium when they start killing an unknown killer. At the same time, the local sheriff department heats a dangerous killer. I call the list of problems. <br /> <br /> 1. Acting. The boy was cheap and terribly bad. It seemed unnatural and it seemed very written. None of the actresses seemed as if they were trying to perform with good intentions and therefore they seemed stupid and tired. All the characters in the movie worked badly, so I can't point out specific people, but I want to say that the stoners did a terrible job, as well as the police and cheerleaders, which is no surprise. br /> <br /> 2. Content. This story had created the perfect story for a good slip of fashion, but instead it stood on the smudge-holes, useless and unnecessary scenes, and the general stupid story of the killer's intentions. There were big parcels, including how the killer killed the last victim so quickly and was still in the group of girls when it happened? Ex-con practically did not give the film any purpose, as it was not a useless plot device. There was casual and unnecessary sex and nudity, even for a b-movie or for my taste, it was a bit too much. As for the killer's intentions, just say it was stupid, and there is no point in why he kills young girls. In addition, there were very predictable killings, which I saw about 30 miles away. <br /> <br /> 3. Technical side. The lighting was okay, it was definitely not the worse illumination I saw in the movie, but there were points where it was supposed to be dark, but it seemed more in the afternoon. The house seemed darker when the lights were on, the lights came out. The work of the camera was average, it had no good pictures or amazing panties or enlargements, I thought it was a work done, there is a certain relationship when creating this frame. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is a plot of land, character formation and performance were a huge disappointment and waste of my time. I thought it would have been a big sliding flick that turned out to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. The action was very bad and the wood was barely worthwhile and the film had no emotions. The technical aspect of this movie saved me, because if the camera was running or the lighting was bad, I would have turned off the DVD player and turned on something else. I recommend this movie to those who really enjoy chef's b-movies and those who follow the classic of culture because this movie is definitely. I'd like to partially recommend this movie to those who enjoy the 80s slip. But for me, this film was pathetic and totally terrible.
