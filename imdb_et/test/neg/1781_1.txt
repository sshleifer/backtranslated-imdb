Even under most B-movie standards, this film is the worst I've ever seen. Graphics are so poor that a man with a monster looks more realistic. Ocean water effects are especially ridiculous, including one scene where they enter the miniature, and "water" looks like frozen. The problems with this movie are so numerous that I just stop here with details. Needless to say, I'm not doing you when I say that even the Uwe WC Boll itself could do a better job. Avoid this movie at all costs, there are other B-Class movies that, despite being terrible, are at least a good way to pass the time.
