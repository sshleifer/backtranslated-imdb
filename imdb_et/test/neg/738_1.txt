It is difficult for a lover of Northanger's monastery to sit down and keep the objects on the TV screen with the adaptation of the BBC - in fact, if Jane Austen would see it, she would be somewhat amusing and possibly out. The adaptation of Maggie Wadey has changed the Gothic novel (and the readers of Gothic novels) of the Norther's monastery, which it satirizes. <br /> <br /> Catherine Morland's role in adaptation is quite close to Austin's Catherine, an open - dear, generous girl whose imagination just goes with her. But the novel Henry Tilney is not a naughty, stainless, gothic hero - he is a bully, almost beautiful man with a messy room and lively (that's right, Henry Tilney is a clergy, a charm that has completely fallen off the script. Some of the best of the novel Scenes when Henry, completely dead, tends to cripple literally thoughtless Catherine, magazines, Mrs. Radcliffe, etc. are not depicted in adaptation. Much of Henry's personality will disappear if these scenes are not adapted. Moreover, Peter Firth's appearance is not accurate - Henry Tilney should be 24 or 25, dark hair and brown skin, not 35 or 40 and blonde. <br /> <br /> There are so many other absurdities in the adjustment that it refers to the surprise and disgusting of the martyr and what he's doing Why is John Thorpe less dunce and more schemer? Why is the Northanger monastery castle? Roman Catherine is waiting for her romantic visions of hidden passageways and dark wall tapes, but is very cheated discovered that the Northanger Monastery is actually a comfortable, modern house - another satire element! Why Imagine Generic Tilney When Drunk? Why Catherine has these strange visions of Mrs Allen, who has her finger and the like. Catherine's imagination runs only with her in Northanger, where Henry gently adjusts. And finally, why have so many facts about Tilney's family and Mrs. Tilney's death changed unnecessarily? To make this story more "terrible?" All these strange and simpler ones are too strange to ignore them. <br /> <br />>
