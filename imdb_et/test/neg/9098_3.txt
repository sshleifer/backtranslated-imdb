I remember seeing this movie clip on HBO when I was a kid, and it frightened me of a nonsense. When I found it, I looked at it. I wish it wasn't. The film was not scary. <br /> <br /> The plot rotates around the castle's old woman. He feeds this terribly dispersed person in the basement of a 12th century castle. He constantly harms the poor man every day and feeds him. That day he dies. Then a few months later the family moved in. Father, mother and their blind daughter. The father was involved in a terrible car accident that got his son dead and left his daughter blind. above all. This is until some people die. Apparently the creature in the basement is free and kills people. How has this thing survived in the last few months without food or spending? Every time I saw this creature, it gave me a slip. The creature goes to a terrible hell and the police accuse the father of deaths. <br /> <br /> It was a pretty bad movie. Creepy not scary!
