I was watching this movie first in the mid or late 80s when I was a child. We couldn't even do it. Dialogue, actor, everything was just flat over. <br /> <br /> Here are a few examples ... Imagine that they are actually talking dramatically, how much did you do: "Oreegon? You go to Oreegon? Why would anyone want to go to Oreegon?" <br /> <br / > "Survivalists? Nobody ever got us from every survivor!" <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad, my sister and I rented it again for the 16th birthday so our friends could sit and laugh when it was terrible. I don't think we could have finished it!
