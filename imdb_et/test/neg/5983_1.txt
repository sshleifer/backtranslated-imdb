There's nothing that the viewer could name and call "good." The action was boring and sedated. Sets and cinematography look like someone who grew up in Starbucks and tried to make the perfect Gapi. Characters have no car, no motivation, no reason to care for them. There is no interest and tension that is difficult to follow in banal activities and dialogue. And the plot ... if anyone finds it, I'm sure it would be as boring as everything else. <br /> <br /> It's not funny, it's not romantic, it doesn't reflect the human condition. If you want a good stoner comedy, look at Half-Baked; if you want a good stoner drama, see Trainspotting. The only reason I gave this 2 instead of one is that it is fun to see some familiar faces in the mid-90s. What is the low reason to give the film even one star, but then again it is low.
