FREDDY FORSYTH has created a story that fits West's doubts about Putin's Russia. Forsyth installs a nasty guy who wants to return to the country - not so much to Stalin's Communism, but more to Hitler's fascism. In fact, his political manifesto may have appeared directly in Mein Kampf as Marx. The line has the latest weapons of biological destruction to achieve the Russian Federation's ethnic cleansing pogom. American mercenaries associate Russian with Prez to realize their fanatical, genocidal dream, but then enter Dirty Dancing's Pat Swayze ... and yes, things are going down and dirty. He is a former US-turned, Jason Monk, involved in the British government to see what the Russians are ready for. Swayze's character, who is not Monk (!), Is in the form of a bright sidebar of Russian beauty Elena (played by proud Marta Kondova) from her earlier missions in the former Commie country. Hardman Swayze is struggling to get the job done to defeat the Russians. But the young unknown actor Marta Kondova steals it to the nick, the 18-year-old Russian daughter Elena, who helps her father grab her beloved mother with the terror threatening Russia.
