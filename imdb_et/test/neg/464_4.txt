The movie is expensive and the cage is a kid. <br /> <br /> But does anyone agree with me saying that the punk representation in this movie is ATROCIOUS?!?! <br /> <br /> where is the collision? ramoons? misfits? social distortion? seizures? Sex Guns?! ALL?!?!?!?! Music is this movie is incredibly disappointing! at LEAST they play treatment. <br /> <br /> plus, randy's feathered hair and pleated khaki ... <br /> <br /> it definitely looks like the "punks" movie, with a bunch of film industry squares seeing the dots. <br /> <br /> Although this is a 90s film, SLC punk paints a much more accurate picture of a punk-rock scene in the early 1980s. just say.
