If you plan to schedule your program for a film festival, don't be fooled by what it says in the brochure. It is a complete waste of time and energy. I looked at Bunuel, I saw Dali and admired them; but it is not surreal, it should not be at all. Did they ever think of the image of humanity when taking this picture? After global warming is dead, they are the remains of our civilization. What if foreigners take it for example on our intellectual capital? Taking into account the efforts made in this regard, it might be good if all the copies of this film - or whatever it is - are finished.
