This movie didn't excite me. While on holiday in Turkey, I noticed that he was playing at a local cinema and decided to see this opportunity. The sequences of the film are well-choreographed, but the story shrinks in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> One thing I didn't really follow is how Borte got money to bribe. The second thing I didn't like was a missing segment of Khani's life. It did not go into the details of how the bad guys were able to find him and was imprisoned after he had disappeared for so long. In general, I appreciate this movie a (4) because I enjoyed the action sequences, but they were too little to justify a higher rating because the dialogue was less than impressing me ...
