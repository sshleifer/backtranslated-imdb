I saw the trailers of this movie and found cinematography and what was interesting. I saw the IMDb rating and 6.8 confirmed it was above the average movie. So I went to see it. <br /> <br /> The story is about Mandy Lane (Amber Heard)? beautiful girl in high school, who is the subject of male sexual desire. The provocation of Mandy's friend Emmet (Michael Welch) to another student to show his love for Mandy leaves a fellow student drunk and jump to death. After nine months and Mandy is invited to her teenage friends for the summer day, separated by a ranch? Three girls and three boys go there! Ranch works with guard Garth (Anson Mount). Is the first night killing? the members of the group are killed one by one. Who's behind the killings? I'm not telling you about this sport? Did I like the movie? NO. After the usual interesting opening ?? the film takes down each event. Half-time, if the killer appears, loses all interest in the rest of the procedure. The story is the last twist that strikes the viewers to shock, but rather made me shake head in disbelief and laugh! All this is a break? Ah ??! Amber Heard acts and plays her role as a shy and conscious girl? who is aware of his beauty and men's desire for him. The rest cast is ordinary? say something. There are so many movies made of teenage boys and girls who are going to a lonely place and slowly killing them one by one? it doesn't interest me anymore. <br /> <br /> Director Jonathan Levine is trying to make the movie interesting by using teen chat conversations that are full of sexual record, but don't let the film go over the secular <br /> <br /> The only and most attractive sustainable film of grace is The Art of Darren Genet? who takes great pictures!
