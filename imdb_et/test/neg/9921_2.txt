It was a superfluous and harsh confusion. I needed a shower when it was over. It's going to be something like that - some socialists are killed and a case of a woman's murder detective. He discovers that the victims were part of an underground lesbian society, and his friends interact with a group affiliate who may have relevant information. Because the detective is an attractive woman, she is of course horny and interesting (which shows a lot about Hollywood and its psychosis of women). Surprisingly, none of this is very sexy or interesting, but frustrating and happy. Ellen Barkin gives a decisive result as a leading detective, and Julian Sands involuntarily laughs at a crusade as a psychiatrist, so she escapes with one star.
