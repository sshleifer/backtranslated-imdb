I put this vehicle for the first time with Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy, and especially Murphy, but I have seen it again, recently seeing it has very funny bits. <br /> <br /> It is by no means to say that this is the greatest comedy of all time, but what can you do for an already exhausted subgroup? What director Tom Dey has been trying to do is satire of friendship and media clichés. At the beginning of the film, the cable network manager asks, "How does it differ from the brotherhood?", When Chase Renzi pulls the idea of ​​a reality show that deals with De Niro's character, Mitch Preston (by the way a fun boring name). Then I saw it in a new light that I didn't notice before. <br /> <br /> The idea is to show all of your friend's comedy elements and make them twist. De Niro's reluctance to show the star and partner with Murphy is every police movie that is conceivable. You can say that De Niro is playing himself, asking, "Why should I do a policeman playing another movie?" Chase Renzi is a Hollywood counterfeiting, but when you look back at her opening procedure, she just does it to save her work. He sees somehow what he does, but he still wants to succeed. One line says, "Who doesn't want to be on TV?" Maybe it reads too much about what is essentially a light film, but to entertain, but it gives it a little spin that I haven't noticed before. <br /> <br /> Murphy. You have to praise him for this ridiculousness. Trey wants to be such a bad star that she is ready to sell everything she's facing. Murphy was a big star and maybe it hit a nerve that is all so short. <br /> <br /> A gun gun is of course quite boring. The sequences are nothing special except for the end that required a lot of effort from both the cast and the team. One thing I noticed for the offender is that he is dressed like an 80's pop star. George Michael comes to mind and it adds a whole media spin. <br /> <br /> So I caught it for the first time, but what the hell; If you do, why not point out how ridiculous it really is, and De Niro and Murphy took a great chance to do it.
