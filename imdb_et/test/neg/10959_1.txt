I watched this movie a few months ago when it first appeared on the Blockbuster shelves. This is officially the only movie I wanted to watch. Let me start by saying that I like "B" movies. I find "Ice Pirates" One of the best comedies EVER. Also note that I am a writer and that I met the director / writer of this cinematic wonder. <br /> <br /> Measuring Action: When I chose a bright spot, I should note that Dion Day had an amazing debut with her role in it. For those who do not know, Dion is a boxer, not an actor, so we forgive him his flat death. Why doesn't he come to a shotgun that he once holds? Budget? It would take pages to highlight bad behavior, so I would stay with the egotistic leader Ryn Baskin. Ryn (which seems like the name chosen from the comic book because it sounded good) is the maximum face of this movie, probably because she was a producer. His appearance is perfectly good, but his delivery creates memories of ripping SNL into soap operas. I think she could do as much as she had written for her, but she's definitely part of the charge. and playing weapons was acceptable. It didn't bother me, but it didn't impress me either. <br /> <br /> Writing / Directing: The Oscar for the best scenario is not something I could foresee Gerald Nott. The plot is not only primitive, but the dialogue is flat and inclined. I understand the stylized hockey ness, but it was just bad writing. The thing that bothered me the most was theft. Nott stole scenes, shots and Viggo's facial hair from other movies. The scene where Russell Crow walks out of the wheat in the Gladiator, all the sequences of Heal, Bad and Ugly, that such a thing just won't cut it with me. I don't want to comment on shooting because I don't know what it takes to take a good picture, etc. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Don't try this movie, don't even pirate it. It is too bad to waste time. A good review can be completely fake, after meeting with Gerry It seems more likely that he will post them himself.
