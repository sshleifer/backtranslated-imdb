After I couldn't ignore this example, I started to look at the season one and it hit me really well and I was hooked ... about 5 episodes, then it started to roll down. Why? First of all, Ethan Suplee has been written to act as a complete idiot confirming that displacing very obviously semi-random things with great expectation that it will somehow become the next best joke. <br /> <br /> Jaime Pressly has been stunned, but when she thinks lips stretching to look at the parts of the face that they usually don't go to, and making a strange grimace to emphasize everything she says, she's fun. Perhaps he thought his character would be too flat, faded, and he wanted to make it colorful and spicy, but he made the flood of colors, spices and screams loudly, and it hurts my eyes, ears and intellect. > <br /> Really, I really wanted to love this example, as I said that the assumption is great, (comes from the same shelf as Amelie Poulain's Fabulous Destiny) and Jason Lee is doing a good job with some other players, but there's no way how can i "suck" and forget that this is just an exhibition because the surreal characters of Pressly and Suplee wake me up sharply when they appear. It is worth noting that their characters and actors would be good if it wasn't a 70-fold part and if they didn't get as much time on the screen.
