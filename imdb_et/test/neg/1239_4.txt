I looked at the first two nights before visiting IMDb to search for some actors. I saw a 9+ rating that surprised me because I didn't see what I saw. (Reference, I believe Lonesome Dove was the best TV in the West. I grew up at the back of MGM in Culver City in the 50s and I have some respect for the western genre.) So I saw the glow first review and decided to read "more". There I found a number of comments with 1 or 2 stars, which combined their feelings well with the lack of character development, poor editing, the feeling that it was done in the universal back (MGM has long been lost) and the general impression that it was not close to changing one's feelings about LD . My impression is that their writing was "less than 4.0" with a decisive voice. <br /> <br /> This gave me the idea of ​​what a 9+ rating process is. If people aged 10 and 9 do not take the time to justify their vote, do people with financial motivation fill the ballot box? I've been using IMDb for a long time as a tool to show movies and thought it was the best. Now I'm not so sure.
