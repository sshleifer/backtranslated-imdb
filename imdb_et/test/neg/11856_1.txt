So bad, it's fun, especially during a cocktail hour, and believe me, you have to get a beer, a drink or whatever it takes with this turkey. Where do they get financial support for such numbered "horror" clips? The fun of this movie is to predict which symbols are eaten and in what order, and the wear of "uniforms" "army" jokers. The raptors, by the way, are not the same robbers we met in Jurassic Park, but the cousin's. (Sorry, there is no spoiler here. You have to look at it to find out for yourself) Don't expect the plot to be reasonable, easy, because it's just, go along the ride. You could play it ... take another drink every time you hear a certain sound ... or better, every time someone "raptor" hits. With little luck, you don't even remember having seen this "C-Class" movie!
