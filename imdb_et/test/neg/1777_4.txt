Stinger starts "3 months Ago" on SS Newark submarine, where genetic experiments have gone terribly, and crew members are brutally killed by scorpions ... Jump a few months later at Camp Pendleton, where General Ashford (James Cagnard) short Lieutenant Williams (John Miranda) on his mission Newark and assistant genetic researcher dr. On board Carly Ryan (Michelle Meadows), before anyone knows that a group of business scientists and navies are on board Newark, and they are shocked to discover she has distorted the crew's bodies apart from Dr. Mike Thompson (Casey Clark) who doesn't understand much. It won't be long before the scorpion attack, first falling down is Mrs. Williams to promote Sergeant Sam Harmon (Christopher Persson) and commits himself to becoming the victim of everything and ending the giant scorpion threat forever ... <br /> This Sweedish America co-production led by Martin Munthe and he also dealt with cinematography and I thought it was a strictly remote feature. At the beginning of the new year, Stinger is the first genetic mutated monster / creature / insect film I saw in 2007, hopefully things will only get better ... The Mat Nastos script is incredibly clich√© and will get all the ideas from other movies, especially Aliens (1986). to see that there is an isolated location here, which is a submarine, there is a crew of quickly assembled seafarers, including the one who looks at the cigar at the time of the movie, there are scientists, including the blonde Swedish-speaking one, to try and explain all this and grab money from the company villain who puts a mighty dollar over the human life & the final ingredient is a monster / alien / insect, or whatever, in this case, many great scorpions run around, but they are not used in any unique or imaginative way so that they can also be killer grasshoppers. Yes, it's all here, unfortunately, Stinger is not an alien when you get what I mean. It's a long length of over 100 minutes, and it's quite predictable, though it moves at a reasonable pace and as a stupid creature that you could worse despite what many of the IMDb say ... <br /> <br /> Director Munthe does Distinguish yourself, it's not scary, there's an absence of atmosphere and action scenes are boring and unmistakably. There are not many scorpion attacks, and it is almost an hour before important actions take place, special effects are at the bottom of the scale, but I've seen worse that is certain. I mean, that doesn't mean that the effects on Stinger are good, but I've seen it worse. There is not much blood or gore, there are some corrupted bodies, some decapitated heads and someone ripped in half. The only clever and amusing moment in the whole movie is when a naked Sweedish female scientist asks her lover to turn on talking about all the money they make from scorpions ... But there was a moment that dropped me and tearing my hair out of its stupidity as poisonous Trying to improve the submarine circuit and get the lights on, hitting the power supply / computer discs with the hammer and it works well ... <br /> <br /> Technically, Stinger is the best on average and has an ordinary endless number of dark corridors that are monotonous. Stinger was shot in Sweeden, Stockholm, if you are interested. Action was bad and nothing else to say. <br /> <br /> Stinger is not a great movie and it's not a big horror movie, I can't recommend it at all, but I've seen it worse. If you liked Stinger (unlikely), you might like Tail Sting (2001) or Scorpius Gigantus (2006), which is similar to the "giant scorpions in the open" (as unlikely).
