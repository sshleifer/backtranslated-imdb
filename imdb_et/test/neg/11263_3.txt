It's a bad movie. It can't be denied as much as I want. Tommy Lee Jones is about as good as he can, he may have the script he gave him, and he had a couple of decent sequences that really failed because of his acceptable quality. <br /> <br /> Somewhere along the line, anyone thought that any script shortcomings might conflict if they hired every single branch of the actor's business, unfortunately even truly, deeply talented actors like Goodman, Beatty, Sarsgaard, Gammon, Steenburgen, MacDonald , Pruitt Taylor Vince and that we do not forget that Mr Jones himself is not able to resolve the wooden dialogue and to progress completely unsuccessfully. <br /> <br /> In fact, at one point, I was looking at the film only running for the last 2 hours to find that I was 51 minutes into it. <br /> <br /> The most painful point in the movie was the sub-block that concerned ghost soldiers who seem to have little or no help. story. Other than a little bit of a damaging business, the picture is at the end. * If you haven't seen this movie, ignoring this past statement that may seem amazing and I know it's not, then you don't understand it after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this movie may be that it is actually a sequel to the movie "Heaven's Prisoners" starring Alec Baldwin in the same movie Tommy Lee Jones. Maybe we have to look at it now to see if it's as bad as electric, and secondly, because I don't seem (no matter how hard I try) to break my man to Alec Baldwin.
