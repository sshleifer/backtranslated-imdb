A few years ago, this film was intended to be broadcast in TCM UK as part of Tod Browning's retrospective? but what they actually showed was the 1937 remake! my brother watched it (and afterwards did the original look pretty much in the scene, even under the design)? Although not classic, he said it was a much more satisfying viewing experience than the incredibly hidden earlier version? <br /> <br /> Was it the first collaboration between Browning and Bela Lugos, I had great hopes for it? but they were reversed when, after the first annoying roll of the conversation, it became apparent that the main concern of the film was still the relaxation of the novel sound technology and the result was gradual and extremely static. The thriller plot is also not exciting; even less appetizing is the seemingly British-Indian setting (accents that affect characters and higher class behavior? Not to mention the overpopulated idiosynthetic idioms like "I say", "rather" and "now" look here "? /> <br /> In addition, there are a couple of unwanted criminals: Margaret Wycherly (as a fake carrier) asks police inspector Lugos (if anything, the existence of her undeniable screen is already evident) to give her time to "work out" who is the culprit of a double murder ( the evidence refers to his daughter, played by Leila Hyams!), he hears touching and is disappointed to think that the spirit world has really come into contact with him, but then enters the Lugos space and tells him, "I knocked twice! Me!" where my brother and I almost fell on the floor of laughter convulsions !! also editing is really sloppy: during one of the high-angle images of the main set, is it seen that the mike is quickly pulled out of the cameras? And worse, there are a few cases where a person walks down the screen, seemingly going to the next, part of a second set, but each picture is kept absurdly absent for a long time for other participants, so it seems to take forever that this person would walk just a few steps! <br /> <br /> THE THIRD SESSION GUIDELINE marks the third non-horror Browning Talkie I watched? even if both it and MIRACLES FOR SALE (1939) deal with murder and occultism and may therefore be related to the genre. Much has been said about the director's obvious splitting with the advent of Sound: however, although they may be wrong, there are four straight films he made during the 1930s endlessly better than the rest? What have I always found stylish and weird to suggest that Browning was not as much at sea during this period as recommended?
