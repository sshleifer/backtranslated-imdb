"The Day of Completion" is "Friday the 13th." Both movies are more creative, bloody murders than temporary. If you enjoy this type of movie, I would recommend "Ending Day." If not, I wouldn't. Old killings. <br /> <br /> Although I have given the film 10 out of 10, this is not a repulsive movie, it is traceable if you are curious, just not creative.
