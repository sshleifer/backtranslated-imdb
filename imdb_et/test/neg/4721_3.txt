The buyers of culture undoubtedly know the term "video nasties". It was a notorious British list containing all the films that could have harmed society if seen by an irresponsible audience (dramatization). Gore buffs, this is an excellent checklist because it contains inhumanly cruel and disturbingly realistic movies (face of death, cannibalistic Holocaust, drill killer) and outrageous and very sick horrorfacts (The Burning, Nightmare City, Toolbox Murders). With this in mind, it is quite unusual that among other "nasties" is "Blood Apeside Night". It is certain that blood and violence are so badly presented that I cannot imagine anyone being offended by it. And the silly plot (about a desperate doctor who transplanted gorilla's heart to his dying son's chest) is not exactly what you would call disturbingly real. All that remains is the terrible scary and pointless slip of a fairly fun wedding horror. The effects of human ape are ridiculous and there is no tension or atmosphere. Pleasure only if you are in the right mood, in other words. Few sequences that show exact female-wrestling games (one of the main actors live) are very cool.
