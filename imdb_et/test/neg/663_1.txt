Admission to traffic (I live in Sicily) on the journey (in the military base) to see Superman Returns was 15 minutes late and the only other film game was "Watch No Evil", the poster and just a short description of the movie schedule ... but my girlfriend and we decided to check it out ... As soon as I saw it produced by WWE, I knew it was terrible. Few people in the theater mostly smiled at the time and this was the first movie I read honestly and I've seen "Ringer" ... okay, I would have gone out of it, but I was too busy. The death of the bad boy at the end was pretty good, but besides that it was just stupid.
