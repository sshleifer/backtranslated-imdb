I love low budget movies. Including those that are deliberately or unintentionally funny, excessive counterfeiting, violence, etc. When you see the end of what you say, what the hell was the point of all the scenes of killing, where someone (except the couple) saw them. ALL the story away so that these fools actually look at it. Granny is like a psychic Jason. First of all, he's out of the window with his body and 15 seconds later he's in the living room. The whole thing is setting up a newcomer. They pull out graphical kill scenes, eye knitting needles that only Chris Angel Mind Freak could pull. And again, the end was end-posterous. 56 min waste of time. I've seen one director's second movie and it was almost as bad. Give me 20 big and I can do better. It deserves great fat 0.
