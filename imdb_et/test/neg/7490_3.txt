Lethal Contact: Bird Flu in America: 3: 10: This movie is as funny as sad. The funny part is quite obvious, because it is certainly not an indirect look at a possible upcoming crisis. This is the modern version of The Swarm. Like their killer bees (and the so-called killer bee crisis that prompted them), Bird Flu has joined the media that has inspired the end of the world scenarios (SARS, Y2K, global warming), which simply refuse to actually come. /> <br /> The sad part is the bold endeavor of filmmakers to inspire panic. The disease pandemics were historically quite common after all people did not die in their forties. Even the recent pandemics, such as AIDS, reflect old-fashioned VD crises (think of syphilis) that killed more soldiers than bullets. <br /> <br /> The 20th-century influenza pandemic was a disgusting business that killed millions but honestly went on life. I don't know if the dramatic media and the power-hungry government allies would allow us to live a normal life today. <br /> <br /> The film itself despises the fairly competent scenes (Triage Grand Central Station) for a ridiculous (Rednecks test) lurking with the National Guard of Manhattan). <br /> <br /> The scenarios themselves are quite useless because the filmmakers do not seem to have decided exactly when the avian flu is contagious, or whether the symptoms are an Ebola-style crash or just a long illness. Indeed, one scene shows everyone in a biological hazard costume and the next one is even wearing a mask. <br /> <br /> The film also obviously refuses to give practical advice on what to do in the event of a bird flu crisis. (Outside the wash hands that are not a ribbon?) Functional and directional are good for a TV movie, but the script is all over the map. The last film has strange non-exponential death at the bottom of the screen. Just like swarm.
