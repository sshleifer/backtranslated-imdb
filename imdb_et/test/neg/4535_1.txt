It is sad what they are promising to film festivals these days. I had to sit for over twenty minutes on this tough short time, which wasn't funny at all to get a good place for the feature film I wanted to see at the local film festival. Festival planners tied this terrible short with a great feature. I'm just glad the feature was good, otherwise I would not have been a very happy tenter! <br /> <br /> The short comedy film didn't laugh. The title says it all.
