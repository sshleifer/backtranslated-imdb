This is a stupid movie. When I saw it in the cinema more than half of the audience, before he was halfway. I missed the bitter tip. To show strength? I caught it again on television and it was a lot more fun. Still not classical or even fun, but the family grew to me. I love Jessica Lundy anyway. If you have nothing better to do and it is free t.v. you could get worse.
