I know a lot of people like this show and I apologize to people who think this show is awesome, but it's the worst example. Of course, I'm sure I would be a big fan of this show if Jeremy Clarkson wasn't. I mean, I think the testing of cars and the testing of things like seeing whether a car can be shot is fantastic! But Jeremy Clarkson is just pathetic. Here are the reasons why I hate this man. He thinks it's quick to trick speed cameras that measure your average speed by measuring your distance and time when you drive 200mph along the road and then rest for two hours. . He clearly thinks he's better than Richard Hammond and James May. . He has the best friend who says miserable things. . She screams for the children just to take pictures. I'm sorry, but Jeremy Clarkson is a freak.
