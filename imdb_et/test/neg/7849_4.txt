Maybe the director tried the second PIRATE (Good Garland and Kelly musical) - but this flat musical epoch falls. The votes of Sinatra and Kathryn Graysons do not fit well - and their chemistry does not have a spark. Sinatra, as a sweet guy trying to highlight his late "bandito" father, is okay, but he seems uncomfortable in this role. What is amazing and wonderful here is how Sinatra can take a rather unpleasant song and make it special - her wording and the singing as a singer want to hear it again. When Grayson sings the same songs, it is hard to believe that he did not sing anything completely different and not so interesting. He has a great moment when "Love is where you find" that suits him and shows his abilities. Photography is passionate and both stars look interesting, as are costumes and kits. The co-workers Mildred Natwick and J. Carroll Nash made a lot of energy to do the impossible work. Beside Sinatra's song there is a strange dance with Ricardo Montalban, Cyd Char and Ann Miller. It's exciting and weird. Montalban and Charisse had a wonderful dance team and this number is really strange.
