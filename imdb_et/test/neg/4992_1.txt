This is the worst film I've ever seen. Bored, illogical, terrible. Don't even waste your life to watch this mess! I hope the directors will not make any other films because this film goes bankrupt. The film seems to have been created within one or two days with some directors' friends (if we can use that word for these two boys). They only use the camera. Many scenes are in the dark and nothing can be seen. Many scenes (80% of the movie) are only in the conversation. ! There are films like Vampire vs Zombies that can laugh, but it's just bad, there's no point in making such movies. Please stop Jason Horton and Shannon Hubbel. Don't do more movies!
