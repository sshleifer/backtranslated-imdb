Oh boy. Such films disturb me. If this film were to come close to the truth, I would assume that Rommel knew Hitler some time before World War II began. In the film, Rommel mentions how Hitler had changed before. Well, I can't imagine Rommel knowing anything about Hitler's government policy, so Rommel must have some guilt for German offenses. With that in mind, I have a problem with the film that makes Rommel's life finally tragic. She made her choices and we have to feel bad about her? I can't do that. I also can't buy the theory that if more competent generals could fight the war, the Allies would have had more problems with winning. When more responsible people were responsible, World War II may never begin. From the aspect of watching a movie, the movie pops up and most of the time it looks like a special story with big names playing historical roles. Leo G. Carroll has a few good scenes with James Mason and I liked the fact that everyone spoke English without ridiculous accents. But apart from what is not very important.
