Well, the hero and terror are, in my opinion, a little lower than average. Yes, Chuck is a true martial artist and it hits this movie, but it's pretty slow, and I think it works mostly, though I think Steve James is doing a decent job. Like my friend Ryan, I was confused why a psychopath decided to go to the theater at the end of the movie, not a Norris girlfriend. So far the killer had only killed women. Oh, I think it wasn't as predictable as I thought. Definitely a movie that can be passed on.
