It's amazing that this talent actor Chapa did not get all these famous stars in this depressing, pathetic, cheesy and long film that speaks of a low-life gangster who looks white but is half Mexican; Known stars in this trashy movie give a script that seems to be made up of 16-year-olds, I'm sure this film is a career opportunity for actors like Dunaway, Wagner, Keach, Tilly and Busey, who I am very embarrassed to ever appear in the turkey. I doubt many people have ever heard of Chap and after that terrible movie, I'm sure he will lose sight of where he belongs.
