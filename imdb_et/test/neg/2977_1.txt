Although I tried to avoid German films recently, positive evaluations were given for renting it. There, again, in the German media, I am deceiving, which has jumped over and over again. It is no wonder that no one abroad wants to see this mess. The idea of ​​making this film is not at all meaningful (I think some fools read a women's magazine article about quick search). In short: the characters (which is not), the dialogue and the content are so amazingly trivial, tritical, and clichés that I watched, because I hardly looked at what I saw. BTW would call a number of mechanically transmitted apartment works (certainly the above mentioned magazine dialog) just wrong. The action is so up, I can't remember badly on the screen for a long time. You must think the director had no idea whatsoever. Amazingly, distributors and manufacturers all over the country are still thinking about why German films (with rare exceptions) do not generate interest worldwide. Why? Because it's a waste of time and money.
