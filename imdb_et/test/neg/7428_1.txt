I got this thing out of the sci-fi shelf because I remember when I saw the boy first. I rented another and it was a decent "B" sci-fi. That was right. The "special" effects on cars seemed like my 4-year-old cousin. Two female cyber were so terrible that I literally screwed every time they came on the screen. The plot left so much to make it sick. I don't know what anybody thought when they agreed to get this movie, but I'm sure they would have done it better if they had left 2 movies. The films in this series are running awfully and decently. I only hope that no terrorist group can get to this film because it is a great tool for torture.
