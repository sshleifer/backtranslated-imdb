Camp Blood is a totally frightening movie. We mix on Friday the 13th Blair witch project and add ... murder clown mask. <br /> <br /> The budget for this movie must have been very low, some actors played several times, and the camera used gave a picture that was equal to the original color of the night of death. If someone has been watching this version is modest for me. <br /> <br /> This movie was just so bad. There's nothing worth watching in the movie. What I was doing all the time with the drug was watching. Just take my advice and don't buy or rent this movie. It's terrible.
