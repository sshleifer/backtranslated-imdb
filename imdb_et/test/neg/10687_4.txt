If, like me, you are also actively looking for the toughest and strangest (and often the most terrible) cinema that the world offers, then you should look beyond Hong Kong's supernatural horror product in the early 1980s. Often strange black magic is kung fu and silly comedy, and usually there are many creepy crawlies (snakes, worms, eels, centipedes, etc.), these movies are about as weird. <br /> <br /> Succubare is definitely an example: a mountain tribe whose women keep their men from abandoning them by casting a nasty spell on them (that when they leave, they cause their capturing beings to be filled and die agonizing death), some both martial arts and martial arts. also a lot of the actual killing of animals (a large part of which has been committed by a geek who has no story), this film is simply strange. <br /> <br /> A long-running scene where tribal peoples chasing snakes and insects, accidentally throwing creatures into the back of the baskets, are quite exciting; a tribal party that sees a bad bull with a head, and then breaks, is totally disgusting; and the moments that show climbing and vomiting on open wounds on worms have for some time lost their appetite. <br /> <br /> But this is a living animal that really qualifies Succubare's legendary status as film-making fans. It's a thorough whistle and still strangely convincing: snake drops, greasy, juicy toad (nasty!), And the hungry eats the mouse (biting his head and then sliding the rest). /> <br /> Not a big movie (hell, it's not even a mediocre movie), Succubare is only recommended for people who think they've seen it all. It gets from 4 out of 10, which is probably more than it deserves, but I respect it with respect that I can feel bad.
