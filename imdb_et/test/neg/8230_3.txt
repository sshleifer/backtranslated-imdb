It's a strange film. It does not differ from many other d-grade gore films on the surface, but at least in a couple of ways. First, the main character of the killer is very strange. How the hell, which a man who only ever fucked like a chicken, is paroled, is completely over me. What was this female female board member: "she has been completely reformed and restored". She clucks! Another problem with Luther Geek is the women's script / direction. The daughter is so pathetic and seemingly stupid that if she were me, I'd beat her. In an attempt to detach her mother, she struggles with knots and just doesn't seem to think, "I'm getting a scissor or a knife". Later, with a similar attempt to untie the mother, she travels down the stairs and begins to look for a box of breakers for some scissors, eventually she gets a knife. By the way, it is after the killer has probably left the car and has just returned. Bizarre. On the plus side, the daughter got her kit for the shower so it was nice, though again unusual. It seems that in many of these d-class gore films, they are happy to see the cucumbers bitten by bitten blood, but seeing the woman's breasts is somehow too strong for the audience. Generally it worked, but it was annoying and disgusting, although the bare breasts formed part of it.
