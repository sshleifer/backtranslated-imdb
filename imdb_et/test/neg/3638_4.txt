I've seen this program a couple of times and see more, the less I like it. Jamie Lynn Spears was asked to do this because she is a Britney sister and I'm sorry to say it's obvious at the show. They have created the Zoey sign to be all that people want to believe that Jamie Lynn is smart, original, intelligent, beautiful, popular, and so on. than those that boys want more then. There is nothing original about it and it is poured with money, so every child has the coolest fashion and stuff. I also have to say that a 13-year-old girl (or an old one, she can't be a lot older), she's wearing a very mature dress, these short skirts are too short, it makes young people want to wear them and all this makeup problems why young girls get into so much trouble. The only thing I say is that Jamie Lynn is singing opening credits and because of her age it's not bad, much better than her sister when it comes to voice. Sorry, it's too mature and too dumb. It has worked badly with predictable stories and too many stereotypes.
