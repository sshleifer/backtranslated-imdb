Let's see. This movie is a lot for many people. For Finns, as the comments showed, it may be OK or terrible or boring. For other people this may be something else. First of all: if you don't speak Finnish (me), you understand what's going on because the subtitles are terrible and even the title is translated incorrectly ("Bad Land" would probably be idiomically translated into Badlands in English). <br /> <br /> Why didn't I like it? Because it is a Tarantino-style movie: it just takes a very tough reality and throws it at you as brutally as possible. However, I am not an American, and so I am not particularly against this procedure because it all shows that the director has nothing to say. The technical ability (camera performance is brilliant), the script (not that it is unoriginal) does not save the movie from where it belongs. If you want to see a Finnish film, go to some of Kaurism√§ki's brother's film, which is suitable for talent and director skills, with very good actors and actors. <br /> <br /> This director should review his intentions and priorities: none of them was understandable, so this film failed. Ignoring this will not leave much behind.
