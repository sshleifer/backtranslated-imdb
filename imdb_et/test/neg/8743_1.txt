Boy Oh Boy, does this movie smell. This film is one of the worst trash I've ever seen in my life. Please, even if your life depends on it, DON'T and I repeat: DON'T under any circumstances look at this terrible garbage. Look at this thing only if it is an MST 3000 episode. That was the only way I could sit the whole thing. If I had to look at it without an exhibition, I would have reviewed it before. It has one use: Insomniacs treatment !!!!!
