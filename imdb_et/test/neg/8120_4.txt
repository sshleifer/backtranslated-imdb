A terrible movie about a doctor who goes fishing and breezes seaweed when he is thrown overboard. He's trying to bring him back. <br /> <br /> Glynis Johns is really a silly single person with a tail hanging in the title. <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford is a sister who should be so eccentric, but we don't see eccentricity here. In fact, Miss Rutherford was not allowed to use her real comedy gifts. <br /> <br /> Glad to see David Tomlinson in the movie. He met John at the age of 16 with much better "Mary Poppins". <br /> <br /> Miranda is causing the worry that two men, a neighbor's bride and a driver (Tomlinson) will fall against him. <Br>> <br /> Ask any mermaid you see, the best tuna, the sea chicken! Like this movie, forget about it.
