These writers are trying to recreate the signs they have in "scratches" in a different occupation, but their characters do not have the charisma or the ability to act, not to mention that writing seems poor and effortless. These guys are trying to create something that would be good if writing was not so nasty, leaving the exhibitions alive for life, as two attractive teachers who barely hold it. The humor of this exhibition seems to be trying to target the target audience at I.Q. 40 or less. Another reason why this exhibition is unsuccessful may be that writing at "scrubs" is great and this exhibition has to follow it, leaving the viewer in an odd position, without knowing whether to cry or just lose hope of new laptops all together. This is just my opinion, but I think these men should stop before they lower themselves anymore.
