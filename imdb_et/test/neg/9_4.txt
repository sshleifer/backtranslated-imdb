David Bryce's close comments are exceptionally well written and informative, just as I can say almost everything I know about DARLING LILI. This massive music is so peculiar and overwhelmed, over-produced, and must break in 1970 in Paramount. It cost $ 22 million! It's just irresponsible. DARLING LILI must be on the board at a meeting that said, "Hey, we have this Pink Panther boy and that Sound Of Music gal ... lets it go" and gave a blank check. The result is a GIGI, ZEPPELIN, HALF A SIXPENCE, some MGM 40s song and dance number (daisies and boaters!) Hybrid that is so desperately old-fashioned as musical porridge and MATA HARI drama. Production is colossal, lush, breathtaking to look at, but the rest: ridiculous romance, Julie was looking for a scatter, Hudson already dead, flawless comedy, and an amazingly boring song devastating this remarkable movie irritating. LILI is like the mega music of the 1940s, with some vulgar bits to spice it up. STAR! released year before, unfortunately, fell off and now a very good movie is really appreciated ... and Andrews seems sublime, mature, especially in the last half hour ...... but LILI is POPPINS and DOLLY frilly and I believe I was actually killed The mega-musical excess of the 1960s ..... and gave Andrews Poppin a similar ... that I didn't think was Edward's intention. Paramount has to collapse collectively during sight: and with another $ 20 million in CATCH 22 and $ 12 million in ONE CLEAR DAY and $ 25 million in PAINT YOUR WAGON .... they had a cash gap of 77 million CLEOPATRA proportions The dollar is associated with four very uncertain future films. Maybe they should have asked seers from Daisy Gamble ON A CLEAR DAY ...... LILI was very popular for the first time ever released in Australia and ran several months on 70mm cinemas, but it failed any time and again. After that, one night on Sunday evening is double ON ON CLEAR DAY. Thanks to God, Paramount had his simple $ 1million (yes, one million dollars) movie LOVE STORY and that $ 4 million gangster pic THE GODFATHER is also ready to recover $ 77 million in just the next two years .... just $ 5m. ... unbelievable!
