It is by far the most scarlet and scary version of Scarlet Pimpernel. As a fan of Pimperel, I sincerely broke what they were doing - but this cruelty isn't worth watching, even if you're not familiar with the story. <br /> <br /> Percy Blakeney, for example, would never get people just down the corridor. Chauvelin would never have a woman in bed. Marguerite never had a Charm with Chauvel or Minette with whom he was. Chauvelin did not accidentally drop Tony's head. The name of Chauvelin is not and never was Paul. They have completely lost all references to Pimpern's disguises, replacing them with James Bond-esque gadgets and gizmos. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, makeup is terrible. Women look like clowns. Elizabeth McGover's beauty sign accidentally goes around her face. The poor, the merciful participants have no manuscript, so it is not their fault that their characters are as thin as wet paper. Dialogue ... oh, dialogue. Dialogue is intolerable. And anyone responsible for all these small captions at the bottom of the screen should be forced to watch this movie. (In the first half of the year, I counted 13 places on the label before I gave up. As we could not understand that the water body between England and France is an English language channel.) Film - if I can call myself because it is really just a filter video tape, it is absolutely worthless. Don't waste your time and brain cells in this filthy fire - instead look at the 1982 version of Anthony Andrews / Jane Seymour or the 1934 Leslie Howard movie, or even something, but that's it.
