The Detonator is located in Bucharest, where some former CIA government agent, Son Griffith (Wesley Snipes), has been following the Dimitru arms store (Matthew Leitch), things are going wrong, although & Dimitru explains that Son is working for the US government. After a lot of shooting, most of Dimitru's men have been killed by Son, which the local Romanian police are not happy with, the top man Flint (Michael Brandon) decides to send Son back to the US and at the same time defend a woman named Nadia Cominski (Silvia Colloca) who is also sent back To the USA. However, it turns out that Nadia wants Dimitru & his football club, who owns the boss Jozef (Tim Dutton), who needs him to make an agreement on a nerve gas bomb that they intend to kick off in Washington, killing millions of people ... <br /> < American / Romanian co-production led by Po-Chih Leong & The Detonator confirms that Wesely Snipes has joined a washed-up action film club, which has descended from general action films in Eastern Europe, yep Snipes has joined with lighting such as Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, Dolph Lundgren, Rutger Hauer & Chuck Norris. I give Snipes some credit, because he kept a little longer than the rest with the great Blade: Trinity (2004), which is still fresh in many cinema visitors (every movie he's done after he's gone straight to DVD) le) but it had to happen sooner or later, as many of the names mentioned in Snipes have lived a reputation for some great movie and when you look at his career, he has been in the worse films that are good. Like recent JCVD ​​& Seagal films, the Detonator is quite terrible. Martin Wheeler's manuscript is as predictable, boring and alien as anything. A detonator is a movie you expect on a hidden cable television that plays at 2 am. The detonator is full of clichés, Snipes is forced into a situation where he has to protect a woman and initially dislikes each other, but eventually they are in love, his closest friend in the CIA turns out to be a traitor to the book's boss is not terrible, because no one really wants a decent man, Snipes The character is allowed to ride around Bucharest, killing and blowing people like it doesn't matter and he can never be arrested, the action is boring and forgotten, a bad man owns a football club, so there are many annoying football terminologies and even no funny lining. up, Detonator sees the chase of a car cheaper, where two cars no longer look like a 30 mph mark. OK action scenes are relatively well staged, but they are little and far & totally forgotten "bad man shoots in snipes & misses, in return for snipes shoots a bad man and kills him in a sort of way. There's half a decent car accident and explosion, but very little. that some detonators were shot at a Romanian football stadium, I think I would have been watching the game for 90 minutes rather than the movie. <br /> <br /> The estimated budget is about $ 15,000,000, quite well done, but not so much. Set & filmed in Romania in Bucharest, it's not that big, Snipes just doesn't seem interested and feels like he's just out of the money I don't blame him for. <br /> <br /> Detonator is another poor Clichéd movie is starring in eastern Europe, why does Sony continue to do these things?
