This movie was terrible, simple and easy! Animation scenes had absolutely terrible graphics. It was very clear that this movie was on my food supply budget! Action was just as bad .. I've seen better action in pornographic movies. I really like an hour and twenty minutes of my life. In fact, I just registered in IMDb so that other people wouldn't get to see it like me. Don't let me go wrong, I love sci-fi movies! It seemed like a video game input: (I'm glad I spent one dollar to see it! The story line reminded me of the darkness of the movie, the prisoner of the ship in the outer space is fleeing. Oh my goodness .. what are we doing? Bottom line here, you can do better.
