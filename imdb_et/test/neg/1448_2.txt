Power began to look promising, but soon became boring and annoying. The plot is about an ancient Aztec doll, which owns their possessors. The idea is "decent enough" and this movie would have been quite fun if it was better to do it. But after the first ten minutes, it will soon become boring; we don't get good death scenes and we have to listen to a lot of talk. Finally, one of the men in possession meets his two deaths, but it is not very interesting and certainly not pleasant. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend The Power to any horror or slasher fan because it is of little use.
