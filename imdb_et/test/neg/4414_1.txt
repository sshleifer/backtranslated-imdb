The gigantic, niggling, grimacious tree baggage struggle counteracts the "natives" in the "Pacific Atoll" (looking suspiciously like South CA ...), reacting and revenge. Unlike the stupid stumps of the Navy VS The Night Monsters, Tabonga is actually an adult male tree. Well, grown up in 2 days: the jade has risen as their miracle grew ... Anycow, it doesn't come from the grave of hell, but from the grave of Kimo (Greg Palmer, "Mora Tau zombies"), murdered by local parents with their scary American scientists. Scientists include Dr. William Arnold (Tod Andrews, "Hang 'em High", "The Apes Planet") and Professor Clark (John McNamara, "The War of the Colossal Beast"). The rounding of pain is Linda Watkins ("Parent Trap") as a reluctant Mrs. Kilgore, an obvious comic relief that draws out an obvious accent of a false speech. Alphabet Cast! Anycow, because her dough, the free woman Korey, whom Suzanne Ridgeway ("A-Poppin of Love") played amateurly, helps her set up, Kimo acknowledges her and all parents' revenge. Then the ancient American scientists dropped the tree, brought it back to "science", and allowed it to slow down, killing everyone who had done it wrong. Of course, we all know that evil monsters are carrying out fair food, so Tabonga grabs the happy female scientist Dr. Terry Masoni (Tina Carver, "Hell Frisco's Gulf") & waddles with her. A winemaker, a good hit with Remmington, strikes a knife placed in Tabonga and falls under the body. This ridiculously silly horse is one of the most time-consuming hairs. Tabonga is arguably the slowest monster in moovie history, just where "Robot Monster vs Aztec Mummy" and perverse slow carpet monster from "Creeping Terror". Try not to laugh when you look at Tabonga toss fake natives in the mountains and cluster, dodge spears and lumber around the "island". Shady writing, wood performances, and the cute direction all suggest that this pulp fertilizer is far from cream as a bite. This lukewarm wood chips were the last hurry of the long-time editor-director Dan Milner, who quickly disappeared into a well-deserved ambiguity after this film. You're grazing it first on the MooCow vineyard: "From Hell it Came" is a classic compost !! : ??
