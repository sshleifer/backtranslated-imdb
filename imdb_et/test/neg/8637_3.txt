When he was told George Sluizer he could direct the book "Het Gouden No" to an American film / "Spoorloo" (outside the Netherlands, the name of this movie is "lost") that he was told that it would go out only when the end was changed - he was told that the "American audience" would not confirm the original end. Of course, the original end is much better and without it the film loses its effect. Since I've already used it in the Cancellation section, I don't give the original end and keep my comment spoiler free. If you want to know the original end, check out "Spore Story" or read the book. This film is an absolute garbage and the first Kiefer Sutherland movie I don't like. Watch the original Dutch movie, one of the world's best thrillers.
