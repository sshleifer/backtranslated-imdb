When I saw a poster in the theater, I thought it was a horror story for a "new line" without the famous pain that you should try. But after I went, I wanted to leave after 20 minutes. There was a lot of nonsense and logical mistakes. For me, it's a movie that's not worth the theaters. It's not even worth it.
