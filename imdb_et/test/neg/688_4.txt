After his role as a fine captain in SEVEN THIEVES (1960) - which I've been looking at many years ago - it seemed that Edward G. Robinson was playing alongside the types of older criminal masterpieces (except for the strange juicy role like CINCINNATI's KID [1965])). I was already looking at a good Euro-Cult effort for GRAND SLAM (1967) and after that I have two similar titles to control in Italy, one of which was led by future goreme champion Lucio Fulci! Anyway, this is an international production featuring American and Italian actors and British director - which was prevalent in the 1960s; it is safe and simple, but hardly memorable and surely overwhelming - especially since in order to raise funds for the heavy equipment needed for the attack (such as the army tank and the airplane!), the group in question must pull the small variety theft first. <br /> <br /> Gang is, of course, an incompetent batch led by American (Robert Wagner) and his bimbo girlfriend (Raquel Welch) - others are "pacifist black man", hungry Italian all year round and little English. They are trying to invite the former gangster (Vittorio De Sica) to succeed in them, except for his poverty ... but under the auspices of Robinson, he is proposing a $ 5 million platinum! Needless to say, gang members do not trust each other (Wagner instructs Welch to seduce De Sica to get his fence name in Morocco - where they retreat after the robbery), or else work away (the Italians can't sit down and order a multi-course course to keep their ordered restaurant) meals!). Funly, in the eyes of similar malfunctions, De Sica tries to show them how they did it in the old days - but it seems to have kept the gas station that the owner is his nephew and he just asked to borrow money! The central thrust sequence is usually developed: when a gang, including Welch, takes a train that carries platinum, Wagner pilot Victor Spinetti and his plane. When the job is done, he plans to double De Sica - but his partners and Welch himself are not willing to go with it, so he is forced to go again. Since the crime did not pay, the gang is losing its entire shadow in the middle of the air when the doors of the aircraft are opened randomlyâ€¦
