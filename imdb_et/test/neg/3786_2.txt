The most impressive thing about "Anemic Cinema" is its title: anagram, which is almost a palindrome. Unfortunately, it only works in English in English because in the UK "anemic" is written differently. <br /> <br /> I've always found that the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts are profoundly pretentious and I've never realized why his work attracts so much attention. In addition to his Rayograph (which he discovered in an accident and just being in direct contact with photos), it seems that his real contribution to culture seems to be the first photographer to portray a woman's nudity in a way that is accepted as art rather than porn. But it certainly had to happen, and there is no real reason why Ray deserves credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the Emperor's new clothing story. black and white. 'Anemic Cinema' is such a similar picture, I don't know if 'Twilight Zone' borrowed this movie. The main difference is that the rotating image is a black and white spiral. Indeed, once there was a film that deserves to be described as a spiral, it is. The whole "anemic cinema" is treated with (?) Rotating disc techniques that include spiral-moving words (in French). It is a vertical effect, and the texts - incest and Eskimo - are almost Dada's in vain. I smiled with one smart sexual red. The emperor is naked, the people and this film hardly appreciates 2 out of 10. Au suivant!
