Cultural Vandalism Does the New Hallmark Production in Gulliver Ride a Cultural Vandalism Act? Not literally. After all, no copy of the book is burned. But if this is the only Gulliver people who have been in contact, and for many, it is that people do not get what Jonathan Swift was going to do. If Jonathan Swift was alive, Hallmark could be sued for violating moral rights and they would lose. This is a good way to think about someone else's ideas before starting a project. <br /> <br /> Swift's masterpiece is an extraordinary vision of humanity. Through his hero Gulliver, he drives to places that make him big, small, couple and? human. The small people of the flower pot are small in every sense. Small and foolish, they fight, big and small, infinite destruction wars, at the end of which their soft boiled eggs end at the breakfast table. Sounds like us. <br /> <br /> I forget most of the rest: it has been for years since it was read. The TV show reminded me of some things and with the bright side it made me want to read it again. Yahoos and Danson, Steenbergen and especially the two great actors, Peter O'Toole and Edward Fox, should be thoroughly ashamed. Some "creative persons" got a brilliant idea to focus on the "star" of Gulliver played by Ted Danson, whose behavior is just bad. He depicts Gulliver crazy. All his trips were made. Weeeeel. Yeeeaaah! Of course Swift Gulliver! Of course, the land visited was imaginable: it is called fiction. His goal was to talk about humanity and our often, terrible relationships with each other. Moving his imaginary character into imaginary lands is his method. But these people treat imagination as a disease and anyone who has a moment when Hallmark couldn't turn into anodic cards is a suspect. It's so bad that O'Toole, which is always deep, seems as small as her flower-like character. He is, of course, at the same time commenting on his character, as much as not all the great actors do. Transmitting characters illuminates this. Our light complements this sign. It becomes three-dimensional through the making of this psychic triangle. Most participants do it very delicately, like Hopkins, "Remnants of the Day". Others, like Nicholson, play two parts quite widely over the last two decades. Nicholson actually plays with two points in his relationship and with us: he is the cat's cradle and he who slips out has all the strings. Very fun, like O'Toole. But here's something. She screams in a megaphone (as big as ever) and all the senses are hollow shells under her. <br /> <br /> It's because it is. See "anodyne" and the word "Hallmark" should be synonymous. Harmful, unpleasant, unpleasant: Hallmark is a doll that can't pee because it has no genitals: it's the norm, the average, the person with no difference. The hallmark is not a badge. I never doubt that such people despise those who have so much imagination. Suddenly a pound of "Disney's metaphysics" looks bold. Or Einstein's "Genius Men are always violently opposed to mediocre minds". Indeed, someone in this mediocre type who has an answer to any question other than "a" or "b" is a suspect. So what is more distinctive is that the person who drives into the darker places of the human soul and shines his little flashlight to illuminate what is there? So vandalism is. The Taliban destroyed Afghan Buddhas, the Palestinians from the oldest synagogue in the world, the barbarians, the great statues of the classical era, and these things are obviously vandalism. Hallmark strives to protect us from foreign enemies, damaging our own culture; what feeds and supports them. And we. <br /> <br /> Please buy a copy of Gulliver's travel wherever you live and read it. Or order it online. I like to use ABE books.
