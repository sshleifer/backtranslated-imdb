"Three" is a serious silly shipwreck. Being a psychological thriller is the closest relative to the monumentally higher "Dead Calm" (also Billy Zane). "Dead Calm" gave well-drawn symbols to root them to the depressing parents of Sam Neil and Nicole Kidman who tried to redefine their relationship with the ocean cruise. They are being terrorized by Zane's adrift-psycho-killer. It gave a sharp, ever-ratcheted, frightening feeling of claustrophobia on the high seas like a cat and mouse game and death rid. <br /> <br /> "Three" suffers from poorly drawn characterization (the audience doesn't care what happens to them), stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device, full stop or excitement, and some major players hammy appearances. Particularly Zane moves over the irritating fashion. In "Dead Calm", he was threatening, wired and barely struggling with controlled sexual violence. Here he is bombing, tough and butterfly. And where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars? And how can his lighter be filled with juice for over a year? Mrs Brook is very picturesque, amazingly beautiful, but both her chest and back are obviously overwhelmed by a life-raft pump. But they manage to do more skills and convictions than the rest. A dramatic actor, the term in the purest sense, is not it. A man who played voodoo-hexed Manuel, the third part of this unfortunate third component, could have been replaced by a temporary one not noticed. In fact, given his total inability to provide dialogue in a meaningful or dynamic way, the driftwood represents a potential improvement on the alloy wheels (apology). <br /> <br /> Plus: Landscape is nice and cinematography (above and under water) is reliable. <br /> <br /> I think it had a very limited (if any) theatrical release or went straight to a rental and retail DVD. The reason for this is that it is not very good. If you want something you want, get "Dead Calm". This was done by people who knew a little about cinema.
