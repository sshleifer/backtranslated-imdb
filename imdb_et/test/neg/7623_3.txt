I bought this movie from a DVD for a great deptide store. This is probably the best and the most generous comment I have to offer about it. At least it won't deceive me of the price of lunch. <br /> <br /> Chiller is a problem with Craven as a director. The man is his apologists who claim that his travel documents prove he is a truly intelligent man and a comprehensive sharp conceptual. But it's no secret that, as a director, he has never had any Hitchcock's visual and hopeful idea. As Chiller proved, he is much closer to this legendary flat Hershel Gordon Lewis. What Craven does not have as a director is the main ingredient that would make her direct to hire a higher-level filmmaker. The moments of this film's transition are sleek. Creative shots give him a sense of quality production. The film looks professionally put together, as is the TV program director's movie. (Thought: Movies only visually differentiate, those transitions that at least look professionally behave may well be the job of the head of another unit.) This is the part of bridges and smooth transitions - drama - that coincide. <br /> <br /> The essence of the procedure is constantly being discussed. Critical shots (after leaving the cars in a well-placed camera, we cut the hospital overnight, the waiting area and the corridor, then in the corner of the phone cab that appears next) are quickly issued so that we can rush and reach the next section. Craven is never anywhere near to explode any dramatic or visual possibilities of the moment. The quick result of the failure of all of these unimportant parts and the movement of things is the film, which seems to be the work of a similar art student who sharpens all his pencils, easily adjusts his painting and lighting fixtures. up, grind all your pigments, stretch and prime your canvas ... and then there's nothing to say. Craven, like an art student, never gets to the exercise. more.
