Some of Janapez's modern horror movies are very good. Strong plot, frightening moments, good action, while others are just .... Unfortunately Uzumaki falls under the last camp. <br /> <br /> I rate a movie based on three elements: Plot, Scary Factor and Action. <br /> <br /> 1) Drawing - The movie's name is correct, the graph moves around and never explains. Okay, the city is fascinated by the spiral curse, but why? And why do people behave so stupidly? There is a brief attempt to explain what has happened to the reporter ... fortunately ... <br /> <br /> 2) A frightening factor - if it was to be a horror strike, it was unlucky. I can't really remember one good scary scene with a lot of structure. 3) acting - very monotonous. People go around and say meaningless phases. I can't really feel great empathy for our tragic heroes. <br /> <br /> All in all, there are much better Japanese horror films with a uniform plot and strong character. Don't waste your time with this wannabe.
