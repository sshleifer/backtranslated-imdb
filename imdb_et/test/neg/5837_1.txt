I like science fiction films and even low-ranking films made for TV, a source of discount, movies that I still find interesting. Well, I found this one in a litter bin and brought it to a group of friends with a movie. <br /> <br /> I was literally * mother-in-law * that I brought this movie. <Br /> <br /> From the beginning, the actor is bad, the story is blissful and the plot is almost non-existent. All this leads to what movie really was: Soft core porn graphic film. <br /> <br /> The film started with a female prison, where prisoners are all sexual women who work with me. The first idea that this film is not serious: attractive women in prison are forced to do physical work. Yeah, of course! What ever. : P If the "plot" continues, they overshadowed the meaningless scene of sexual people. Halfway, my friends and I stopped watching, it was so stupid. The next day I thought I'd give the film another chance and watch the rest. I looked for another 15 minutes and gave up again. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a decent, scientific literature or even a sci-fi monster movie DON'T Lethal Target! If you want to see a soft budget with a small budget that is light on the plot, look at Lethal Target.
