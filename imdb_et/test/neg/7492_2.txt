What garbage, isn't it really part II? When this movie actually ends, as it did, all those involved in this movie should be ashamed. This movie is not a movie like Outbreak, which was actually a pretty decent movie. This movie was rushed in the hope of getting some simple dollars. I started watching the movie on the assumption that it would be bad, but I never imagined it to be bad. This movie was nothing more than a way to take advantage of American people's fears for profit! If you haven't seen this movie, don't worry. The film is full of badly developed characters and poor action. I hope the production of this movie was only a few weeks. Stay away! Don't be fooled!
