I felt like I saw how not to make a movie. I think the director is filming it in the backyard! There was no real plot. A scary script. <br /> <br /> Terrible action. <br /> <br /> The worst product I've ever seen. A few bad CG effects and then the rest of the movies were spent walking around, which looked like a junk park. <br /> <br /> I don't usually write movies for comments, but moved to warn everyone about this Life is short to waste your time with this movie!
