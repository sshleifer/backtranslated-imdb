And again, I find myself in a minority. <br /> <br /> I didn't like it. It's ONLY a Varney job I haven't accepted, including Knowhutimean. Slam Dunk Ernest evaluates credit for being the worst, but it is a clear competitor for this dubious title. <br /> <br /> This work is too harsh and too much to be loved. Love was one of Ernest's main components, and this element was completely lost here. Unfortunately, most think it is the best of the line, but if you love the content of Ernest, Ernest, you will understand what I am referring to in this work for fifteen minutes. It was a funny base to have fun. <br /> <br /> This price is 3.5 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
