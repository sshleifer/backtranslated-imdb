I like all kinds of movies, so it's not a romantic movie from a man who loves only the matrix, and so on. <br /> <br /> I felt it was a tough film. I don't feel that there are enough signs for love. They were there for a couple of days and were dealing with a serious hurricane and big problems in every life, Richard Gere and Diane Lane fell hopelessly and helplessly in love? This is not realistic. This movie didn't change me and I feel it emotionally, and that's something you're looking for in a good plot. Some emotional ties. If someone can communicate with them, it is not true if it is in love. You are not right or wrong. Different punches for different people. <br /> <br /> Another very incredible part of the movie was Diane Lane's very rude teenage daughter, who got nice and understanding at the end of the movie. Is a teenage girl who is unhappy and aggravated by her mother that she can't get back with her cheated spouse, just turn on the switch and be nice? In short, this movie had big names, but it was a big disappointment for me.
