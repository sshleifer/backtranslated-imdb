1993 was a time of change for WWE, but for Wrestleman, they decided to bring back the clock when Hulk Hogan returned with his good friend Brutus Beefcake, who had won the accident since the wrestling in 1990. <br /> It wasn't a great event. Only two competitions had a real design and the whole thing was rushing. In the ring ring the action wasn't great and the twist at the end of what I discussed later, really wasn't a land breaking moment WWE hoped it would be. <br /> <br /> This forgotten night began with Shawn Micheals defending his continental championship against invincible Tatanka. Tatanka beat Michael a few times, which led to a fight. Michaels had a new leader, Luna Vachon, while Tatanka was accompanied by a former head of Michaels and the future WWE Hall of Famer Sherri Martel. Tatanka won the DQ. Michaels held his title and went straight back to his enemy, Marty Janet, who was just waiting for Wrestlemania. Why, I have no idea. Good fit. <br /> <br /> Blending the clown needs the help of another clown to win his game against Crush. Another Doink disturbing Crush when he was in full control and allowed Doink to get a pin and victory. Doink was a fun trick character who got pretty fast. <br /> <br /> Razor Ramon won Bob Backlund at the next race with an easy return. <br /> <br /> This brings us to our first double event. Since Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake's Mega Maniacs team took their newly-turned good man Jimmy Hart, he took his former friend Money Inc (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster). It was a pretty sketchy finish. As already mentioned, the beef was a parallel accident requiring complete facial surgery and competing with a face mask. Shyster hung up the mask and beat Beefcake's pulp. Ref went down, Hogan grabbed the face mask and knocked out DiBIase and Shyster, and then Hart, who wore the judge's shirt, took three. The second ref came back and turned the decision back, declaring Money Inc. winners with DQ. <br /> <br /> Next to Lex Luger or Narcissist, as he was known at that time, Mr. Perfecti won. This game came because Luger was headed by Perfect's old leader Bobby Heenan. Perfect was on the ropes when he was stuck, but the ref remained on it. <br /> <br /> Undertaker picked up a weak DQ victory in a pretty bad game by Giant Gonzales. Undertaker was the head of Gonzales, Harvey Wippleman, who served in 1992 and Taker had won his big monster on Kamala Survivor Series. Wippleman won the revenge and took it to the Royal Rumble when Gonzales attacked Taker, paying him the game. Gonzales dominated this game under Undertaker, but had DQ to prevent Taker from chloroform. A strange finish for a bad game. <br /> <br /> It bought us for our main event, as WWE Champion Bret Hart, who first argued as a champion, placed her headline on Fuji for an unstoppable monster against Yokozuna. Yokozuna checked early attendance, but Hart responded and then checked. He was a Yokozuna teravmeeser, surely he gave and Hart would have created a heroic hero after taking out a big monster. But Fuji had other ideas that threw salt on Hart's face, making Canada helpless when Yokozuna got a piece. <br /> <br /> What is downfall? But wait here for Hulk Hogan. He checks Hart to be sure. Maybe Fuji Hogan is asking for a WWE title right now and there. Hogan agrees. Fuji throws salt to Hogan, but instead hits Yokozun. Hogan strikes the leg and wins the game and title. What was I just watching? And what most fans had to be at night when we saw Hart as a giant killer, or Yokozuna found himself an unstoppable monster, we saw Hulk Hogan instead of winning a meaningless title. The title he wouldn't protect for three months. In fact, it was the only game that Hogan WWE wrote in front of the PPV King in June 1993.
