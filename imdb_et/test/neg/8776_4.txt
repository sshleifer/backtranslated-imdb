I loved this movie when it first came out (but I was just 12 years old - and I had forgotten this movie until one day I found a copy used at the point of sale. I bought it and I couldn't wait to watch this movie that I I would have loved as a child, and when I saw this film several years later, it hit me ... Why did I love this movie as a child, watching it again as an adult I realized that this movie is terrible because the saddest part of this movie is that they had everything they could to do the biggest western and they blew it! Costumes are perfect, good actors, there are 2 music, the orchestra's performance is wonderful and holds the old Lone Ranger with a living classical spirit, the second score is a music charter like Merle Haggerd and The Statler Brothers Songs and Songs Like "The Man in the Mask." This film is a Stronger Point that he had the Briliant Storyline and one of the best Western ern plots ever, and some a time for this fun to watch when John Reid is put back on health, after he and his companions Rangers have been attacked. It's fun to see him grow his new life and identity with the Lone Ranger when he concels his identity, and gets revenge to to become a gang responsible for killing your brother and all his migrants. But, unfortunately, Merle Haggard is all that is narrative when everything is broken. Everything you look at happens (for God's love, why did they do it?) Between Merle Haggard's story and The Statler Brothers who sing the corn (stupid) songs like "Ride little cowboy" that play in the background, make this movie impossible to take seriously. I would love to see a really good producer who would take the same script and story and make this movie again, because at the heart of this stupid movie is a big west .--- I'd like this to be the toughest dress for a beautiful woman dress. I'll give her 4 stars out of 10 - if you are 12 years old and don't know better, you might love it.
