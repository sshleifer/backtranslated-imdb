Just terrible. I am also here in a spoiler warning, because the movie also includes a bubble joke - there is nothing to spoil because it is already rotten. This dross was made during a time that was supposed to be one of the "few dollars more" periods for sellers when he was involved in a couple of couples. I saw this as a 15-year-old high school student in 1972 and then looked at it. There is no need to review it again; After 35 years I remember it as one of the five worst films I saw as a child. Recalling, salespeople were constantly playing a bigger role than here, but even his presence was unable to relieve jokes, a flat plot and a toddler. One ongoing topic revolves around the use of vendor fingers: In one scene, it keeps its open hand on the medical team, and fingers list the groups for which the hospital is available - interns, nurses, administrators, and so on. - until only her middle finger is left, she says "... and patients!" Har Har. In the second scene, he tilts his finger to the urine sample to avoid costly laboratory tests and sticks to the mouth to control the sugar, and then encourages the intern to gather around to do the same. He then advises them to put his middle finger in the urine, but suck his face and warn them to pay attention. Hee Hee. (The only reason I remember this and writing this movie and writing it is that a friend told me even today about the "joke" evenly bleeding version.) If yu aja is, then let yourself move. If not, see "Hospital" where George C. Scott (who came out in the same year, 1972) was a true, wonderful black medical humor. Better yet, read Samuel Shem's "House of God", and, if possible, look at the version of this movie that has never been released (please make a copy and send it to me - I would like to finally see it).
