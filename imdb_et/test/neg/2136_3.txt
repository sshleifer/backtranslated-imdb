WARNING: USE OF SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The first "jaws" films were already in the 1980s and beyond. The film's monsters went from radioactive monstrosities to unknown and foolish wild animals who hid in the unexplored corners of human activity (ie ocean, deep space, genetics). Although "jaws" were a milestone in this film's horror, some films have been able to respond to the visceral effect of the original. "Shark rosso nell'oceano" (aka Devil Fish or Red Ocean) is a mandatory follower of the original "Jaws" formula. After some unhappy boats and sailors, some ocean creatures are brutally murdered, there is an initial incentive to discover the beast, failure to investigate it without terrible results and the ultimate pressure to destroy it. Though filmmakers tried to inject fresh life into the equation by adding technology and corporate conspiracy, something disastrous results. This film sinks at its own weight, which is terrible editing, brittle action and cheap intimidation. <br /> <br /> Devil Fish's most sickest feature is its cookie cutter. From the beginning of the movie, when a total of 3 different scenes are put together, the viewer feels the film lacks technical credibility. Editors seem to cut the scenes around the music score instead of trimming the movie, and then make the necessary changes to the music. In addition, each cut is interwoven and it seems like the editors ever heard the terms "fade", "wipe" or "dissolve". The effects of scenes can never be taken, because after the last row they are immediately cut and a new scene begins. There are many stupid camera tricks when two fundamental characters share a private moment on the beach, and sort of a distinctive image of their actions. The subject of the creature is the hopeless copy of the "Jaws" theme with a small variation. Although I like my comments on the lack of MST3K effect, Mike described the most terrible score as "soft core porn music". The lack of burning on a film that is so heavily dependent on it is a blow to death "Devil Fish". Action is disguised, relationships are astonishing and the whole conspiracy is ridiculous. The question remains that if genetics had reached such a level as to create a great fearful seaman to protect the interests of the ocean, why couldn't a better humanity be used in practice? One of the few positive aspects of this film is the idea of ​​a monster, although the presence of this film is less than a star. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is badly below mediocre. If "jaws" have never been done, the film could be described as average because its subject would be new and exciting even if it was ineffective. Unfortunately, the carbon copy of Spielberg's original thriller is most convenient in the trash bin.
