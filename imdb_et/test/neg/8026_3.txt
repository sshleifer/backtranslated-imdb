Being a completely broken movie buffer with the house, I'm a big IKEA fan. My entire location, practically, is packed with small chipboards. And you know how all these stylish household items with IKEA have these funny names - a bookcase called "Holika" and a bathroom mirror "Grundtal" - it just adds the whole Euro charm. <br /> <br /> Like these interesting names (but terribly translated) items on IKEA shelves, I would like to give some translations some of the comments I've read about Swedish-made "Kraftverk 3714". <br /> <br /> Original comment: "For a low budget movie, it's pretty cool. It's nice to see what these guys can do in the Hollywood budget!" <br /> <br /> Translation: The film's stock is dirty, lighting is pedestrian, cinema is uninteresting, sound recording is hollow. characters! "Translation: These" actors "act free of charge, the story is round and tiring, the ideas that hold under the flick try to be desperately existential, but are just everyday and the settings (especially the interiors) are boring and full of stupid wallpaper. <br /> < br /> Original Comment: "Editing is well done and conservative use of computer graphics shows that CGI's impact does not have to appear in Hollywood studio! "<br /> <br /> Translation: If you first have visual cinematography, hide the flaws by digitizing it all on your Mac and vigorously mixing it for three minutes. Capable! <br /> <br /> I took this DVD as I am an independent filmmaker, especially those who are trying to solve the often expensive and awe-inspiring genre, and I think that some of the best sci-fi fiction of the time has been realized with little or no budget, spfx and extraordinary actors. "Idaho Transfer" classical. <br /> <br /> But "Kraftverk 3714" doesn't fit in the "carefully crafted, low-key ideas-based sci-fi category. It consistently focuses on characters who don't do much and don't say interesting It is too long (it comes from a big Tarkovsky fan). Even worse, the concept of "foreigners of changing reality" is the feed of Twilight Zone 40 years ago. movie, and i really wanted it to be dammit! <br /> <br /> But I'm a fan of IKEA, but I did an earthquake. First, anyone who has bought an IKEA knows how their complex shopping carts work - all four wheels are multi-dimensional. Trolleys can rotate to a perfect 360 degree, and it takes some sensitivity to treat them like a pro, as any sure IKEA buyer knows. Well, I'm fucking, but one of the leading actors in "Kraftverk 3714" goes to some green grocery store somewhere in the middle and what does it pull around? Multidirectional shopping cart! So it's not all IKEA's invention, but it's another great invention (we call it "Tacklebee" for this hell) hey-doo land!
