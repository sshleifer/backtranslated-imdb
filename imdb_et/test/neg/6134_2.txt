I saw a DVD in a shop near my home, and since I'm an addict to "cheesy horror movie / alien flicks," I thought how good it was. It also comes with two awards (I don't remember what the festival won) so I thought "Hey, this may be good". So I bought it (five euros) and came to IMDb to review some reviews. Here, either person looked at the movie to say it was bad, or people said the movie was a wonderful movie in indie films bla, bla. Then I played a DVD, did not think of any reviews I had read, openly and did not expect anything at all. <br /> <br /> Man ... I don't want to be critical, but the movie was really bad ... OK, I just give you a few tips on what I thought: <br /> <br /> 1 action / dialogue: the actor was so confused ... sometimes the actors did a decent job, but there were scenes where I couldn't make any effort at all! The dialogue was even the worst ... I think it was probably the aspect that I didn't like most in the film. Talking between the characters seemed ... out. Not only bad, but far from the actual events of the film. Female character monologues, albeit well, became a bit boring and annoying ... But of course the most ridiculous aspect ... "foreigners" or "infected" ... I don't even comment on this one, just saying it was completely ridiculous and took the entire mood away from the picture; 2-Visuals: The Strongest Aspect of Film ... When You Forget the Terrible FX and the Light Blinking What They Used to Simulate Explosions or What They Had to Hell. The "camera in the car" aspect was quite cool, but they didn't even use the environment to inspire fear or fear. They left it for cheap audio and video and three "infected" characters. The film becomes so boring in so many scenes ...; 3-Sound: Talk about editing ... this movie doesn't have any trouble editing it. Computer sounds that imitate wildlife "alien dialogue" ... ah ... <br /> <br /> So I liked the movie ... (SPOILERS) the only thing I really liked and it was really scary was the two scenes the sequence where the car is still and where you notice something / someone who has walked far. First I thought I saw things, but when the figure realizes that the "figures" in front of him were his own reflection, I was surprised! A pretty horrible idea well done! Besides that ... I had a terrible time. <br /> <br /> And I don't recommend it to anyone ... not even "do it together" because you can't even laugh at it. <br /> <br /> I give him a strong 2. Only a few technical achievements worked here ... besides ... yes ... nothing
