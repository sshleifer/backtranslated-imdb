How this movie can be considered a drama, I have no idea. If I were John Voight and Mary Steenburgen, I would try to delete it from my CV. It was historically accurate as Xena and Hercules. Abraham and Moses came to Noah. Lot, Abraham's nephew, Lot, rises for thousands of years before he was born. The Canaanites went to earth ... really? What were the screenwriters? Whether it was just ignorance ("I remember something about Noah and animals, Lot and Canaan and all this thing from Sunday school"), they tried to offend as many people as possible on the planet - Christians, Jews and Muslims, historians, archaeologists, geologists, psychologists, linguists. .. did anyone get offended? Anyone who even had a nice taste would have imprisoned him!
