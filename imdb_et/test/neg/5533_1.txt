Wakayama Tomisaburo is a former Kaishakunin Ogami Itto, which was completely natural. His way of behaving, his voice, his appearance - it all spread apart. When he entered the room I, as well as the characters on the screen, he might feel that he was not there and that his decision to be in trouble there. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that Mr. Wakayama actually took the training of Kendo (Japanese sword game) and that would explain his comfort with the catana, which showed great in every cut. When you watch movies, from the moment he draws a sword, you feel as if you were witnessing something inevitable. He'd even want to shake the blood quickly before it slanted and it would easily happen. <br /> <br /> The transfer of Nakamura Kinnosuke takes place as a transfer. He seems to be trying too nice to be someone else's or someone else's story. As a result, I would lose every time I tried to deal because I didn't feel my role. As if it was uncomfortable for him. <br /> <br /> The cardinality of the TV series was also an old school Hollyweird. Camera cuts to hide Mr. Nakamura's inconvenience with Katana, slow action, targets, etc. Very bad from the viewer's perspective. In the episode, "Castle Wall Attack" was a moment when Mr. Nakamura pulled his sword like a child. It was embarrassing. He treated it as if it was hard! I almost fell off my chair. And let's face it: the story is a great sword-masculine. Period. Swordsmanship is a problem. <br /> <br /> Realism is not, however: in the films, the sword fight was excellent and manga-like, as it was intended, I'm sure. (The baby carriage was equipped with automatic, fast fire muskets led by 3-year-olds? Yes ... in manga style.) This is how the story sews historically cultural accuracy in principle to superhero fantasy that makes movies. (Read Yoshikawa Eiji Musashi [% historical legend]%!) I couldn't really sit through the episodes of the TV series. They just felt cheap. Watch movies first and know what I'm talking about.
