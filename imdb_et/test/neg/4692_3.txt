Esther Williams plays a romantic possession of a water ski secretary who wants to stop "walking on the water" and be a man of some man; Van Johnson and Tony Martin are his possible choices for his wife. Despite the fine water sequences filmed at Florida Cypress Gardens, this romantic comedy is terribly hidden. Like the leading Charles Charles Walters, everything here is deliberately harmless, which does not give much power to the picture. Even Esther's great moments in the water are not quite astonishing jumps from other swimming equipment, although they are more preferred by men who are both colorless. Carroll Baker, the debut of his film, when Martin's satisfied former girlfriend, is the busiest bundle. Blurry things, indeed. * 1/2 from ****
