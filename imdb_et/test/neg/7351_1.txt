I agree with "SpecialAgentFoxMulder" that this episode is terribly bad for the whole show. Now, I don't want any episodes of later series, but it takes a cookie! It was unusual and unpleasant. As for the end, I'm sorry, but it bothered me more than any other episode. <br /> <br /> I mean, boys think they meant well, but the end was so disturbing that they thought the whale was a month and over the credit we saw that it was dead. Wht could have saved an episode if the pranksters were able to recognize what they were doing. <br /> <br /> There seems to be no outgoing message. Okay, South Park can be guilty of proclaiming too much and it's always nice to see that one (like Love is not Warcraft) is insecure, but this episode was just wrong!
