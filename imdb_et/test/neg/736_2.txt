I've seen some terrible book-to-movie adjustments during my day, but one of them is the best! Strangely unattractive majority worsens the story, which in itself is misleading to the book. Mr. Tilney is nothing beautiful; Like Catherine Morland, the similar appearance of rats makes it difficult for the heroine to sell to a compassionate audience. Isabella has nothing like Aphrodite, which is read in the original text, and James Morland appears too little in the film to leave the viewer without understanding his important role in the story. Also, as others have pointed out earlier, this novel was meant to meet Austin's widespread Gothic madness, but it seems that this "soft horror" movie has been designed and designed seriously. I'm sure Jane Austen turns her grave every time one of her fans is disappointed with the terrible interpretation that was supposed to be a joke.
