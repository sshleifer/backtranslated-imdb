My wife and I watched it after the DVR that it was out of Encore's activity last week. It must be the worst horror flick ever seen by any of us. Predictable dialogue (my wife and I were talking before talking), hokey special effects, a scenario that moved all over the place. I think the part that was the most annoying was the stereotyping of the various symbols of the scenario, not to mention the free events between the two young heroes of the film, neither of which was for real purposes except the disclosure of certain parts. camera anatomy. This film should be categorized as comedy, not as a horror, because the film's scrapers (spiders) were animated and not less believable. I can't say I would have done a better job for the movie, but it was very amateurish and not even a "B" movie, somewhere closer to the "d" movie or "f" if possible. I think even the Science Fiction 3000 should pass it on!
