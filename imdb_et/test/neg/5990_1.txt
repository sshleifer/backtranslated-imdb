I don't think I've seen a movie of fear that is bad because ... hell, I don't think I've ever seen this movie of fear. Acting alone was enough to make one. Bad action went beyond the horror film. It was just terrible. And did you control these pious special effects? When the demon (which seemed to be a cheap-built doll) came out of the wall, I couldn't tell if I had to fear or laugh at my ass. This film was mostly disappointing for the big fan of the fear genre. I could not notice that the director was Portland, OR, which just happens to be my home town. I have to say that I am very ashamed. If I could, I'd give this film a negative 500.
