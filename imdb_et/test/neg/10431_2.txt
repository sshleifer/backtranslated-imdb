Maybe it should have been a title. The bad dialogue was sent at a snail's pace. All characters have one dimension except one. Unfortunately, this character has some of the worst features and does not seem to fit into this two-hour drag-and-drop of clich√©s. The film that grew up in the seventies is not detailed enough, atmosphere and authenticity. Surprisingly, it was prepared by Kelsey's grammar, someone who should admit a sharp dialogue and consistent narrative in the script. Cameron Richardson is about the only element that shines this film. Robin Trower's music is also welcome.
