STMD! is not a terrible movie, but it is quite forgotten. Lighting is deliberately bad in many scenarios and inadvertently bad for the rest, so you probably have a headache or eye force. Special effects are imaginative, but obvious. The nudity of young people, which is necessary for teen bags, is naturally with archetypal teenagers, but the whole film is not just a gel. There was a need for somewhat faster dialogue and more language-in-cheek humor. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend using this time to watch this movie. I often give a movie based just on the scene or two, which shows imagination or humor, but these films unfortunately do not exist.
