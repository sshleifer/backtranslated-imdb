I have the impression that I watch another movie for most other people I've seen this movie. It's not really that I found the film offensive or something - just that the script was incredibly amateurish for a movie that obviously had some money on him. I really respected Paul Haggis's work on the Million Dollar Baby Script and was bitterly disappointed to see how bad this script was. It was clear to me that the version of "racism" in traffic was desperate, but I don't think traffic was really a movie that was first ripping. <br /> <br /> The worst feature of this movie is how it shamelessly hits its audience. Does Haggisreally think we are so stupid that we need to take empty pictures? Do you need to see a phonebook in the Farhad dashboard where the address was in black texta? Can we not leave ourselves to create logic for ourselves? <br /> <br /> I also had a big problem with the dialogue that was on my nose. I have heard that one critic says that the quality of the dialogue is deceptive, because although people may not speak this way, they will certainly think so. This is not relevant. The purpose of such a script is to use the dialogue in a way that contributes to characterizing and credible situations (in this case highly unlikely). These characters speak with the same voice and all they say is racism. <br /> <br /> The goal of such a movie should definitely be the fact that the race should not really be a problem in these situations, but making it the only focus of each scene, is it not essentially a racist self? The characters walk from their philosophy and from comfortably memorable statistics on race relationships as if they had revived the extracts of the essay they were writing. This is absolutely convincing and obvious. <br /> <br /> The film should gradually reveal its meaning, not open its face in opening scenes and never let it. I can see that Hagney's intentions with this film were honorable, but I dare assume that he has not been able to identify and overcome his shortcomings by directing his script. I really hope that the writer / directors will be very cautious about this "mosaic style" in the future. This has been done many times, but it is very difficult to strike a balance between personal and political rights. And Robert Altman is not surprised at this department.
