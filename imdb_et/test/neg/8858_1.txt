If you watched Pulp Fiction not see this movie. This movie is not funny. This is the worst parody movie ever. This is a bad test of parody movies. <br /> <br /> The cast is bad. The film is bad. This is one of the worst pictures ever made. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend Plump Fiction. I prefer the great Quentin Tarantino's original Pulp Fiction. This is one of the worst parody films ever made. <br /> <br /> Plump Fiction is not a good movie. That's not funny. It's so stupid and vulgar.
