I rented this movie, waiting for it to suck, and it didn't let me down. I rented it with some friends. But what we got was worse than anyone could ever imagine. <br /> <br /> It starts sucking before you take it out of the box. It seems that the Blade's rip-off and cover cover are not in the movie anywhere. It's called vampire Assassin, but isn't an assassin killing someone for rent? Well, this guy kills his will, so he doesn't make him an assassin. <br /> <br /> When you actually put it on the disk, it gets worse. First, the menu animation is flat. But when you actually start a movie, every thing from design to lighting (or lack of it) is terrible. You know, the movie is bad when the credit is even sucking. Action is ridiculous. Action is childish. Writing is elementary. And management is the worst
