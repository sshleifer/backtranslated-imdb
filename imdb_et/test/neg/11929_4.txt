This is a bit irritating if the studio refuses to press for the film before it is widely released. The fact that many movies are sucking is not surprising, but when the studio itself recognizes so much before, the film making process becomes passionate. Make it a Hollywood early Christmas gift that "Aeon Flux" is not just a taste and dignity for the above. Although it is finally puzzled, it is at least (sort of) an idea to play with. Too bad director Karyn Kusama seems to have little idea how to do all this. <br /> <br /> This is the future. There's been a plague. There are dictatorships and rebels. The latter are known as polygons, and they are not far from the cult of Beret or tennis rackets, they are trying to overthrow what is called the Goodchild mode. The regime means from time to time for citizens that are more than Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) and his sons can stand. With the help of some biochemical virtual reality technology, monks can order from their dear leader (Frances McDormand), a mysterious priest who seems to be baptized with carrot. Aeon has some form-fitting futuristic spandex rivers to carry high carrot orders, which are, of course, some versions of "destruction of the regime." A year earlier, he looked at his sister Goodchild in liquidation, she needs little convincing. <br /> <br /> It's no surprise that things are getting complicated. Goodchilds may not be exactly what they look like, and Aeon may have an unexpected history with them. Although occasionally confused, the central attitude of the film (which I no longer ask for) includes some pure concepts of the existence and survival of a person. There's plenty of room for exploring what the film doesn't use, but there are ideas at least. The big problems with Aeon Flux are technical. Kusama has made an amazing decision to film almost all the activities so close that we can rarely follow what is happening. Worse still, it is delivered with jumps that leave us completely lost. The result is some serious distancing that takes over the film. "Aeon Flux" aesthetics is one of the sleek costumes, strange corner architecture and cheeky characters. Much of the activity takes place in minimalist, open spaces that ask for some uninterrupted long frames that can convey the above-mentioned grace and sportiness. Instead, we get split seconds from flying limbs, breaking the glass and the accompanying sound effects. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty good movie trying to get out of the "Aeon Flux" morale. Put this stuff in Wachowski's brothers, and the results may be quite different. But as I felt "Aeon Flux" deliberately pushed me out of the movie I wanted to enjoy. This film does not match its strengths. As a beginner poker player, he dealt with a royal flush, but somehow he finds a chance to lose, despite its potential.
