No gore, no blood, no gratifying death scenes ... stupid stupid, stupid. Dear God, who sat through this film, made me sick. Sick sick sick. Very boring ... very boring ... <br /> <br /> This movie is not even humorous! I can't say anything except the driver who was a nice body ... I guess. Certainly, this fifty cent is not worth what I rented for it.
