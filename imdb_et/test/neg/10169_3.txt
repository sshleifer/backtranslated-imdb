The owner of an antique shop in NYC, played by Joanne Whalley (Valerie Alston), is being put on trial by a US District Court jury, known as Mafioso Armand Asante (Rusty Pirone), and most of this very slow pace revolves around Pirone's attempts to get Whalley. to confess him to murder, threatening to kill his son and himself. A lot of action is being taken by involving the fearsome mob-abnormalities that have spread with Willam Hurt as a skip. Much of this stupid, scattered confusion surrounds Hurt and Asante's obsession with Whalley, the court scenes we've all seen time and again, and the end that is incredible. 3/10 is probably a waste of time.
