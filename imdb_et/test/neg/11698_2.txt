For me, this film was too far from Straub's novel. Barely in the middle of the movie. Aside from being a son of Edward's nephew, Don Wanderly removed most of the main scenes and characters that gave the novel so much life. What was left was the trash. The Straub version was much worse than this poorly executed film. I do not believe that casting did not do such a great job in choosing Chowder society members. Hopefully, someone in my life will get the whole movie properly. I just hate when Hollywood kills the works of talented authors because they think their version is so much better. Makes me sick.
