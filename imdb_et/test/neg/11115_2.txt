"Chupacabra Terror" is recorded from "1" in the presence of Canadian hero Chelan Simmons as a heroine, she is happy to look, front, back and side, otherwise your standard monster movie, John Rhys-Davies, plays the captain of the ship to whom the monster is being transported, and A very unpleasant monster is just a suit for a man who makes about 100 meaningless at least fun killings, so the body considers it quite fantastic. In smaller words I love this moment when Simmons maliciously tells someone what chupacabra stands for: Goat eater! Oooohhh ... scary!
