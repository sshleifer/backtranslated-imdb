WARNING! SPOILER! This movie is an absolute mess. It's not entertainment. I have no words to describe the resentment I felt at the end. <br /> <br /> This is a badly made movie about the impact of society. During the whole movie, I was expecting it better. It wasn't. Instead, it just got worse and worse. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie that is as bad as it is, I always try to find at least one good one. In this case, it turned out to be impossible. I can't say anything about that. How bad did it get? Well, here's an example: At the end Dan Akroyd ends up killing Vincent D'Onofrio when Reeves and Diaz look! It's not entertainment!
