Luchino Visconti, an artist with a sword. Courage should be the first word associated with all his opulence. Movie. Theater. Music. Revolutions, artistic, cultural, personal. A legacy with powerful consequences and endless consequences. He introduced Neorealism in the work of Ossesione by American writer James Cain. He gave Anna Magnan the most beautiful loved ones in his career. He gave us Alain Deloni and Maria Callase. But the last word about his life and work is based on the voice of a certain Adam Low and Helmut Berger. What is a terrible destiny. <br /> <br /> For interested parties, director Carlo Lizzan (Visconti conscious man) is a 61-minute documentary called LUCHINO VISCONTI A PORTRAIT. It's through a DVD that is distributed by Image Entertainment
