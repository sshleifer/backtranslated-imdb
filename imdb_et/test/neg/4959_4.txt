2.5m from the budget is not very big when watching movie animation, puppet information, which alone is the reason for 9 weeks of shooting. I was really interested in watching this movie and hoping to catch it when it came out, instead I got it on a DVD recently. My main problem is that it's not funny at all, it's better than Tenacious D, who doesn't have funny bone in his body. But it was a really disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> Trevor Matthews is a very strong physical performer but his acting sucking! Rachel Skarsten gives you an opportunity that is one of the most irritating and no fun shows I've ever seen. The only real BIG star is David Scott, who is a monster work of art. His special effects work is the main reason to watch this movie, Cyclops and Troll loved, and Prof Monster was directly from the Henson Library. the biggest waste of time, but if you want to see it in a great horror comedy romp ... Don't bother.
