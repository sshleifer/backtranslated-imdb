I saw this movie because every review I read was said to be one of the most terrifying films of the new millennium. I really do not understand what all the leap was. First, the dialogue in this film was ridiculously bad ("What if something strange?" ... what ????). The actors didn't hit my socks either. It could have been because the script didn't work hard for the participants. The characters are purely 2-dimensional for me and I didn't give them a hoot at all. Another thing is that the movie is very boring. Extremely. Of course, here and there there are a couple of "jolts", but for the 112-minute length of the movie, it certainly did not use it occasionally. Most of the film contains characters that speak of things that had hardly anything to do with the plot. What was the idea? <br /> <br /> Moreover, the movie does not make sense. Yes, I believe I have understood the ghosts' intentions, but how it fits into the actual events in the film. Also, much of the movie is played in small vignettes, making it difficult to follow. And don't even start with me until the end. What exactly happened there? There are very horrible pictures of ghosts and other undisturbed images. If they reflected on these images and developed them, it would have made the film much stronger. But they didn't do it, and instead worked out with a social comment that was interesting, but again, which was extremely boring. Yes, it's a movie. Okay, fun. I'm just getting my review message open here: you will find a better way to spend your free time than to watch it.
