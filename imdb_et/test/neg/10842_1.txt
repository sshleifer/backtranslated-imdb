This film seems like someone with a lovely idea about the movie, thinking of two or three fun options, hired good light, then the whole thing really turned to a bad scriptwriter and even a worse driver. The director in the movie screwdriver romantic comedy, as if it were dark, artistic film --- weird camera corners, blue filtered shots, protracted, look at the raindrops. Steve Zahn was good, as always. Ben Affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy; he was perfect for romantic comedy. Sandra Bullock bravely fought with the character who was supposed to be a keeper, but whose insecurity was in things such as mad kissing the spouse he hated, giving up his child, going to the carnival, recording for money and trying to ride peacefully. airline passenger. The script had very few funny lines; there was no physical comedy; it was boring. It introduced potentially funny situations, then cut them out before they evolved. First of all, it's all turned off, at the end of "twisting" there was a face of someone waiting for a fun romantic comedy. When you saw the movie on the trailer and liked it, as I did, my advice is: don't go to the movie. It only breaks a nice trailer.
