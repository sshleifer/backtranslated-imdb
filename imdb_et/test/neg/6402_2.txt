The couple is moving to their dream home without knowing that it and its neighbors have been built on the land used to be a cemetery. The film is said to be the basis for a true story, although how much it should be true is not disclosed. The plot is hardly unique - see Spielberg's "Poltergeist" (1982). In a short period of time, they experience a variety of supernatural phenomena: ranging from distracting - mysterious shadows, serious illness of the daughter - to honestly ridiculous toilets that are constantly rinsed out and the garage doors are out of control. There is little story: if it is found that the land has been used as a cemetery, we will not learn more. The parcel does not look out. The characters are not particularly well drawn and in no way memorable, and the atmosphere is not very special. The film may disturb some viewers. There is no catharsis or its positive message.
