This movie is so predictable if you know the modern American dream: do something, be loser and then suddenly ... who! You are a genius and unpleasant, and the world kisses the land you are walking on. <br /> <br /> And surprisingly all other smart people are losing. They don't know anything and are bitter when our miracle solves problems so easily. And what problems? They are so heavy, but these professors can still analyze the results in less than 10 seconds. <br /> <br /> Every movie has something good anyway and Robin Williams is in it.
