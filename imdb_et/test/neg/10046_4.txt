It is one of those strange, self-important films that are trying too hard to be deep. This is not. Instead, it creates clich√©s that try to make a profit. Typically, the scene where Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains to the protagonist and the best friend Adam (Dwier Brown) how a person starts breastfeeding, then moves to suck his girlfriend and finally his wife, concluding that life sucks. So deep. We are treated with a variety of characters who offer their perspective on life, the universe, etc. while traveling through Adam on the Mojave Desert. (He suddenly leaves L.A. from his wedding and family, friends day and the groom assumes he's dead when his car was found in the military test range that was broken by the rocket.) Some characters are more fun than others. The best is the mental hospital refugee who only speaks of the voices of others. Actor James Kevin Ward makes some great impressions, including Nicholson, Popeye and several characters from the original Star Trek. But when interesting characters leave the screen, we are again deep with Adam and his pursuit. It's a long journey that drags in many places. In fact, it's the longest hour and half of the movie I've ever seen. And the final will not do it at all if I do. <br /> <br /> I discovered a movie that played on HBO one day, waking up too early and clicking on the TV. It learns me. The next time I try harder to sleep.
