This is one of the main problems with this film, with a large number of québecois's biggest films: pretentious people have made more intentional ways. <br /> <br /> It's really sad, but "big shots" filmmakers (flying Dodge Stratus ...) from this province believe they got Thruh, they know what little people like. <br /> <br /> We are not a rich province, every time such a big movie (30 million)? !!) It has been cut off by many others who do not see their movie due to lack of government support. So it creates mediocrity; only movies from "family friends" are made. <br /> <br /> I'm angry and I'm. I went to Nouvelle-France to wait for a trip in the lives of my ancestors, but I found myself in a set of contradictions: the French accent (we ask our relatives, so we get our québecois) and historical research is just a few. Add a campy love story and the same piece of music that plays over and over again and the stupid québecois viewer opens and asks for more. I'm glad that this pretentious piece didn't do the same as Dodge stratus in Big Shots ... It helps filmmakers who aren't in Québec's very restrained "movie business". > <br /> Rent a lane and have a great time. <br /> <br /> PS: I will never forgive them for destroying such an awesome title.
