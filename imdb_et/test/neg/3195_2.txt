Wow. I looked at McCool one night yesterday and all I can say is "Wow." <br /> <br /> Here I go. MAIN SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> Do you want a plot summary to see how stupid and pointless this movie is? I will never tell anyone who would look at it unless I had caused them pain. Anyway, here's a glimpse (or a big piece). <br /> <br /> Randy is working at the bar, McCool's. She meets the woman named Jewel who convinces her to have sex with her surprisingly. His ex boyfriend is trying to rob and kill them. Randy and his cousin and the detective detectives fall on Jewel. He's a foolish mascot, every one of these men uses to get what he wants by involving a DVD player. Randy hires him to hit, and finally kills the detective's former boyfriend's psycho-brother and hit the man and the Jewel start. <br /> <br /> Seriously. That's it. I hardly missed anything except for a few sexual scenes and Liv-Tyler's almost pornographic scene like Jewel, using a hose against his sexuality. <br /> <br /> What was the meaning of this movie? Frankly, I think it was so that producers and leaders could show their male calls. I think it is completely void and just stupid. When I watch a movie, I want a plot. I want signs. I don't care about a sexy woman who discourages anything they have. The film should do something for goodness. It's as bad as the Fight Club. <br /> <br /> It gets even worse. John Goodman is a detective dedicated to a higher being. I myself wondered why Goodman is playing something so angry about sadness, but then I remembered he was an O brother, where are you? as well. His reputation just fell to the notch. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler was an amazing actor in the Rings series. In this film, she is more than just an unseen bitch who wants nothing more than his way. His reputation for me has fallen by seven or eight degrees. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised, just AMAZED, so people work so hard to make something so stupid. The music is completely crappy (which has a "YMCA" game, while John Goodman's character is being killed, doesn't really fit), the characters are completely unlikely, the plot is one of the most stupid people ever imagined, not even suitable for some genre. It's closest to pornographic comedy. If it were even funny. What it wasn't. <br /> <br /> I think I have now been healing. But let me just assure you that no one in their right sense ever wants to see this movie. If they don't like Liv Tyler as much as the characters do, it is.
