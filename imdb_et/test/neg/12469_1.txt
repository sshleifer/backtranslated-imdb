Story basic structure: start, middle, end. Sometimes it's not just linear, la Pulp Fiction. Regardless of whether they all have a start, middle and end. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Top: Girl's Best Friend Middle: The girl has to do without the best friends. <br /> <br /> End: Not available. <br /> <br /> Not that the end of this movie has been recorded, but at least it would have been complete. <br /> <br /> This is an apathy exercise; we get a character party and they all turn out to be dude. Bored, void, coats and burning imitations of people. <br /> <br /> And here's the action in this movie: NOT ACID. Nothing will happen. Mischa Barton tries to talk plummy English accent, Dominique Swain whines a lot and Brad Renfro gets a blow job with some old man. End of the movie. <br /> <br /> At the time of credit, I had a terrible feeling that many prisoners need to know: periods of time, the precious minutes of our lives have just been wasted. <br /> <br /> The only satisfactory point (and it is ONLY very emphatic) is Brad Renfro. He's doing well. Lacey Chabert, whom I usually like, but not lucky. Because of the good work in other movies, I forgive Mischa Barton for this travesty, but I hope all the cast members were hit on the face to get them. <br /> <br /> Please, I ask you. Avoid. Don't be fooled into thinking, "I'll do my mind." My sister told me she'd never see it, and I ignored her, who wanted to make my thoughts. That was a bad decision. <br /> <br /> I've never hated a movie. I don't like much, but I've never hated the movie. Until I saw it.
