You know those movies that are so unthinkable that you have to laugh? Poland was not one of them. What sounds good, right? But no, it's not. It's not a bad test of the horror movie that is fun to watch because it's flat or doesn't work well or has a bad special effect or something else. No, the half box is just boring. They don't even try to be scary until the last 20 minutes are so. It's just kids who drive in the African bush country and send 75% of the movie to the elephant manure at first, and it's not even funny. However, the last 20 minutes are HILARIOUS. I have no idea what happened, but it was really fun to see that the CGI leopard hangs out all those white guys I couldn't say anyway. If you're in the mood for bad horror movies, don't rent it because you go to bed before they start to have fun. If you rented this movie by mistake, I would advise you to fast forward and skip all the scenes in daylight. You're not leaving anything behind. You have no idea what kind of character is what is happening or what is happening, even if you look at the whole story.
