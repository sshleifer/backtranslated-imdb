Faithful and tiring, with one liner, I almost cried. My 4-year-old left the room and finished the puzzle. I don't know what age group it was written for, but the writer didn't even want credit. As for the song, it's a little fun. At least it was ten years ago. There are many Christmas movies to watch. Although I've seen much more than this, they're still enjoyable. When that happens, I try to encourage my child to look at something else. One positive note that allowed 1 to vote for 1 is that it promotes good moral values. It would have been encouraging if someone looked.
