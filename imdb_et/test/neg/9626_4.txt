Wow, with exciting visual effects. I also loved costumes and art, the circus of the movie and the essential feeling was superb. It just needed the need for the viewer to worry about the fate of our protagonist. Since he is trapped in his imagination, he never has to be threatened, unlike the words of David Lynch, which haunt every time. This also points to the age group the film is directed to. Who would do that? <br /> <br /> Mirrormasks obviously make comparisons with a maze of teenage / fantasy themes, but unfortunately this is not as close to communicating the same Henson character. The subject of the sick mother has never been fully explained and certainly not something that you care about slipping the candy of the eye. <br /> <br /> Not agonizing terrible la Cell or tempting dreamy like labyrinth - forgotten but good - looks fantasy.
