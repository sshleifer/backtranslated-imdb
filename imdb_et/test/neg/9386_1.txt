This show is terrible. I cannot overcome the complete waste of this great talent that this show contains. It's not a fun improvisational actor, it's just an inexpensive attempt to throw a famous comedy actor on stage and let them fill in a badly improved scene. I've actually done some improvement work as actors and this exhibition hasn't improved. <br /> <br /> What the audience actually laughs about (if they laugh at all, it looks pretty fake) is the embarrassment of the guest star as deer in headlamps. The dark, interconnected things they come out of are the ones people laugh at. And if it's not part of the scene, the actors tell them it's wrong! I find this exhibition disgraceful for art and make me cry for such exhibitions as the one for whom it is anyway, which had great talent, great improvisation games and everything else did not make me change the channel.
