Maybe I'm too generous when I give this movie two and a half stars out of five, but there was a random moment. But like the "American werewolf" movie, this is a forgotten opportunity! There is no real plot connection to the boss's original talk, but the story is somewhat similar to "London". <br /> <br /> * Possible Spoiler Warning * American kids go abroad, one gets into the love of a beautiful girl. Another child can kill the werewolf the same night that one bites, and despite his undead friend's warnings, in the light of a full moon he germinates fur, bear and claws! <br /> <br /> But the story has one difference; girl is one of werewolves. Secondly; there are three American kids. And thirdly; there are some weird - @ $$ werewolf cult intention to take over the world! As crazy as it sounds, the last one is no joke! * Spoiler ends * <br /> <br /> Movies suffer from a lot of things, first and foremost, sluggish performance is tremendously down! Tom Everret Scot's performance is the best, and he and Julie Delpy, who play the interests of their love, don't seem to have any chemistry at all. Secondly; A weak script that seems to be all over the place. In this chapter, there are many elements of temporary and dark comedy that made the original great. And who said eating a werewolf's heart, which would make you a little bit back, is a man? Finally I heard that it was not part of the werewolf tradition at all! Thirdly; terrible special effects; A werewolf affects a computer animation that works for example on dinosaurs, ghosts, and spacecraft. But it seems uncomfortable, fake and artificial when used for hairy creatures like werewolves. <br /> <br /> But there were some things that saved it from "turkeydom", there is one fun scene in the Paris cafe, when Andy (Scott) takes coffee with Serafine (Delpy), he falls on the condoms and try to chew and chew them as a chewing gum. Also; a soundtrack, a very cool mix of alternative rock bands like Bush and Smashmouth. Although no song has the word "moon" in their title, like the original movie, the soundtrack is great. And another funny scene where Julie Bowen's rotten body was trying to whistle and eject her eyeball, I laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> But this film seems to be a whole spiritual and tense original. And an overly complicated end won't help that much. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 Two and a half five stars (average).
