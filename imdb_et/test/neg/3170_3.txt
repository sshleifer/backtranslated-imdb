I don't usually like turning off a movie if it's really bad. Home is a movie I wish I didn't even turn on. The plot is interesting, but the actor and writing are too low. I don't care about the characters. Every film with drug use and nudity is not worthy of. The characters spent their time and believed in me, the only way to sit through this film.
