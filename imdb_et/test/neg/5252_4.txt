The future of fantasy never seemed so dark! Christopher Lambert in the battle with the evil demon Grendel in this grim fantasy fantasy epic. "Epos" I said? Er ... there is only one place, so you can't call it a truly epic adventure? The location is a medieval / futuristic 5-inch long castle, so how did they cram in all the actors? Oh, I get those with special effects. Miniature. Crazy to me. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the reasons why you want or don't want to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> - Lambert is starting to make his swords again as he did in Highlander. <br /> <br /> - Sets and costumes are amazingly cool (if you're 12 years old). <br /> <br /> Rhona Mitral is a nice knocker she likes to show through the movie. <br /> <br /> - ... er, Christopher Lambert has white hair ... <br /> <br /> - Every time they start to fight, the giant shaving techno-soundtrack goes. Why do these medieval killers fight when they should dance. Where is the Amplifier? I think they borrowed the sound from the techno that delivered the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> - See if this is the end result that contains a terrible demonic CGI creature coming directly from the Playstation 2 survival horror. <br /> <br /> If you like it all, check it out (at your own risk), but don't tell anyone I said. I doubt that Pinhead will visit the set while shooting because there is no soul in this film. Anyway, if you want to see the beautiful Rohna Mitra really skin, check out Paul Verhoeven's HOLLOW MAN.
