Many negative reviews focus on the historical accuracy of this film. OK, it was about as much as the actual NFL, because your average war movie is related to the actual war, or in the West it's a real "old west". So, I think we should give them this permission. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the director (Clooney) probably thinks that making a comedy for a balloon means a) stupid things, b) a camera for a camera, and c) take stupid scenes and stretch them too long. Screwball comedies need fast pace, not necessarily frenetics, but they keep moving all the time. Here you drag and drop and drag. When you look at this movie, we appreciate how brilliant Mack Sennett was when he started a lot of genre with his Keystone Cops. In 90 years, you would think the directors would have learned the old masters and learned something or two, maybe even some things to improve. But no, it would have been like someone watching a car pioneer who built Duesberg and almost a century later paid tribute and "repaired" the concept by knocking a wagon with a bike. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed many of Clooney's films, I consider him a talented actor. However, very few participants can manage themselves competently; Clint Eastwood took the time to hang it. Clooney is clearly a very steep slope. The movie gets a few times out of the frame, but when he's in the picture, he makes himself the center of attention. In combat scenes, his looting is so unpleasant if you want someone to jump into him. <br /> <br /> If you make a soccer comedy and want to throw some romance, you need to develop chemistry between men. and women. Clooney and Zellweger have all the chemistry of the waste bins in the car park. There are no sparks, no sparks, not even post mortem. Zellweger, who has also proved to be a good movie, must have sold his botox injection to oak tannin, giving it amazing wood. He could just pull the "harsh wide man in the world" when he once tried to call testosterone, he had looked at the camera with a small half-smile and a blink of an eye. But no, he kept his jockstrap complete. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest sin here is that the movie isn't just funny. Making stupid things is not the same as slapstick. Funny things like Stooges, or very sporty, like Buster Keaton, can be funny. But otherwise it's boring and well, stupid. I think I got one laugh from the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this. I saw it in a free cable and wanted to get my money back.
