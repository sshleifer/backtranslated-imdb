The paper has some pieces on the film: the street boy who crosses the trauma of the past, restores his life and succeeds if the world wrote him. Great things, everyone loves a happy ending. <br /> <br /> The theater, however, had some drawbacks that left the movie dead. The dialogue was hollow and uninteresting, the characters were almost comic, because they lacked the dimension and complexity, and why all had to be gay? I do not have anything against homosexual themes or characters in the film, but if it is used in this way, it is not only offensive to homosexuals, it makes the lifestyle and the movie cheaper. If the story worked without this cheap trick, it should have been cut. <br /> <br /> Each item seemed to be in the same cookie form: everyone had one big mistake and one little mistake, each character with a good heart if they succeeded or not, and each had or has an abusive relationship with someone. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about the movie is that they will never let you get the name "pip". high expectations. They will give it to you once and it should be enough. The story is divided into Dickens' classic enough to prove it. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the movie is the story of the grandfather and cassette he leaves for Pip and how Pip, the main character, learns to grow up from the lessons learned from the tape. In the end, Pip stays with his life in his dark past and in the movies.
