The classic trash can! Basically, we have a story here of a couple of American teenagers (one man, one woman, both beautiful people) who seem to be psychically bound, because each time they sleep, they can dream and live each other. Express each other's most intrinsic desires ... I think Mills & Boon will match X files and you're somewhere near the mark. In fact, it is more than an unhappy hybrid between one of Ed Wood's famous bad B-films, and especially the silly Melrose Place episode, so special effects are sticky so the amateur is an actor. Actors who live (I wouldn't say to act) would say their rows as they read smart cards and pouts when they should feel emotions, and this is not a big shock (or loss) industry they've ever lost since then. The whole thing is just a ridiculously mistaken blend of styles that don't go together and the end result is an intriguing curiosity that will undoubtedly disappear from the suppliers of bad-good movies over the years. to come. I am probably the only person ever to comment on this movie, but if you read and have seen it, return, it will be lonely around here ...
