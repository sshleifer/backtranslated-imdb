The strange Jack (Matthew Lillard) arrives at the studio of Maxi (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his ambitious companion and poison specialist Jamie (Valeria Golino) that he is Jack's brother. Jamie doesn't buy her story, dominates Jack and binds her to the chair. When Max arrives, Jack will provide $ 100,000 for everyone to protect him with antique "Spanish judges" talks with a rich and dangerous collector. Max calls to his foolish Piece (Mark Boone Junior) who comes with his slow girlfriend who believes he is from Mars to back up the team. But Jack moves over the collector and then intrigues Jack, Jamie and Piece. <br /> <br /> Low budget "Spanish judges" is a film that has a reasonable scenario with a terrible conclusion that wastes good lies. Valeria Golino is amazingly beautiful, but with a good actor Vincent D'Onofrio they can't save a stupid story. What's more, scenes that, unfortunately, should be funny, do not work and are actually stupid and not funny. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("All For Money")
