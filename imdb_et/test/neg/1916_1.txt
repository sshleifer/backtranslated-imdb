It's close to the worst movie I've ever seen. The writer starts you off with Jasper (Josh Hartnett). If he did not do something wrong, Sam (Leelee Sobiesky) leaves him with Kelley (Chris Klein) in a way that leaves you mad. You won't let it know what it feels, so its feelings with Kelley are not real for you and their relationship is fake. It pulls you in both directions and becomes quite tiring and annoying. The only good film I saw was cast. <br /> <br />
