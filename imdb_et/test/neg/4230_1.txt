I don't remember when it was the last time that the film was so disappointed. Probably I thought it would happen too much (so you can expect in dogma-style movies, of course). But there's nothing here. Luckily, I looked at it at home and exchanged channels when silence and stupid / dull faces began to kill me. And it was very often! It is not really a joy when you look at ugly people who do not speak and move slowly, stroke and French kisses, not to mention the ugly body with explicit sex. If only that would make sense ... the whole murder situation is ridiculous; it seems that it was created only to show another vagina, as the zero marks can actually solve the crime. Only four of the pseudo-advanced characters and the film do not go out obviously to whom the director chose the killer. And it does not reflect any. Despite all the boredom and suffering, I have to admit that it touched me somehow inexplicably. Maybe you should look at it yourself, although I don't recommend it.
