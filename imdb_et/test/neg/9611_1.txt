What happened to exhibitions with older figures? Parents of this exhibition are almost as responsible as children. Instead of punishing the youngest child for manipulative behavior, they let him get murdered. They can never agree on how to deal with children, and they do nothing. Yes, a great plan. Just ignore their behavior because they are "cute". This exhibition speaks of manipulative proverbs that look at "sharing and conquering" techniques as the best way to "cave" your parents. The oldest children run constantly and get in any impossible situation, but their actions have no effect. Yes, great television is fine.
