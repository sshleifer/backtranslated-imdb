This movie is a good example of what happens when a studio wants to get films outside the gate at all costs. Only with this film has it almost disappeared. Everything seems to be Robocop 2's worthy first film. The full original version (except accidents, of course) returns and gives it the best. Too bad hackneyed script and incompetent director as good as neutralize your efforts. <br /> <br /> Irvin Kershner could have been a perfect go-to for George Lucas's man to drive back the impulses of the empire. For a Kershner-like pedestrian filmmaker, Lucas's exuberant series of films is not destroyed. A worthy successor, like Robocop, should have returned to Paul Verhoeven or a director with enough brass to give him his spin. Kershner doesn't know how to give her a spin (Lucas hired her for that) and she's definitely not Verhoeven. the first film, but no freshness, humor or courage on the original. Probably Kershner thought he could be at the top of Verhoeven, adding more honor and free violence, but he shows how much he was working as a director instead of a hired filmmaker. And it is a shame because everything was to make it another classic. As mentioned, the actors do their best, but Phill Tippet offers some groundbreaking stops and Frank Miller, who was born to write Robocop's movie, has some great ideas. If only the studio had hired a director who was competent enough to carry out the full potential.
