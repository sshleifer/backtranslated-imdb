Thank God I didn't work on heavy machinery, it could have been the worst disaster. The shots were slow and repetitive. Different scenes, same shots, medium picture, medium picture, medium picture, punching. The story was quite empty. The worst was William Hurt. Where did he get this foolish accent? Random shots from the landscape to just add them didn't add much. Arbor had more cars than a car. The direction really didn't bring us any scene and it didn't give me any sign. I would have estimated it to be zero if IMDb had a chance. A great sedative if you can't sleep. I went 2 hours of my life when I ever returned.
