Blake Edwards tried to make Julie Andrews's picture very difficult to change in this film. She tried to make her sexy not realize she was already. I think they were still a bit devastated, that Julie wasn't chosen to shoot her Broadway success on Camelot and it went over so it wasn't sexy enough. Unfortunately, they chose this vehicle to try this faith. It goes to a point where it's almost funny to see Rock Hudson, who we all know now, was gay, kissing this movie every 2 minutes, Julie. Now they seem to have tried not only to believe that Julie was a femme fatale, but that Rock was straight. Unfortunately, they have absolutely no chemistry, and endless kissing scenes start one out. The other mistake they made with this picture didn't know what movie they did. It's almost three separate movies. Julie is a drama when German Spy tries to get Rock out of the mystery. There's an air warfare film that has many materials on WWI vintage planes that are pounded and where there are stupid attempts to humor that Blake Edwards seems to think he has to put in each of his pictures whether it is appropriate or not. , it wasn't. The only truly redeeming qualities in this film always look at the wonderful Dame Julie and hear her singing in such a crystal-clear bell. Of course, if you love him, you can just get the weaknesses of this movie just for him. You can always tell yourself that it was much better than sitting on STAR!
