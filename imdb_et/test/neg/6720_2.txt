Three words: what pile ..... Two words: Don't bother! One word: Sucked! There is no reason to see this movie. Even those Seagal groups should go away from this movie. Martial arts, typical Aikido, are terrible. Martial arts are moving well, but cinematography is pathetic. The film actually moves slowly when Seagal gives its victims a "kill". Worse still, the three steps quickly move three times differently. How stupid. Seagall's action was a common fool, but I still give this film a "6" show because it is a "fun" role that was actually quite fun. <br /> <br /> The plot is just stupid. Seagal plays the Federal Express agent who is authorized to kill. It also features this dedicated work ethic, which means that all of his packages are sent to the right people in a timely manner - at no extra charge - and there is nothing in his way. Not as assassins, political leaders, explosions, or even death. I am looking for a certain level of violence in the martial arts film, but there are several scenes with random and terrible acts of violence that lend themselves in some way to the advancement of the film or its story. There is a reason why this movie went straight to the video and there are many reasons to avoid it. No one should be disturbed by this upside down. <br /> <br />
