I should have realized that it was a sign of things when the trailer of this movie missed me. <br /> <br /> Having looked at a number of "indie" movies in the comments given here, and later found that my opinion is completely the opposite of other reviewers, I began to wonder if I look at watching completely different movies from them people, or are they filmmakers trying to make their work "big"? Hmmm. <br /> <br /> Are you interested in seeing amateurs pay tribute to Pulp Fiction and 11:14, except in the case of worse actors, a stupid result (undermining different scenes) and incredible jumps in logic? If not, skip this movie. <br /> <br /> Here is my open letter to two players in this movie. <br /> <br /> Alfonso Morgan, please, please stop trying "Ole" Samuel L Jackon a la Pulp Fiction. No one can do what he does as well as he does. <br /> <br /> President, please come up with something original. It's a service for you to make the stuff you do for Quentin Tarantino a mistake. <br /> <br /> Just terrible and I really don't see anyone saying it is a good movie. It is a shame that people have somehow managed to score 8.5 points, like movies like Pulp fiction or Goodfellas. This is not the place near these films; 4 or 5 would be a more reasonable average rating, I'll give it 3.
