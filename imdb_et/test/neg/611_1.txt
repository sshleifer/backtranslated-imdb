I am very diplomatic in my comments and as an academic writer I try to give a creative license to TV writers who try to explain the true story. This story about Karen Carpenter could have helped so much, but it is not the way to manage and edit it. <br /> <br /> In this case, the story is not fully addressed unless someone reads the psychological magazines. Although Cynthia Gibb depicts a realistic Karen, it is sad that so much has been edited ... Louise Fletcher depicts her mother and does a good job with limited material and dialogue. In this case, I give the participants credit for the survival of this project. <br /> <br /> Why aren't audiences allowed to see causal relationships? .... The American audience is quite skilled and if they have a cable, they are usually educated. <br /> <br /> I sincerely feel I could have written a better story, not change the truth, and allow participants to design reality. <br /> <br /> Richard Carpenter, as director, has seriously underestimated and offended the American audience. Karen's story is important, and it's sad that we never hear it.
