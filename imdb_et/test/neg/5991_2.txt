Sometimes, Full Moon makes fun movies. It's not one of them. The full moon is like a low-key Troma. Their films are neither violent nor wall, but they are usually so talented. Acting in this movie is not terrible, but the script is pretty bad and, in general, it's pretty boring and doesn't even include nudity (like many full moon movies) to redeem it somewhat. Leave it out and rent "Perepea".
