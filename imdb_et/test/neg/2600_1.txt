Words cannot describe how there is asinine, minor and repeated series steaming. It is based on three things: 1. References to pop culture in the 80s 2. Tired of "stretching to the point of discomfort" and 3. At least 3 or 4 pointless setbacks per episode. The only reason I see this fucking festival is as popular as the constant pop culture references, which I expect to call the "OMG LOL, SUPERFRIEND! IT !!" viewer response. Writing is lazy, and looks at its viewers mostly in the 20s and 30s. In addition, the character is a design that appears to consist of the same three characters and the same boredom drawn over and over again, but with different skin colors and possibly a different hairline. Smashing crap.
