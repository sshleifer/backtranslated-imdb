I'm so disappointed in this movie that it can't be expressed. I was so excited when I started watching this movie to see all Mickey Rourke's skin and the third Rock Sun boy like me. I thought it was a winner, a freakin natural-born killer style. And it got better. The value of the production was great, the management was great, the operation was great, the cinematography was great and the plot was well, the plot, well, what WHAT? About half of this movie was going to draw my hair yelling, "What's going on in hell?" and I mean it literally? Nothing makes sense. Something. Something. Something. Aaaaaaahhhhhhggg !!!!
