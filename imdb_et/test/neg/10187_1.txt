This is the worst movie I've seen so far. 85 minutes of completely bad behavior (half of the pains appear to be under Asperger's syndrome), strange wigs, strange make-up (including rafts around wig areas) and more holy than your characters than your dialogue that makes you dress. One comic aspect of this movie, if you have the patience to watch it, is the large number of costume changes that unfortunate casting has appeared in the scene - did this film desperately support the manufacturer of the pastel pastel catalog? Did you get cast clothes for their work? They certainly don't deserve anything else! This terrible effort of the film gives a brisk plot in the first half of the year, which blends equally into confused Christian Bible. The whole cast and the production team must be burned at the stake or at least crossed!
