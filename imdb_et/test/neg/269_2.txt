Compared to the oceans of the twelve oceans of 2001, did anyone else notice all the things that stayed the same? <br /> <br /> - All twelve letters returned and Zeta-Jones added; <br /> <br /> Twenty had the same director, <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same producers; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same product developer; <br /> <br /> - Twelve were the same music director; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same movie editor. <br /> <br /> Has anyone mentioned things as a change when the "ocean" franchise was created? <br /> <br /> - Twelve-year budget was over $ 25 million (30%); <br /> <br /> - Eleven got great comments, but twelve were overwhelmed, <br /> <br /> - Eleven made $ 450 million, but Twenty fell to $ 362 million; <br /> <br /> - Twelve household offices fell by 32%, <br /> <br /> - Soderbergh made a different screenwriter. <br /> <br /> Movies are, of course, the director's medium. I almost forgot.
