Starting the movie started in o.k. A couple of tourists on vacation in Mexico decide they should hike. They discover some hidden paths and end, and this great temple like a fortress. Angry villagers appear and try to climb, but because of the language barrier, people get hit and tourists climb on a stupid thing. It turns out that plants are evil bleeding things that the villagers do not get closer to, so that they keep the temple so that tourists cannot escape. There are a few fears in this movie, but nothing really makes sense. I mean, they're plants! Don't worry about d.v.d. purchase or lease. Wait until it goes out with a cable.
