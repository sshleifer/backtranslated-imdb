When a movie starts, it's obvious how old and sick the guys are. Oliver Hardy is huge, Stanley looks like death has warmed. Apparently, he was sick at the time of production and probably lost a lot of weight. Though he eventually recovers and lives for another ten and a half years, he looks like a dying man. In addition, when I watched the film, I was shocked at how many Stan's exercises he took - I was hoping he would fall. I really do not understand why they came to retire because of their health - especially when the story and production values ​​are as poor as the film. <br /> <br /> Stanley blocks the island and the boat. He and Ollie are ready to leave when a stateless man Antoine has literally dropped off his boat and they start their journey to find the island. Along the way, they discover that Giovanni has kept it away, but despite this, four men become friends and land on another island. It looks like a paradise and they are all very happy. Shortly thereafter, a young lady joins them and looks great. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, uranium is discovered on the island and the place is flooded. Finally, the mobile decides to hang and take over the four men - at this point, the island sinks back to the sea and the men are saved. <br /> <br /> I give the film hope to be original and interesting. But one thing that is not is FUNNY - and it's unforgivable for Laurel and Hardy. Although this is not a bad film, it is definitely not good. The sad end to their brilliant career. <br /> <br /> All actors, except duo, are dubbed English because the film was made in France. Although it may not be the worst movie they did (it would be a big noise), it's definitely close! Watching this movie is painful and like watching people after a serious accident.
