After the doubling of weapons in the 19th century, which becomes poor, the charming young woman becomes a vampire. Not only does he become one Undead, he uses his goth, a tempting person to hold his talents as a cold bloody assassin. This is a low B class feature that should have gone straight to the video. Violence is cruel and gory, but actually quite light. The story is so weak and the dialogue is so casual that it is hard to interest. Eileen Daly is the leader of Lilith Silver. Mark Caven, Kevin Howarth and Isabel Brook are also cast.
