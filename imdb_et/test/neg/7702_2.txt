The problem with this movie, like many other unsuccessful films, is the script. <br /> <br /> The script is so purposeful that it's around the place. What's the story here? OK, it's biological, but I think everyone agrees that it is impossible for a whole life to be condensable for 100 minutes. Some options and editing are required, but this script just didn't select or change enough. It did not change the life of Hoffman under one or two identifiable essential moments or topics that the audience could identify and through them "get" a larger picture of the whole person. <br /> <br /> The movie's wandering is a straight biopsy of a "worrying genius", a half-document (using new shots that are fake to match archive material) to the True Life Sob Stories movie week ("I Grow Up") ) son who does not know that i am his father's "shtick", political conspiracy theory movie, etc. It never makes its thoughts about what it wants to be, and a half-hearted citizen Kane like the narrative structure (reporter) interviewing Hoffman's past is soon abandoned, leaving the film even more structured and more relaxed than it begins. <br /> <br /> The film is full of moments and incidents that don't let anything happen and that could have been cut to leave room for something more important. The whole scene in the psychiatrist's office after Vincent D'Onofrio nails the window shouting "I'm Abbie Hoffman! I'm Abbie Hoffman! I'm Abbie Hoffman!" ("I act! I act! I act!") It could have been easily cut. All this happens is that the psychiatrist says, "There is a bipolar disorder that is here lithium." And two women in their lives say, "We saw you more often on weekends." and bang! That's it. No more mental health problems. It is such a ridiculously meaningless tokenistic scene that it could easily have taken off before. A scene where they all get high and watch the newspaper footage from Vietnam and Hoffman phones GOD? Nonsense. Tells us something. However, when it comes to a pivotal moment like a drug bust, making movies is so rushed that the situation just goes out of the left and doesn't make sense to the audience. Suddenly, he is dealing with heroin? Where does it come from? Why? What's going on here? <br /> <br /> I think I am a middle-aged boy, well-off in the target audience of this movie, but even I got the girl "Man", "Pigs", "Fuzz" etc. is brutal, appropriate, unthinkable, hippie-angry android. Maybe it was in the 60s, I don't know, I wasn't there, but in the movie it was a clumsy clumsy polemic. <br /> <br /> Having said that Vincent D'Onofrio was convincingly charismatic than the younger Hoffman and I could look at Janeane Garofalo, even reading the bus schedule, though he was just not right for that part.
