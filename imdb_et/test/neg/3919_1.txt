The square pigs, which are an effective way to use the cargo space, are the only smart moment in "Space Truckers". Believe it or not, Dennis Hopper has made it worse, look at "The American Way", but this movie is on the "crap pound" scale. I think the best way to describe the viewing experience is that "Space Truckers" don't want anyone. Too much cartoon-like too serious consideration, almost complete lack of humor and bad character development is virtually disappointing. The crowd of beers and popcorn can tolerate one look, but everyone else is warned to avoid all of the "reasons above". - MERK
