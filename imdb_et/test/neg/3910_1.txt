K, one day my father took a movie with a "clean" cover. I have a home with my mother and we were like yay to watch this new movie we never saw before! .. Ok, so it started ... an interesting start, cool robots and a nasty ghost (eek) on a strange planet (actually it wasn't Pluto?) ... Blablabla I can talk the whole story, but not, WTF NEVER USE a movie whose name is a flat ass, and seriously never thinks I ever appreciate a book with this cover (error tape.), It seemed like an interesting movie as now sci-fi movies, its DISGUSTING. I mean, it was so bad that I started to laugh (I swear I tried to be serious). It killed more than a million brain cells, which I can't even write down criticism. THAT YOU! Argh and I wana prepare you for something "strange" * COUGH COUGH * mechanical p3n1 $ * COUGH COUGH * Unfortunately, I had to say it, so funny, think of it as a comedy or paris for sci-fi movies. This classic batman laughs, but in a new package, what the hell was that director thinking?
