Ugh. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst films I've seen for a long time. No characters are far from pleasant, so it's hard to watch this movie. They are all unhappy thirty years old who do not take responsibility for their frustrating life. I was only able to do it for half an hour from the movie, so there is a chance later, but I doubt it. I can't imagine that five people are absorbed by themselves because they can keep friends with each other for ten years. relevance to the plot and were clearly a free (unsuccessful) attempt to bring this otherwise boring film to life.
