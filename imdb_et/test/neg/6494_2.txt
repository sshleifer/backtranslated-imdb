PROTECTION. You hear the name. You think, "ah, this is an amazing Hong Kong movie." Guess - it's not Hong Kong. And yes, it's crazy. This amazingly stupid Jackie Chan movie we destroyed, yes, the Americans (I cooked anger, oh, I think I jump out of that window!), Is Chan New York police officer who is chasing the gang for his friend's death. Sounds cool ... but it's not. Don't waste your money by renting it. To prove he can do a better cart, Chan made an amazing POLICE STORY (1985).
