Rabbit Fever is a set of sketches of sketches, each of which focuses on a female personal device that became popular in a 1998 Sex and City episode (1998 Women). From the opening of statistics that make rabbit fever sound like a soft porn movie, we are being treated with predictable sketches of a sea of ​​real and imaginary characters who are women dependent on individual pleasure. Germaine Greer explains quite lofty, inventing a gadget for women that makes men in the bedroom redundant. The rabbit vibrator (which some statistics show is about a quarter of all vibrator sales) is called, because the small rabbit-shaped ears that vibrate the clitoris vibrate, while the rotating pearls inside the shaft stimulate the vaginal interior. The film interviews characters involved in anonymous rabbits to help overcome their "addiction", as well as well-known people, such as Tom Conti, who represents Professor or Richard Branson (who tend to ban rabbits on board an aircraft) by saying that they want to offer free rabbits for their first class passengers and finally all of them. <br /> <br /> The main weakness of the movie is that the idea is not enough to preserve the 85-minute cinema, the schemes have no writing to say that the Charlotte Church or Ricky Gervais make them funny and even though it can make a late-night TV, is not on this hook so people can rank in multiplexes to the public to watch masturbation jokes. Lines like: "It has been almost a week since you used your rabbit - how are you going to cope?" wear quite thin after five minutes. The idea behind the film is that just mentioning the word "rabbit" laughs. . . and the second and the second. Honest midfielder batteries are fun in real life, but here they look quite laborious and the extraordinary emergency service is beyond its welcome. violence, hardly any explicit sex and sexual references that are less "perverse" than any late night comedies. The company protested, but the BBFC did not accept. At first glance, it seems to be superfluous and their consumer advice simply says, "Often contains strong sexual opportunities." It is believed that young people find masturbation more fun than the most desperate chicken party parties, and the topic is a worthy discussion; but rabbit fever does not even have a sustainable grace for a balanced approach to this issue. <br /> <br /> The best part is probably Ruocco rabbit song (who plays a band called Thumperi). For those who are at the end and raised the credit at the end, there is a bonus at the end to convince them that they have not forgotten anything.
