Finally, there is not so much to say. One could have expected much more from the director, who made better films in the past. It just seems that he did it without actually caring. Actors do their job (although Belmondo is far from amazing), but you just can't get it. In short, it's boring. This is even more disappointing because I have heard many times that this film can be seen as a reaction to all the great American blockers who are threatened by the French exception who simply cannot admit that they should go to work for the other. I'll tell you, if this is the best reaction we should get, boy, I'm going soon ...
