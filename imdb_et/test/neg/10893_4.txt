A young couple decides to escape to sunny California. They will never reach their destination if they decide to switch from the rest of the stop. <br /> <br /> After struggling with her boyfriend, Nicole Carrow asks her to stop. When he's ready to leave, he leaves the bathroom to find his friend lost in his car, leaving him trapped in Texas's rear roads with only an abandoned caravan to keep his company. <br /> <br /> Stop is one of those cheap and sticky horror films that can become a cult class. Will Rest Stop become a cult class you can ask? Well, the three elements you need to become a cult class are gore, sex, and artistic values. The resting area has cobwebs, and although I don't want to miss too much, it contains bleeding nastery. This movie has everything that a bad boy runs over the police feet with his car several times using a girl's pneumatic drill. Sometimes it can be as bloody as the movie gets. It also has free and somehow rather intimate love in the protocols for opening the film. That's why this sex is covered. Now it's hard? does it have artistic value? You never see a bad boy's face? you can see the eyes, the profiles, the shady silhouettes. He is a face, a relentless, a monster that only highly values ​​the scale of artistic value. There are very few characters in the movie except the main protagonist? Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander). As he spends much of his film, he cannot express his thoughts during the conversation, but must tell them loudly that we, the audience, know what he thinks. Sometimes it can be a little irritating; this is a bold step for the writer (John Shiban) and it works for most movies. As the public knows, being independent and isolated from civilization is frightening, even if you were not captured by psychotic killers. <br /> <br /> So is Rest Stop becoming a cult class? It is likely that, with gore, sex and controversial artistic value, it also has a lot of chills, an interesting and inventive plot, and it gives a lot of shouts on the screen because the main character does a lot of things that you shouldn't do when you drive a psychotic killer. (What fun are horror movies if you don't get a crime because of the stupidity of the victims?)
