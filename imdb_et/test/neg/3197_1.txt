I'm watching this terrible movie when we talk. this is perhaps one of the worst films I ever had in the house. I sit here with 3 friends and they agree. its not scary. that's not funny. it is not dramatic. it does not contain anything attractive. we're in the movie for 49 minutes. we have only seen 2 critter. only one person is dead. This movie is one big drop. nothing such a terrible and terrible movie has made me want to look the rest. I'm getting a movie. I hope everyone doing something about this movie will die. I mean not just actors. I mean the director, the producers, the studio president who funded the film. it's completely, the worst movie ever. it should make IMDb the worst 100 movies of all time. 1
