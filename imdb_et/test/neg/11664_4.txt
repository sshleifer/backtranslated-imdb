Everything you do in this world should make at least a little sense. Unfortunately, there is very little sense of "Delusion". Jennifer Rubin is enough to hit Kyle Secor as a key squeezer in her role. By contrast, Secor goes beyond the resentment. Jim Metzler, a bright yuppie, is incredible as a beginner, revenge, opponent. When Jennifer Rubin returns the money he has carefully concealed, all credibility is out of the window, and weapons that show the final display between Secor and Metzler are ridiculous. Avoid "misleading" unless you are misleading to believe in misleading positive comments here. - MERK
