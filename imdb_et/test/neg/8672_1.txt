Please ... if anyone gets a chance to read it before watching a movie, if you can invite it, beware of it ... don't waste your time !!!! I also watched this movie right after the book was finished and I was seriously disappointed ... the main character is basically a new one that consists of Fanny because he shows NO similarity with the book ... he is so lively and laughs all the time ... when there was one thing what the author wanted to do was that he was very shy, introverted in nature .... please !!!!! All the most important parts of the story that were supposed to pass to the hippy end are simply ignored ... and the rest are !!! I think it is better to take the time to either read a little bit of the actual novel or just do something.
