Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll is undoubtedly the worst product in Western civilization. Monologues are both uninteresting and pointless. With a rare monologue that hits the audience, it has quickly disappeared due to too long repetition and unnecessary additions (Hell Angels McDonalds) I think Bogosian needs some stuff to give the length he thought was justified by the entrance price. <br /> <br /> I slept with my aunt and hung up and emptied my blood when I see Sex, Medicines, Rock & Roll again.
