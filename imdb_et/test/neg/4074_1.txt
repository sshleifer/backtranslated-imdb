This film was embarrassing in his clich√©, somewhat functional and generally low production values. It starts badly with long hair with a 3-star, calling the hero, masters, "great" when he obviously carries the colonel's silver oak leaves. But what was most disturbing was the soldiers' team at Neptune Atoll. How can you touch any reality? They were all the experts who flew with 747 and the scenes of the ditches were more comical. <br /> <br /> WARNING: This movie is dangerous to your health! SEE YOUR PERILI!
