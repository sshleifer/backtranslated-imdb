It turned out to be a rare case when the British were funded by polizottesco; unfortunately, the stars and the director are not the obvious result (except for the inconvenience and the approach of border camps). The first is led by Franco Nero and ultra-hammy Telly Savala as a pair of potential robbers (if anyone is able to believe an actor who usually cools?), He is more gullible than I am!). <br /> <br /> Their "work" goes awry (ending with murder and falling into cutlery, not jewels!)? At the same time, contradictory criminals see their dilemma open up when they inadvertently "kidnap" the British diplomat's son (confused Lester, who even gets hit-lucky by a hit at Savala when it hurts at one point). However, they have never redeemed him and their only purpose is to cross the border with France; tagging with them is Nero's girlfriend (wasted by Ely Gallean): though soon she will have enough and decides to escape when others sleep; crazy Savalas notices this and after the girl he kills. In the meantime, Nero and Lester have awakened? the former thinks that his accomplices could double him, so that he goes down with his son; After a short incantation in the abundant old lady's castle (with both Nero and Lester!), Savalas comes with them. They continue the track where the trio ran into the family of German campers: the situation worsens to the point where Savalas switches them into their trailer and throws the river? although he suffers badly in the process; it usually ends when "heavy" is killed just as they start to cross. <br /> <br /> So does the movie contain most of the typical elements of the genre? Sleaze, Sadism, Violence, Delay (Post-Detention Consequence, when the car of escape causes destruction in the narrow streets of the city and even disturbs the funeral, is even a pharmacy), etc .; one somewhat interesting aspect is that Lester himself seems to be definitely (irreversibly?) marked with experience? when the act of violence occurs, excitement arises.
