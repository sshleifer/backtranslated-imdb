Director Jim Wynorski (Chopping Mall, Swamp Thing Return), Cheerleader Massacre is the fourth installment of the Slumber Party Massacre series. Think about it: this is the fourth chapter of the slasher series that nobody really cares about! So how can it even be good? Well, that's not! But when is slasher movies good? Cheerleader's massacre is fun, that's for sure. But in the entertainment field we have seen better, it is definitely too! As you can see, I'm not sure where I stand against this movie. Those who watch slasher only for nudity are more than happy. This film is all boobs, but unfortunately there is no blood or not enough. I think I am generous with this movie because I had the time to watch it and I really enjoy watching the movie, even as bad as sometimes. If you want me to be sincere, Slumber Party Massacre Part 1 is the best and everyone else is a waste of time, so I think I have a lot of time to waste! For fun, see Sleepaway Camp 2 and Cheerleader Camp.
