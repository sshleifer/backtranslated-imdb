The alleged "scream queen" Debbie Rochon and her front-line prostitutes are heading to the western title and are experiencing terrible killings in the culture of former Confederate psychopaths who are trying to rise up through the massacre of the Resurrection. > <br /> The action and spacing take on a boring dialogue and an uninteresting character for the rear seats. <br /> <br /> Billy Drago is a good city mistress of ungrateful (not to mention meaningless) role, but everything else about this wannabe west coast is extremely poor, including a city and a fortress that both look like modern western tourist traps and costumes that look look like they were bought at Party City. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a big favorite and watch Ravenous instead.
