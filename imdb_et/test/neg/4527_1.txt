This movie is in the same league as Ishtar. Lots of wasted talent. Who will let this bomb escape? When Sigfried says we have to give an example of a nuclear bomb, I told you to give it to the theater! Don't waste your time. Not even worth the free rental! And where did they get these competitions to complete the IMDb comments section? I can't believe anyone who has ever seen the original series enjoyed this stink. Steve Carell is not a physical comedian. If they removed the "comedy" and made it into a straightforward action film, it could go through. What was the purpose of the hell dance picture? Fat jokes and references were tasteless. This film never left an opportunity to go to the lowest common denominator and just finished scenes, it seemed like no one thought of them. Just terrible! Save your time, if not money, and give this movie a passport!
