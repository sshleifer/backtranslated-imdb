A group of young adults opens up the spirit of Elizabeth Bathory when they say their poem about a video game that allegedly represents s√©ance. The only one who dies in the game is Miller (Adam Goldberg), who has also died as he died in the video game. Although the characters of the others did not die in the video game, their poem from their poem has released a video game into reality, as they walk through the CGI characters, each one of them coming and killing. They have to follow certain methods using a mirror and spikes to defeat Batory and save their skin. <br /> <br /> If this assumption is stupid, it is because it is. Characters are ho-hum pushing bad WB TV shows, this time being allowed to crack. This flick follows Slasher's rules, but doesn't show much violence or gore. It remains safe for PG-13, with most deaths on the screen. There is a scene where a true hero and heroine are flying from the video game characters who follow them. Yes, it's so bad. Nothing to recommend. Stylish display including Sophia Bush as suitably named October.
