Closet Land is an unpleasant job with great actors. There is nothing else (or less) in the film besides the endless abuse of an attractive woman by a sadistic police officer. The setting is minimalistic. It can be considered soft S&M porn, because there is no reference point in drama, such as time, place and political context. Because what happens is cut fantasy in a futuristic environment, abuse becomes purely personal. Pornographic aspects are justified by the warning of the totalitarian government's evil, but because there is no real context for torture by this young woman, we are losing sight, but have not learned anything. <br /> <br /> What is it? Is there torture in the world? This abusive prisoner is bad? Is dictatorship abusing innocent people? We already know that. Closet Land has echoes of works such as the Darkness at Noon and the Ionesco rhino, but both works were made by competent artists whose work had a historical context and depth of meaning. This work is amateurish and sophisticated in dialogue. A firm thumb down.
