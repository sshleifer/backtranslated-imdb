As a warning to others, I believe that the "skeleton man" is actually worse than "Raptor Island". I've used RI's examples of the worst original movie on the Sci-Fi channel, but the most ridiculously inconsistent and wretched film I have ever seen is the most ridiculous. Yes, I was looking at almost the whole thing for about 35 minutes. It pulled me with pure unreliability. What was Sci-Fi Thinking? When Skeleton Man and the surviving group leader (or whatever he was - I am not good at the military unit terminology) arrived at the chemical plant, the film moved to a zone of impossible and house, which was almost enchanting. I had the same idea as another viewer who was wondering if more than one movie would have been edited together to make one terrible whole.
