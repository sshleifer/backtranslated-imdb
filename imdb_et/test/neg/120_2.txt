It really hurts to say, but this movie was terrible at every level. It's not just Van Damme's fault, because you see that he was trying his best, but let's be honest he's almost fifty, how much do you ask him? I find it so hard to believe that the same people who put together Undisputed 2; this is probably the best (western) martial arts film that has been created over the years. Everything from the plot, dialogue, editing to the general example was just terribly put together and in many cases completely boring and pointless. Scott Adkins, who fights with scenes, seemed more like a demo reel, was also terribly underdog and not even the main villain, which is such a shame, because 1) He is more than capable of playing this role and 2) The real main villain was not only scary but also quite annoying. Again, Van Damme does not blame. I'm always a fan but avoid it.
