The couple is divorced during the holidays. Early scenes believe that the character of Barney, Jeff Bridges, has robbed the girl of inexplicable but deliberate robbery. The film is played a few years later, where Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland) has decided to solve his disappearance despite the interest of new love. <br /> <br /> The story is definitely interesting, but very bad decisions have been made. making a movie that culminates in pretty bad work. <br /> <br /> OK here we go. At the site of robbery - in addition to two major inconsistencies, there is a place where Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland make a small signed pet-love ritual that has sunk to over-sentimentality to nausea. We know they are in love; "I celebrate that I never leave you" speech only moments before was enough thanks. Another example is the Jeff Bridgese robot accent. What is this? Starman is back and seems to be on the planet after a decade, he has become disgusting. The whole plot can then be solved by the introduction of an unnecessary character, who has quite a remarkable observance at the wrath of a quite successful destiny. The climatic sequence itself is essentially done before only much, much better. It is confused with further disruptions and another dazzling consistency. I could go on, but something positive should be said. Kiefer Sutherland is the only one who saves the face with relatively decent performance. <br /> <br /> The 1988 original with the same name (modified in Dutch-speaking "Spoonloo" for English-speaking audiences) was recommended to me, only the online rental company sent me this version of Hollywood wrongly. I was surprised to find that both are director George Sluizer, and I would be interested in his motivation. I am reliably and fortunately informed that it is of much higher quality in all areas, including the plot. Horah for that, but it really doesn't do much.
