The beginning of the film was confusing and the rest was predictable. It was just one of those movies I found in my netflix queue and I thought it would be interesting to see Brad Renfro and Bijou Phillips compete again after Bully. Unfortunately, this movie has never been "interesting". Swain plays an invisible girl in a private school whose best friend is rich and does something she wants at any time (Phillips). But Swain likes one of the boys (Renfro) among the "crowd" and will eventually hang with them. And, of course, like all other movies, things are good (or you expect the film never to see that things are good) and then things are not as good as rich kids hanging out. <br /> <br /> The film's problem is that there are no peaks and valleys. It's just a dead-to-life movie that, after you've watched it, you might have done something better. Some scenes (those with Renfro's parents) aren't even worth participating in the movie because the director and the writer didn't watch it at all. <br /> <br /> All the interesting things that could have been played were just completely ignored, and it's almost like watching the episode of stars (Mischa Barton and Rachel Bison from OC). <br /> <br /> The only bright light in this movie and the reason why he doesn't give me one rating is Phillips. They needed more scenes with him. Renfro looks like he brought Bully a little bit of his character. And for the sake of fake, the title is BS, change the name.
