Watching this movie and listening to the comments is clear that Michael Radford does not understand this game. The first idea that he can't fully understand the work is that he makes a movie in the seventeenth century Venice. What sounds really strange is that the misunderstanding of a movie would mean trying to get it as close as possible to your location. But anyone who studied Shakespeare knows that although he put most of his games into exotic locals, culture and values ​​are always in England. It does not harm the film, but it shows the lack of necessary knowledge. <br /> <br /> When Radford kills a movie, it is so seriously dead. He succeeds in taking out every joke script, leaving the entire production process flat. Each dream passion is beaten with characters. Even Shylock's "Don't We Bleed" speech is a mild, uncomfortable robbery from a cholesterol who seems to say and do what he does because he should be. Lovers are solemn and too restrained (Joseph Fiennes supplies some of the most romantic features of the cinema this year with a spiritual whisper), Gratiano (who has to allow one at a time) is calmer and collected than Bassiano (who makes him promise to behave), Jessica does not want to leave his father and spend his life with Lorenzo pouting. <br /> <br /> In the commentary on the right and delicate judgment, the director expresses his shock that the audience laughed at the "Meat body, no more, no less" sentence; in the end, concluding that he had to strain laughter. "The Venetian merchant" is a comedy and Radford scoffs with the idea that the most absurd and hysterical part of the story is nothing more than a provocative drama. <br /> <br /> The film does not yet have a clear focus. cuts out some of the most fun scenes. The characters are forced into high drama farms so they come out like Ibsen's characters who read Victorian poetry. And the comedic end where all the good guys are sleeping is drowning in dignified despair, which seems to find the upcoming death of the stubborn-upper lip instead of reconciling with lovers. Even Lancelot and Antonio are leaving the film with their hats, like aristocratic mourners. It is stern where it should be hysterical. It is reserved where it should be passionate. This is Michael Radford, where it should be William Shakespeare.
