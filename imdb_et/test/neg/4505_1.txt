The evil is in a big house, where the bad spirit is stupidly tortured all inside. What a movie crowding out! There is no scary scene. Not one! Richard Crenna crosses something. There are some animated ghosts, power discomfort and ghost attack. If nothing happens to almost the whole movie, Evil personally ... Victor Buono. Great! Where did the filmmakers get the idea that Buono was scary. He looks like he was for the guests who play payroll to pay their beverage bill. By this time it's too late to turn it off because the fucking thing is over. I felt like I threw the cartridge out of the window. Please avoid this spam! Hopefully it will never see the light of the DVD and become dark.
