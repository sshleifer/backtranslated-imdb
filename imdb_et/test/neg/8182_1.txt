This movie is strange even for a silent movie. Basically, it follows the adventures of a revolutionary Russian engineer who dreams of going to Mars. In this film, the producers seem to know that the Communists have indeed turned the country, but it also seems to want it to look like they have done something good. <br /> <br /> Then we reach "Mars" scenes, where all Mars wear silver hats. They have a revolution after the inspiration of the Earth men, but the queen who is with them has quickly betrayed her. Except it is all a dream, or it is. (And since the Russian Revolution will eventually lead to Stalin's dictatorship, it gives you some doubts about whether this is all allegory.) Now I have seen a good Russian cinema. For example, Eisenstein's battleship Potemkin is a good film. It's just, silly.
