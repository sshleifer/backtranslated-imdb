I guess I probably wouldn't hate this movie when I spoke Polish. I chose the English version in the first menu, but it gave me a Polish dialogue with English subtitles, as did the Polish version. Perhaps the dialogue was not so separate because the subtitled person could not translate it into English very well. There were no subtitles at all in some dialogues to deepen the problem. Action was pretty bad, especially for a female leader who was all about melodramatic! One scene that bothered me was when a German woman had been trying to steal and she was around the cell, her shirt opened, and the director showed close-ups of her bare breasts in the next 15-20 seconds. I didn't see her drama of an event or movie with her breast. Maybe the director tried to increase the number of teenage boys in the audience. A large part of the film takes place in the liberated American camp. First, the "American" uniforms did not see any uniforms in the US Army. Secondly, the Americans did not release any of Poland's destruction camps. I think the Polish film director, who turned 19 in 1945, knew better than an American born in 1966 that the Russians had released all six destruction camps. All in all, it's not just a good movie if you don't speak Polish.
