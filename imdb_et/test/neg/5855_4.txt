This film coincides with the mini-series "Red Rocket Seven" by Mike Allred and tells that an alien who fled to Earth is waiting for "Astroesque", which is associated with the book of revelation and apocylpse. This is only part of a larger story (if the film mixes you, read "RR7"). You can easily say that Allred is used to telling stories with pictures. The direction is very good and the impact is not bad for a $ 500 budget. Unfortunately, Mike used many friends to play the roles and apparently could not say that they could not act. Nor does Mike show his writing skills in this film. His dialouge spoon feeds the plot on you and won't let you enjoy the characters. It was, in fact, a disappointment given his enormous ability to write in his comic books. 4 out of 10.
