When I saw it in the cinema, I remember that bad behavior is about a minute or two minutes into the first scene, then I'm talking "no, it has to heal". It wasn't. The performances are quite evenly teak 'n pine and no, in this movie there is no sexual chemistry, just a reasonable, discreetly talented actor who seems to have been born "Interviú" coat and not much more than inconvenient posturings. . If the scriptwriter thought the creation of Mérimée was an amazingly original creative idea, he would have had to come out more. And if Aranda had given the thought a bit more thoughtful, he would have realized that Carmen's story was simply a BAD for thoughtful, iconic, parody-deconstruction, not for the ersatz passion and comic book dialogue on leaving his own brain-at-the-turn. This is the worst thing in today's Spanish cinema. <br /> <br />
