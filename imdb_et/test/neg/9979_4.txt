"Caligula" shares many of the same attributes as the 1970 "Fellini Satyricon", which has strange sights, unpleasantness, and all that is superfluous to sexual imagery placed in the "glory" of ancient Rome. But it's not Fellin ... First, it's not that fun. Too much screen time is dedicated to bug-eyed, rubber-coated McDowell. His presentation is too fey and campy to be convincing. Jay Robinson's images of "The Robe" (1953) and David Cain-Haughton's "Emperor Caligula" (1983) are much more convincing and credible, the latter being the most nuanced. The help could have been reasonably offered by improving the surrounding stars. As it is, they are little more than cyphers. One example is the role of Macro, played by Guido Mannari, who has an enormous screen presence, but is mostly in the background. The only positive feature of the credit is the adriatic use of some Prokofiev and Stravinski themes in the music score and the addition of some unpleasant but still precise actions. However, these two factors are much smaller than what is needed to alleviate the ruling tedium.
