This is a movie that is shown on BEGS TV 3 or 4 in the morning, if at all. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the filmmakers responsible for the 50 foot female attack made a statement on the dangers of women and philanthropy and the demon rumor, all of which were in the sci-fi allegory. <br /> <br /> Or maybe it was a tax exemption. <br /> <br /> In both cases, Attack proves best to the viewer in the following circumstances: a) extreme state of intoxication, b) seen in any double bill with any Jacqueline Suzanne movie (perhaps "not enough")? or c) only at night when you feel insecure and the surrounding world is a little too perfect. Pop under "attack" and feel great, guaranteed! And I think the last line should be engraved on a memorial somewhere in Washington, D. - it's just memorable. <br /> <br /> Four Stars '50 Foot Wife Attack'; buy a copy, send it to Gloria Steinem - she loves you for that.
