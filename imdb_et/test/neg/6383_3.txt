I know Terry Gilliam is a good director, but says this movie is good, it's just stupid. What was the movie? What is it? Fantasy? Comedy? Satire? Gilliam did not respond there. Totally confused and pointless hurting from one historical age to another. I find it fun that some people magically call this movie. Is it because they have to praise every movie that is vague and indecisive about what it is? 3 stars for special effects in 1981. Roger Ebert has this right in his review. The film is ambiguous and looks like Gilliam's peace to make the vague movement of children disguised in history. The film also tries to confuse the viewer by giving John Cleese and Sean Connery the best deal.
