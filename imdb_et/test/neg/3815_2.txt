A terrible film that is almost amateur at all levels - a boring and derived scenario full of stereotypical characters played by embarrassing actors on a director who lacks the most rudimentary understanding of his craft. The whole thing smells. It plays like a sliding film dating back to the early eighties, up to the fucking scores and the SFX of the ketchup, but without the nostalgia of childhood that is needed to watch such a dross. One of the worst horror movies I've ever seen - definitely the worst that got the mainstream theater release. I've never gone out of my life from my life - if I was unhappy to see Hatchet in the theater, it would have been the first. Avoid at all costs.
