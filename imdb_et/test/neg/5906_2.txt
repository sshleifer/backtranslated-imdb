It was praised by the fast paced comedy and the best German movie of the year, so I gave it a try, although I've already seen some of Dani Levy's movies - or at least some of them. <br /> <br /> I got what I expected: no comedy at all if you think the heart attack is funny. This is a good example of a sloppy screen writing with incredible plot and characters full of clichés that may be true, but certainly not funny either. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing is that Zucker's wife played. Hannelore Elsner. He must behave incredibly strange to move the plot. For example: He does not know anything about jealousy, but for the most likely unknown reasons he gets the idea of ​​playing a cup that he and his family are Jewish laws that are true to the Jewish family of his spouse, who really is, and a very orthodox and self-righteous variety . To make it more complicated, he invites four of them to stay in their city apartment because they arrive from Frankfurt to Berlin without booking their hotel in advance, something that is not a 60-year-old businessman, in fact not an adult German would ever have done. It gives the viewer a lot to swallow, but still can't joke. <br /> <br /> Zucker and his brother Samuel have not seen each other for 40 years, but it turns out that his daughter lesbian - and Samuel's son - now a military orthodox - was once a lover and is his daughter's father. Samuel's daughter - nympho - goes to Zucker's gay son. Should it be somehow a humorous parody of immaterial Jewish trends? It's probably just a useless way to add some "turbulences of love action" to each of the screw comedies. And of course, jokes can't be produced. <br /> <br /> The praise of this film is purely political. Therefore, only those people who enjoy movies that should be "politically important" will enjoy it, though "Only auf Zucker!" obviously is of no importance. <br /> <br /> For all other people, don't look at it without the "fast forward" option. I really missed it.
