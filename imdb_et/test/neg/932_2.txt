It's like someone took a fantasy video game and put it in a blender and the resulting scene is what we have to sit down on. <br /> <br /> Now let me record how much I love Chinese fantasy movies. For the fun and foolish, more dramatic and romantic types of martial arts, this genre I really enjoy. Movies like "Chinese Odyssey: Pandora Box" and "Chinese Odyssey: Cinderella" (both written and / or directed by Jeffrey Lau); "Bride with White Hair"; "Butterfly & Sword"; "Green Snake"; "Chinese Ghost Story"; "Swordman II"; "Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain"; "Tiger, hidden dragon" and others. That's why I was waiting for the "Chinese story". One of the characters in the film is the "Monkey King" (aka Sun Wukong), a very well-known character in Chinese mythology that was first spoken about an ethical adventure west of 500 years ago. (The story of Monkey King and his disciples is also at the heart of "Chinese Odyssey" films, among others). Other familiar characters that appear in the film are Zhu Wuneng (Swine Mark) and Sha Wujing. <br /> <br /> So how does it all go wrong? Well, let's take the example of a Western audience, for example. How about Robin Hood's mythology? Well-known story of the old days. Suppose our Robin Hood movie played Wesley Snipes like Robin Hood and Haley Joel Osment Friar Tuckin. Maid Marian is nothing but Rosie Perez. Also give Uz Rob to Sir Robin, because you never know when you need to waste Nottingham sheriff. They may also need rocket packages, and while we're on it, we're giving them a tactical nuclear weapon because it can be convenient. If you think it sounds like Robin Hood's story is really clean, then "China's high story" is a movie for you! As I mentioned above, this film is confusing. In the first 30 minutes, not only Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng and Sha Wujing will be introduced, but also Monk Tripitaka (who is actually the main protagonist), kidnapped children, "The Millennium Bug Demon" (which will let the laser beams), Underground tree God, Lizard imp tribe, an English girl in an intergalactic egg, a Lord Chancellor's turtle, a sea dragon king, an ever-morpic magical golden staff, a spiritual box imp girl, wormholes in outer space, and Four heavenly knights. All this would not be too bad - the stories and myths passed over the years are certainly all kinds of fantastic elements. But I guarantee you that Chinese mythology does not contain many things that we are subject to in the last half of the film. (Useful tips for filmmakers: just because your computer affects men to come in search of a spaceship and represents an intergalactic war does not mean they should have). <br /> <br /> You know that your Chinese mythology film is the wrong way to go when the director asks (and I don't make it directly from the comment to a direct quote). "I asked the composer if we had some kind of rock and role-type music or not. Android-like thing." Is there a story where something is hidden? Yes, yes. Yes there is. Most of the adventure is followed by Tripitaka (played by Nicholas Tse? "Gen-X Cops", "Time and Tide", "My Schoolmate the Barbarian") and Meiyan, the lizard girl (played by Charlene Choi and the computer). Choi is the best thing in this movie. You can feel him half the Canto-pop group "Twins" and other movies like "The Twins Effect" and "Just One Look" (surprisingly good drama / romance / comedy). Bad Choi, a lizard and all, is hardly recognizable with his warts, toothed teeth, nose and back. It is as long as the computers get hold of it and decorate it, which somehow makes it worse. Tse is satisfactory, but all supporting actors were sad. Some slightly recognizable faces are wasted in bits. <br /> <br /> At one point I was discussing with myself whether the "long Chinese story" was a scam. I was almost able to convince myself that when the intergalactic egg girl (played by a very beautiful Fan Bing-Bing) came out and burned Marlboro (!), When she spoke about sports and spider- Men's Costume (!!). But it's not a scam. Of course, typical Hong Kong stupidity, but the film takes itself seriously enough, with enough romance and stamens (striking violins and reminiscent cellos) and amazing action and adventure. <br /> <br /> You might think you can rent this Netflix and it doesn't cost you anything. (Oh, but it costs you, all right). <br /> <br /> Is there anything good to say? Of course. The colors are bright (they are the best for this movie). And the filmmakers certainly tried very hard. Too bad that this effort went to a movie that is nothing more than a bad video game.
