A film about French girls wasted by street hoodlums. In an independent rape scene, all males and females and their communication with the camera are clearly visible. When the fear is matched, the victim grabs his friend (or was he a brother?) A weapon, fires it down and runs down with a gun. He meets a prostitute who has just seen his pimp down, competed and turned to Paris. Next, there are a number of crazy, pointless and wild killings, girls seem to be more murder than ever before. One poor man gets **** out of the hole. Between many killings, good sexual doses are thrown. <br /> <br /> The film is not the most violent I've ever seen, I would say that private investment by Ryan would probably be more violent. If violence is what you are looking for, there are many other movies. And if that's sex, I'd recommend some of these XXX. <br /> <br /> I went to watch the movie because all the media gave it. The film itself is not a big deal, but a lot of violence and sex that is photographed as a hand-held camera. I was surprised that this film had a 15-year-old age limit in Sweden, when 15-year-olds can watch this movie, they should also be able to watch XXX movies.
