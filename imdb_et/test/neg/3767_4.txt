Rocketship X-M should be viewed by any serious movie buffer for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) This is one of the first and few films that have no happy ending. Undoubtedly, the impact in post-World War II America was deeper than it is today, but the sad ending adds to the film's message. <br /> <br /> 2) It is also one of the first movies to deal with space seriously, using space as a setting for drama. Despite the scientific background, the film itself is dramatic. It is not so much a space drama as it is a drama set in space. <br /> <br /> 3) The Nuclear War message is being sent seriously, which does not disappear in the sfx, which includes large grasshoppers, men or animals. The influence of the Martian society on nuclear weapons is very and honestly presented. The fact that the exponents of the expedition fail to proclaim the lesson learned on Mars adds another sad element to the end of the tragedy.
