Definition of a documentary: A work, such as a film or television program, which presents a political, social or historical theme in a factual and informative way and often consists of actual news films or interviews accompanied by narration. The keyword here is informative. I love that they can be giants and hardly learn them. <br /> <br /> Interviews with all celebrities were pretty much worthless. I don't care what Sarah Vowel thinks anyone and Syd Straw was irritating. And listen to people that they say TMBG lyrics as they were supposed to be funny / interesting? Was not. I think this was a problem: the film spends time discussing TMBG love coffee. So what?? Millions of people love coffee. Was the presentation of the material funny? No! There were clues that both men were married but never discussed. And what is the solo material they did? What motivated them to do that? These questions are neither addressed nor answered. <br /> <br /> I can continue and go on with the negatives. I found the Dial-a-Song segment very interesting. If you want to know that they may be giants, just buy a few CDs and listen. Seriously. This movie is a giant disappointment. I can't believe many people gave him 10. Unbelievable.
