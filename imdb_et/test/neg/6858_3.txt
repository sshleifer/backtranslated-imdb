Maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because I went out before the end. It's strange because I usually like Shakespeare on the screen and I enjoyed Midsummer's night dream once, several years ago when I saw it on stage. <br /> <br /> I think the two things were done to me: the lazy turn to Shakespeare's name, Calista Flockhart and Michelle Feiffer who sit in a giant crust. I think you could say it should be a comedy - but if the scenery is funny and the actors aren't, I would say we have a bad movie in our hands.
