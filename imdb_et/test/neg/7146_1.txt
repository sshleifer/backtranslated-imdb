This movie just scared me because it was only made because the shepherd was gay. The men who killed him are clearly evil. It was a terrible and tragedy with a poor person. But where was Hollywood, when four religious white children were executed, after they were forced to make a lot of sex with their relatives and one another, two evil black men Wichitas were only two years ago? Celebrities only for the camera if it serves a political purpose. Laramie, in poor light, also depicts this pseudo-documentary film, which, of course, is not surprising, because they are inverted cages that must be known to all sorts of illuminated and illuminated California. However, Laura Linney is always visible.
