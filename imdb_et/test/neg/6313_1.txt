This film is easily ridiculous, if not further, to actually offend. I mean, in which alternative universe did filmmakers and studios think this movie was playing? From the beginning to the end, Quaids were bombarded with excessive and ridiculous facial expressions, placing the "im loose cannon" a little thick. The second point in the film's selection was the lack of a realistic story of events that would make you grow to create a character. I mean in one scene where Lewis plays at the bar before making it big, it's up, just a completely absurd bar struggle that every city citizen probably belongs to. Then Lewis begins to play his shift "Shivering the Whole" and everyone will forget their differences right away and start dancing wildly if it were the most common thing in the world. Such scenes, which are many, with the lack of depth in any character, led me to real laughter. So all this movie is not worth watching for anyone who is not interested in the decision of the filmmaker and his actors for one and a half hours.
