This is the only word I mean to describe this movie. Don't waste your time (any time spent with these letters will never be wasted), but waste wastes opportunities. <br /> <br /> When I see this movie, I think all Star Trek's novels have made a much better movie than the story of Shatner. The setting was like a normal TV show, while the finish seemed to be the peak of the first movie (if you call it). <br /> <br /> Nimoy, who led II-IV, focused on Spock - how he faced Kobayashi Maru outside of the classroom and how he was now in his emotional life when he was able to start fresh. Shatner could have done the same with Kirk, but he didn't. We don't know much about Kirk that we didn't know before. Again, one of the novels would have been better - try "My enemy, my ally" to explore the very interesting character of our friend James T. Small characters are mostly used for cute bits, and the Scotty-Uhura sub-block seems to be outward from the left, especially since the original text subtitle was Sulu-Uhura. <br /> <br /> Even heavy fans can't enjoy much here. I'm sorry, but that's true.
