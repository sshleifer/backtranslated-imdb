Somehow I thought I'd enjoy this movie because I love pictures of mountain climbing and a great secret in the plot. I have to say that photography was fantastic and my attention was given to some scary scenes. I thought Nicole Eggert (Diana Pennington), "Thank you, good night", "01" played a very convincing role as a young girl with tragic loss in her life and meeting some of the stars who want to lead her up the hill. Marc Singer, "Angel Blade", "02" played a very convincing strange guy, and there were many scenes with a bad mood that seemed comical. This movie was a big disappointment and is not worth watching if there is nothing on the TV ENJOY !!
