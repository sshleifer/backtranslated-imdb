I watched the MST3K version of the movie and this review includes smaller spoilers. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, it seemed to be a promise as a sci-fi flick of cheese, but the more I looked at it, the more disappointing it was. The first reason is quite idiosynthetic - I liked the mousy shy girl with glasses much more than the model at the end of the Wanda movie. It was deeper that the loss of glass and the change in clothing replaced real growth. Instead of growing a character that could take care of itself, Wanda was just as addicted to men as to do everything for her when she was at the beginning of the movie. Action might have been better (although I was tired of splits with the Irish voice - they were even in the movie itself! It's not so bad.) The background was okay, but it was a little hokey (foreigners = people with facepaint), and could have used more explanations. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was just that I was interested in the film myself, but Joel and the robots did little for me. The film could have been better without them at all. <br /> <br /> Generally (movie for yourself, not MST3K), 3 out of 10. It was okay when it was.
