Straight video and good reason. It's like neighborhood kids playing in the backyard, but worse. The young man (Don Digiulio) comes from a West Virginia farm that has been a generation. He decides to take some friends to check the property. This arable land used good maize cultivation even during major depression. The secret is that the owner killed people and watered the fields with blood. Then hang your bodies as peacocks. The special effects are pretty flat and the terrible dialogue is full of unpleasant single liners and the catcher is so ridiculous that the sound can be better off. Cheap gore and horror. Cast with Digiulio: Jeanie Cheek, B.W. York, Booty Chewning and Jessica Dunphy.
