Apparently it was the winner of the prize. Apparently someone had a weapon against his head and was forced to wear corn: a movie. <br /> <br /> Or it must be an error. <br /> <br /> This is the most incredible film ever made. Screening and editing is the biggest horror of this movie. Two little girls disappear from the corn field and get somebody who can hear a laugh under his rubber mask. Little girls run to their hero's father and then run away, W.T.F. The film's hero father loses their tracking within minutes after watching it. <br /> <br /> Girls apparently were not trained participants and had no common sense. They were so annoying in the movie and so infantile that not even a comedian. I heard them again and again as a broken record was the reason I got up and left. This movie can't even be listened to when it comes to seizures. <br /> <br /> I will be awarded this prize for a better prize.
