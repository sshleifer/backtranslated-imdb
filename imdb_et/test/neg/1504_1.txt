Object lesson on how to make a bad film that masks horror. Without going too far, I would imagine that there are a lot of students who will add a bit to the story and then deal with it! This is some kind of film school and its film that needs the editor badly - in that case it would have lasted 10 minutes! The director of this garbage probably had more money than the mind. Consider the number of submitted scripts or even unpublished movies that would benefit from it. The so-called grandmother, who killed people in some pretty stupid, looked like Christopher Lloyd, who is back in the future, or maybe musicians Johnny Winter / Edgar Winter. It starts with the pointlessness of the 20-minute crass boredom that students are talking about - paranoia. Giving this garbage 1 is because it doesn't get less. It has no redemption function - and if one girl thinks that there is a body on the blood-covered floor that tells her to actually red things out before she knows it's not a tomato ketchup! Insulting it to the idiot's intelligence
