Watching this movie reminds you of a number of words: "sophomoric", "ridiculous", "unlikely", "self-conscious", and finally (and deadly) "boring". A poorly managed, poorly captured, and poorly acting film is a confusing confusion in all directions of line lines (if they can be named). Someone can use a five-year finger painting as a template. By punishing a child's childish crime, this cast of "stars" should be given and sent to their respective beds without dinner. . All in all, George seems to be sorry to get paid for his summer vacation with his little friends and we pay for it. Bad George! Bad!
