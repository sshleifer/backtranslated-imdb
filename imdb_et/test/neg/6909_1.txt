My boyfriend and we decided to watch this movie after listening to the radio that it was a good movie to see, even where there are "Cars". In the first ten minutes of the movie, I was scared. For starters, cows, which should be women, were male voices. Then I realized that they should be men. I put the transverse cows a little aside and tried to look at the film openly, but it was just so funny that I couldn't but shook my head. I probably checked my phone about ten times to see if it was almost over. The plot was decent, if not predictable, but it took a long time to reach that point. I had difficulty sitting through it and I am 19. Children in the theater really get up and pass the aisle. I felt like joining them. But my biggest problem with the film was that it was full of drinking tips, not to mention that the cows / bulls are really hot and led the car, then drank and drove, broke the boy's house to pull him out of bed (he deserves it), then ran away from the policemen who made the film writers look like terrible people. This is not something I would like my boyfriend to come into contact with. There is too much of this in the real world if I want my child to look at the boys to drink and drive, and lead the police to chase, then I have to watch them at 10 am. Children's movies should be an escape from reality, not a escape to ridicule. What happened to the good morals and happy endings that children's movies boast about? That's why Disney's old movies like beauty and beast, lady and tram, little mermaid, etc. are classic. If you want your kids to see a big cup with basically the same plot as "Barnyard", rent a "Lion King". You'll get a great story without terrible drinking and driving and big burglaries. The "Barnyard" writers obviously tried to continue the great trend of making a children's film that the parent could enjoy, but they did it with a very bad taste. I would never take my children to see it, and I suggest you save your money and look at something else.
