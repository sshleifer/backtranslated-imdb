Man stops post-production for great movies. The original was a wonderful film that was in combat, sex, and one of the coolest symbols that embellished the screen in the 1990s. The story is plausible, as if you were in your southern bars, which you would know. But here comes this piece of Junk Roadhouse 2 Last Call. Lets just hope they're serious about the title and never make another Roadhouse ever. It is not really believable the charm or story of the original characters. The story is more about Steven Segal's type of action, which, although Roadhouse 2 is a B-film, is still not clicked, as some of the B-movie operations are still selling the movie, no matter if it is black. The only reason not to buy this movie is that we finally know that one question remains from the original Roadhouse. The character of Patrick Swayze Dalton is his first or last name? Well I'll save you a $ 4.00 rent. Dalton is his first name as Dalton Tanner. NOT MORE ROADHOUSE !!!!!!!!!!!
