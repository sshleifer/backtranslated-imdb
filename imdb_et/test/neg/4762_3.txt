If you have insomnia, then Radiant would be the best way to send you a 7-year coma. The film is so potty and boring that it is hard to imagine that director Steve Mahone could forget this obvious mood. <br /> <br /> The story is an expelled doctor (who we never see) move to the wilderness to create a vaccine that cures all diseases by filling antibodies that are full of antibodies that can fight any infection (yes, just like Futurama) episode). Vaccines do not work and human guinea pigs are infected with a virus that kills within 48 hours. <br /> <br /> Don't want the government guys to disguise that the group is going to cover the desert, hoping the sun will kill the virus. This is what Michael says, the only quartet immune to infection. And this is the most boring story. They could have given someone an interesting voice, but instead we get someone with less vocal personality than Clive Owen. <br /> <br /> The editor insists that fade-cutting is more than half of the movie, giving it a strange dreamlike feeling and the audience's desire to sleep. Not surprisingly, half of this audience went out of it, I wasn't one of them for some reason. But I should be bloody well. <br /> <br /> The end should be shocking and smart and predictive. But it's easy and just not. Yeah, yes, but not a little dramatic. <br /> <br /> The perfect cheapness and sound of this production, which makes a lot of dialogue incomprehensible to the bad that could have been an interesting sci-fi story if it had been better participants, cooler places and urgency. As it is, Radiant is snoozefest.
