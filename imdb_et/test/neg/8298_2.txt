This film clearly has an agenda that could be summarized as follows: Never, never cross (physical or metaphorical). Let's shun everything that is on the other side of a wall or fence or something else, pretending that all "gringos" are evil, satanic or drug dealers. Everything that is beyond the borders of your country (and especially the US borders) is dangerous, malicious, and people hate you, or envy you or try to steal you or anything else. Based on "real events", there is only a perverted label that can be affirmed to give it any aura of credibility, or in this case just to help the ideology of the film to push out some naive throat. The perversion of the film is that it reduces countries, people and all other very black-and-white stereotypical categories: Mexicans to foolish people, Mexican police to corrupt police, Republicans to right-wing morphs, democrats to almost hip-hop humanists, and so on. Is there anything good in the movie? I hardly think so, but you can think differently.
