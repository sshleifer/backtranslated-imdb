The movie opens with a scene that you just can't. One man wakes up and when his wife stays in bed, he starts to pray in his bedroom in the morning as his wife sleeps calmly. Morning blessings are spoken, but only those that Gitai finds are contradictory. the rest are comfortably left out. then he kisses his wife good morning in filaments and stables. This is not an exact depiction of the Jewish prayer in any home, not to mention the home of companions. Amos Gittai is not interested in accurately portraying Chassid's life. He is interested in adding his growing list of melodramatic and empty films. The scenes of Mika (ritual bath) are far from accurate and his Jewish weddings were ridiculous because it did not even approach the chassid wedding atmosphere. I have many chassid lifestyle problems, but I have no use in Amos Gittai's comments on these issues. He would have thought that chassidim is all close comformists with severe depression. I may not agree with the chassid lifestyle, but I admit that there are many layers of chassid life. Amos Gitai is blinded by dark-intellectual self-darkness and is therefore unable to imagine the exact life of chassid. In addition to his poor research and unbalanced image of life, Gitai is not capable of any other aspects. The plot is full of holes, silent dialogue is sound, the soundtrack is too repetitive, and exemplary, though sometimes powerful, was too often melodrama. The movie drags and ends and the end is not worth it. see if you need to, but warn. If you want to learn about chassid life, go to communities and talk to chassidim. Don't rely on Gittai movie!
