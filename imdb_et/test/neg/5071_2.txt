I love to write a little summary of the plot, but ... just not one! If you just look at the keywords in this title, you know quite a bit about the content of the movie: sex, breasts, exploitation, female nudity and women's prison! 80 minutes of pure salmon and nothing else. "Escaping the Islands" Women (an alternative title not even listed here) clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial classical female-prisoner class, but it lacks any brutality. WIP valves are designed to mix graphical sexual images with shocking violence, but violence here is simply replaced by more sex. Director Erwin Dietrich would definitely not be able to compete with professionals like Jess Franco or Joe D'Amato, and he would have had to adhere to the usual soft core flaps. The only aspects that look a bit like the cult cinema are the tyranny-president's similarity to the raping of Fidel Castro and the militant (minors) girls. The girls are looting and Ibiza's filming seems very enchanting.
