I'm a fan of good historical fiction, and I was happy to think that someone is taking a series of well-written books and filming. Writing scripts is not like writing regular fiction, but if you have a book that you customize, it would be nice to follow the graph line. <br /> <br /> The Vesasians (the actual Emperor and his 2 sons, Titus and Domitian) were terrible. They acted like a cookie cutter, Caligula, and were "bad guys" for this adaptation. Titus was just like he was Caligula (a movie of the same name). The way in which Vespasiani is depicted in his books mostly follows the writings of historians who wrote in this period - they were just and the wickedness of the Imperial Claudia was not violated. <br /> <br /> Helena (the interest of Marcus Didius Falco's love) gives Pertinax a separation (one of the traitors mentioned in the title) that she was a traitor, but in books that were because she ignored her and she felt she would be better married to someone who appreciated her. <br /> <br /> In the Marcus movie, the slave named Justus still has books that he hardly promised to himself, not to mention his slave. Certainly there was no romantic difference between the existent slave Justus and the female gladiator ... <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, if you want good novelties from the novel's novel, look at the good novel of classical history, Claudius.
