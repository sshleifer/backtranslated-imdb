Don't be fooled by other rogues. Although this film has an impressive number of talents, the material they provide leaves much to be desired. Nat King Cole's 3 numbers are pretty flat and not even close to his later efforts, although he impresses with his piano play. "Moms" Mabley is not a little funny, although I remember him as a very young entertainment opportunity. In fact, the best performances are a couple of fat boys who impress with the lively dancing dance and the Four Tops start and jazz band, especially the bass player. The print itself is of poor quality and the wonderful butterfly McQueen is completely wasted in the surrounding plot.
