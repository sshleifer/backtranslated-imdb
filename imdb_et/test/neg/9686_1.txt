Who wrote the script for this movie, Disney Studios? It is the most immutable adaptation of any story! I wanted to laugh at a scene and called out to others, and that was just because it was pathetic. I have to credit it, it has some funny scenes, but I could have spent a better time with my evening. Very rarely do I turn off the movie only a quarter.
