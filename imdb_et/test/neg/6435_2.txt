License fees to view and pay for this trash with hard earned money? Humorous, laughing, God knows how he won BAFTA! <br /> <br /> We have been "Eastenders" for twenty years now. When, when will the UK public see this terrible soap, what is it? Crass Pap! This program no longer represents the reality of London's East End as a daily life in Beirut and has never been done. <br /> <br /> The Eastender I know is real, bold, hardworking and loyal. And one of their greatest qualities is humor. It was Eastenders, who went through the worst of London and two more fingers to Hitler. And what do we see on our screens within five days (including omnibus)? Nothing more than a bunch of wilting, "dead on the neck" wimps, who look each other a little while sitting around the pub all day. What Great Britain's Advertising Is! Do the writers believe the garbage they pumped? Obviously, the public is doing a poor part, but then I have heard that everyone can be washed temporarily to believe something.
