This movie has bad writing and bad editing. It's hard to keep track of what's going on, because no signs make sense. Some major accidents occur every 30 seconds. As a result, no "action" sequence is interesting at all. The movie is two hours worth of "throw" scenes, which are only related to the sharing of common participants. This movie doesn't even have enough sense of humor to be a good "bad" movie.
