Great story and great actors (Quaid and Ryan), but the film suffers from poor leadership, bad scenario and bad script. Leading actors do their part but couldn't record the movie at all. Bad bad because it could have been a good 80-year-old style Hitchcock temporary / mystery / thriller.Ryan seemed so young and fresh.
