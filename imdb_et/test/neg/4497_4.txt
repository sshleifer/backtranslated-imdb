Photography has been completed by acting is pretty good, but in almost all other departments, Greece is Tycoon terrible. The film is inspired by the love of true life of Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis, a shiny but completely empty soap opera that is on television all day. Observers who own the whole "fame magazine culture" (paparazzi photos and gossipy stories about the rich and famous) will undoubtedly find a lot of their appetite here. But those who prefer a little more substance and crafts and quirkines will find a 107-minute ride on sliding. <br /> <br /> American President James Cassidy (James Franciscus) and his beautiful wife, Liz (Jacqueline Bisset), are in official business in Greece. The ridiculously rich Greek sailor, Theo Tomas (Anthony Quinn), sees Liz at his elegant mansion. Despite the fact that both of them are married to someone else, there is an immediate attraction between them. Later on, Tomas makes his own wishes to the private sector on his hunt. After a while, President Cassidy was murdered on a walk on the beach. Liz is shocked and sad because of his death, but it is not long before he looks for comfort in his Greek lover Tomasis. Finally, two of them are married and their love relationship becomes the favorite language of the world's newspapers, magazines, photographers and wagons. <br /> <br /> It is somewhat fun to note the power of the producers of this movie denied that it was a dramatic drama about Kennedy-Onass. They wanted the film to be seen as an original story that is rooted in fiction. But anyone with a brain sees where the film is inspiring. Even Aristotle Onassis himself knew that the Greek Tycoon was his love life for Hollywood (when it is believed that rumors he had Anthony Quinn's approval for Tom's role!) J. Lee-Thompson isn't really the right kind of leader for this type of film? is he better suited for handling feeds such as Navarone weapons and ice cold Alexis? but his court proceedings are guided by professional adequacy. Quinn is very observable as Thomas; Bisset looks like an object of his desires; Francis uses his toothy smile and integrity facade to become a credible politician. Their performances are good on the surface, but participants cannot do it at a deeper level. Similarly, Tony Richmond's photo gives the film an elegant surface that moves from one exotic region to the next, but critical scratches indicate that there is nothing behind the shiny exterior of the film.
