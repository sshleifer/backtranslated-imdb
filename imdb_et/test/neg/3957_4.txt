A group of teenagers discover a bootleg video game, but when they start playing, they start to die like a video game. As they become addicted to the game, they have to find a way to win the central criminals The Blood Countess before they kill them all. <br /> <br /> Assuming it is a bit stupid and familiar, this movie would still be a little entertaining. But this "horror" movie is not scary at all. It's actually comedy as something else. The movie is too serious and the movie can't be viewed. Of course, there is an occasional laugh, but mostly the film is very boring. PG-13 horror movies can still be good like Ring or Cry Wolf. Ring and Stay Alive are not really the same type of horror movie. Stay Alive is rather a slasher film and its nominal value PG-13 is the death scenes very much. It should have been the main selling of the film and since it was an interesting concept, the deaths would have been very good. Unfortunately, the studio wanted a bigger audience and the film had to be changed. <br /> <br /> The actor is a complete joke and most of the casts give terrible performances. Jon Foster is not a very good leading man. He has no charisma to really engage the audience or take care of the audience. His character is not very shameful. Samaire Armstrong really does give a decent presentation, although it is a bit too sharp. Frankie Muniz is probably the best in Stay Alive. This is the honor of Houston Texas as the best player. Sophia Bush is absolutely terrible in October. His perception seems so hasty and fake. The most annoying feature of the movie is Phineas, played by Jimmi Simpson. His character is so unlikely that you will kill him. <br /> <br /> In fact, most characters are quite unlikely, making the movie even more interested. It's just hard to apologize for some of these annoying children and it's much more fun to see if you want the characters to survive. The only real good of the film is the atmosphere. It's a bit old, but it's still working. The film is also very short, so it's not too much pain to sit down. I no longer blame it because they worked with an inexperienced leader and writer. The direction is not very good and the scenario is not much better. Stay Alive is not really the worst horror film of 2006. This honor comes when a stranger calls. However, Stay Alive is a forgotten opportunity. Finally, this cheesy and flat horror film is on the right shelf. Rating 4/10.
