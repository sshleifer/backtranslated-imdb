Forget the sad action that can be forgiven in such a movie. Or even terrible, unnatural dialogue and illogical events (if my subtitles actually reflected what was said). Worse is the skilful lack of a skilled or experienced director who might have had a vacation with an editor at the time of making the film? Looking at the film, it seems completely outdated, although it was "only" 7 years ago. Computer virus as a successor's portal? lol? Is there an internet connection? Clucky ghost photos of the picture ("He! Look there ... is it the face?" - face in- -Oops, the sound interrupts- "splits" - the next scene), scenes and sequences are poorly modified and therefore do not flow at all. You look at a girl who still found a dead body in one scene, and then 10 seconds later we see her again in some place, apparently intact, smiling and going. <br /> <br /> In addition to the many problems I have with the film about the value of the output, it is also painfully long and repetitive and therefore boring. <br /> <br /> Instead, I recommend "Shutter", an oriental horror film that is well done.
