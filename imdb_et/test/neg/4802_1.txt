I got this little joke from the VideoAsia "Voodoo of Voodoo" DVD label. I don't know that voodoo should fit. Indeed, I usually wouldn't connect voodoo to Indonesia (not to mention WIPs). <br /> <br /> I know and love WIP movies. I've seen most of them. That's why I couldn't stand this little known pearl from the description in the title. <br /> <br /> This is APPALLING. You can't get a WIP movie when women keep their clothes (even in the shower!). Although it gives youngsters the exploitation of the genre, it is a naked WIP like a big Mac without beef. <br /> <br /> Like my gym instructor at all, I said I'm rather a disco.
