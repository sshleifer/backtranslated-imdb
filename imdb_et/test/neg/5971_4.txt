After observing Darwin's nightmare, one must have the impression that Tanzania is a living hell, whose population is almost slaves, offering the best fish to well-fed Europeans, leaving the fish bones hungry for the population. In return for the fish they receive western weapons, which are mainly expected by the unemployed, as being a soldier is their only source of income. an incarnation of evil and all sources of misery? Not quite. Fortunately, Darwin's nightmare shows only the blind sides and saves completely positive aspects. In fact, the documentary hardly talks about the economic and ecological importance of Victoria and the region. <br /> <br /> Victoria Lake is the second largest source of income around Lake Victoria. Fishing industry salaries are above average. Tanzania has banned large trawlers to provide jobs for thousands of fishermen. The neighboring countries have agreed agreements to maintain a sustainable level of fishing. Cities on the shores of the lake will benefit from the taxes that fishermen have to pay for each kilogram of fish caught and the taxes on their exports and profits. In addition, Tanzania has banned the export of local traditional fish, which still play an important role for the local population. <br /> <br /> By ignoring these positive signs, the documentary hampers the required western consumers and investors and thus threatens to worsen the African situation. <br /> <br /> For further reading, I recommend two articles written by the German alternative newspaper: http://www.taz.de/pt/2006/09/02/a0013. 1 / textdruck http://www.taz.de/pt/2005/03/17/a0151.1/text
