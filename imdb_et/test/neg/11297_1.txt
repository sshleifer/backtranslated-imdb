* Hannibal SPOILERS * Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is back in the movie ... Now he's in Italy, pricing our food (including people like Rinaldo Pazz (Giancarlo Giannini)), but he returns to Clarice (Julianne Moore) and even to the result of the former victim Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) Let me tell you that this film is not worth talking with the silence of lambs and with Manhunter, because it is truly, completely, absolutely, absolutely BAD. <br /> <br /> I mean, near the end of the scene, where Ray Liotta was opened and he was forced to eat some of his brain? WTF? Then why was HELL all so annoying (including Clarice)? And why was this story somewhere? I think this is the Hannibal series "teenager" chapter; terrible, stupid, gore and totally embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it, especially if you love some other Hannibal movie (SOTL, Manhunter, Red Dragon, Hannibal Rising). <br /> <br /> Hannibal: 1/10.
