Everything except the younger Americans is probably familiar with "Laaaaaa-sie!" a little Timmy, or whatever the boy's name was, with his little towing place, a friend of his frontier colonel. These same Americans may or may not be familiar with the fact that Lassie jumped from television to movies (or was it the other way around? I'm clearly too lazy to study here) and painted mountains are one of them. "This movie has gone to the dogs" is irresistible. pun, so i dont (though i technically just did). But there is some way. Lassie (playing Shepit, her best friend) gets the best bills. THE DOG MUST BE ISSUED. Now, I'm not familiar with how participants or their representatives negotiate contracts, but here's how it feels to me: <br /> <br /> MOVIE MOGUL: Okay, Lassie, on credits, it'll be, "and Lassiega like Shep! "LASSIE: Rrrrowf! Grrrrrrr. MOVIE: Ha, ha, boy, calm down, calm down! LASSIE: Rrroo rrrrooo roooo. MOVIE MOGUL: Okay, I think I can see. Invoicing? LASSIE: Rawrf! Rawrrrrff rawrf! MOVIE: Oh God! Let go of my hand! Best Settlement! Best billing for you, now let my hands open! <br /> <br /> So, the dog will get the highest billing and for the rest of this shocked shocked story, I think it's understandable. We get the beloved old grump Jonatan, his young, tiny and probably orphaned friend Tommy, the sketchy loser Lin Taylor and the loving old religious wrinkle Pilot Pete. The meat of this plot can be summed up with a few sentences, so I save the real pain of watching the movie. Jonathan is a dog whose dog is called Shep and his partner dies at his request. He gets a new partner named Lin, who has become obsessed with gold, and for some reason Jonathan gives a small tommy Tommy to Shep. Lin kills Jonathan, Shep sees it, and Lin tries to kill Shepi. Then Lin tries to kill Tommy. Then Tommy gets upset, it freezes and Shep makes a comprehensive plan to get Lin to revenge what he does. End. <br /> <br /> If you don't have a deep and undisturbed need to see a Lassie movie (even if you have to have a better Lassie movie than that), avoid simply painted mountains. If it doesn't drag, admiring Lassie's limited ability to "act" (maybe similar to style, to Keanu Reeves - always the same facial expression, only body moves), creating an obvious multi-minute movie or offensive Native Americans everywhere with their white-actor-in-facepaint "Ugh! How! I work bear!" Stereotypes, painted hills are only suitable for Lassie fetishists or people who have any connection with searching for those days, as an outdated prospector who is a shiny gold embedded in the vein!
