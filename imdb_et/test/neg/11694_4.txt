Of the praise he received, I waited more for the fear of Korea when viewed with the same caliber as the story of two sisters, as some other reviews have said. This movie is not the same caliber, except for the special spending budget. Think about the horror of Amytiville. In case of fruit and rarely dialogue. <br /> <br /> If you have a film with limited dialogue, the graph lines and characters will have to wear a movie. This movie could have been pretty well in the concept of a 30-minute short film, 2 hours with lots of pictures of trees and terror scenes that make you not only afraid but also "What ..." is not a good horror movie. <br /> <br /> The people who say that this film gave them a lasting impression literally have a heart attack when proper horror movies put it in.
