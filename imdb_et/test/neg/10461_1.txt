I agree with all the comments that have been posted so far: this film was a waste of time and for both viewers and those who did it. Terrible CGI, terrible script, stupid plot and hey, the device is in Alabama, but it looks like California. But the worst thing is that it is a native-american angle that draws in any stereotype that you have to think about with a smoky commander, an angry warrior, people who speak without using contractions ("Don't do it!"), Native American tubes that play air in the air, etc. It shows only the lack of respect and understanding that I beat my hair. Native American, who has one ounce of self-esteem, would have thrown it out of the window. So finally, I would say that this movie is a lot offensive to everyone.
