I went to see myself to make sure it fits my little boy to see. Why? Violence, death, funeral. If you are not prepared to explain these concepts to your children, keep them away. "Maybe Hello Kitty will also make a gangland comic. <br /> <br /> There was very little and far between smiles. When you were talking about yourself, there were no. The cows saw the Far Side with comics." there is nothing original about this film except for the addition of ridiculous violence and anti-social action to all young children.
