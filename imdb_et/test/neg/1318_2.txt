There is something interesting about disasters. A simple, primary assumption can lead to a number of great stories. Most of the accident films tend to explore the familiar territory, but usually I can live with it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the flood is probably a low point in the history of this subspace. Robert Carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the movie, although the screen time is divided between different places and characters. He barely gives a decent result. Joanne Whalley is also very uneven. Particularly bad is the veteran actor Tom Courtenay (he played Doctor Zhivago's heaven). I think his timing has been completely off most of the time and his characterization is extremely bad. What an embarrassing performance for this person. The remainder of the majority goes from decent to really bad and one exception: Jessalyn Gilsig, whom I thought there was a plot device / eye candy, gives the most convincing result. It doesn't mean much if everyone else is bad, but still nice to see that he cares. <br /> <br /> The script is really bad, confusing and clich√©. Some of the worst features I've heard for a long time are the participants' succession. You've seen this story a thousand times. It uses all the dramatic hooks and tears you've seen in Outbreak, Armageddon, Poseidon films (original and remake) and many others. <br /> <br /> The direction is terrible. There is no sense of timing, no inspiration. Pictures are blissful, dialogue and action can't flow. Editing is bad, but how to make such confusion? Undoubtedly, this film tried to rely too much on the CGI (rather poor). The human factor, the drama of symbols and the struggles are glossed. Scenes where the characters actually have to deal with the flood are rare and badly done. The feeling on television gives you nausea. Should anyone go out of the helicopter with a rope? No problem, we'll show him inside a helicopter and really do a bad cutting / editing job and get the next shot safely with him in the most obvious way. <br /> <br /> The film's result is poor. The whole place, no timing. <br /> <br /> The end is probably worse than I've seen for some time. Like ideas, they went out. Clean it up so you can't run out unless you have ever had it. Must be out of budget. <br /> <br /> It's really an amateur job. I'll give him 2 to use London as a location that is a nice change, because Gilsig is actually a decent contributor and a few CGI frames that were decent (London and Gate closed water) <br /> <br /> Do Give yourself a preference and watch the day after tomorrow's day or almost every catastrophe before. It includes older classics like The Towering Inferno.
