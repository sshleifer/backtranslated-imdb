Barney teaches kids something !!! Here are a few three reasons why you shouldn't watch this example for children: 1. Barney teaches children that we should take care of getting along with each other. Barney teaches kids you shouldn't be sad, and if you feel sad, eat lots of games! 3. If you do harm to people, they will give you what you want, if you want it. He should not trust. And he's high every day! !!! DO NOT EXIT THIS SHOW !!!!!!!!!!! Your children will thank you for your parents
