Chaplin was a great silent comedian, but many quiet stars of the era fell when the public heard their voices in the first conversations. In my opinion, Chaplin's voice was simply not suited to his silent characters that made him rich and famous. His career did not recover when the film came. Contrary to most of the reviews I read, Chaplin's lifestyle and politics did not help his popularity with the average viewer who had been waiting for Chaplin comedian entertainment, and not spend his entertainment dollars watching Chaplin's political comment. <br /> <br /> Despite Chaplin's awards and knighthoods, I would make an exception to his "contribution" to humanity. The great dictator was made while Stalin's brutal dictatorship was to be shown, and both dictators signed a treaty that invaded both dictators in Poland. During World War II, Poland was attempted to rescue. The Nazis won after 6 years, but Poland lost its sovereign state. It happened at the time of making this film and by the federal government in Hollywood research. If Chaplin had been part of this satire, Joe Stalin, then, besides the Italian dictator, he would probably have been criticized by politicians for less policy on his policy. The improper treatment of the Soviets with Jews and dissidents went beyond Nazi time and numbers. <br /> <br /> With just a movie, many gags were too topical to be understood by younger viewers who didn't know who Goebbels, Goring or Mussolini were. The classic work of art must stand in time. The classic Greek tragedy, Mona Lisa and Beethoven's 9th place are still centuries after their creation, because they are timeless. Films based on topical political comments or currently popular social views usually do not cross the generation in which they are made. But those who deal with the common problems of all generations will probably live forever and get a high rating from me. <br /> <br /> Chaplin, as a writer, director and leading actor, must blame what I meet with Chaplin apologists for apologizing for his decision to leave a country that made him rich and famous. When Chaplin found that the US was so offensive, why didn't he return to his country. Great Britain fought against the Nazis with blood and money. What did Switzerland do to fight Europe's dictators? Switzerland is like a country club that chooses and chooses its members based on race and class, and cares little about people who can't join the club.
