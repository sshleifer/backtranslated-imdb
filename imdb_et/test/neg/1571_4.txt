The film was disappointing. I saw this with Broadways Bernadette Peters and she was outstanding. Perhaps when he ends his musical career, he will let his despair play his despair, which he despises, revives and triumphs. Bette's song is always a belt, always flat and missing to show her ability as an actor. To be fun, this performance died of stronger lead and stronger casting, so others would be memorable in the absence of Bette. Another criticism: she smiles straight into the camera every time she sings! I know this is a musical theater, but please leave a mercy society - Middler can't play like Liza or Streisand, who could be retrospective - out of context and out of context.
