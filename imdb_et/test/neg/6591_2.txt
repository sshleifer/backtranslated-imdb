This film was filmed in my hometown and I was acquainted with many "actors" in small rolls. Most of them were students of the local karate school, and even when we were filming, we all knew what it was. However, it was interesting to see that. Most of the films that it was filming no longer exist, such as a nightclub, a pizza shop, and so on. "The World Premiere" took place at Akron Civic Theater and we all laughed hysterically when it was uneven. I personally believe that this is the worst film ever made, but it brings me many pleasant memories. Watch this movie with advice ... enjoy it for what it is ... a very low budget, badly done, karate flick.
