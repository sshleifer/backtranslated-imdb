This movie was bad and movies about how some college students in the house to renovate this money and find out that the house has a woman Deamon and that there is a hell portal. heaps of stupid scenes like at the beginning of the movie, how they clean the house and they start dancing for a fun song, and some of the demons at the end of the movies are just a few boys in bad costumes, trying scary sounds and there are some good gore scenes like when the professor ripped his face. I only hired this movie because I'm a big fan of horror movies and its only worth watching if u are a fan of horror movies. really bad the only good actor is Roy Scheider from the big movie Jaws and all over this movie there are heaps of bugs and my rating is 4 out of 10.
