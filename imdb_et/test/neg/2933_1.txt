Maybe I was expecting this movie too much, but at least comedy should be funny and has very few fun moments. It succeeds in offending homosexuals, heterosexuals, women, obese, and probably many other groups. The ending scene, where _everyone_ claims to be gay, is one of the toughest I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Tom Selleck and Matt Dillon are ridiculously unsuccessful and Kevin Kline seems to be confused most of the time. > <br /> Other reviewers will compare "Will and Grace", but at least "Will and Grace" _is_ funny.
