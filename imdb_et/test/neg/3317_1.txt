Now, don't get me wrong, I love seeing the half-winded chicks that are around. It is part of the fun of the Moroccan restaurant: belly dancers. But it doesn't do much for the plot. <br /> <br /> My first big problem is music. I feel that when Ann Rice wrote "The Vampire Lestat", Cure had more music she would have liked (although I could be wrong). I know that with the current "Gothic" music it may have seemed like a good idea, but they did this terrible job. Lestat was an actress who probably had a pretty good song. The fact that they chose Jonathan Davis to be his stage voice is heartbreaking. Second, and another one said that compressing two very complex books into one crazy movie is a bad idea. "Lestat" could have been a separate film and damn good if it was right. I do not believe frankly that "The Queen of Fucking" borrows the film very well. Although I would like to see a movie that contains a creative story, there is too much to say about it in the "inaction" book that it would be a very interesting film. And what he repeated, they greased it quite badly. Now remember, it's been a long time since I've read it. I always thought that "Lestat", "Body Thief" and "Memnoch the Devil" were much more packed and made better films. /> <br /> I know a lot of people (hey, me too) who like a lot of cheesy vampire crap that thought it was the biggest genre to make it a big movie. I tend to agree with them there. Aaliyah had a nice body.
