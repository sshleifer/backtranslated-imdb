I thought the "cams that make crank phone calls" were pretty low, but I don't think Carlos Mencia's show would qualify even for comedy. His main goal is to make the audience incredibly uncomfortable using the word "beaner" as many times as possible. I've never felt compelled to write a review that announced something awful before IMDb, but I really hope that this exhibition has never been renewed or repeated. maybe he was only hired by the network because they hoped he would fill those shoes. It is obvious until the introduction of Chapelle (blues guys vs. mariachi band). However, Mencial is absolutely * reluctant and does not get enough of the popular views of the Spanish culture to bring out his creative look every time. Instead, he sticks with a small number of shocking nicknames for his fellow countrymen and makes fun of immigration. From time to time, he uses a little darkness in his skin to entertain someone like Middle Eastern cultures. These jokes consist mainly of repeating every joke or stereotype that has been made against culture, and maybe some incredibly old themes (such as 9/11), in a loving, stand-up style, while he laughs himself to cover the audience's style . I think he's really afraid of being offensive, so it just makes the viewer uncomfortable. He also jokes about death. If you've ever seen "Why is f *** this news?" you know what I'm talking about. First of all it's funny, but it just runs on and continues and at some point becomes a captain. <br /> <br /> This is a train that is purely painful to watch.
