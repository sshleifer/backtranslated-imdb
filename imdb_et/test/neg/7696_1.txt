This is the fact that it is the first Saudi film film to be shown in cinema theaters, but not in Saudi Arabia for a simple reason, because we do not have a cinema theater in our big city. The government banned the opening of cinema theaters after Islamic extremists OR the religious police (or both) asked for its closure in the late 1970s and early 1980s, accusing the seventh art of encouraging false sex relations and such things. t you see a strong reason why we will not open a movie cinema !! .. we have a lot of videos in the whole kingdom, we watch TV movies on some satellite channels, we can install the channels set by "Showtime" and after all the films generally seem harmless in many ways. to neighboring countries to watch a few movies. I went to Bahrain several times to watch movies in theaters because watching it is very fun, unlike watching a movie. Saudi Arabia pays the world's most expensive cinema ticket, we travel to watch movies, while in the rest of the world there are cinemas in all cities. This is one of the problems we have! .. <br /> <br /> The film is produced and presented by Rotana Filmed Entertainment, a large company owned by Saudi Arabia's prince Alwaleed Bin Talal (the world's 8th richest person). The movie's title is a word that literally means "how are you?" but it is also a slang that means "what's up!", sometimes used as a slang to say "bad" and sometimes it is used as a slang to somebody politely recall your business and not interfere in someone else's affairs. Anyway, I think they meant (how are you) and (what is!) At the same time, I could still be wrong. <br /> <br /> Male actresses are from Saudi Arabia like Hisham Abdulrahman, who is very famous and has some popularity after winning the 1st prize in Arabian real estate, showing more like "American Idol", working on some television programs like "Cash Taxi" Arabic version. Another famous actor is Khaled Sami, who is a funny and very good sense of humor. Other actors like Mishal Al-Mutairi, Turkish Al-Yusuf and Ali Al Sabea are less famous and work in some TV series. Women actresses are non-Saudi Arabia and they did a very good job with the Saudi Arabian accent .. Jordan actress Mais Hamdan in the leading role & Emeritus actor Fatima Al-Hawsan ... not that we don't have Saudi actors but are little and not good. <br /> <br /> Saudi critic "Rja Al-Mutairi", who writes for Alriyad's newspaper (the most popular newspaper in the kingdom), wrote: "You can't wait for a big part of the first Saudi feature film. can we rate it according to the usual standards, like any other film, that the film hit huge financial success only in the Kingdom of Bahrain during its first opening day. Saudi Arabian family deals (communicates) with controversial fresh problems in Saudi society, such as: women who are driving cars, low low thoughts about art, civic custody by a certain group, and the differences between conservative and being are good, but you feel like you're lost in the middle of the movie. but sometimes it does not fit or express what is in the picture. Turkish Al-Yusuf did a great job, and his performance was the best with Hamamani Mais. a Hisham Abdulrahman, who came behind supportive actors Mishal Al-Mutair, Ali Al Sabea and Khaled Sami. good work within their roles. <br /> <br /> After all, "Keif al-fish?" even if all its shortcomings are still OK film and this is a very good Rotana first step. And the film became a speech of the people and the streets, which is the golden goal of making strong discussions in Saudi society about films in general, until they know the importance of the seventh art and other arts. "PS: There is another Saudi filmmaker" Abdullah Almohaisen " who says he directed the first Saudi movie titled "Shadows of Silence". br /> <br /> I haven't seen the movie yet ... I hope I've been helpful.
