Oh wow, the character shares my first name! Nick! This film is as bad as the first, if not worse. Well, this movie has at least an actual octopus. The actual octopus that makes this movie better. Better, I mean, "Longer" acts quite dry and is hard to sit through. Just to let you know when this ninety minute movie ends not only when you are released from your couch, but you can breathe back. Not only that, but you understand how stupid you are and then suicide, realizing how terrible life is after watching this movie. Indeed, it shows how desperate horror movies are today, more understandable as it has been realized and where the hell has a real horror lately? This film should have been the final shoulder so that we could bring back the cinematic geniuses that could make really good horror films, the bites of the film, in the fear of the cinema.
