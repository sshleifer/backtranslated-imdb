It was one of the most seen films, tedious and harsher films. And yes, I've seen Pearl Harbor. Even those like Gina McKee could not get out of the terrible dialogue. It has been described as an "art house", it can only be euphemism for dull, terrible and, frankly, wretched. Why is it that if the film lacks parcels, the critics think it is worth mentioning art? But much more confusing why America loved it? Without you, this movie would have been on the shelf where it might be famous.
