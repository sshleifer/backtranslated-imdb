A few years ago, I bought a movie called The Cellar. I had heard that it should be a great movie, but it turned out to be a flop and a B movie. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but there are no good effects in the movie. (Maybe they didn't have enough money in the budget?). <br /> <br /> If you choose to watch this movie, be sure to watch it three times. First and last time !!!
