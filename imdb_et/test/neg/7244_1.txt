Just Colmyster. I fully agree with and add to all your knowledge. I came to my computer to comment on this terrible (minus) Bgrade movie. I was going to say that on this day and age I'm sorry to understand how someone could make such a terrible movie - but you beat me. Anyone reading this and Colmyster's comment trust me ---- Don't waste time and money. This is an absolute shock. Operation is completely pathetic, the script is worse and (nn) special effects are a joke. Surely no one invested in making this movie? I really can't think of what to say about this so-called horror sci-fi product, but you have to do this with a comment to make 10 lines of comments.
