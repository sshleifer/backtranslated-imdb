Thank you God for not buying this movie yourself! I borrowed it from a friend who just bought it for curiosity, and of course, after watching, they felt they should be compensated! It must be one of the worst films I've seen! I understand that they wouldn't have had a lot of budget, but I swear I can make a better movie while staring at my pets! Operation was terrible, so was editing, dialogue, ALL! It was so bad that it made me seriously angry when I watched it! I look forward to the REAL movie about the story that will come out soon, so people who are interested in it don't have to watch this joke!
