If you're not old enough to remember Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan, here they are a couple of filmmakers and finishers from Israel who founded the Cannon movie company in the early eighties. The only Israeli who was worse than the two was Menachim Begin. You probably start with a bad press, but Globus and Golan were the filmmakers, because no matter how bad your script is, your movie is peaceful and usually direct by directors who were unable to direct and who could not act directly and actors who could not directly to act. In fact, you get the impression that people just walk to Yoram and Menahem to ask them for money and they commit the filmmaker despite continuing. If only manufacturers are so confident today. It is poorly managed, badly behaved, poorly edited, but it is a script that jumps and attacks you with this horror. It starts with a number of high school jocks that take part in all kinds of horror, in fact, the first 20 minutes of the movie, like sex comedy, and it's a shock when young soldiers turn into vigilants. But it's not just any vigilante movie like EXTERMINATOR 2 or DEATH WISH 3 (please contact the community? They are both descendants and they are both Cannon films made for movies), no siree it's ridiculously bad vigilante film about pretty boy high school jocks and their Poodle on a mission to destroy scumbags. This film proves that Globus and Golan made money for people, despite their ability to make films, and you have to worry about people who seem to spend their entire reserve on making fully watchful films
