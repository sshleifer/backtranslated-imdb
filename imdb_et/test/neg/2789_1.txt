According to the budget information on this website, the estimated budget for Dark Harvest was $ 130,000. When that money was spent, I'm not quite sure. Let me look .... costumes ... no ... location and sets ... hmmm, think no .... special f / x ... NO ... acting lessons ... ah, no. Dark Harvest tells an epic story of young men from a family farm in the West Virginia Mountains. Her girlfriend tells her to go there to see the place. If there is our terrible hero learning that his great grandfather used a unique method to grow his culture, and now it is a time of revenge. Killer scares revenge !!! Ewww scary. Well, no. We all know that some terrible movies have been made for very little money, but that is not one of them. This movie contains quite a few of the worst things I have seen. Terrible clich√©s with terrible childbirth. All in all, they should not be fooled with a semi-proper cover and avoided at all costs. I'd like to try at least D for filmmakers, but I'm afraid they didn't do a good job. GRADE: F
