The worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen. Action is terrible, the plot is terrible, the idea is terrible and research has never been done! I testify that "Air Bud" was a pretty good movie, but not a "football dog". This dog is smaller than my cat! How can he play football? Even for 10-year-old children, there is no problem if the ball is heavy enough for the buggy dog ​​in half! It's terrible, don't look at this movie.
