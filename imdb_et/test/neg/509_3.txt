I looked at the 219-minute version and I have to say it's a dollar for the dollar, it's probably one of the worst movies. Now, I'm not saying it's the worst movie ever - but if you look at the cost ratio when an average person enjoys it, it's a very, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> Let's say that one of the biggest factors in making this bad movie is the writer / director Michael Cimino. Rarely can one be blamed for one person. If he hadn't been so self-conscious, just as bad a movie would be done in about 90 minutes - the studio would save millions! <br /> <br /> The film starts with a completely unnecessary prologue that should be set at Harvard. The scene is huge, but completely without context. You have no idea exactly what happens, and you don't know why students (especially John Hurt) behave so gently. It is very difficult for me to imagine the beginning of what would happen in 1870 - and it seems much more like 1970. It is half an hour where you have no idea what is happening, who are the characters or their motivation. <br /> <br /> The next scene is 20 years later. Inexplicably, there are two Harvard degrees (Hurt and Kris Kristofferson) in Wyoming. So, they went to the best schools in America and now there is only one guy who is not where and where the other is .... well, what is John Hurt in the movie?!?! He just appears here and there and seems to be either a jerk (prologue) or a pathetic and meaningless drunk who proclaims with murderers - though he's probably against them! His whole character didn't make sense. They never explained why he was a British who lives somewhere in the middle (it was impossible to hide his accent), why he troubled with the hired army when he was against his malicious plan and why he would risk his life for the reason he did not believe at all. As far as Kristofferson is concerned, his magnificent ability to act and a better-defined character made his character more plausible, although he had no point in moving to Wyoming and risking his life for a prostitute. <br /> <br /> HEADEN GATE. The scenes are WAY TOO LONG and need trimming, but the worst part of the movie is that the characters were like a cardboard. John Hurt (a wonderful actor who has nothing to do with the movie), Jeff Bridges and many other great names exist, but you have no idea why. Actually, everything except Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert (as a golden heap - quite a clich√©) and perhaps Christopher Walken, EVERYONE is completely one-dimensional. It's hard to imagine a movie HOW it will be a long time if you don't know or understand the characters. <br /> <br /> Much of the film also seems anachronistic. Who would have thought that in 1890 a huge roll would be built in the middle of the environment? I am sure that it would have been very, very difficult to get the basic supplies in this region in the western country - and yet we expect trains with roller skates and lumber to reach the food. Maybe if they hadn't spent a basic dollar on buildings and a bike path, farmers would have been able to buy food and avoid this war purloined against cattle !!! And what about a skateboarder with a violin? What was it about land war? The most obvious problem you have left is that it is a movie where, in fact, very little happens until the big battle ends. There are many scenes of dirty and flat flaws. There is nothing so much that many of the audience members would have left the film at the time of the battle or are now so hostile that it is inevitable that nothing will save the movie. <br /> <br /> As for the last battle, it was pretty good, but they had problems. First, this little prairie connection lasted longer than the D-Day invasion! Secondly, although the details of the actual events of the so-called "Johnson County War" are a tight sketch, we know that the characters played by Huppert and Kristofferson were not really there as they were both hung before the battle. Thirdly, I cannot believe that Cimino killed the animals throughout the film - especially in the last battle. Although I am far from the bleeding heart of animal rights, his need to use animal gut and actually kill some horses in cinematography. Looking and knowing that some horses died to achieve the "vision" of Cimino's film, it is very sad. <br /> <br /> Finally, after a great battle, we have an epilogue. Although it is blissfully short, it seemed completely unnecessary and vague. We see Kristofferson's fancy yacht, so we can assume that he will eventually end up with Harvard education for himself. We also see a woman who seems to have been looking at Kris a few times during the prologue. Most importantly, nothing is said and you have no idea what the end result is. I read it myself and found that the film often has facts wrong. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, the film has a long and necessary ton, there was more editing than World War II was a "tiff". Well, I've certainly seen a lot worse, but if you consider the cost of production, I think it may be just one of the worst films in history. <br /> <br /> Finally, when the film has this much explicit nudity, warn the parents. However, since no child can sit through this film (even with a promise of sex), no warning is needed.
