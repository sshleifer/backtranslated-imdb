This cute piece is not worth the critical evaluation, so I write to those who don't know the background of this movie. First of all it's not the first Saudi movie, they used it for the wrong information for commercial purposes (they lied!). Second, they did nothing else for the money, so they chose fun (Hesham), who won the Star Academy (like Big Brother), this is a popular show, and Herkis Hesham is popular but stupid, cheesy & untalented, then chose Kuwiti actress Mohammed Al Sairafi (also stupid and unbelievable) but popular (read how many times I use the word "popular", then send me an email to get my prize, but ..) is a popular show and Jordan actress Mais Hamdan who appeared in CBM (unfunny) at POPular comic show so he is famous * PoPular! Then they chose .. Saudi Arabian participants .. blah blah blah. The funniest thing is the director! He's with Canadian Palestinian roots (I believe the film's identity is the identity of its director) .. Wait a minute! The screen is written by an Egyptian scriptwriter (very terrible!), Assisted by Lebanese critics (known as a critic, but actually a money collector!). This group of several racial groups (money slaves) know nothing about the Saudi culture they do not represent, but if we know who is behind this garbage, all our questions will be found! Waleed bin Talaal is a Saudi prince and (BUSINESSMAN) who does not care about Saudi Arabian culture or the people of Saudi Arabia (even if he lives in his own world, his world is far from the real world of the human world) that he knows nothing and nothing else, except his endless happiness. <br /> <br /> * Not a Saudi movie (nothing about the movie). <br /> <br /> Turn them all together. <br /> <br /> Vote for 10!
