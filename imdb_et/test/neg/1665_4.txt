Andr√© Roussin was a specialist in the French "Theater de Boulevard": playing where you can find an eternal triangle: a man / woman / (male or female) lover. Many of his games gave Elvire Popesco some of his best pieces on stage. ... and the big actor was the main reason to watch them, because Roussin is not Sacha Guitry, with a long shot. The French audience remembers "Au Theater Ce Soir". <br /> <br /> Still with me? Roussin's games were not filmed. And this is a pretty mediocre material, even if the screenwriters call Lewis Carroll to save them. I like Stewart Granger and David Niven and Ava Gardner are eye-catchers. Being raw and predictable, the local (Bola-Bola) intervention is a ludicrous farce surrounding the desert in the Trois desert in the desert, where Granger would be some Robinson, Niven, his Friday and Gardner's girl on Friday.
