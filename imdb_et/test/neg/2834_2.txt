I love Brian Yuzna's second job, even the cruder stuff like "Necronomicon", but "offspring" was too much for me. My main complaint is that it has used Jillian McWhirter's nudity unnecessarily, I am not a bride, but these naked scenes only drag on and on ... only to culminate (practically every time) quietly * beat sexual violence. An example of where he tries to scream his wife's abortion after several minutes is the best example. Arnold Vosloo's "performance" is completely complicated, but even Jeffrey Coombs was unable to save this terrible fish. Aliens are boring, uniformly boring lighting captures your interests and the plot is completely predictable. For me, the only highlighted too short look at the true form of the aliens (a very nice model) and the scene where Vosloo finds his wife in the closet was also OK. But you are warned.
