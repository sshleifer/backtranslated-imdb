This short topic is a thirty-year-old 1942 film "What is Matador?" Transformation of boys' trips to Mexico and their bullfighting adventures. Although the original short was made during the Stooges peak period, it is not so memorable and I believe it is one of the most central films with Curly Howard. <br /> <br /> Being convinced that "Sappy Bullfighters" is simply pathetic, like all other pants with Joe Besser. Moe and Larry would never have had Besser to work because his bright, almost feminine character was totally wrong for Stooges' violent comedy. Her 16 films with Moe and Larry celebrated the team's lowest, and these trousers are embarrassing to watch. This short appeared in 1959 and was a crew swan with Columbia. Maybe Besser was a nice guy, but he was all wrong as the third difference. <br /> <br /> I don't look at Besser's short pants anymore because I would give the same negative review over and over again. Take a big advantage and don't look at it. Instead, try "In Sweet Pie and Pie" or "Hoi Polloi".
