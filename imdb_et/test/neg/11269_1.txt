"Yagyu ichizoku no inbo" (just say "Shogun samurai") is a somewhat dull and delightful painful look. As a historical epic, there could have been so many opportunities to have a rich saga ... but it really is nothing more than just one cheap action of the 70s associated with the story of real events and outstanding sport with Sonnyga Chiba. Before halfway through this movie, I was tempted by a wolf! Music is like a thousand dogs in the ears with the voice of Ennio Morricone (not against Morricone). The use of zoom lens cinematography is more naive than exciting. And it is nothing more than brutal attacks and oh-no-they-not-shocks. What a terrible movie.
