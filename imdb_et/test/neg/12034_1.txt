I'm so glad she didn't see it. This film is devastating to his work. I agree with another comment - this film was a terrible disappointment. I'd give it to zero, but I'm forced to give it. <br /> <br /> The story was weak and reminded me of the days when I was a young teenager trying to write a movie. looking back and knowing how terrible it was. The bad actors, family and friends, and someone who is stupid enough to finance it, was how it was done. It's really amazing how the strings can be pulled to do something. When this film came out to the public, it puts hope on other indie filmmakers who are talented talents who are in trouble! This movie made me laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. It wasn't a serious comedy for all accounts. A scary movie is a better game for the horror genre - this movie sucks.
