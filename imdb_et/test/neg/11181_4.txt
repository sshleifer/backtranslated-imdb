Dad Brown's dissertation is that a good dose of Roman Catholicism solves all the problems of life. Little prudent, which I do not mind, but it sometimes becomes a little ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Some fine actors have been playing for Brown over the years, Kenneth More and Barnard Hughes are two good examples. Alec Guinness plays him in this movie and does it all right, but you didn't see a greater demand for future father brown movies. <br /> <br /> I think that if you are a dedicated Roman Catholic, it all makes perfect sense. It is much more important to steal a thief and convert him into his religion than to see that he has brought him to justice. <br /> <br /> But it was asked to be here. In fact, the main activity of the film is a story. Guinness's Church doctrine attempts to steal the stolen items one of his parishioners, Sidney James, had been at the time of the robbery. <br /> <br /> This is a story he gives to local police officers and, of course, this is something James has trusted him to not testify. <br /> <br /> Now for a bigger game. Master Thief Flambeau, played by Peter Finch, has stolen a cross that has been entrusted to Father Brown and belonged to St. Augustine. But Father Brown is more interested in Flambeau to return to his faith when he sees him in court. So he's misleading the police so he can complete his mission. <br /> <br /> Sorry, this thing was too much for me to swallow. Father Brown I wouldn't say it was guilty of an obstacle and had to be arrested. And he was not obliged to reveal anything he knew about Flambeau, the man had not come to him who tried to release and spiritual counsel. <br /> <br /> By G.K. Chesterton, a very noted Catholic lord, who is his day, finds it all very reasonable. Based on our logical conclusion, we should replace all police forces with the priesthood army. <br /> <br /> Guinness borrowed his own admirer Ascoyne D'Ascoyne from Kind Hearts and Coronets and Barry Fitzgerald to create Father Brown. Although Brown is much more sorry than the other two. There's a little Colonel Nicholson in this picture. Guinness also played on the bridge of the Kwai River, who caused a rather strange interpretation of the rules that he lost sight of what was important in the situation where Nicholson was. <br /> <br /> Father Brown is an entertaining companion when he solves mysteries and makes the authorities foolish. We liked Brother Cadfael in a medieval environment, and the American audience liked his father Dowling, whom Tom Bosley played a few years ago. <br /> <br /> This movie should be entertaining.
