This film is silly and very short as a funny movie. The unfortunate "eastern" is not satisfied that they are in the west; to hire a sailboat captain (John Candy) to bring them back to the east. The visions were not just funny to wear. And Richard Lewis goes to your nerves very quickly; but then I don't like something he does. Ed Lauter is fun as a bumblebee. <br /> <br /> The film was dedicated to Candy. He died ten days before the film was made due to a massive heart attack. The position and digital accessory allowed the Candy character to be seen in the latest scenes. Candy was a very good comedian and gave us a really good knee-hit, a stomach laughing at her career. This movie was not just his best caliber. <br /> <br /> Also in the movie you will know: William Sanderson, Gailard Sartain, Ethan Phillips, Ellen Greene and Rodney A. Grant.
