I'm a big fan of Randolph Scott, so I was surprised and disappointed that he was hardly in this movie! The movie really belongs to Robert Ryan, a jazz hero, and one who is loved in the triangle. Grief, Gabby Hayes gets more movie time than Mr. Scott in this movie! For many viewers, this is not a problem, but I'm Walter Brennan's school school, not Gabby Hayes ... although I say his lines were a little humorous in this film than in many of his films with Randolph Scott and John Wayne. <br /> <br /> Personally, I found the movie very slowly, with a twisted plot, which was even more unnecessary in the romance sub-platform. Collapsed, I don't want to understand or understand, I just mean too shameful for your good good. at the end. The whole movie accumulates in fake, unrealistic and poorly filmed. <br /> <br /> Just so you don't think I can find anything good here ... <br /> <br /> plus, Anne Jeffreys is very sexy in too short parts of her movie. Not sure if it's actually his song, or someone else, but who had this very beautiful voice. Jeffreys also had a few moments of action. The script needs him a lot more or to remove his character completely. As he was, his beautiful moments were not enough to help the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, Mr. Scott is. She looks fantastic in this movie and is a nonsensical lawyer to set things right. Some people complain that his characters before 1950 were too good, good, but it didn't bother me at all. I'll take him before 1950 as a good-tempered or post-1950 harsh and violent ... in both cases, Randolph Scott was a real Western hero. but I should recommend going through this movie if you are not a tough hard fan ... there are so many better Scott movies that you won't miss.
