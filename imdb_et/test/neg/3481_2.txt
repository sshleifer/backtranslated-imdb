This movie is very unlikely. Read other comments to see why. <br /> <br /> I would say most of the symbols were plastic, but they didn't even allow that little luxury; they just act like cardboard cutouts. Of course, they had to become real surfers for the roles of surfing, so it is nonsense to shoot if they can act. At least Occy didn't give a mess and just went with it. But "Lance" ??? One character who proved it, Gerry Lopez, who didn't actually act, was quite a lot of himself. He's quite accustomed to coercing people. :-) The only reason I gave this film a 2 instead was because I put a newsletter on my laptop when it came over a cable overnight. It saved me from such a stupid little time without full attention. No way I would look at it.
