So one day I was in a video shop looking for a movie. I found it and rented it because it was a movie I hadn't seen or even heard. <br /> <br /> Now I generally like to film, but it's just sad, not even laughing. In addition to being ultra-inexpensive and containing all the clich√©s and terrible acts of the film, it has the most incompetent and intuitive direction I've ever come across. Sometimes the above features may appear in the movie and some enjoyment may still be present, but not here. A painful example of a home-made horror.
