How to take Charles Darwin's fantastic intellectual journey and make it a chick flick. His central and original ideas and their radical influence on Western thinking and capitalist society are inviolable, with the exception of two short scenes, one of which claims to "kill God"; pure demagogy to make the movie emotional. And the rest of the movie pans for this purpose: it consists entirely of melodramatic and long family scenes whose music is superfluous and to whom we have to cry. Anyone who actually reads "the origin of the species" would be aware that none of Darwin's work violated God; on the contrary, awe and respect and a revolutionary new way to see things grew. A good movie about Darwin could be educational, thoughtful, and deeply inspiring even in a religious sense - but that would be contrary to the intentions of this flick soap opera. This is a flick designed to make people lure compassion and then feel transformed, although they cannot understand why; it only uses Darwin's excellent name as a marketing force, as one side could leave the name famous. It is sad that kits and costumes are so good: production values, except in writing, were probably high. See if you want to cry, the loss of intelligence in American literature.
