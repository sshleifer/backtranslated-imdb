I bought a DVD collection (9 movies for 10 euros) where it was included. It turned out to be "uncut" whatever it means. In addition to the low average quality and short scenes, there was one thing that was very strange - a soft sex scene. It started with two bigger breasts. After about 2 minutes I had my face, which installed the term "boooooooooooooring!" totally completely. 7.5 minutes not even bouncing concrete like tits (in this sense, the concept of breasts bad choice) far from entertainment. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie was more like "people aren't / that / stupid, right? <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the DVD was scratched and I got my money back."
