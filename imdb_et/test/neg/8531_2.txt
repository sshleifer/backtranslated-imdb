Well, at least we have to admit that big Hollywood horror producers will eventually become smarter and more sensitive. Instead of patiently waiting for the rights to buy Asian horror hits and later making them into America, they now discovered they could just hire Asian directors and set their new ghost story right in the countries. It's like killing two birds with one stone; way to go boys! "Messengers" are pretty much identical to all the other supernatural coolers that have come out of the East from "Ring". That means it's boring, too long, and a totally gore-free movie, but it contains a lot of wrong fears and embarrassment for the weak "did we scare you yet?" a moment. Pang-Brothers (Danny & Oxide) made the "Eye" in the past, and it is a kind of tradition where they create clues and tips on where their curious expectations are almost impossible to answer. audiences, but they don't seem to be eager to change their formula quickly. And they are also dishonest to reuse the same old and repetitive ghosting issues over and over again. The restless spirits of the previous inhabitants trapped in the walls of a remote farm? The refugee family, which has been broken by the unprocessed traumas of the past, must first restore faith and trust to each other? Leave me alone! Throw a videotape and a seven-day curse, why don't you? Even trying to jump into your place is too déjà-vu and doesn't scare anyone over 7 years old. Doors, dirty and gradually larger growing stains on the walls, ghostly appearances, basements from the basement. The endless overuse of such cheap tricks becomes offensive to almost horizontal fans. "Messengers" turn to the family for a new life in the country as sunflower growers. The family situation is one that is uncertain, because the personal tragedy (which does not appear before the end of the film) caused their younger son to speak and the parents did not trust their opposing teenage daughter. Shortly thereafter, children will experience strange performances in the adjacent economy, but they will not be able to convince their parents to leave. This is pretty much the whole movie. Little Ben sees things, but he can't talk and Jessica attacks repeatedly by supernatural forces, but no one listens to him. The main prerequisite for "messengers" is the derivation of Stanley Kubrick's immortal classic "The Shining", but it lacks a constantly ominous atmosphere and a disturbing tone. The script takes itself too seriously, although it is quite easy to predict the final execution and the complete absence of violence and bloodshed is unforgivable. At least "Eye" finally gave some real shocks, while the happy joy that ends with "Messengers" is simply pathetic. The only positive elements I think are the beautiful shooting places in rural areas, enough editing and promising young actors (and beauty) Kristen Stewart. And for William B. Davis, it is a surprising but, unfortunately, underdeveloped supporting role.
