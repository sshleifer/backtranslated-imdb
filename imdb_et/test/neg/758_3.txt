It's not just that the movie is flat. That's more. This movie is just unnecessary. Do we need another Western? How would the West Coast be in the role of African-American titles? Sound is silly, incredible and flat to modernize the genre? It is. Incredibly flat and easy thinking. It's like the flat film by Baz Luhrman "Romeo and Juliet", where he put it into modern times to attract young people and create a leap in transforming the classical story. Well, Baz Luhrman failed and so did the mess. The story is not really bad, but the whole idea of ​​eliminating racism from the racist genre by choosing all the African-American pains is in itself racist. It's also pure and simple thinking (like Baz Luhrman-man, he's a bad director). Hey (I hear you say) led by Mario Van Peebles! She's in the movie! How can it be racist? This is not. I said all Afro-Americans were cast instead of Caucasians. The film is not racist, it's just pointless, stupid and very boring.
