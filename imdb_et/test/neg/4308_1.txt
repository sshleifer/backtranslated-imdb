I knew it would be terrible but not terrible !!, because it is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, not the fucking thing! All the characters are boring and the story is stupid and incredibly boring !, Plus End is especially flat!. The only reason I rented this chick because I'm a big fan of Michael Dudikoff, but he's wasted here and looks very boring and doesn't show the emotions that were ever! It's like there was no plot on the film and it was all about, and Ice-T is a terrible thing for God (although he's fine in some things), plus Dudikoff and Yvette Nipar had no chemistry at all. There's one scene that the director tried to do emotionally, but he can't fail because Yvette Nipar did not really show so much emotion, but there is a decent car chase, but it's not enough to recommend this god-awful movie! plus dialogue is cruel. Avoid a movie like a plague that is not a damn thing, please don't help me and trust me for what you thank me for the after effects. The direction is terrible! Fred I am Ray's doing a terrible job here with bad camera work, ridiculously cheap sets, terrible corners, ridiculous movie footage, and incredibly blank film storage. Operation is terrible! Michael Dudikoff is not close to his usual amazing self, he looks very boring, and does not show any emotions that are ever so, his character is also very boring because I can't believe he signed up for this trash, nor can he he had chemistry with Yvette Nipar (Dudikoff still rules !!!). Ice-T has hardly anything to do and it seems boring, and he didn't convince me a little. Hannes Jaenicke is not very good here, she had some nervous character, I didn't like her. Yvette Nipar is beautiful but was very terrible here, she didn't show much emotion and had no chemistry with Dudikoff, and as a result I didn't give a damn for her character. Art Hindle (Owen Marsh), Kathy Harren (Katharine Marsh) and the rest are also bad. In general, don't look like a plague!, Fred I Ray and Steve Lathshaw should be ashamed! BOMB 5
