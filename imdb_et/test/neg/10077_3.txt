(Possible small spoiler) The first "Jurassic Park" was an effective but silly film that made it work and was actually pretty good. There were some good moments in The Lost World, but they had destroyed the film's own part, which had a San Diego T-Rex race. Now "Jurassic Park III", which was a small story in the first and sequel, has been thrown out of the window and only replaced 90 minutes of essentially non-stop action that would have worked if the film wasn't so badly done. <br /> <br /> Sam Neill is back with Dr. Grant, whom a couple (William H. Macy & Tea Leon) is proposing to come to the island to help them find their son who has been lost for over 2 months. But, of course, this is the island where dinosaurs are located, and of course that this plane just runs out, leaving them with a busy dinosaur. <br /> <br /> It was probably an exciting ride without getting the actual story, but even at this level the movie doesn't offer. Directed by Joe Johnston ("Jumanji"), he managed to take out little magic in "Jura" films and push it out of life. <br /> <br /> Dinosid looks good, though now they're just just fair and not very scary. The bottom line is that it is not a very good movie, even if it is an exciting journey. * four stars.
