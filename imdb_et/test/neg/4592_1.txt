This movie is terrible. A real ice hockey fan should assume that the people who appeared and produced in this movie didn't play or watch a real hockey game. I got the hope that it would be a "guy movie", but the only people who probably enjoy this movie are 13-17-year-old women. Ice hockey scenes are terrible, defenders play as they are 5 years old, gates that dive in frames that are 10 meters wide on the net, and so on. It's so hard to predict the end of this movie! For those who have seen it, who would have thought? For those who haven't seen it, don't waste your time! <br /> <br /> I thought it was less than half way through the movie. To name this movie, drama is ridiculous!
