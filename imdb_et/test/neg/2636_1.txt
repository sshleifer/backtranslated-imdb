This movie was nonsense. The script is full of holes; I don't see how the producers financed it. <br /> <br /> We are never given any explanation. Operation is terrible. The plot sucks. This movie was probably written for them 8 and below. <br /> <br /> I have to say: Why are high school classes just 2 minutes long? The teacher walks, finds a frog at the table or draws a table top, and 30 seconds later, the clock rings, the class is over. Children have not even opened their books. Can we have at least a little consistency? <br /> <br /> The Dialog. Milo Jeter is a reincarnated, interrupted fetal, zombie thing. Do we really need a line, "This is Dr. Jeter's office. Dr Jeter, Milo's father." Thanks for the hint; I could never put it together. It will never get better. <br /> <br /> Why does Milo speak as he does, even at the beginning? Was Milo ever "real". Or was he never real, but always what he is now? And if it was always so, why was the unexplained "accident" Milo? <br /> <br /> In addition to what is Milo? We see all these contradictions in their father's medical office and they are never given an explanation of what they have done or what they are related to. What are the injections? But with aquarium contraction? Obviously they are not needed. (Watch the movie, it makes sense). And what does this medicine do for everyone? Apparently there is nothing because it does not affect the lead actress. <br /> <br /> This movie is very bad hanging from all other movies. It's really a terrible Friday, because the 13th Halloween was broken by a 10-year-old writer. It's not ridiculous, it's just an incredibly irritating cage.
