A cautious horror film that looks like a soap opera went out of drugs that send you to a fantasy world where strange creatures lurk. The film has some good pictures, but its strange mix, which is real and not, doesn't go anywhere. Worse still, vague voice calls over one character. It seems to be a more serious, more meaningful film, but I don't think they even got into a serious or substantive territory to start trying to overcome its meaning foolishly. There's not much to say, people talk, take drugs with visions ... they talk more. It's not bad so pointless and boring. Sin is boring here and why you want to avoid it.
