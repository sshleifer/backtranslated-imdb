I appreciate the effort that filmmakers wanted to portray on Moses and Israel's emigration, and that the film helps viewers put themselves in Moses 'shoes and understand the intense burden placed on Moses' shoulders. When I saw this movie, I was excited because I was very disappointed. (I will leave out videos, special effects and artistic abilities during this review.) The most disappointing thing is the historical inaccuracy of this film and how it is so far away from the historical reports of the Bible texts. One of the main principles of the Bible is that * God * led his people out of Egypt and promised that he would bring them into the land that flows with milk and honey. Not only did he give this promise, but he led his people a cloud of clouds a day and come with a pillar at night. He never left them; He was always visible to the Israelis. The film, however, depicts God who is silent throughout the journey from the desert. This film changed the nature and subject matter of the Bible, and instead depicts God as a silent, cruel, disciplinary void. <br /> <br /> In addition, Moses' depiction was the same. Moses was known as a man of faith (why would he be such a father-figure as the old and new Testament of Israel, even though Moses is known as a man of great faith). The film depicts him as a pragmatic, angry, insecure lonely man who despises what God put on his life. OK, I promise the creators of creative freedom the story of Exodus ... but that's beyond creative - it's heresy.
