What a self-defeating mess! Duncan Roy's film is obviously autobiographical, but this chaotic, ill-acted and shamefully amateur fiasco is impossible to find any emotional truth. <br /> <br /> In some ways, you must admire a human ball who, with a gloomy assignment and a very generous benefactor, succeeds in making a film of his own rise and fall - abuse, working class, and criminal English lord. At the same time, the tone is so self-evident or so intelligent that it is not possible to deal with characters or drawings. Potentially big things are raw materials, but Roy seems to be unable to tear down a story that should catch you from the cucumber, then move you to tears. And it is a complete mystery why it was ever pictured as a triptych - probably because viewing one image would have been too annoying. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see so many other good actors - Bill Nighy, Diana Quick, Lindsay Coulson - the worst performances in the career.
