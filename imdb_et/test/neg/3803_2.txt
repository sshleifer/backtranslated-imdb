I accidentally hit it in the middle of fixative channels. I immediately recognized almost everyone who was cast, "rigid" discounts, and wondered what film could attract both the past and future stars? When the original was not seen, I thought it might be Poseidon's adventure, because it was obviously a ship in distress. I was wrong! I can't imagine for my life why any of these big (or promising) actors and actors would allow their names to be associated with such rubbish. There is no story, all the performances were forced, the characters from the parody of the usual roles of disaster films, which are suddenly concentrated by the event, and begin bombardment of the true meaning of life at the level of the philosophy of the bumper sticker. > <br /> It is worth seeing such amazing performances as Sally Field, Michael Caine and others. They need the money badly. Can we blame the director?
