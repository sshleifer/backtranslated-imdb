It's hard to be too harsh for Brad Sykes, a hard-working man who does what he loves is honest with him, which often seems to be missing from other micro-cost managers. Explore the small team members at Camp Blood, there's no ordinary thanks to all the pizza together they ate, Brad and his buddies and that's it, it's not terrible garbage. Jennifer Ritchkoff is not your average horror hero hero, but it does well enough for you to hardly notice Bethany Zolt looks like a star and Joseph Haggerty is so funny. Clown is hardly an original man in horror, but design is good, Shemp Moseley does a decent job to bring him to life and the picture blends well with rural backgrounds. Camp Blood is a horror as a blue collar and basic as it gets, not a good thing, not a bad thing but a thing.
