This movie seemed fun on the cover and thought honestly how bad it was? Little do I know. The UNBEARABLE dialog remained in the gate. It was natural, unrealistic and even interesting. The UPN Syndicated Television Dialogue is more natural. The story was unlikely and at the end was almost zero. The end of the snake is almost confusing and seemed staged. The only remarkably interesting feature is Rose McGowen, who is silent, which prevents him from destroying the dialogue with the clich√© rubbish (well, at least, until he even has to speak). The only thing that even gives it to 3 over 1 or 2 is Rose McGowen's naked scene. Really terrible. Save yourself in trouble and rent something interesting like Barney Video.
