This movie was played last month at Lifetime Movie Network and decided to review it. I looked for the first 20 minutes and then interrupted it from b / c. Sorry, the holes in the plot that are an integral part of the film plot make the film different from garbage. <br /> <br /> The film is about a woman who accidentally drives a child off the road, leaves for help, returns only to find out that it is called a blow and a run, and there is a terrible "monster" that (her tapis) hurts. /> <br /> This is a movie about a prosperous woman who has 2 small class school students and who is an active, social woman, and yet to make this film work, she must be credible to do her own CELL PHONE. Sorry, but this is a full BS, especially when everyone else seems to be - they used their number to call 911 when they found a girl on the side of the road - when our driver female left the crime scene to go to some payphone. When a female female returns, the ambulance is already on her daughter's side, and the dreadful person hits her and leaves. <br /> <br /> Just DUMB. I'm sorry, but I don't want to buy that woman not having a mobile phone that is needed for the movie. Please don't offend my movie, thanks. Perhaps, if it did in the 1970s or 1960s, I would buy it, but this is clearly the film of today (1999). .. but wait for him to have a cell phone, there would be no movie. Pfft. <br /> <br /> She knows the technology clearly because she had computers in her house, the kids she played, so all the movies had to make her cell phone dead in her car, making her a different way to call the police. The removal of the mobile phone just created a ridiculous plot.
