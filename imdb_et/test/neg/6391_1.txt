I never wanted to write a review of this movie. In fact, I was just looking at the movie star name and then I started reading the comments ... I think I never learn. This movie is terrible! I do not cause my comments for specific reasons because I really find it hard to believe that someone who has any taste really likes it. Innocent pleasure? Okay, I guess. But the movie that is so bad that it is so good (Caine, Gelbart and Donen) is why mourning is not a pleasant deviation. Except for Bologna, everyone involved has a low point who has to sit at night trying to find out which bomb was his bomb destroyed.
