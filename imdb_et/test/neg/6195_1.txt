Okay, I felt that the Mormon movie, the Mormons, the Mormons, would be a disaster that should wait, but I knew little how it would be so painful. The little known fact is that the Mormons have always made exceptionally fine propaganda films. The official film campaign of the Church has brought rare and lasting gems beyond the Mormon community, including the wonderful short film "Cipher in the Snow", which ended in the late 1970s as an educational film. Then Neil LaBute is a disturbingly masterful ouvre .... <br /> <br /> But the success of these films largely depended on not focusing on the Mormons or any particular Mormon theology. Instead, they decide to focus on a universal theme and deal with it on the basic human level. The "army of God" abandons any pretext of universality and runs predominantly to the orthodox passionate and myopic world. While this may be enough to transfer everyone, but the most devoted Mormon, director Richard Ductcher, is a filmmaker and his minors approach to storytelling as a reason to evaluate the "armies of God", which is almost impossible to read with almost any standard. <br /> <br /> Making your own terrible wood in the Netherlands sets the tone for your army of the least interesting Mormons you probably meet. Of course, the Dutch pathetic script has not usually given excuses. He should testify that he did not avoid some of the most controversial aspects of the Church, but, as expected, he reconciles these contradictions with the light. It should also not be surprising that most of the answers to the darker side of the church have been treated with little other than faith. At one point, a black couple of African-American missionaries rubbed into the church that was separated until 1978 (about ten to twenty years after almost all the churches were in the deepest degenerate parts of the south). Instead of dealing with the active racist history of the church, perhaps most of all with the theology of Mormon, which is not even protected by church leaders, the Dutch restlessness contemplates the murder of Joseph Smith - an obvious and perhaps outrageous hint of defeat. Pull this syrup milk cake together with the third tumbler joke that moves into a comic weapon, and you have a strong difference between reviving silent movies. <br /> <br /> If you knew little Mormons before watching this movie, you might get prone to avoid them at all costs. If you are a Mormon, this movie does not offer any pride.
