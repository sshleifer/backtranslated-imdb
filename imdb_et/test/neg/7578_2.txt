I don't know, but the movie was too similar to the other movies I've seen. Ring, eye, dark water, they're all the same for me. Don't do it wrong, it's beautifully done, lovely camera, great graphics, but this story is too ... too ordinary. Ultimately, this result, which makes you skip, you know: screaming, rumbles. The film's characters do not react very naturally, they move very slowly, surprise something they see. I know some people who love such a movie, and if you do, being a well-made movie, I think it won't hurt to watch it. But if you've seen the movie mentioned above and didn't like them, I would recommend you not to bother.
