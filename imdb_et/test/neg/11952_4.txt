This movie had all kinds of great feelings, a great love story ... a perfect, visual work, original spaces work, characters work .... but the story moves from one go to the next in the most predictable way ... no movie symbol with depth or explained by the director. Everything we know about the character of Catherine Zeta-Jones, she is obsessed with her world .... no one is allowed and no one sets her against the world ... that much is obvious .... but the rest of the characters have their dimensions that Aaron Eckhart's character had so much more to offer, but it was not allowed, Abigail Breslin's character is so easy to understand that his performance is somewhat predictable and fake .... Finally, everyone returns to the forced turbulent world of Catherine Zeta-Jones What the public has never completely fallen away .... To be honest, his turbulent world is not much more than a selfish, self-obsessed, corrupted lady who most people would not have much time or compassion in the real world. The director had to make him a hero and never do it ... in the end it is the nature of Eckhart that eventually wins because he wins. <br /> <br /> Not one bad movie, but a movie that could have been much better than deeper individuals allowed, explained, and exposed. <br /> <br /> Greetings
