I thought the film was shameful for the series. After all, Part 3 doesn't measure Part 2, and it doesn't have Daniel Sawni. Miyagi's humor was not as funny in this respect as in part 3, but it was funny to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The girl's part was pretty good. She's a missing teenager who needs direction. I find the plot hard to believe. That Aunt would just agree to leave her home and her niece, which she just met, under the care of Mr Miyagi. Of course he was his brother's friend. <br /> <br /> I appreciated the monastery. Some other reviews may suggest that I didn't like dancing monks, but I thought it was fun. It showed that they know how to have fun. Now that they were ancient Chinese monks who danced to pop music, it would have been another thing. <br /> <br /> Probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks wouldn't want to. t kill the error. Miyagi told him that the street gangs killing each other are stupid, states that are trying to destroy each other are stupid, but respect for life is not stupid. Miyagi has also expressed such wisdom in other films. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie out of 10 out of 10. Of course, I had something I liked about it. It wasn't as funny as the third part, and no character could live in Sato in part 2. This movie has no re-viewing value. I can't imagine watching it again, but it's worth it once.
