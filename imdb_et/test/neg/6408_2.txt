Not just because of this topic in the movie. What was one of the flat excuses for reminiscent of something. No. <br /> <br /> I looked at it knowing I wouldn't want it. I hate numerology. When somebody starts to get off the pattern with numbers, I feel the urge to hit them. My brain starts to hurt empathy. And knowing that this is a movie about this particular topic, I couldn't resist the desire to watch it and maybe I could laugh. But it wasn't funny. Just that stupid kind of thing: "Isn't that a completely frightening and amazingly cool? Dialogue that I was afraid of. As soon as the son started calling, I knew that this movie is anything that happens. But I hardly ever start watching the movie I started I sat through it. I enjoy the pain. <br /> <br /> The film pretends to be numbered hiding, showing how the obsession can end badly, but it drives this wave as much as it should break it. see this message. I see only the scary signs of a stylish number with little plot to justify it. <br /> <br /> Get up with the usual "surprises" - trying to get another twist to throw you out, it doesn't make sense and you almost believe this thanks to the quality of the narration and - you get one hollow movie. It just happens around the subject that I despise. If only that wasn't trying to be serious and was rather a fun movie with the actors, then I don't give it est something but i started like carrey ... even though it's not his fault he's trying. It's not even good to watch with friends and mst3k out of hell. <br /> <br /> My expectations were low enough for anyone to travel, but this movie was able to live one of the worst I've ever seen.
