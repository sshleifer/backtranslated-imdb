Now, I'll do it without putting on a spoiler if I can. My cousin and I rented movies on the second weekend, and we stumbled over when there was a big freaking on the cover. It seemed cool, so we rent it together with Kungfu. <br /> <br /> Wow ... Just ... Wow. <br /> <br /> To get started, the movie was terrible. Now the art of the box, the opening of scenes and the music are well done, but the film itself is terrible. Acting is a sub-par (Sean, leader, barely showing any emotion and / or effort by his character), peacocks don't have anything on the cover (wrong advertisement, maybe?) And camera shots and corners were a bad wrestling event. <br /> <br /> And trust me, I'm a wrestling fan. I know the cameras are bad. And to be honest, it's there with Gigli and Pootie Tang. It's so bad that I have it. It makes me laugh. So, somehow, this movie is a good comedy for me. <br /> <br /> But to be fair, it works what to do and what not to do in films, especially in Slasher. genre. I suggest people look at it to get a good idea of ​​what to avoid.
