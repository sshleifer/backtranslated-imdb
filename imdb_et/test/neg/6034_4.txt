this movie is pretty bad, aggressive, not well played, not well targeted, low budget, low quality, emotional weak and disconnected. After watching the previous comments, it went to see it, but if you try to compare it with the apocalypse now, PLATOON or some other, then really out of the traces. this film looks like a 60-year-old and purely crafted film that has grown neanderthals, not to mention (or actually), rather than paying attention to details like changing circles, small budget fireworks, and any badly filmed features. is traceable, however, if you would like to see it as an early development of movie documents .. not go back! <br /> <br /> p.s - afterall, guys are pretty good.
