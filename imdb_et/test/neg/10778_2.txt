Yawn, this is my reaction to this movie. I was really hoping that it would have been a good slasher today, but it doesn't even belong to the slashers category. Instead, it tries to be something that is not what is a psychological thriller, and it fails. Even the title "Freak" suggests that it may be interesting. Match it with the DVD cover design and think "OK, maybe I'll give it a try". Time is not worth it. <br /> <br /> The story actually starts with a little bit of interest, as a bad deformed child is tied to his head, which is linked by his fat mother. She screams at her and probably strikes her, because in one scene we see her really beat. After all, he decides that he has had enough and crushes his face (faith) stone. Today she is a crazy shelter and she is over. On his way, he breaks down from where he is and flees. Introduce 2 characters, a little girl and her older sister. They move and hit the road. So most of the movie is driving in a car that talks to each other. But the tied "Freak" is now loose and is going to rob a grueling murder! (That's I'm completely sarcastic) <br /> <br /> I can't believe this movie was boring. The budget was the smallest ever, without any special effects and a dialogue that I just wouldn't care about. This is one of those films where the package is better than the flick itself. And compare it to Halloween?! Garbage! I'm not even a fan of Halloween series (except for the third), but Halloween is much better than that. At least with Halloween we have a great score and some really horrible moments. There's virtually no music except for some piano here and there, and there's nothing scary about this movie. Perhaps this film would be better if it had a definite result, because even the worst movies are acceptable if the music is good. <br /> <br /> It's just my opinion about the movie. I thought it was just a full waist of time and money. But since the film has more than 4/10 ratings on IMDb, people like this movie. I'm not one of those people. 2/10
