Dracula 3000 is a painfully cheesy cinema image. I thought I was something pretty disgusting. What could be expected if Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio and Tiny Lister are cast? Let's just say that your expectations were broken ... <br /> <br /> If I really start, I feel this review will take a long time, so we'll keep it simple. The vampire is not even called Dracula. The Space Team carries coffins from the Transylvanian system from the Carpathian sector. In his great scene, Coolio talks about the most terrible things that film history has ever said. In 3000, all of today's standards are worn by bad clothes, they have nothing more modern than a modern wheelchair, and they adorn the neon lights that have been stolen from the roller. <br /> <br /> Up all this ... end. Dear gracious God. It doesn't deserve to be destroyed. It must be believed. <br /> <br /> I have rated this movie "1" and I wish I could give it to zero ... but I feel compelled to see you. What madness is this?
