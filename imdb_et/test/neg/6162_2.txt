They say David Duchovny took six days to write this script script. That sounds right. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst films I've seen and I've seen Gigli. It's not as bad as Gigli, but it's like saying Saddam Hussein wasn't as bad as Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> Tom Warshaw has lived in France with his French wife and 13-year-old son. She's always pretending to be French. He tells his wife that he is actually America. For some reason, it is as if a rupture occurs, despite the fact that he always commented on his man's American accent. Their son - remember, he was born in France and did not know that his father was American - speaks the perfect American English without the French accent. This is just one of many big plot holes in this movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is a setback for Tommy's young people in New York in the 1970s, as he explains to his wife why he's been hiding in France. His best friend, a boy, was Pappas, slowly an adult whom Robin Williams had terribly played. I assume that Duchovny thinks that "slowed down" is someone who is just a kind of stupid, because Pappas will come slowly slowly at times, while for the second time he comes as Robin Williams. Yes, Williams actually fits his tired improviser, although he should play a person who is spiritually slow. <br /> <br /> Tommy's mother, played by Duchovny's wife, Tea Leon, is a reed. his wife's recent death. Leoni does a good job, but he only smokes a lot and screams at Tomm for things that don't seem too important. The script did not give him much work. Tommy also interacts with a woman (whom she calls a "lady") who is in jail and gives her advice through her prison window (this detention house is called "D" house, hence the title). Tomm does not have any competitions that cite his personal problems on the city street, so this imprisoned culprit can give him advice and he does so many times. <br /> <br /> I don't want to bring you the whole movie summary, but there are plenty of pictures in this movie that try to touch too hard but come out as well, bad. Real bad. Real bad. At the end of the wreck of this train, the script goes to cornice and cornier and ends with a ridiculously endless end. <br /> <br /> Critics tore apart the "D House" and rightly so. I can't believe some people actually like this movie. It is painful to sit through the film and I felt weak after that - not emotion, but how terrible it was.
