This movie is a laugh and a half. From the first scene, where we see Mel Torme as a big, halbana leader of the Jaguar drivin muffin park (and this is itself a gigg-fest), Mamie Van Doren, now retired from the rehabilitation of an English-language teenager, finishing out of prison (errr..lugev girl, run by iron fists nuns), you can't shake your head. The production of this film is black and Mamie, who is talented to Paul Anka (all I wanted through this movie, that he was just STOP SINGING!) And forty years old teens, Dick Contino. Gloria Talbot, playing a humorous teenage girl with more than a couple of pieces (judo, not acting), saw the latter in a terrible 50s fearsome Leech Woman who had a bad hairstyle that looked like a dead woodchuck that was on the Mac broken. Mamie is a bad, bad girl - she smokes, swears, runs wildly, hits teachers and runs around with gang leaders. He throws his idiot into a Jaguar driving boy Chip (who we see in the first scene, trying to rape a blonde girl before he falls off the shore with a nice guy) and continues with Dick Contino. Whether it's a step forward for him, no one guesses. Mel appears at the party, where she is with her new beau, and accuses her of disgusting the chip. Although I'm sure he wanted to, he wasn't there. It is a foolish fight between Contino and his gang and Mel and his jazz friezes, where some badly moving moves on both sides. <br /> <br /> Mamie is sent to the girls' city, the reform school. .. bringing home the girls' friends .. Sister Iron Pants and her cousins ​​improved. He irritates the nuns (and us) by bullying, dragging each other out of their linings and just showing how bad it is. He runs quickly to Gloria Talbot, playing one of the wrong girls who gives him a carbonate to make him know. She meets Paul Anka's character (why?) Obsession with the girl. This little drop becomes his "henchman". <br /> <br /> There's a long bit of a movie where nothing happens, except Anka St. Paul shows and proves how holy it is. She sings too much in this interval until you want to hit her with her huge smoke to just keep her silent! And Mamie's little sister played by the Princess Father knew the best celebrity, inviting her to tell her she was in trouble. It turns out that it was the one who went out with Chipster, and now Meli's blackmail because he found it. There is a hysterical struggle between girls and Mel and his boys to get girls out of it. it is after the race between Mel and Dick, which is just so stupid that it understands the spirit. Overweight teenagers in this funny movie have a fabulous time that strikes through what is basically a silly, ill-written, and morally preaching film that can't achieve its goals - if its purpose is not to make you laugh out loud.
