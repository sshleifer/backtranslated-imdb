Here are other comments that express similar views, but I still feel I need to add my comments. The film is generally well made from a technical point of view, except perhaps too long. Action is usually very good, although Kevin Spacey is not given much room to explain his character motivation (more ambitious than racism), and Sandra Bullock's only function seems to be an eye-candy that he does very well. <Br /> <br /> At the core level, the heart of the film is in the right place to fight racism, and I have the impression that he was trying to have some sort of final treatment for racism, perhaps why so many famous names that were in agreement with it. But it seems that the writers are much more than they could chew (I haven't read the book, so I don't know how much it will stay with Grisham). The biggest problem, as many others have said, is that it favors vigilant justice. Not only do I disagree with this view, I do not believe that such a view would help racist resistance at all - it is more likely that white defendants who kill black victims will be implemented. Finally, the prosecutor calls on the jury (and the audience) to imagine that the raped girl was white - but follow it and imagine that the defendant is a white man who murdered black rapists ... finally the message seems to be OK to kill someone as long as you hate them. It is also convenient that the killed person was presented completely as evil, and his guilt was undoubtedly, which removes any moral uncertainty that is likely to be in the real world. <br /> <br /> Samuel L Jackson delivers excellent performance, but unfortunately it also undermines the plot - he has come across as someone with significant integrity, but it is hard to believe he would be willing to hide behind the insanity (and indeed, if he doesn't, when the pushing has come). We should probably think that this is due to the death penalty, but in fact, at one point, it has offered a murder, but if you blink, it may remain. Why not take it, given that he must know that his possibilities of acquittal are thin? Or if he wants to go to court, why ask for madness? <br /> <br /> There are also less serious errors. The medical experts whose testimony in this case allegedly relies are jokes - both are discredited for very unlikely reasons, and neither of them offers a real psychiatric diagnosis. The message seems to be that the experts say what they are asked to say, and they should not be believed. The fact that the injured policeman supports Jackson is moderately plausible, but still somewhat comfortable (and what if he was dead?) I find it hard to believe that the FAQ will travel on the street with wide daylight. Other apparently serious crimes (rebellion, arson, robbery, attempted murder) will be detected or prosecuted without a visible attempt. And the scene where the dog comes back is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> My last reaction must be left feeling dirty - as I should be racist because I disagree with the resolution. It may be that the purpose of the film was to explore different perspectives and leave the audience to decide, but if they are, they have forgotten it to the end. The film made me think about my views, read what other people are thinking about here and add their opinion so that somehow maybe it succeeded - but I worry that some people might have very vague views on what I hope this is the opposite of what he intended. <br /> <br /> The ultimate idea - try to look at the law and order, covering such issues much deeper in about 38 minutes on screen!
