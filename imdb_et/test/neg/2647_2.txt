On the dark days of 1990, it was believed that the expected successor of the Spielberg throne (after the alleged quiz Phil Joanou failed) was mistaken for Spielberg wannabe David Mickey Evans. Evans managed to fertilize the studios for more than a million dollars, breastfeeding the leaders of the baby boom to believe their scenario - combined with nostalgic references from the 1960s and a worrying drama about child abuse - somehow equated good storytelling and decent film. <br /> <br /> As Rod Stewart once sang, "see how wrong you can be." <br /> <br /> But the beginner's artistic-fartsy, "ET" -necessary script convinced enough people he was next selected - the new spielberg - and so agreed not only to buy the script more money than 99 percent of the world the population never sees in their lifetime, but that Evans also directs the film - though he would never have guided his life. Hey, how hard is it to be another movie genius? <br /> <br /> Two weeks after shooting, Columbia discovered. His newspapers were called "totally unusable" in the studio or at least those that were high enough not to stay in E.N. (Emperor's New Clothes). All of his footage was demolished and recovered for the guitar. <br /> <br /> So what was the studio after dropping $ 10 or $ 20 million into what they still believed were Steven Spielberg's resurrection? Hire Spielberg himself to save the day? Columbia has probably tried it. <br /> <br /> Enter old Prof. Richard Donner. Hey, he may not be a cinematic genius, but he gets this job. After all, "Superman" wasn't too bad - and the first "Lethal Weapon" was pretty good. <br /> <br /> So Donner comes in and grabs the guide rings. Fortunately, he succeeds in persuading Columbia that the worst thing about the film is inaccurate fantasy stories that should have been like a ten-year-old acid trip. Unfortunately, he leaves Crying Buffalo (oh, poetic) and ridiculous, from the end of the pseudo-Spielberg fantasy, with Clueless's mother for the rest of his life, to get his missing son's postcards when he is surrounded by the world's red wagon. Right. <br /> <br /> But Donner managed to achieve a decent performance from Elijah Wood. And Lorraine Bracco's mother was not bad either. Perhaps Donner should be reassessed. Perhaps he is not such a fake Hollywood hacking as everyone has always believed. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give it over-cooked failure is that someone was smart enough to cast a big John Heard (of course, in the wrong part). Children are okay ... even though Tom Hanks's terrible, over-explaining narrative almost destroys every scene he is invading. <br /> <br /> You might think that after the worlds of David Mickey Evans and Phil Joanous and Troy Duffys, the studios may end up wisely. It can be hoped that these hype-oriented filmmakers can prevent the emperor's new fabric syndrome from reappearing with his ugly head. <br /> <br /> No doubt!
