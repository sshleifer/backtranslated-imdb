Looking at all 29 years old, Rob Lowe is the detective responsible for investigating the murder. <br /> <br /> When the wife of a social woman (Leslie Hope) is dead, the police suspect that a rich chick may be doing something about it. Enter Rob, who is just falling under the widow, though he says he's just trying to be "helpful." Rob is such a good cop, he can hide some of his accusing love letters in his pocket before he accidentally throws them into the fireplace. Monotonous dark drama with endless background drone. <br /> <br /> This is a good substitute if you have used Sominex.
