Concept: Show four families of different ethnic origins in the L.A Fairfax district, preparing for a family reunion at Thanksgiving. I loved Soul Food and how to make an American quilt {I think there is a law that Alfre Woodard must have in all these films), which, like a family tradition, offered a pasty and was ready for treatment. Instead, I felt cheated. They donate about 40+ characters, and all but two are one-off clich√©s with no finish. Writers and directors should spend a few more years learning about life and learning how the loving people of different generations actually come into contact. Instead, you have a bunch of ** holes assembled in Turkey during the day to act as extra unpleasant ** holes. Now it is thanks to the Thanksgiving. But it's not wrong. And why bothered Julianne Marguiles, giving her absolutely nothing. It was a chore to go through, and Mercedes Ruehl is extraordinary, but I'll give it 4/10.
