I loved this movie 10 years ago when I was about 16 years old. My biggest mistake was to look at it 10 years later. This is not the worst "I-wanna-be-a-pilot" movie, but it has so many flaws that hardly can be forgotten. <br /> <br /> Queen 'One Vision' (with the rest of the soundtrack) makes this movie better than the usual patriotic mess you usually see;) <br /> <br /> [**** ----- -]
