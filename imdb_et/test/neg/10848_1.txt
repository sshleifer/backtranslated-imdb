Don't buy this movie for the comedy value, as I did, I didn't find it a little funny, but both f ****** unhappy and flat are incredible. I gave it to Christmas Day, which was pretty funny (on my side). I recently heard that he looked at it and told me what I am **. <br /> <br /> Nothing is more frustrating than watching an illuminated, dramatic, poorly scanned scene where the camera is sitting on a tripod and not moving ... the movie is really pathetic, and I can only say that DONT watches it movie !! !!!!!!!
