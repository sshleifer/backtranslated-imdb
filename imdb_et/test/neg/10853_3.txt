Very bad film, clich√©s and amalgam of historical inaccuracies. Some examples: In the early stages, the Germans attack the Soviet infantry; Instead of staying in their trenches to shoot at them, they move to the ground to fight against them, as opposed to all infantry tactics; Kate, one of the central characters, is said to be a White Russian daughter and her Russianness is obsessed, but she does not speak Russian; the guilt of the German airman is attacking an anti-aircraft weapon, but the gun does not come in shrapnel shells, but appreciates a direct blow on its plane, which does not seem like a German plane in the Second World War. In justice, if they can escape from the uneven plot and the absurdity of it, there are some really powerful moments - depicting people who are slowly starving to death is convincingly made and moving, but they only show the rest. Avoidable film.
