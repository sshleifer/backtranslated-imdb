I had been impressed by this film as an eight-nine-year-old child. The Gangsters seemed very real to me and threatened, and I saw why people were afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical thanks to the excessive narrations and details like the cars of thirty gangsters that looked like they were in the fifties. The way in which criminals are depicted is a sharp, unforgettable reality, but the overall effect is rather a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny little thing with me is the scene where Ma Barker and his sons shoot it with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something, "Maybe at this point, I became Barker a real mother". It is meant for a moment of great tragedy and sin, because I finally understand how he ruined his family's greed, but it provokes laughter. A very strange film that is rarely shown these days. Gangster movie fans can enjoy it, but more than curiosity as a true movie.
