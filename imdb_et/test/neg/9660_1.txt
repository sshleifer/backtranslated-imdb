Just in case the title doesn't give it away - this movie is garbage. <br /> <br /> A Brief Overview? Yes, yes. <br /> <br /> I decided to spend so much time writing this review when Hollywood probably decided to put the script. I doubt it will be published, given how badly I have worded everything, but if it is and someone reads it - stay on the first Sandlot movie. It completely transcends its predecessors in every way. The conclusions are never worth buying or seeing, and all those involved in making them should be ashamed of destroying what must be the classic and original film of our childhood.
