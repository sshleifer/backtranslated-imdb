Not even the original plot. Ho hum. There were a couple of corners that could have been quite interesting, but the film follows 90% of Hollywood movies. I don't really "get" Samuel Jackson in most of his time ever since he was pretty good in this movie. He rarely screamed and went much further than his own, not to return to his face of anger. I liked Eva Mendes - as usual - and while she is a big eye, she proves to be much more than an actor. Luis Guzman was actually very good, except that I didn't want to change his character to Samuel Jackson at the end of the movie. How can one remember the former policeman in the middle of his character, and then become a fool of the second second? Isn't there any sense in Hollywood?
