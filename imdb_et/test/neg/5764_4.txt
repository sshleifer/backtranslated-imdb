A group of friends discover gold deep inside the old mine. But gold and I thought they'd hit it up, they wake up for a long dead miner, Hell Bent protecting his treasure. "Miners Massacre" is an extreme scary b-horror movie. You have all of your familiar clich√©s, your intellectually disturbed teens, people who leave to explore strange sounds, some pop fears, a mysterious sheriff, an old lady who all thinks there are nuts. -Verified Karen Black Not Less) and so on. However, this is done in a fun, non-pretentious fashion that makes the movie meaninglessly "as bad as it is". Characters and dialogue are familiar, common and common films. Participants do a decent job, considering that I've actually seen movies with a lower budget than doing this type of action (I know what you did last summer, nobody?) And add some credibility to the movie itself. The 49'er of this film is obviously derived from Jeepers Creepers' mountain bike, to a brown coat, a hat and a long white coat. Like a miner, he never speaks, and is undying. I think Gore is a bit disappointing. There are a couple of pretty terrible moments, but too much of the screen off and death scenes are often ridiculous (Spoiler front!). There's a really fun moment when a girl gets decapitated by this guy, and to get this "effect", the filmmakers hid under the coat of the actress's body, swelling their head, and put some fake on their neck. Seriously, you saw the outline of your shoulders! I think they could have done a little better there, even if the budget was small (and I'm sure it was, but still?). Special effects are cheap but effective enough and mostly moderately well done for low budget movies. Both consequences for the guys or the director seem to be for explosions and fire. At the end of almost every movie, there are at least a couple of characters burning (always filmed slowly) or SOMETHING exploding, be it a car or an old cave. Seriously, no one ever heard the word; "Stop, Fall and Roll"!?!?!? <br /> <br /> "Miners Massacre" (Or "Forty Ninety Curse" whatever you want to call it) is fun and stupid, though entertaining and as long as you don't have expectations through the roof, you have enough entertainment . <br /> <br /> I feel generous, so give it 4/10.
