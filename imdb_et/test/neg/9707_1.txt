If you have never heard of Jane Austen, seen the original movie or the 1995 BBC adaptation, or even seen the book's pop-up, then this classic love story may be vaguely resilient. <br /> <br /> From the open scene, this movie must be remembered for its dreadful action, terrible disturbances and the complete absence of Jane Austen's classic mindset. great Judi Dench) who has probably never heard of Jane Austen, let alone read her, should be punished! Keira Knightley grimaces and smiles through each scene and met so unpleasant that no one wants to marry her! Darcy looked to try to commemorate his films for the whole movie and the rest of Bennet's girls were interchangeable because they didn't show their characters as they were originally written. <br /> <br /> This version did not show the true pride and prejudice that both Darcy and Elizabeth suffered, and the longest two hours of my life, who took care of whether they got together or not! Absolutely exhausting - even Judi Dench's too little minutes will not save this garbage. I don't mean to say anything good to this movie except that it finally ended!
