Cameron Crowe's very strange scenario (followed by his "Fast Times Ridgemont High" concerts) has little inspiration and fools on foolish tracks. At least on the Fast Times, there was a fair share of satire and sensitivity behind their good signs (the unquestionable aspiration of a good director, Amy Heckerling and Crowe to record adult adult speech); here is Chris Penn (Seaman's brother, natch) who makes life a hollow arrow for hell Eric Stoltz and filmmakers think he's fun. Jenny Wright has some good moments in the mall, but Illan Mitchell-Smith has lost his head-scratched sub-block of service that seems to be fascinated by an ex-soldier. A shameful, confusing mess that gave a shiny glow and a soundtrack full of pop-rock tracks, but characters that could be hoped to avoid. Supporters Lea Thompson, Rick Moran, Lee Ving and Sherilyn Fenn are wasted in stupid roles. * from ****
