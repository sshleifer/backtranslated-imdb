I would have given this film a one-star vote if it hadn't been laughed. Some dialogues were just so flat that they laugh! How can anyone talk like that. Not to mention the fact that bodyguard Major (Antonio Sabato Jr.) flew to 747 as the pro and Michael Pare team of crews were able to dig a gasoline-filled trench and blow up a huge stone at a point in time. Has anyone noticed a "glory on the island of fantasy" where the man said, "Boss, plane!" Michael Pare is just like 747 in the eye. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace was cute girls and even smarter female hijackers. Not to mention that the main hijacker deserves to die a flat death, which he did to be such a joker! Imagine you fleeing when you are only involved in "cross stroke" shooting. Bad. <br /> <br /> Poor pilot probably died on an airplane when everyone ate steak and rum !! Just laugh, they should make a sequel to show us how they spend the night at the Neptune Atoll in the middle of the 3rd Hurricane. Did I hear Michael Pare calling it "the best honeymoon resort in the Pacific". Now it makes an interesting movie !!
