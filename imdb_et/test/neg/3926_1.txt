Performances are better than what I have done in this work, simply because I do not support a movie that shows a child or a person who has been challenged to get drugs into their body, eat and inject. <br /> <br /> This is a nasty movie that has no purpose in the world, but a glamor and legitimacy of a narcotic lifestyle. He has convincing performances that add to my disgust. What did these people think?! I couldn't enjoy such a movie. It is enough for someone who has never done drugs to think about it and for those who have redeemed and redeemed themselves, consider returning. I'm surprised that it doesn't make every clean junkie who sees it dropped from the wagon. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good about this "movie", which is rather a summoned document. drama. This is a Hollywood false manifestation. <br /> <br /> Extremely nasty. <br /> <br /> It determines 1.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend:.
