The film is moving quite well, but action, direction and editing leave much to be desired. Characters are mostly raised from other movies and the appearance of Vinnie Jones is out of Gone within 50 seconds. Comedy gangster movie is a genre that should have lots of contrasts, foolish dealers, foolish dealers and shooting that leaves everyone dead. You should never know whether to laugh or just sit there in shock. This movie was the right elements, but it is too easy to sit like a person knitting and knitting small details that should have been fixed somewhere along the line and if faith is stopped one just has become increasingly critical. It is a pity that it was a bold attempt and although Clint Eastwood is famous for being a scene for the scene, he puts his work before he fires and he is Clint Eastwood. There would be a bit more imagination in the camera and a little more instructing and submitting samples for the delivery of lines to a big difference.
