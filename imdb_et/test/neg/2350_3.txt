First, let me explain. This movie is a real garbage, but even though it is a real garbage, it is a better garbage than it might have been. It could have been sucked in a big time, but it is not ... <br /> <br /> This movie was not, for example, frightening moments, good acting and a good script. It wasn't much fun either. But the film had cool music, fancy locations and hot girls. It also works great as a Dracula attack. (I hope it meant that, though I don't really believe it) <br /> <br /> The story focuses on three Transylvanian girls, awakening an old vampire, which then terrorizes and kills girls one by one. Sounds familiar? Yes, so it does! <br /> <br /> After reading this, you might think I should have given it a better vote. The reason I don't do that is that I felt almost asleep at some points ...
