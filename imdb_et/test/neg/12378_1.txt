This is one terrible movie! Some people told me that this is not really bad, but I definitely do not agree! The monster is amazingly cheap (and funny), but that's something we all knew. In addition, dialogues are terrible and writing is just terrible. <br /> <br /> It's as bad as the quality of entertainment. Not always for good reasons, but it's good "so bad that it's fun". By the way, there is no such thing as "La Castagne". According to the secondary nature of Pierre (a film in French in the Canadian language), among French Canadians, the legend is a giant castle known as "La Castagne". As a French Canadian, I can assure you that I have never heard of such a legend. It certainly made me laugh ... :))
