Jack Lemmon was one of the best actors ever to decorate the screen. He can easily easily go from dramatic roles to comedy, making most of his peers greedy. Although his performance "Save The Tiger" is Oscar-worthy, I feel that it was given to him because he had missed his other opportunities to win the prize with the other, better role that had preceded it. <Br>> <br /> It is also one of those pretentious films that come out to show the talents of a cast or, in this case, one particular member. It is too bad if the scriptwriter's output did not match Lemmon's. Don't waste your time with it.
