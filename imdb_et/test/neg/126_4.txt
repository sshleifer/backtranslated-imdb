Worth the value of renting, especially if you like movies. It has ordinary caravans, a fight with the great Van Damme kick-style, battles with 40 load ships and even terrorist-style bombs. All this is entertaining and professionally handled, but there is nothing that really strikes you when you have seen your part before. <br /> <br /> The plot is interesting for rabbit engagement, which is smart but hardly deep. Many characters are strongly stereotyped - an angry veteran, a frightened illegal alien, crooked policemen, indifferent fans, a devil's harsh woman, a curved politician, a fat federal who looks like he was a master class as a Mexican Hollywood movie from the 1940s. Everything was passive, but again something special. <br /> <br /> I thought the main villains were pretty well done and quite well. By the end of the movie, you knew for sure who were good and who were not. There was an emotional lift, because your deserts were really bad. Very simple, but then you didn't expect Hamlet, right? The only thing I found really annoying was the constant cutting of VD's daughter during the last fighting phase. <br /> <br /> Not bad. Not good. Passable 4.
