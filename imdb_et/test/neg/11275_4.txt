For some movies it is really hard to tell whom they are made for. Huevos de oro seems to be targeting a well-educated middle class in Spain. There must be a lot of internal jokes in this movie that you do not understand when you are a foreign artist. It can be quite annoying. <br /> <br /> Symbols and references to art and popular culture are abundant, the film refers to the work of Salvador Dali, Luis Buñuel and general surrealist. point to Duchamp's completed practice.
