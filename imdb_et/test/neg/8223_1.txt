Garden State was at best a mediocre film. The film seems to be a collection of ideas that the writer (Zach Braff) was, not a single story. An isolated plot may have been more interesting if it was not confused with meaningless scenes that were nothing more than "peculiar". Randomly, these scenes are often the ones that are broadcast in the conversation (Zack walks by bypasses when he passes, crazy underworld competition, shouting into the abyss, the list goes on). <br /> <br /> The main character is flat, unleashed and ultimately unlikely to be the most in the show where he talks to his dad, ignoring fathers' problems, including his recently dead wife, and dragging his own "What do I do for me with life? "The film ends when Andrew (Zach Braff) decides to go back to LA because he can't break his love of life, Sam (Natalie Portman), whom he has known for 2 days. This can only lead to the conclusion that the film's message is that love at first glance heals work-related dilemmas ... Of course you could interpret it as a misuse of priorities, but if so, it could have been better. Much better. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. Drama, comedy, teenage-wilderness movie or other stuff game. I am not saying this as a genre-oriented person, but as a person who loves multiple genres, such as Stanley Kubrick. The reason I feel it doesn't work for Garden State is because it jumps around instead of mixing genres; one scene is one genre, the other one is back and forth, so on. as director, writer and management organization. Impressive because it was the first movie I think could make as much money as he could. For the first time, the directors of feature films have been much better (Michel Gondry "Human Nature", David Gordon Green "George Washington"). Perhaps, if he had stayed in writing OR to lead or act, it would have been better. Zach Braff is a talented performer, perhaps his second attempt is not so annoying and scattered.
