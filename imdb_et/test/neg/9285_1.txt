I saw it on a small channel late at night and put it to laugh or two. Martin Lawrence is a good comic artist and thought he might be a good stand-up comedian / actor in Richard Pryor's style. <br /> <br /> I would not have been wrong anymore. This concert was terrible. It was full of racist comments directed at white people, Muslims and Indian people (Muslims and Indians are the same thing in Lawrence's narrow mind) and rambling, clich√©d tourism philosophy (Lawrence, like many black comics and directors, can't resist Do we really need a lecture on Martin Luther King and the struggle for civil rights during a stand-up comedy show?). Then his visual comment aimed at attracting her to the women made me listen to my skin again. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the show was not just funny and I found it boring. I turned halfway and turned back to find him still preaching or continuing and the birth of my child (there was no humor in the story of his child's birth and it was self-conscious for him) He gave us details, but obviously he didn't have much to say or he would have cut it off). <br /> <br /> This show was garbage: Runteldat!
