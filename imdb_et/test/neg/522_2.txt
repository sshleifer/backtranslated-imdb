Okay, I had to proclaim this sound ... Like a huge spirit son, I just sat through this movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> Note that IMDB points out that 747 lifting parts were borrowed from a 1977 airport. It does not reflect the surface ... Almost all the exterior of the plane that peeles the ocean, lands, sinks and even-grabs are borrowed from the airport '77. All of the "lifting" shots are pulled out of '77, including most internal flooding flags, except for Dennis Weaver's drowning. I couldn't wonder if Olivia Dehavilland could swim or "dead" at any time Tom Tom. Another Eye-Roll: The name of Dennis Weaver in this film is Stevens, which compensates for the fact that Airport '77 is owned by Stevens Corporation (of course led by Jimmie Stewart). <br /> <br /> is a real fishy gambler who doesn't work much, or at least hasn't worked for a while, which could have been the first idea that it will be a real stinker. <br /> <br /> This movie was rated 2 - It's pretty worth "1", but if this movie doesn't offer any other redemption, at least someone helped Coolio, Max Caulfield, Nicolle Eggert and Dennis Weaver do their own Cars Month!
