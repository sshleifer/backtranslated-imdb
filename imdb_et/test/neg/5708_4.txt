A woman engaged in art starts a passionate love affair with a man named John. They love wherever they go, and they play sexual games. I had a problem they did. There was no plot for this movie or I just didn't see it. Hot erotic passion was the best thing about this movie, but I wanted something else to happen. Perhaps he could have been a sequential killer or had a secret. I just needed something and all that was there was a lot of love scenes. Not just that was bad or something, I just wanted to do more things in the movie. Maybe my colleague was sleeping with him. Something! I was very upset that it was all there was. Mickey Rourke was so hot then. I don't know what happened.
