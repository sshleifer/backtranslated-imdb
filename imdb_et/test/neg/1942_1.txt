It is by far the worst and stupid TV show. It is almost physically painful to look at an adult (well in his twenties) who does nothing but tortures and mocks his parents, who do not always seem to have a clue what is so eternally exhausted when they are forced to endure their dim son and equally stupid friends. Of course I know his parents are inside, but I hate how they always behave as they are surprised. It looks fake through and out. And I really hate the introduction of the exhibition, where the voice asks: "Bam Margera, what does he think next?!?!" (I think this is the way it is), and Bam himself says, "Whatever f ^ * k I want!" - WOW! Bam is really a lifter of hell - lives at home with mom and dad! - Of course, the word "f ^ * k" is replaced by a tasty beep, but we get the message. Bam is a real rebel - at least in his own eyes. Of course, Bam and his fervent breeds are trying to be a teenage boys' audience and of course this is an MTV show, but please raise the bar a bit. It is painfully predictable and stupid, and so is nothing but boring.
