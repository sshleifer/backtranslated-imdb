Well ... there were some big, creamy-smooth facial images of Marlene with her "shocking" sex-bender clothing (plus her unforgettable "transmogrification" from monkey to man); in general, a generally insecure plot and a dated actor - not to mention the fact that Miss Dietrich's "baritone" voice music is less involved - little to ensure that Blonde Venus has a permanent place in the pantheon of memorable films in my mind. Cary Grant - still in cinematic childhood - seemed to be looking for "forever" forever, while Herbert Marshall was unlikely to be anything but Herbert Marshall's birthday until the day he died. Of course, from a historical point of view, Blonde Venus was fun to watch as long as someone could leave ... "high expectations".
