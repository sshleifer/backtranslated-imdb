"Garden State" is one of those "indie" type images that allegedly attack production results to give the audience a real real life drama. Strangely enough, production is very good, so there are performances (actors with some quite big names). In the absence of a picture, Zach Braff is in a manuscript that seems to have been mostly killed by situations from other films. <br /> <br /> If you are as young as Braff, you have not really lived enough to use the experience as a movie feed. Braff's experience seems to be watching movies, then repeating the same movie clip. In Garden State, he plays Andrew Largeman, a successful Hollywood actor who returns to his hometown of New Jersey to bury his mother, who took his life in a wheelchair for many years. It seems he has no sense of it; he has no relationship with his father, who accuses him of his mother's bad accident because he is six years old and has no particular disdain for losing his mother (actually staying with the party right after the funeral) what his friend called him works as a graveyard in a cemetery). It all smells strongly of "beautiful girls", as well as a man who returns to his hometown to "find himself" and hang with his old friends, a small "normal person" thrown to the side. <br /> <br /> It is a miracle that Braff could attain in his life because he gave his father and his useless friends (I'm surprised he didn't kill himself) who still live their lives. as if they were still in high school, buggy bumbling, drinking and drugs, etc. None of them even recognizes her on her TV as a "braked upside" (Natalie Portman's character, the most knowledgeable person in the movie) says things like "Hey, I remember you from a younger year". These men are such losers, for whom watching television is a cultural leap. Even one friend who made millions who invented the quiet Velcro has no real reason to live because his entire frame of reference is high school and partying. And you don't need big money for a party like a high school graduate. <br /> <br /> Braff, this has appeared, is a highly treatable, still holding "feeling" and doing something like an adult. Then he meets Sam (Natalie Portman) with a kind of lost girl, who gives pet funerals and lives with her mother, like a 10-year-old, in a bedroom that looks like a pink dollhouse blown up to life. Anyway, they fall in love and Braff learns again. Clichés come quickly and fiercely. Braff has a long delayed heart-to-heart talk with his cold, distant father and tells him what it is and the name of the game. In one scene, Braff and Portman are in a millionaire child's house playing with a giant fireplace, and a bit routine, so the usual movie-schtick, I swear, I waited for someone to walk around and throw a comb. In another, Braff visits a doctor (Ron Liebman) to get his spam again and Liebman tells him (the film's worst line) "The body can play tricks for you. I found my former best friend's cufflinks in my wife's wallet and I had no erections for a year and a half. "Obviously, no licensed doctor would say it, but this is a dirtbag poem, Braff's quarrel, I think his loser friends, so they know he's still thinking about them like" 37 "jokes in" Clerks "was Kevin Smith nodded your dirtbug friends. <br /> <br /> In any case, Braff finds true happiness and leaves the trop; The story plays predictably. But if you have a film that is a cliché between the wall and the wall, at least give it some charming performances to breathe life into it. And Braff does. He has the right kind of freedom, casual approval to make his role both circulated Andrewna both real and real, and Natalie Portman (also Beautiful Girls) gives the film a big lift. With his tiny features and trembling mood expressions, he steals almost a picture of his travel companion. Jean Smart is surprisingly good at Portman's mother, and Peter Saarsgard (though much better at "Shattered Glass") is a frightening friend. I would recommend "Garden State" if you can't get enough of the movies, but when people start it as masterpieces, they're just helpless. Braff thinks you can take the same old tired plot, write a few "f ** ks" and "awesomes" and capture acoustic rock music and it drives the material. This is not.
