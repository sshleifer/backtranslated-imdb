This "movie" and I say it lightly, is nothing but a clean trash. I'm sorry for those people who actually wasted their money to see it in theaters. I saw a friend's screening and I've been sorry since then. Like a black woman, I'm extremely embarrassed to see it. What's more, I am very scared that people of other races have seen it and may believe that it is the behavior of black people in general. It is full of stereotypes of all nationalities and sexes, horribly vulgar coarse jokes and flat single-liners, which were somewhat disrupted by well-known Afro-American comedians, who should have known this script better to read! I also have to mention many rap and hip-hop singers / rappers who live the movie, as it was too long for a music video --- they didn't have any place in the movie. I think they were "Jiving & Singing Minstrels?" HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> "Writers" and the producers who were stupid about funding this "movie" should all be shot or locked in space and forced to watch this mess for the rest of their lives. DO-NOT-WATCH-THIS-MOVIE !!! Time is lost in your life so you can never come back.
