INFERNO starts with a relatively impressive TVM star design. We also introduce a scientist who named Heller. Don't you get it? Heller, Hell-er, Inferno. So I think somebody had some intelligence in the production. But it is becoming more and more evident when TVM is advancing that intelligence has been thrown away throughout the storyline in order to appeal to the American TVM audience. a tough liberal teacher who is trying to save a housewife from a crime, a doctor who has lost his healing license, and so on. In fact, the story focuses much more on these characters than the upcoming catastrophe, that all potential tensions and drama that the scenario could have soon been smoking is TVM, and we just know it's not down. what i noticed and what is always where there is an explosion, with a massive fireball that seems ridiculous, not to mention the physically impossible. Look at the scene where the national guard is in the battle. The soldier burns a block of grenades and the whole building explodes with a fireball. What a small grean that doesn't contain more than a few ounces of high explosive can do it! No, it can't. There's also another army of engineers, blowing dust with a plastic explosive and the same fire effect. Can the directors remember that high explosion is not the same as napalm <br /> <br /> Having said that I found INFERNO very observable for TVM and I never found that I wanted to turn it off. It had some potential and let me repeat the special effects, taking into account the budget, and it's not as bad TVM as some people do
