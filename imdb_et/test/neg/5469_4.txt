When buying cigarettes, a professional dancer Daniel (Tom Long) is abducted and forced to perform three days of kinky sex for many days. When released, the chair of his company Isabel (Greta Scacchi) has already replaced him and his girlfriend gives him a cold reception. Disrupted and humiliated, Daniel leaves the dance company and is obsessed with finding robbers. Daniel has sex with many women he suspects as a kidnapper. <br /> <br /> "Revelation" is a strange film that has a promising start that loses its original power and becomes somewhat too long for erotic soap or soft-porn. The production is stylish, the DVD cover is fantastic, but the characters are not well developed and Daniel's trauma seems to be excessive because most men are fantasizing about the dream situation he had put forward? to Make Three Sexy Women a Sexual Object Melabramatic development with Isabel's disease does not add any value to the plot; the open conclusion is very disappointing and there is no explanation for the motif or title of women. It is very clear that the man in the scenario was written by a woman. It was good to see more beautiful Greta Scacchi and her make-up at the end is impressive. In Portuguese there is a speech that can be translated into English as follows: "If rape is inevitable, relax and come." Daniel should have done this and saved me from watching almost two hours of meaningless story. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Livro das Revelações" (Revelation Book)
