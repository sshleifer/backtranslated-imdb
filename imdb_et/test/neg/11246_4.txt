... it's not just the cost of a movie ticket. What these filmmakers have done cannot be properly called film making; rather, they chose only a somewhat diverse student from the sixteen (though not quite a lot of diversity as the reviews have suggested) and set them apart. The results are brutally honest, much more often boring, self-conscious, burnt and finely sharp than truly insightful. possible only in documentary, but in general there is not much more truth than in "Bully" or because it is a decent TV documentary that is the same. Although the film is full of sexual and sexual diversity and racism, it does not bring anything to the table that would benefit everyone who has seriously thought about some of these issues. And while certain segments do not provide any other purpose than just a little (certainly welcome) comic, the five minute limit is mostly emotionally against any student. An interesting idea, but CHAIN ​​CAMERA has thumbs down.
