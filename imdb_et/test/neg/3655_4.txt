The man mentioned that he complained about his life for 1.5 hours, I can't distinguish it. The film started as a class project camera and came into a dark room. when girls, where magically appeared naked there, everywhere, I know I write a script or say something about it. But it's like a bad remake copy of a poorly finished harvest. Think of the person who actually wrote this story, sick. This is really a shocking film speed that says its horror does not. It's just brutal and violence that is sick to me. It's really frustrating to watch a movie without an end, with its similar clutter on your face. The movie is done now when you can go home. <br /> <br /> cons-cam-lighting (though I think it was supposed to be) -dispecific <br /> <br /> concentration on your face - activation was, in my opinion, good - it sucks Generally Film is not the taste of my movie that witer wanted us to know that these things were happening, and the man wrote his little fantasy. When did you ever see the movies? they all had a nice moment in it to keep. It? no it is not. Maybe she just tells me it's too soft, but this movie made me tremble and the story is a real short, sick man killing girls slowly. But the actors shot you in this movie every shot you could almost feel. <br /> <br /> And frankly, was it a terrible, quick judge? it is not. this is a real example of being real as it can get. But don't look at this movie if you expect a big secret or a real plot or even some story. The man gets the daughters in a dark room and kills one by one, it's really.
