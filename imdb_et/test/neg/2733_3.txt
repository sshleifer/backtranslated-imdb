Terry Cunningham manages this Sci-Fi network original. Not all in the state of Washington and Oregon; volcanic eruptions and earthquakes threaten to fall off most of the Pacific Ocean. In an attempt to keep the world from ecological devastation, a team of scientists led by Dr. Jake Rollins (Luke Perry) is taking a massive earth drill called "Mole" to chew his earth's crust to the core of the nucleus to avoid threatening death. The technical dialogue does not really help the film. Action is flat, but Perry has always been rejected. You can only blame him. Others cast: Michael Dorn, Adam Frost and Michael Teigen
