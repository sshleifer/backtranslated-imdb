This film lacks heart and soul; it is an attempt to win the cult film from the departure of other, better directors, mainly David Lynch and Tim Burton. Rifkin seems to think that if he overwhelms the visual visual style in some way and fills the rage and garbage of the street, he makes a statement. But this is not a statement of anything - except for the director's gentle accusation "HEY LOOK AT ME! I am ARTIST, TOO." But he does not have the artist's imagination but a good memory of the things that worked - like some of the participants in it - for the other directors. All of this would be almost acceptable if this film was not a thoughtful and boring chore.
