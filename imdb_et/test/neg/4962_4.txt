I am a German student because I am sorry to finally make mistakes (I'm working on it;)) <br /> <br /> Stylish very interesting with converted and effective sound effects that emphasized the dramatic action of drama, in no way changing the terrible bad actors (insecure) and unnatural movements and expressions of feelings) and makes a relatively strange and meaningless story less good. Just a common genre, which is a very strange activity. Many side-games partially destroy the main story and let the viewers end in the dark, create strangeness, and suggest that deeds and mindsets are simply considered. This is definitely a hit for fans, but not for me. But while the interesting style of film art and the adeptly use of light is well established. <br /> <br /> So not the best ...
