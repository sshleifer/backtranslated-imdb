In 2001, Eric Roberts was probably not the best year. Both Raptor and it came out. I looked at Raptor some time ago and really thought he was sucking and was Eric's worst. But it was fun and the D standard. It has nothing. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Thomas is probably the name of the worst actor these days. The story lacks any impact, and the whole thing seems even slower than the shattering snail. <br /> <br /> Two outstanding things are Martin Kove and Eric Roberts. You can claim that their efforts are good or what is, but compared to the rest, they are extremely critical. <br /> <br /> I say Roberts will see you next time (and hopefully better).
