Yes Pigeon and Coburn are big and interesting to watch them, although Coburn seems quite modest and boring here. It's nice to see Seattle, Victoria and Salt Lake City in the 1970s and the car and clothing period. It's all that boring movie. Dialogue is incredibly bad, as are most actors. Ray and Sandy's motivation seems to be forced and unlikely. I've seen this "training to be a handkerchief" many times before. There is a long structure that brings something. Better to catch the episode of "San Francisco Streets" or one of the many big crimes / capricious movies. With some names, there is a Bedtime Story, which has been rebuilt with Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, The Lavender Hill Mob, The Grifters, Paper Moon, The Sting, and best of all, House of Games.
