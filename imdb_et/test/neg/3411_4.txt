The first of three Aztec Mummies films is the only one that, according to my knowledge, was never completely duplicated in English. The movie was cut and used by pieces in other movies like Jerry Warren (he combined it with another Mexican horror comedy with Lon Chaney to make a funny werewolf. And it appeared in Maya's mummy attack and elsewhere.) The longest part of the film, the good piece of this movie two later movies that use it on the flash. On the plot of this film, there is a scientist who conducts a regression test of earlier life, which causes his subject to return and the hidden chambers to be discovered in the Aztec pyramid. The group, like the nervous figure known as Batina, hope to use the information to find hidden treasure. Instead, they discover a living mummy with other plans. This film has too long and long curves to maintain its 80-minute driving time (worse, if the mummy doesn't even see for up to an hour). Probably the least of the three films, its easy to understand why this movie was cut, this is the only way to create a non-sleep inducing film. Watching the movie last night I found myself awake awake. It was a tough nature and I found that I reached the point where the mummy was showing. Considering the choice I take and watching two other movies.
