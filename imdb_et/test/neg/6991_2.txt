I liked this movie. Of course, the actor was flat, there was no plot, and the villain was flat, what I've seen. Michael Bernardo, when Dante is worth, laughs by himself, incredibly funny and laughing. But it's worth seeing, just because WORST is an explosion you will ever see outside of the Power Rangers TV series. You know it when you see it. Frankly, this movie must be a low-quality porn budget. I stopped watching for almost an hour, but I recommend looking through the whole thing; at least there are many eye candy all to enjoy. Recommended for viewers who have a big deviation from bad movies.
