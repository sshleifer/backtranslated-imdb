When Kristy Swanson attacks the culprits for what he does, he wants. Unfortunately, Madsen is her direct superior in a company where "two weeks notice is not an option." <br /> <br /> As a vampire for teenage killing, Kristy did a great job. The orga's girl was fit. But if the assassin has run ... well, press Kristy. Run, run away! This movie is not a concept that hasn't been done before, but it's done better! <br /> <br /> I didn't want to watch the rest of the movie, but I felt like I should like to review this movie. I've always liked Madsen and her character was a bit predictable, but this movie was definitely a waste of time to watch and do ... it's no wonder she never left the theater!
