There's a good story that is well hidden and never used! The film is short and too dependent on action and thematic photography; somehow has forgotten the character and story. What is left is confusing and superficial. Turn your brain out and see that you will probably find that time passes fast, but if you are not the one who finds the soaps deeply and in essence, you will not get real satisfaction with this movie. <br /> <br /> See only if you have nothing better to do and then only when someone else pays for video rental.
