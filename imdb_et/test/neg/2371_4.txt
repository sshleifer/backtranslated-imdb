Leonard Rossiter and Frances de la Tour wear this film, not without a fight, because the script was obviously bouncing together with old episodes. When it comes out, it must be a real disappointment, because it is also done in the budget for bus tickets. Attempts to take it out of the house - which is spamming, bad work all around - with picnic, fantasy, rugby and boxing in the local gym just doesn't work. Most of them are simply the settings of the characteristic light for a lonely, not particularly good gag. This means that the interaction between Rossiter and de la Tour (and anyone with him) is mostly fun; they even manage to make a soda siphon gag, but you can see the fight for the recycling of a literally unnecessary script that makes the plot halfway. Don Warrington has very little work except for "black," and Christopher Straul is at least twice the character because of the random script. And finally, as he often did in the TV series (though you don't remember - read the scripts), Eric Chappell allows you time that ends. Were they cynical or just too desperate to be in the film industry? Rossiter and de la Tour are always funny, but as a film, this terrible monument is pleasantly remembered in the TV series. REST IN PEACE.
