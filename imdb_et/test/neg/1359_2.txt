For those of you who have never heard of the movie so far (which I expect there are many happy people who are not), I will give you a summary. Ryan Gosling plays the character of Leland, who is also a narrator of the film (la Kevin Spacey for American beauty, but without intelligent observations of life). Leland goes to jail to grab a child left dead and the film tries to find out why she did it. It looks like he is a nice boy (if not mentally absent) and is depicted by Gosling completely because of the lack of violence, anger or agenda (and if you wait for him to expose his unhappy side later, don't waste your time - it's not such a movie. Leland Pearl goes to Madison's classes taught by Don Cheadle (who is capable of something besides quality, even in bad movies) Pearl is trying to open up Leland's mystery, trying to find out how such a child could do it and write a book later on (together with a juvenile jail teacher, Pearl is an ambitious author). <br /> <br /> The relationship between Leland and Pearl is the ride behind the film, as their talks open the audience to Leland's audience. Leland United States is impressive cast, which seems to be detrimental to the film. that writer / director Matthew Ryan Hodge (don't worry you haven't heard of him, he never did anything) had to give each character a personal story and a lack of personality to allow them to play. Most of these features and stories are clichés and most of them are underdeveloped and unresolved. <br /> <br /> I try to break them here: Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson have killed the parents of an outdated boy (I love how the movie was called "slowed", never "mentally disabled." This part made me laugh) apparently they have a cold relationship because all suburban marriages in today's cinema must be cold. Their two other children are Michelle Williams, who is apparently a prominent actor in college, and Jena Malone, who plays the same difficult teenage archetype she always plays with this heroine's addiction. Malone was also a Leland girlfriend, giving her a link to her victim. Chris Klein plays Williams' boy who had been orphaned and lived with his family and wished to go to the same college as his girlfriend. He makes more of his character than any other player who can sometimes steal the movie. Lena Olin is Leland's mother, who for some reason seems to be constantly sad. Kevin Spacey (also executive producer) is Leland's cold and missing father, a well-known novelist. Finally, Sherilyn Fenn appears, who makes the story of Leland wrinkle - if you even care about it at the moment. Oh yes, and there's a drug-ex-boyfriend, a couple of companions in the jewel, and a Pearl co-worker with whom he's got his long-distance girlfriend (played by Kerry Washington). <br /> <br /> Sorry if all this synopsis and character distribution took so long. If it seemed pointless and boring, you've just experienced a little bit of what I did in 108 minutes when I was watching a movie. However, the transfer of overworked clichés is the least of the crimes of this film. The biggest thing is that all the action is completely pointless. We are not given an exciting mind because we are not given an effective explanation, we do not give much. Given that it sucks so much, I go on and I break your end so you never have to see it: Leland created slowness because all Leland saw sadness in the world and wanted Corky (or whatever the victim's name was), sadness in his eyes. It's like the world's worst emo band that has made an album and titled "The world is sad so I killed the retard". Oh, and Leland will eventually die in a sequence that depends on incredible coincidences that it would have destroyed the film if the film has not yet been breastfeeding. Of course he will eventually die because it made the film so deep. <br /> <br /> I give the 2 stars of the movie because the actors themselves did a good job with the junk that they were given. The Cheadle and Gosling formations were even interesting on some levels. But to paraphrase the film, you must believe that movies are more than the sum of their parts, kiddo.
