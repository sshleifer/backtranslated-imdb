I look at all the good comments on this movie and I mean to myself ... Am I going crazy ...? Can't I see the beauty of this movie ...? Am I stupid enough to NOT understand the movie that this movie is trying to bring out? I don't know ... maybe one of these lizards entered my head and ate all my brain. The idea of ​​the movie didn't go anywhere ... I was sure it would have a blurry end and of course ... it was! Nothing extraordinary ... Not even landscapes (I jumped to the mountainside to have at least landscapes nice but not). Just lay the story of a mad teacher and of course his crazy students ... now all have grown up, each of them .. with his own firm idea. And the boy some of these ideas were stupid, such as the lizard story. For a moment I thought I was looking at x-files .. when the lizard enters the ear and everything. From my point of view, this film is a waste of time (not to say money when U pays for a ticket) The only part I did was to act as a "German" boy in a young blue eye ... He played very well and convincingly his age ... The rest. .. something! I read the previous review and I think the script writer and director were both drugs when they came up with these ideas. Well, given that there are a lot of people who enjoyed this movie ... I guess again .. Maybe I'm crazy. Advice. Don't waste your time with it!
