This movie made me so much laugh. It was a bloody joke to tell you the truth. So the incredible and worst plot ever. Acting was also bad. I don't know how so many popular Bollywood actors and actors did this movie. The script must be a bit of a joke. The visual effects of this film were painfully painful. I believe a kindergarten child could have made a visual effect for a better job and the monkey could have done a better job than trying a plot. <br /> <br /> The plot has many attempts to copy larger Hollywood movies like the Terminator, but it's not unhappy. I laughed at my head for seeing this movie. Complete catastrophe in Indian cinema history!
