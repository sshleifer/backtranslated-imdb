Few movies have broken expectations and irritated me as much as Fire. The film is pretentious garbage. It does nothing at artistic level. The only thing he managed to get is a ban in India. If only the poor quality of the film and not the actual contradiction, the ban would have been more justified. <br /> <br /> Now that I am out of my system, I have to analyze the film more: <br /> <br /> * From the beginning of the movie it seems unrealistic, especially when the main characters start chatting in English. Of course, the director did not make a film for an Indian audience; however, its international audience was underestimated by its simplification. Looking at the character of home help in full English is too unreal to be true. These scenes are not very effective. They come out and prevent the film from flowing. I am still thinking about how this philosophical dialogue concerns the story. I felt that surrealism was lost. In any case, they do not achieve either of the two. <br /> <br /> * The names chosen for women by Radha and Sita are the names of the Hindu deities and so they are shocked by the chosen audience. Since the film was not primarily for Indian audiences, the shock-name-selection is not meant to achieve that goal, which is absurd. <br /> <br /> * Directional quality is very bad and some keys and delicate scenes are poorly addressed. A better director could have made the subject a powerful emotional drama. I always thought Shabana Azmi was a good actor, but her talent is not obvious in this film. Male leaders were direct rubbish. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Earth and want to see more director, stay away from it. Please.
