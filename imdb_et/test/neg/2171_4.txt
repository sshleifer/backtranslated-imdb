Elderbush Gilch was a big disappointment for me. I heard how big it was, how important it was. It just didn't hit me. It had a twilight story, accompanied by some moral and sadistic Native American characters who are attacking today's standards. Although most D.W. Griffith's films have depth and intelegence, which seems to be a picture of a formula-based program. <br /> <br /> I loved seeing Lillian Gishi and Mae Marshi nations after birth, plus some productions of battle scenes were pretty good. According to the future Griffith cameraman Karl Brown, the spectators are standing by the eye and rejoicing when the cavalry ceased riding. I didn't know anything. And brother me, I look at Griffith's early work on biography. This movie isn't exactly what it used to be. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is that all its mistakes have a lot of Griffith touches. He is doing quite well with his main players, plus a scene where Indians surround the cabin, resembling a nation-born climax - a much higher film that would send the American blast a little over a year later.
