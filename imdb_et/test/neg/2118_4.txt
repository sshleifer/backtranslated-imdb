This is the perfect example of the main horror words of the 90s. Nothing is scary and the movie is almost bloodless. Yes, there is violence, but everything is politically correct like on a television movie. It's not a totally bad picture, I can safely say I found it quite enjoyable. If the lack of originality really hurts "Voodoo" .All if you are part of the mainstream audience and pseudo-horror movies like "Scream" is your favorite then you will love "Voodoo", but if you want something very merciful then avoid this movie.
