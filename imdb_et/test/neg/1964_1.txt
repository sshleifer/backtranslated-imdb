Jack Frost 2 was a terrible, terrible, unfortunately pathetic apology for the success of an excellent film. The original was a low-budget comedy horror movie murdered in a place that, after being poisonous with waste, became more snowy. And the snowman went around to kill people and prevent such blow dryers as the plague. However, it was far from the original quality. It seemed to have even a lower budget because for some reason, an hour later, the film was not a snowman. Some revenge he gets when he is always in the form of ice cubes, with a cheesy voice and a little trembling cooler that he gives to the character animation. Disappointment, if you don't believe, even for a bad movie fan.
