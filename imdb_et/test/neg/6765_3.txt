We chose this movie as an alternative to Polar Express, which shows our local IMAX theater. What a waste of time and money! First, it's not cute. The snowman sometimes seemed demonic. At other times he was just a zombie. She did not show expression or emotions mostly, and her hollow blue eyes were just scary. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Santa says at the beginning that this is about the spirit of giving a movie. Santa Claus and Snowman, who proclaim war to each other, is the film? I'm all about a parody, but it wasn't funny or fun. The idea that the snowman flute is his voice is different. Too bad for you to see or listen to the snowman from your flute ... not even "thank you" to Santa. <br /> <br /> The only funny part of the movie was "outflows" at the end. film. Too bad they didn't use them in the movie. It would have been better.
