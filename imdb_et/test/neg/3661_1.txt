My girlfriend and I are really cheering horrors. Especially those with a lot of nonsense. When we saw the box in this movie, we thought it would be the perfect movie for the night. We started to look at it, not waiting for it to be GREAT, but thought it would be at least our interest. After 20 minutes of the movie, we realized that the pace would not end up and it was an incredibly boring film. We tried to enter it, but the idea of ​​the plot was very small even after reading the back of the DVD box. The film was filmed in the dark and it was quite tedious to try to find out what was happening in every key. Every violent scene was very hard to come by and you can never wait for violence. This is definitely a non-motive film that is wrong and very drawn out. Each scene was about 20 minutes the same thing and I felt like I got a point after the first one. 5. Leave this movie out and check out another Freddy or Jason again and get more content.
