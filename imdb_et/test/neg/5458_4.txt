I'm shocked that all the "hated" ratings are six and seven, which are still above average. For me, it seems that "the Emperor has no clothes". I understand that this film was produced in the early 1970s with a very small budget ... Nevertheless, it was a trouble to sit and watch. The DVD I saw had some subtitles, but about 75% of the speech is not subtitled. Part of this is hard to understand. The Jamaican patois was audaciously cool, but you didn't try to "tune" for a while. Some of the pictures were nice and realism was there, even though some of the performances were not great (Jimmy Cliff did a good job) The plot is not bad, but rather predictable. In movie 1:43, Jimmy Cliff (Ivan), who sings for the scene and a couple of shoot-out and fight, is highlighted. Probably 15 minutes. The rest is pretty boring. BTW, at the beginning of the movie, has some wonderful cuts in Ivan's character, which seems to be an editorial mistake that made me a little laugh. One reviewer said this movie was cut so many times that there were few copies of the 1972 theater version. The end was interesting, showing how young media influences people, it can also be a general comment about the influence of white man / colonialism on Jamaica. The other main topics are poverty, corruption, church, ambition ... Finally, the soundtrack is definitely worth it, the film is much less.
