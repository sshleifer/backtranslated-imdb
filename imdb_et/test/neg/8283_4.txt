Interesting slasher film with several suspects. <br /> <br /> Includes a typical girl who blows her breasts (Denise Cheshire) when her swimsuit changes, horrible suspect - each of them can do it, assuming to get very good (Linnea Quigley), a very unusual adventure , more bare breasts, a track that is NOT a summer Olympics, and a ghoulish secret. <br /> <br /> Everything comes to an end. No, there's more. Does this man die? I bet Anne (Patch Mackenzie) is not going to come home soon. <br /> <br /> If you like teen movies, are you able to be perverted, even if all the actors are over 18?
