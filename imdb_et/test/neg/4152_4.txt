Those born to Vietnamese mothers and GI fathers did not find either. A beautiful country is the story of one such child, Binh, who was rejected by the rural village, and he is trying to find his American father. The film starts with a green and wild country, but it fades into a sweaty sweat of ugliness and boredom. The remarkable talents of Tim Roth and Temuera Morrison are wasted in meaningless and ill-conceived roles that carry a rusty merchant ship carried by Binh and who die over the ocean, which seems to be a stock of stormy seas. New York City offers slavery and clich√©s. Although this film is very uneven, this film is the last segment of the curiosity. Nick Nolte gets the most display. I suggested that he was probably only in the final scene and was not far from the truth. As the trip brings Binh to Texas and his father's film is calm and tough simplicity. The complicated cohabitation creates these two men together in the father's and son's family. Ninety-two minutes of garbage we've just been watching rewards Nolte's deep and subtle performance as they communicate slowly. Credit rolls and I was surprised to see the names of Badland's executive editor Edward Pressman and West Texas's native Terrence Malick.
