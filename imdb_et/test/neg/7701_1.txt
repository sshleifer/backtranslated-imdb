Do you want a great recipe for failure? Take the dirty, left-wing political plot, add some weak and fully developed characters, and then throw away the worst sequences the film has ever known. Allow to simmer for a week (the time that probably took to make this trash). <br /> <br /> The result is "Steal This Movie", a movie experience that takes bad movies into dangerous and exotic low places that have never been created before. <br /> <br /> . Words can't be passed on when the pain was to look. It's not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit and joke about. It's not "9. Space Plan ‚Äù. It's a long, boring and sad waste of time. "Steal This Movie" is the greatest energy and talent I've ever seen. It depresses me when I realize that people * actually took time in their lives to act in this whore when you could call it "action". But if you have a bad direction, poor writing, bad ALL - "act" is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a big, nasty turtle that you want to quickly bring out, fears that a friend or loved one can see it. I really wish I could somehow destroy the copy of this movie so that it would not pollute the thoughts of the aspiring filmmakers. Thank you, Robert Greenwald, for giving me new respect for every other movie I've ever seen. You have shown me what is really terrible and why I should evaluate all those movies that are just dirty and / or boring.
