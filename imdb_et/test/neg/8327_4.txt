Danny Lee's performance as a wisecracking policeman has a unique interest in this film, although it has an excellent show including Chow Yun-Fat, Carina Lau, Andy Lau, Shing Fui-On and Alex Man. CYF plays a trio of bosses who want to live in peace and a lot of life, but Alex Man, the whole psychologist with a great fear of CYF, won't let him do that. CYF is trying to escape from Malacca but without results. After his family blows bits, his cronies dead or turncoat, wounded and broke, CYF returns to Hong Kong to get into serious revenge. <br /> <br /> It sounds much better than it is. The CYF is well-dressed and beautiful, looks painful, grim and accepts the cue, but somehow you just don't care. Andy Lau looks good, but that's it. Carina Lau has a small, small little piece that was nice, but she gets a head ball so it ends. Alex Man is a caricature who is so overwhelming that at times it can be intriguing, but writing here is so flat that he just comes up like a garden-type nut. <br /> <br /> Danny Lee is a great though - too bad, he is the small screen of this darkness (literally) and essentially boring film. <br /> <br /> Rent it, don't buy it. Or just skip. <br /> <br /> This is a 'Rich and Famous' sequel, although it was probably filmed simultaneously; it first appeared due to CYF boxoffice power.
