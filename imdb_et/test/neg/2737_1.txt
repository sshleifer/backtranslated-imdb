This movie is a great movie only if you need to sit and laugh with this stupidity. As a geologist, this film is wrong with the most important facts and uses too young actors to even hold the top of these fields. Interesting is how it shows a stage beneath the massive cave below ground. It is also funny if seismic areas have massive destruction as a result of a 6.5 earthquake. They seem to forget that building standards in these areas would be bigger to make a great deal of damage. It is also funny how much they do on the Washington State Coast and also on Oregon as if they were nice South California beaches. Jelly's donut analogy is very fun even when used. The director does a good job of adding the comic to two "supossed" doctoral degrees.
