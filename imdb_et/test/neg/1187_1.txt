It took longer to write this review than to watch this movie. It's just bad. The plot is terrible compared to TV shows. It's flat, uncomfortable and boring. <br /> <br /> It is clear that LoG ended up with ideas long before the film was green. Viewers should read this, for example, if they don't know when to stop. <br /> <br /> Bad editing, bad music, bad performance. Zero dynamics, zilch chemistry. <br /> <br /> A film that does not know what it is, made without a love to a mysterious end that leaves you depressed and feels so much money wasted. br /> <br /> LoG was obviously an offer that they couldn't refuse, or maybe their egos are just better than them. It is a gloomy marketing pressure that could have been better if the LoG was more fresh and inspired. <br /> <br /> However, I knew when to stop and did. <br /> <br /> Please! Someone is trying to convince me of the finer points of this movie!
