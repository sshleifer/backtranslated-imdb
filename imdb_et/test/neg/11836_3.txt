The small western town has an open hanging baby T-Rex, which forces Sheriff Eric Roberts and an animal control agent Melissa Brasselle (who is moving through his role very interestingly) to reach the bottom of things. They discover that the mad scientist (Corbin Bernsen) is unaware of government sponsorship, continuing the long-abandoned US research project Jurassic Storm (ha!), Creating a dinosaur army in detached underground laboratories. Before long, our heroes are trapped inside, the navy is called in, power goes out and the dinosid is free to make quick lunches for everyone they get nails and jaws. <br /> <br /> Despite the often frighteningly unsuccessful script full of plot holes, character inconsistencies and loose ends, this is a direct-to-digest trash from JURASSIC PARK and CARNOSAUR, thanks to good product values, satisfactory FX, casual laughing and a lot of pointless action Someone said that the scene was opened by CARNOSAUR, but anyone who had previously been watching Roger Corman's productions knows that he allows directors to freely reuse their early movie clips to save time and money. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
