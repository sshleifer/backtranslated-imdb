As an independent filmmaker (per se), I really understand what these guys are trying to do and it seems like a good idea. On paper. It is terrible for a 16 mm film. I didn't know it was done in the mid-90s because the film was so grainy and bad that I would have sworn that it was one of those 30-year-old runners where the porn producer was trying to move. And sound! Ugh, I don't know what kind of microphone they were recording, but it sounds like someone is walking on dead pages all over the place. I think I should not judge how many films have been put on my company? No, but I would like to think that we would have at least good picture and sound quality to go with our bad behavior, writing and leadership. For the A + idea, F-- to fill.
