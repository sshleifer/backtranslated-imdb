Just seen the way ahead? In TCM (UK) this is a really terrible movie. If I had paid for the pictures I went out of. <br /> <br /> The terrible mess of the movie. Byers (Lewis) and his companions report a 1960s Italian sci-fi movie. Were the CND / Peace Symbol symbols in the uniforms meant to be chronic? Sets were clean in the 1970s, I'm sure Hollywood TV show could have been a more realistic set. <br /> <br /> The film is against racism. The film takes mickey out of veterans. <br /> <br /> It is not funny how Lewis is outside of every new movie.
