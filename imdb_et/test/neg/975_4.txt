Two popular actors are involved in the show, such as De Niro and Murphy, who play police and actresses. Although they share most of the time with the screen, they do not reach the expected performances, such as Analyze, Parenting, Dr. Doolittle and Professor Nutty. The film begins interestingly, but becomes thin, ordinary comedy that is quite disappointing. Especially De Niro seems to dislike Showtime. It's a shame because it really shows your feelings that I think. Unfortunately, if the idea had been used cleverly, it could have been a more interesting job and could be followed next to every other popular Hollywood movie. Well, I don't think that is followed by at least the re-casting of De Niro and Murpy. ** at the end *****
