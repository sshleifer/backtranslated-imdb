This film had a very complicated plot and a very creative place, which, frankly, could not be followed, which is surprising given that operation and dialogue could only be the result of writing a kindergarten. If you like Kathy Ireland, you might want to see it. The movie was probably created as a vehicle to try to bring him to Hollywood, but if that was his goal, I have to say that I hope he didn't invest too much money in his production.
