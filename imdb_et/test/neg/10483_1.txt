"The Texas community is covertly hit by mysterious killings involving some local college students. The exploratory sheriff discovers the amazing identity of the killer responsible for the murders. The Cosmic NASA experiment has mutated the chain and turned it into an unstoppable killing machine with blood thirst," according to a summary of DVD sleeves . <br /> <br /> Or can this creature really be a mutated alligator that returns to space-related "Noah's Ark"? Long-term opening with a ridiculously straight 1960s pair Ralph Baker Jr. (like Chris) and Dorothy Davis (Judy) show that "Night Fright" can be a joyfully bad movie; but don't get your hopes. After some innocent cavortings, attractive colleges discover that the other pair has been in contact with the monster; of course this creature is terrible when it comes to terrorizing young romanticists. The younger set doesn't trust Sheriff John Agar (like Clint Crawford); but he really wants to help. <br /> <br /> Mr. Agar was my aunt's friend; he talked about very few movies and it wasn't one of them.
