This junk is similar to a novel as cucumber slices. The filmmakers took out part of Alamo from the book, made it into a movie and said it was based on a book. Ha! I wonder what they did to force Mr. Michener to support this stuff? It was just one of Davy Crockett's, a flintlock rifle, Santa Ana, a 13-day poppycock honor collection. I started rooting almost with the Mexicans just to end the damn thing. And what was the scene where Stacey Keach tried to let James Bowie look at the knife? The sexual innuendary he used was minor and unnecessary. They could have used the film they wasted with this stupidity to make a real dialogue. This exhibition was embarrassing for Hollywood. Or can these clowns be embarrassing?
