Perhaps this is because I'm not a fan of comics (but if the comics are of the same quality as the movie, it's hard to believe they are), but it must be one of the worst films ever made. Existing plot, ridiculous action, stupid dialogue ... This movie is so bad that it hurt. Much. The fact that some people actually gave it is offensive to any good or at least mediocre (or at least bad) film. If you hate yourself, check out Tank Girl! For another thought, if you hate yourself, maybe you should just commit suicide ... My Rating: -34/10
