My general feeling about this film is that it was a slow, drawn-out, unstructured walk through some of the world's truly unfortunate situations with a little redemption and a clear message. The film is mostly made up of a rather uninteresting video from countries where it visits bad reenactions, all slowly slipping into action at pace and overlapping with frustrating music. Certainly some materials and interviews contain some compelling stories, but unlike what the backside describes, the victim's story was not that it was a director, Mr. Ripper, and he didn't say it well. This film could have included longer, better interviews with themselves, giving them the opportunity to speak their stories. Instead, Ripper comfortably pulls the story to himself, making it a sort of personal journey, and unfortunately it doesn't end up getting bigger. I have never gotten any growth when he explores this topic, and he can never say how to highlight this topic. He just pulls us from one place to another, brushes the situation lightly and characters, hangs around, showing too many unexpected slow-moving people who just walk around the streets, then move on to their next destination. It does it over and over and over again without real development. I felt that this movie could have been reduced to 45 minutes, but it would be pulled out for almost 2 breakthrough hours. We are morally obliged to take care of this subject, but the director's self-conscious, curvy and involuntary travel will take you a few minutes to stifle.
