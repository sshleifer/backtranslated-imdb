I understand that my summary line is not too polite. <br /> <br /> This film, written and directed by Scott Caan and starring Giovanni Ribisi, Don Cheadle & runs for 88 minutes. <br /> <br /> The puppy in this movie is a dog. <br /> <br /> The movie was unveiled in 2 US theaters at the end of April 2007, one week, and $ 914 in total. DVD in early August 2007. <br /> <br /> We can only take about 40 minutes before turning off DVDs. <br /> <br /> It was a type of movie played on the lower side with a double bill. You saw that the main movie and I thought it was what it was, you could have stepped out before we turned it off. <br /> <br /> All three actresses and all young women in the movie have all done and deserve better than this. <br /> <br /> Ratings: ** (4) 54 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (10 of)
