I think this film has no reason to beat the theaters. It was probably my neighbors on the street who filmed this movie with their mother's camcorder. The actor is very amateur. This movie is definitely not something you would like to watch if you were not very boring. Actors even seem to double as managers and team members without being "professional". If the director (s) and / or actors decide to continue their film making efforts, I would definitely recommend that they improve their skills and maybe take some (ok, many) film making and showing classes.
