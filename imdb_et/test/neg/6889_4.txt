The videos of this movie read "a story of beauty, passion and forbidden fruit". Are they talking about the same movie I just saw? They can't be just as I saw a movie that was beautiful, but it wasn't a passion and a fruit, it's all a hogwash designed to attract the potential viewer to watch this movie. If only that had some passion or life, I would have enjoyed this movie very much. Instead, it was an agonizing slow pace and not a particularly interesting movie, which I certainly wouldn't want to see again. It's not that it's a bad movie (after it's very nicely filmed), but it's unreliable. I was waiting for something more exciting or interesting, but then just finished the movie. There was no great excitement, mystery or anything - just a pretty amazing story about a young girl who becomes a servant and spends her next 10 years as a servant.
