I really wanted to like this movie for a variety of reasons - the subject is interesting in nature and is probably the biggest problem the world faces today and has fascinated by fascinating works (such as Linda Grant when I lived today) usually on the Israeli side of the fence. I was also pleased to say that he thought it was the best film he could see all year round, so with such a recommendation ... <br /> <br /> At the same time, I actually found some points off! True, I was tired and the cinema seats are comfortable, but I found there was too much work trying to identify the characters. When I got my head around the idea that it was a vignette series, I went with it, but it was rather disappointing to show a film rather than a sketch. I liked the concept of restrained, almost silent mystery, which is different from these utopian moments - a sexy girl, a red balloon and a Ninja Muslim destroyer. But personally, I think the film is over-mortgaged. I am not saying that narrative and plot are all (it is definitely not), but even a little more dialogue would have helped.
