This film would have been a very good propaganda clip for a North American Falangist party or some other similar group ... A strong man (Kersey) puts himself above the law (but not outside the law) and frees the citizen by killing worthless trash. The only thing that made me think that the FAQ did not do that was that jew was a star like a good man ... Try to look at it again when you think of it as a propaganda film for the extreme right - and I see what I mean. .. <br /> <br /> It's a tragedy that Jimmy Page made music for this movie ...
