I do not understand the exaggerated good critics of this film except that many Venezuelan people are reasonably very excited, based on the fact that Venezuelan cinema is really a bit behind what other countries in the region are. <br /> The movie is first too repetitive, many scenes are identical to almost both leading roles, so you get the impression that it is a time-consuming. The time-consuming filler is also a good point, because this film is definitely too long in 105 minutes, you start to wear and watch after a while. <br /> <br /> All participants are pretty bad, except for Venezuelan boy Edgar Ramirez, who brings a bit of a hit and plays Venezuela's role, recruits Pedro. By the way, it is not a representative film about people in the region (Caribbean region), it tends to ridicule them.
