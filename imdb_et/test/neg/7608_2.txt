I watched a movie called Dark Talon, dated 1974. The credit for this movie is exactly the same as Dark Star, so I assume it was an alternative title. Dark Talon was not nearly as funny as everyone else here. The action was flat, a ban on editing and a general fool. At first, it is annoying the 1970s truck song called "Benson, Arizona", which has nothing to do with the film. Basically, the plot turns around a small team of interstellar bombers moving around unstable bombs. Bombs are sensitive and responsive to humans. Mandatory disaster interferes with communication between bombs and crew. One of the team members goes out and has an absurdly idiotic existential conversation with a bomb that makes no sense. The film I saw was made less than an hour and a half ago, the ads were thrown in, so I suspect that Dark Talon is an overrated version of Dark Star. Painted with a few monsters he walks. It was stupid and convincing as an alien. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe John Carpenter had a hand in it. His other films were so much better.
