In many respects, I agree with the in-depth review already provided by the ministries and I agree that it has its pros, not just its disadvantages. For example, the original television is largely able to cut the middle and the end of the novel to a single assembly, including the discovery of Gurney Halleck and the Paul Atreides and Chani love event, which is travesty, apparently born in the studio shenanigens, which the second reviewer writes. It was one of the major drawbacks of the original film, and ministries offer a number of original plot lines that were cut out of Lynch's film due to the extensive nature of Herbert's novel. <br /> <br /> But this in itself is a double-edged sword. Instead of putting an end to the Romance text-celluloid transfer, the ministry creators were tempted to create their own line lines that were missing from the original novel. Similarly, although this is definitely a "fuller" account for Dune, it also breaks the original heart and soul and the main vision - prophecy. Where are the internal monologues that characterize Herbert's writing and show what many different characters think without the need to suddenly change the perspective or expand the words or the monologues that are spoken or unnecessary and dislocated? Passed. So much of Paul's decision to choose jihad or death, the choice to fulfill the prophecy or to deviate from it, is certainly the most interesting aspect of the novel (and what fascinates people who are far from science fiction fans) is lost. <br /> <br /> What is the idea of ​​Dune without prophecy? It's just a more educated and learned version of Farscape or Andromeda. How sad it is all we have. The Lynch movie was faulty, yes. However, a defective film can lead to another filmmaker's correction by taking the best points in Lynch's film making and rejecting some of the more broken styles while restoring the story. Now, this story is probably going to be translated to be filmed again, and I find it attentive.
