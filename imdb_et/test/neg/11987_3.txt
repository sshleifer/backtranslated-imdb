Uwe Boll returns to his filmmaking skills to offer a sci-fi horror story about mercenaries and reporters who take superheroes on a remote island. Well-managed exclusive Udo Keir runs Boll, who makes the worst script that should have worked. The crazy scientist studied by the reporter is dead, but this script is fun enough for the plot to work, and the effects and the superhero with his dead, inanimate eyes are somewhat rough, but Boll manages to film everything at hand. It would have wanted to actually figure out what would work and instead the camera's camera layouts were robbed and walked away. In addition, there are no sparks and no life in the scene, I think Boll shot only one or two shots and just used what he had. It really stinks. It is clear that Boll is in one of his periodic reversed films, where something he has ever learned about the film collides. The last movie he did was that bad was Seed's Slayer Slayer, one of the worst films I've ever seen. It's not that bad, but it's just close because it should have been better. Then Udo Keir is good enough again to make his scenes worth watching and make it almost as bad as a good movie. I'll accept if it's not late at night and you're stuck on this cable.
