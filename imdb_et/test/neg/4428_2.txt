Director Lo Wei was aware that he read racing papers and set the set - telling us something about his approach to filmmaking, which? Did I read reviews in two categories: 1) this is such a bad movie it's funny or 2) it's such a bad movie so it's boring. <br /> <br /> So let's go to the point where we all agree - this movie is really bad. <br /> <br /> I vote for Category 2. The story is almost incomprehensible and it is further crushed and spoiled by the very poor work and editing of the camera, but Lo Wei was so in love that he slows down the pace so that we can all look at whether we want to or not. <br /> <br /> Maybe Lo Wei was disturbed by the day (or two) of making this movie - she just wanted to hurt everyone, hurt, team and audience alike <br /> <br /> Keep yourself awake.
