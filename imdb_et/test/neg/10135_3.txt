Everybody knows that it is not possible to keep all the details of the book in the movie. But this film has changed for almost no reason. In addition, many changes have made the story illogical. Some examples: 1) In the movie "Paul Renauld", Pori really meets before he dies (Poirot only receives a letter) saying he is afraid to kill. It is completely stupid because if the Renaulds plan had succeeded, Poirot would have known that the dead man would not have been Renauld. (Poirot was in the graveyard when Mrs. Renauld found the victim). 2) The film has been combined by two people into one! "Cinderella" has removed the film. Girl Hastings falls in love and Jack Renaulds's former girlfriend is one of the movie people! Why for God? 3) Hastings finds victims that he is such a bad golfer. Totally sleepless and stupid. 4) Film speaks secrets too early (for example, at the beginning). So you know things you shouldn't know. 5) The murderer will end up with a person who is not in the book. Perhaps because the person ("dull") who stops the murderer does not exist in the film. 6) The book is very complicated. The film only takes about 90 minutes. Of course, you need to add all the necessary details, but it is impossible if you add stupid things that were not in the book and have no meaning (eg a bicycle track).
