"The Patriot", which looks at Steven Segal, is a late 90's thriller / action movie that is not really a thriller and not really an action movie; rather, Steven Segal plays Steven Segal's second name, but this time he is a doctor of the Native American country, who strikes every time. Obviously, when the lines of the lines are discovered, the film itself is a brilliant disregard for the discrepancy of character. <br /> <br /> From the marketing point of view, I asked myself, "Who in the world were they directed?" The bio-thriller chart is in the middle of the American crowd mark and Segal, because the silk cowboy never sells to anyone, even if you deeply roast him and put him in the krypsy cream circle. The whole movie is just the way out for Segal fans because it just doesn't offer a level.
