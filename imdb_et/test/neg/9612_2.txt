I'm not too hard for this show because I enjoyed the first season, but then things worsened. The concept is nothing special, just a girl whose name is Casey, who is trying to cope with the new step-brother, Derek and her loud, work-family, while she gradually forces her princess standards to each of them. In the 1st season the story was really interesting. I liked Casey because he was smart, strong, independent and conservative. He was disgraceful and deep. I felt bad about harassing her new school at her new school. He was a perfectionist, but not as annoying as the later episodes. Oh, and he dated a nice boy, currently depicted as Derek's idiot friends. The season took on the real tension that the title of the exhibition tried to capture. <br /> <br /> Now I can't say that the show has really gone down, because the story is sometimes interesting, but I'm going to drink to Derek now instead of Casey. Now there is little between these two siblings, if any. When they communicate, it is only brief. Oh, and I don't want my face to be Dasey fans. People, this is called INCEST, even if they are step-sister-brothers. My tolerance can only go so far, but that is not the case. <br /> <br /> It's strange. Derek, as an antagonist, has become more sensitive over time, while the assumed main character, Casey, is previously neurotic and unlikely. I like how younger children get more airtime, but parents are even narrower than before. But this is not the biggest problem ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we are forced to look at everything from Casey's, flat, nauseating background music. He has over time become a stupider and lower. In one episode, he got bright and wanted his boyfriend to be foolish, so he deliberately reduced his food and accused Derek. Now, what happened to be a strong, independent feminist? I haven't watched a lot for the fourth season, but I hear he's acquainted with a boy named Truman, who is a jackass and is arrogant. Oh, I remember this fake episode. He keeps reminding him that he doesn't like him, murders him through the sword, and finally grabs him because he can "handle" him? What the hell? Why go for a man like first. The first season for Casey would have been his ... never thought. Or maybe it would have been my reaction. Oh, and he's a cheerleader. Not that it's a bad thing, but I think he fell into one of his practices with his head. And he was crying in a snake shooter because he couldn't find "his dress of dreams" and wasn't completely satisfied until he got a queen of prom. One thing I have noticed is that no matter how bad Casey tries to tell us that life is over, things almost always pass by (he gets what he wants, Derek gets some revenge, people love him, etc. .) Derek is still quite immature, but I see he's actually matured. I don't understand why many people hate Sally. He seems to be nice and it is good to see Derek in a serious relationship with someone he is interested in, not "play". He heals Edwin a little better and is a good brother to Mart. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the show is so-so, and I appreciated it because, despite some character formation, I have ever been admired by a character like every "fashionable teen queen" you see everywhere on TV. But it was good if it lasted.
