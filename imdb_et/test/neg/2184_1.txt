I found it difficult to take care of these signs, who were either annoying or unpleasant, all who lived in a stunningly fun city life. <br /> <br /> Dialogue was occasionally annoying and at other times the narrative seemed difficult to follow - was it for me or was the entire scene deleted? <br /> <br /> Bad sitcom seemed like a movie. The stereotypes and jokes of "male groups" would have been funny in the early 1990s. That's where much of the movie's humor comes from - and boy, is it getting older quickly. <br /> <br /> In addition to an attractive Irish man, this film is indirect. And not even "so bad is a good way". The last 20 minutes were particularly painful. Perhaps, if you have never met any gay person or have never thought about homosexuality, this film may have something meaningful. Otherwise - darlings, you would still be better off boys renting a band or a beautiful thing.
