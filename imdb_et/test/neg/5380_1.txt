Why ???? What a nasty joke about the supposed movie ... the poster seemed like a lovely movie .. what a disappointment ... who the hell is the man's leader? She looks like an old slow retired policeman ... I'm a cop and I can say that a man can't act ... return to the police ... the presence of the screen .. why did they show their naked ass as if it were Mel Gibson "hell did not ... put the filmmaker out of business ... this man does not deal with the film ... I seriously doubt that women or gay men find him attractive ... whoever cast a film is not talented cages who did not give the leading talent. It's nice that we're white boys who get Asian women, but why a ugly white man, why not Dean Cain or Brad Pitt as a white boy. Asian women like ugly white boys or black guys I see? Don't get it .. must have low self-esteem. <br /> <br /> The only hot girl who can act in the movie was Kate Holliday .. where else was a hot white chick with ugly Asian chicks who think they are hot and able to act? <br /> <br /> Only two actresses in this movie are poets at the end of the movie and a hot white chick in a massage house. TL Young and Kate Holliday should have guided the film. <br /> <br /> The Asian character was ridiculous as he was trying too hard to be a ghetto / sexy black girl ... the keyword here is "trying" .. <br /> <br /> Gina .. you can't act and you are not physically playing such a role .. you have to play character roles and be more modest in my own presentation .. <br /> <br /> I think the actor is Gina Hirazumi ... I watched her on IMDb and he is a great asian actress ???? if that is the case, I don't want to see the bad Asian-American actors. <br /> <br /> No wonder Hollywood doesn't have Asian American actors !!! if that's the best they got! were they supposed to win some Asian movie prize? give me a break ... it seemed like they just made a movie to put them in a lot of Asian girls. They are not even hot. play the role of character and improve your acting .. you are not the leading female type ... <br /> <br /> If this movie makes money for flying pigs ... be so blunt but feel that these actors / actors need either get better or work with your craft: except for the two mentioned participants who should have been leading. I say this in love for all the girls in the Asian movie, do what your parents say and go and watch the doctors / lawyers / engineers ... and act fun. This is what you are doing now. I am not trying to be average, but I hope you read it and push you to get people to get better or go to another company. There wasn't even an ethical message in this movie. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't be surprised if "Soap Girls "is a special section of Asian American hatred propagated by members of Ku Klux Kl. Otherwise, Asian people must hate themselves ... watching this movie makes me look grateful not Asia .. you are pathetic. . Do you have your respects in Asia.
