First of all, let me say that I do not deny the importance of this issue in any way - on the contrary. I'm Polish and I've been aware of Katy's massacre for a long time (actually two of my family members have died there) so I was expecting this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is a script that includes too many sub-blocks and characters, none of which are properly designed. The characters are painfully one-dimensional; their stories are intertwined, but they have no general meaning. In my opinion, there is really no way to show your ability to show. The exception is Andrzej Chyra, who represents Jerzy - the only interesting character. I want the story to focus more on him. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film has no emotion. Before seeing it, I thought I was only moved for sentimental reasons, but I actually looked at it with strange separation, except in the final execution scene. It is well done and its placement is interesting and gives the end to the climate, although the idea that the Lord's prayer is proclaimed by the dead officers seems a bit far removed. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think the film may have some educational value for those who do not know the historical events being depicted, but I do not think it is a cinema.
