This movie is bad, so bad that my mother, who can barely hold on to the Disney Snow Light "arrest," hits the whole movie. My first warning should have been that it was in the $ 5.50 trash bin at Wal-Mart. But I've actually found good movies in this trash so I can't blame this attack. Another warning should have been that when the cashier called the DVD, it was actually $ 3.88. Again, I've never been the one who ignored the cheap. This movie is definitely not for people looking for something good, and it is definitely not for everyone who occasionally enjoys a bad movie. If you need background noise when you do something with your friends playing cards, then get it when you are looking for something you really look at, not even bothering. It was really disappointing because there were many good players there. I felt like I was looking at Willard's chocolate version.
