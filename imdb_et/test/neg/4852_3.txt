I was expecting this movie to improve, but at the same time it is the worst escalating film: centrifuged sugar confectionery that sinks under its weighty self-importance. This pace is like a legionnaar in Sahara. The lack of a good dialogue leaves tempting little other than beautiful white bedding. Irons play another financial wizard who is in the sun. The cover is a pleasant singer, but not many actors. Fortunately, the script does not often call him out of the jazz club microphone. All enviablely relaxed, beautiful and unnecessary characters alternate with landscape alternation and fatigue. The whole exercise is similar to Ralph Lauren's ad. <br /> <br /> If you are forty years old and believe that francophilia is the key to complexity, you can spoil this cardboard box. Well, if you liked this movie, you probably felt good at understanding Godard's leading, and maybe even sitting out of Le Divorce.
