The only reason why this movie is not given a (terrible) voice is that both East Lupino and Robert Ryan are excellent. Ideal for East Lupino, as usual, it becomes increasingly worse when it tries different means to get rid of madness. Robert Ryan is frightening, because the threatening stranger, whose character is driven only by his disturbed mind, changes from one minute to another. Obviously, he becomes simple and obedient, suddenly becoming wise and intimidating. Ms. Lupino's character was in greater danger of this house and her own stupidity than anyone who came together. He couldn't get out of his house: windows didn't open, both front and back doors were locked and opened with a key inside. If you tried, you wouldn't have been able to design a worse firefighter. He did not take precautionary precaution to even have one additional key. He was also unable to find out how to summon help from nearby neighbors or get out of his cellar when he was arrested by the captain. I do not know what war his husband died, but if it was during World War II, his home furnishings, clothing styles, especially children and the telephone company repair shop, are clearly uncertain. I recommend watching this movie to see what strange features you can find.
