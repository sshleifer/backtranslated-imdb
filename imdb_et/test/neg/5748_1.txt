First of all, I would like to make it clear that I am volunteered to watch horrible movies. I've seen what I thought was the worst of the worst. In my opinion, the movies couldn't get worse than D.E.B.S, Leprechaun 6: Back 2 Tha Hood and Terror Storm. Until I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> The Pirate movie is without exaggeration WORST MOVIE WORLD. I was told before watching the movie that the movie was really terrible, but I didn't believe those claims. Believe me, when I tell you that this movie is just a movie's abomination. <br /> <br /> It starts with a 3-minute clip of pirate boat apparently in the middle of battle with yourself. "End" spins over the screen. Unfortunately, this is not the end of the movie. The film talks about an unpopular, clumsy twisted girl named Mabel, who carries a ghetto-blaster and attracts homosexual pirates. He sinks and has overly drawn hallucinations, in which he denotes a little dressed skank who loves Frederick, who happens to be out of the ocean. He can actually be homosexual. Pirate King has ruby ​​and diamond studded tires. It rubs and slips when it squeezes it. <br /> <br /> Sings in this movie. You may have the impression that this is fun music. This is not. Trust me. These are the worst songs you have ever heard, and at the end of the first original music you are looking for items that break the headphones together. <br /> <br /> Other movies have "references" here. By reference, I mean, of course, "obvious blasts". Indiana Jones, Inspector Clouseau and the inclusion of a light cable was actually fun. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is in pain at the best moments. The direction is terrible, and at one point you will see a stunt pillow that is not hidden at all. <br /> <br /> To sum up, if there is even curiosity, you can get rid of this movie. There are times when people want to see how bad something is, but this movie is not worth it. Put it completely out of your mind and never think about it again. If you have your own mental capacity, I ask you, NEVER view this MOVI.
