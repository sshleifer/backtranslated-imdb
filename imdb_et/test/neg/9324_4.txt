I found that Dominion is an evil attempt to continue the story. The original film was a story of evil and how it could penetrate our lives. <br /> <br /> The Schrader version has no evil. Viewers do not get overwhelming fear, fear or even prediction. The Harlin version offers evil evil, reveals violations of the sacredness of the church and builds a convincing story that is plausible given the background of Father Merrini. Schrader's story leaves you thinking exactly what happened. Dominion does not create spectators' emotions against Father Merrin and leaves the viewer wondering why he was first concerned. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to see a sequel that lives originally should see an exorcist: the beginning.
