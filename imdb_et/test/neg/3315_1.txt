I've never voted over IMDB for one movie, but I'm sorry that this scale doesn't go down to -10. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this movie is that I saw it was a sneak preview and it was my worst movie experience. I don't mind jokes. I can live a silly story. But when I see these funny funny "headlines" in their pseudo-speech (only the Germans understand what I'm talking about), I felt that I never thought I never thought I was capable. (If they had omitted them, it might actually be acceptable ...). <br /> <br /> There's not much to say about this. You can laugh once or twice because it is so ridiculous, but it doesn't fix it. Surely this is not funny. <br /> <br /> If you live outside of Germany, be happy and rejoice that this terrible job is unlikely to make it to your cinemas. <br /> <br /> If you live in Germany, avoid this movie at all costs.
