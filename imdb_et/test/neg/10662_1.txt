(HR is what Himesh is called in the movie, I think he likes it too.) It's amazing how intelligent people, talented, even fall into the same trap. <br /> <br /> I like Reshamiya. It's amazing what he's done. In recent years, no one has come back from the desert or made a sign. <br /> <br /> And I really expect a big movie (What is Â£ 50 and a cute actress budget). As I think it is as intense as Reshamiya, it would stand out in a sentimental and emotional role. Ironically, he is depicted the same, but for what care? Gentle incompetence, negligence, terrible action, banal background music, insensitive direction makes it a real pain. <br /> <br /> Blunders rule. (For example, how can the German police give public guidance on an English speaker? They communicate in English!) Unfortunately, this incompetence has become the standard for Bollywood. There are also great directors, but also a lot of bad guys. The worse thing is that most simply don't care. <br /> <br /> Songs are the only sustainable armor ... <br /> <br /> Please do not repeat this HR and find yourself a good director (small budget .. No problem). <br /> <br /> The villain really should shave a wig instead of his head, what you know ... after it's a 50-fold film.
