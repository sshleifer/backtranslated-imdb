"Julia Kerbridge (Catherine Mary Stewart) is working hard to become a doctor. Suddenly Julia finds her younger niece Amanda's caregiver when her parents are murdered. Julia has a new neighbor, mysterious Kevin Finney (Rob Lowe's passionate life coincides when it comes out that young Amanda keeps the key to a terrible secret, because she is now the target of the killers, Julia has to find out if Kevin is a friend or an enemy and opens the mysterious mind of sins before the murderer hits again, "according to the summary of the DVD sleeves. <br /> br /> This thriller breaks down silently in the stitches, but it is interesting for a while. Stalker Sean Devine's wallpaper (outside the police station) and Mr. Lowe's violin (restaurant) are playing tightly, but it's hard not to overlook the fact that one of the allegedly sophisticated killers deliberately reduce their red color in a murder picture. Unfortunately, this is not a challenging test point, and is even worse. In general, "Dead Silent" is not a bad way for some a time to spend if there is nothing better, or you are Lowe and his co-stars. <br /> <br /> **** Dead Silent (1999) Roger Cardinal ~ Catherine Mary Stewart, Rob Lowe, Arlen Aguayo-Stewart, Larry Day
