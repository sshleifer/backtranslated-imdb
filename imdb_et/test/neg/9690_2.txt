If you plan to make a movie from any book, make sure the characters are consistent with that book. This film not only breaks the story of the Bible, which has been spoken to children for one thousand years in one way or another, but clearly took the liberty that adaptation may never be a try. At least the Lord of the Rings is close enough to the books that people read more when they read books when that "Noa Ark" tried.
