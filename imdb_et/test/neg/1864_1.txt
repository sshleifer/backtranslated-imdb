This is one of the worst films EVER did. I can't believe how bad it was. I was shocked by the "ghoulies" masks. They're probably Halloween masks! The mouth does not move even when they talk !!!!! Why did they feel the need to turn the ghoulies into a comic and scapegoat? When they do something, it seems that this circus-like music and excessive BONK and BOING noise hit people. Prison dominatrix lady is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. This movie is just bad. The plot is non-existent. One mother's mountain range is in it and she's probably been a nose job because it's done. Why was the first film's main character for making this garbage? BAD BAD BAD FILM.
