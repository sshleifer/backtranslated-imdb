Julie Delpy celebrates this terrible film about the sadistic relationship between 14th-century French father and daughter. The film tries to break a heroic medieval knightly romantic ritual image, showing a rather clumsy picture of the time defined by psychological dysfunction and violence. The film is opened by a child, François, who grows in the shadow of a hundred years of war and said by his father to keep his mother safe and wait for his return. François is taking steps to discover his mother with a loving bed. François murders him for the defense of his father's honor. Like a father like a son, François grows up and leaves his family to go to the same war. This provision is somewhat explained for future events, because it is already known in our home that there is something wrong with François. The war has not worked well with him, he has changed. <br /> <br /> Daughter Béatrice de Cortemart (Delpy) is waiting for her beloved father to return to English captivity. He is a pure heart, and he took care of his inheritance when his father was gone. In the absence of his father, Béatrice has to deal with financial difficulties that strengthen Béatrice's hope that his father will return. But when he returns, he notices that he has lost his will to enjoy life, and he tortures and humiliates everything around him, even his own daughter. From this point, the film depicts different ways François tortures his family. Starting with the humiliation of his son and ending his rape with his own daughter, Béatrice. <br /> <br /> In the Middle Ages, setting a movie should soften the blow because the viewer can say that this is a violent act. And indeed, many of the films on Incest, such as Tim Roth's "The War Zone (1999)", which are modern, were shocking because of this. <br /> <br /> Delpy will appear in several bold scenes in this movie. Indeed, he seems to be angelic and beautiful. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed when I saw some animal torture scenes. I believe, and it is not confirmed, that some birds were killed for making a film that really disturbs me. The quality of the film is reduced when real violence is used against the animals. I hope this movie will be released again without the scenes of their cruelty. These scenes do not contribute much to film speed. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is too long. The script is problematic. We can't see François and Béatrice before the war, we don't really get the answer to why he changed to such an extreme. I would have passed on this movie, but I have to mention some scenes that made this movie look: <br /> <br /> * Small child scenes capable of murdering in cold blood are truly shocking. I saw it for the first time in "the City of God" (2002). Here, François, murders his mother's lover while his father is in war. Excellent scene and very graphic. * The events of Béatrice, which his father rape until he discovers that he is pregnant, are truly shocking and interesting. Scene after rape, where Delpy burns her clothes and cleans herself. He asks his brother to hit him on the stomach in the hope that he has abortion. <br /> <br /> * The brother lowers scenes where his father digs his son's head down - when he warms. Later, her son dressed in women's clothes. <br /> <br /> The film won the César (French Oscar) for the best costume design, I agree that the costumes here really make the movie authentic. The location of the film is Château de Puivert, a true 12th-century castle and a historic monument in southern central France. A beautiful view of the castle and the mountain really helps to set the period for this movie. Three other César awards were nominated for the film, but they were all captured widely by the successful French film Au revoir, les enfants (1998). <br /> <br /> --- Issued by "Beatrice" in New York, March 1987.
