First of all I am a great fan of Tolkien and when I rely on most of my criticism for my books. <br /> <br /> Film is a standard adventure film, well done with special special effects, with nice sound. track and fine action. Now that this film was called something other than the master of the rings, the reviews would not be half the way they are here. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that it takes the main story from Tolkiens. books, but then, and "hollywood" everything he gets, numerous scenes in the book are eighteen lost or changed quite a lot, the characters are also changed from the book, which I think should be punishable! What a film does not have is a deep understanding of the symbols, I know that it is almost impossible to make a movie from a good book, and it didn't work here for the eighth time, mostly because the motif of characters remained blurred. as an adventure movie is rated 7+ / 10 Tolkien customization is rated 2/10 <br /> <br /> frankly, what on earth did Arwen rivendell ford? And like the comments that this movie "is the best ever", I can only say that eighty of you are very young or you haven't seen good movies ... <br /> <br /> Peter Jackson should have called this movie an adventure movie based on the Lord of the rings.
