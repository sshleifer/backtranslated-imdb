Pretty bad. This movie is grizzled (and honestly rock stupid) with an old prospector and his dog "Shep", ie Lassie, as well as a tedious child whose name I don't remember right now. At the beginning of the film, the old researcher DELIBERATELY is buried in some sand, so the poor dog has to dig him out. Why? Did he hate the dog? Anyway, somehow or in any other way, this idiot has managed to capture gold and talk to his partner. But the man is dead and his stupid second partner will be happy to dig the old Jonathan gold. Geezer tries to leave the dog with the dead son, but even the slowed mole does not want to stay with this child. There's a nice old preacher (peculiar reading stinky) and an oily man ending an old boy (surprise, surprise) and trying to steal all the gold. In addition, he poisoned the dog and also tries to kill the boy. So I think it's okay for the devilish and crazy Lassie..err ... SHEP does this guy at the end, though it's pretty annoying, which is basically a children's movie. There are extremely stereotypical (to the end of the racial end) "Native american" who speak without verbs (like the Me Make Camp Fire call). And it is pretty much poured, because apparently Lassie was too big to hire someone else. Bored. is not very interesting and then too dark. Not a great movie in any way.
