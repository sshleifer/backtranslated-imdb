Based on what I've seen in this example, I don't think I'll ever look at it again. It's not even far from believable and, frankly, Derek's character is just angry. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but seeing such a corrupted brat gets over and over again? Why would I want to watch it?!? No, thanks, there are many other exhibitions that include scary characters (such as Phil of the Future's Pim), where they don't win, or if they don't. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that I think it is a terrible picture of how to paint your brothers and sisters. Yes, life is not rosy, but one could try to portray a character that was not totally evil and victory. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is that you only look at it if you want to see the villain win.
