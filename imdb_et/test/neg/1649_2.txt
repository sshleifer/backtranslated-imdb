The perfect double bill on the terribly rodent "Beverly Hillbillies" is the same cruel, demolished "comedy", "Son in Law". The country girl Rebecca goes to wild California to take part in college, only with a lifestyle. "Resident Adviser" "Crawl" helps him settle down and soon these two are good friends. Bec decides to bring a funny "Crawl" home for Thanksgiving, which has obvious "fish out of the water" results. <br /> <br /> The only other comic corner Steve Rash (named here) reaches sexual here. It will hit us, but without results. Both comics fail and you know that the movie is captivating when "Crawl" grabs the harvester and writes its name in the corn field. <br /> <br /> The movie is dramatically too short for multi-family trials and personal counseling for "Crawl" misrepresentation. Between them, Pauly Shore and Carla Gugino manage to raise a few smiles, but to a small extent, while the rest is just a bait. The problem is that "Crawl" is actually almost impossible, and you find yourself spending the whole trick, thinking why Rebecca would like to spend a moment with her. However, if you are a fan of unsuccessful comedy, "Son in law" is the right sign. <br /> <br /> Sunday, November 10, 1996 - T.V.
