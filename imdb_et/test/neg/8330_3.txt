Well, that was my first IMAX experience, so I was mostly blown about it; in spite of retrospect, I cannot wish that it was any other (less monochrome) film. <br /> <br /> It was a terrible destruction that the "School Program" felt like he was all astronauts and that he was familiar with reading LOT like National Geographic Magazine in 3D. Strangely enough, it was a very two-dimensional quality that only occasionally exploded into reality and a lot of time seemed like a PowerPoint presentation. There was a moment in the film when the uncharted abyss opened; it seems like you feel that it was a bit of a WOW factor, but to be honest, it might be more about me than the IMAX virgin. <br /> <br /> Commentary by Tom Hanks, personally, I found very, (what is a nice way to put it?) "flagged nationalist" that didn't go too well in central London, deciding what we heard like we on the left. <br /> <br /> Over everyone I loved the IMAX experience, but I would have liked another movie the same day. The moon is not a very colorful theme and, frankly, many 3D effects have lost their black and white landscape. Everything that would have been fine, wouldn't have been in the case of documentary additions and disturbing things like interviews with American school children that had a bit of a break
