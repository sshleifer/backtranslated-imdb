Another recent comedy that shows that Hollywood can't even make the basics he'd made in his dream for decades. If the writer / director had had a brain, he would have created a movie about Stamp's tyranny around Jack Taylor. When he's in the movie early, there's something special, but it's a bit promising and occasionally fun. When he leaves most of the movies, and Kutcher has a "fun" visitor after falling from a boring guest, the film will completely break down. <br /> <br /> As a result, what should have been a satisfactory timer will become an inert smell.
