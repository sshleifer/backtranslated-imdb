"Midnight Clear" is a very prerequisite. Inadequate leaders send a group of over-educated, too bright geographical indications to an ambiguous mission to patrol an isolated farmhouse on the eve of the Bulge Battle. The GI meets the group battles regularly with tired German, and it turns out that they no longer want to fight. <br /> <br /> There is a problem here. It's really quite simple. When the Germans want to give up, they do it and that's the end of the movie. When the Germans want to fight, they do it and that's the end of the movie. So instead of playing GIs and Germans, games are played, even by throwing snowballs at one point. Interesting for one or two scenes, but soon it will become very annoying. After all, they are GERMANY. The enemy. Nothing in this film thinks they should not take or capture imprisonment. The film states that they are becoming more humane. In fact, a large part of what the German characters did, I want to shoot them, including one scene where a German officer refuses to deal with a Jew or to give up just a recruited man! Why should I take care of these signs? Just shoot them and go to the Bulge Battle. In any case, it's much more interesting. <br /> <br /> One good scene: GIs return to the German position record where they were Germans in their sights but didn't come. Walking over clearing, they realize that a group of Germans are leveling their mausers. The Germans are about 100 meters away. Then the GI does something I have never seen in any GI in any Sillywood movie. They throw their rifles off and throw their hands! Unusual, as it may occur in movies, is a perfectly sensible reaction if you have a rifle that is aimed at that distance. Although it seems far away, it is the point-empty range of their rifles. I put the odds that someone who worked on this movie was a bully!
