If I had to choose the most depressing movie, try to be embarrassed when I saw it. I know how good the original should be, it would be better than that. The film is so dark and depressing, but it is not interesting to see if I have seen depressing "thriller" -type movies recorded to balance and balance dark quality. It was missing, it was so disturbing to look, and there was nothing positive that it would be a classic film. I think the second IMDb poster was right, saying that this genre has just seen thrillers done in a much better way. I totally agree - I would like to skip it - maybe I look at the original for some days, but I doubt it. I'll give it to 2 out of 10.
