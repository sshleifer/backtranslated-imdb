I couldn't believe what I saw ... (once) brilliant actors who appeared in this terrible effort that should never be done. The plots are terrible and dialogues begin (first I thought it was spam) and working exhaustion. All of this is bad, ranging from cheap kits to fake backgrounds, an expanded range of land. Respectful filmmakers are struggling to realize their vision, but this pious, pathetic attempt in the mini-series does it for our television with 3 Oscar winners. I can only guess that all the actors involved are the writer and the director and were forced (maybe at the gunpoint) to mark this valuable T.V. trash can.
