It is nice that these three young directors have created good product values ​​and films with decent activity. Here are some good works. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, they suffer from what many modern gay cinema influences; recycled plots, too familiar devices (I've seen the "pool" too many times in gay men movies) and hackneyed scripts. The most amazing is all "Dorothy", whose unequivocal premise is that a cute young man is in trouble with NYC because there are no homosexual boys near him. <br /> <br /> Shorts play like sticky little gay afterschool specials. Not much imagination in writing or filling them; Basically, they follow a point-and-shoot, shot / reaction shot / master shot convention that gets painfully boring after five minutes. There is hope that Todd Haynes, Sadie Benning and late, great Marlon Riggs ... but not here. These films are incredibly centered, especially white bread and their values ​​are basically under homosexual civic sensitivity. Which is probably why they play so well in gay movie festivals.
