This is a male dwarf. I saw it in Sci-Fi some time ago and the idea seemed interesting. It could have been a good movie and I can't see a male smile, but certain specific references to men really get annoying. I can still watch the movie because it tries to at least redeem myself, suggesting that the women in the movie aren't really as violent as they claim, but it doesn't compensate for the really tiring man-care. I mean, I get a little bit of it, it's part of the film plot, but come on, it'll get tired after a while. Not only that, but to assume that most women in the world would accept homosexuality and that a few other heterosexual people would be in the minority to go to the "cabinet". It's just incredible. There are too many women who have cultural or religious constraints that would hinder it completely unbelievably. I mean, I know this sci-fi and I love sci-fi, but the best sci-fi is at least a hint that it's possible, and it's too unlikely. The words "Truth is stranger than fiction" arose because fiction must look at least plausible, but the truth is not always. This movie is not so. In addition, the film has a good way of working and creating a possible moral that something that happened was wrong, redeem it a little, but not enough.
