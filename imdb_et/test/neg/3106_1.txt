Yes, that's right. When I ask my friends this question: "What is the worst movie you've ever seen?" They can answer something like "Armageddon" (can you drill a hole?!?), "Shriek", "Nine Appearance Plan", "Medallion", "Scooby Doo" and so on. By insulting me, I thought you saw something that could be in the same natural environment as the human fertilizer department. then you don't know my friend anything. <br /> <br /> Crazy Six ... I remember the day I and my friend went to a local video store to rent a movie. Both of us had already gone through most of the films and "new movies" we see it with us. "Wow, here are some good actors. Says something about the mafia, lets just get out and get out of here." It was undoubtedly the worst film mistake in my film-loving life. It was also the worst mistake for everyone else: a movie lover or not. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is as fun as watching a glass of ice-cold water (or ice-tea ....) until it reaches room temperature. Watching this movie will make you dream of an eternal death dream when death is just a dazzling light and nothing, and then you will realize that you are watching your television screen. Can not make it. You are actually paying as much attention as you can. It's not a joke. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of bad film making. It is not such a bad thing that you can watch, point and laugh, this movie that is so bad that you really have no chance to get out of your memory. If you may not use the brain to eliminate the electric shock treatment. .... ... (Hey! This may be something like reminding me of it and my friend felt it after watching it.) <br /> <br /> Best wish for you from Albert Pyun. br /> <br /> -Yes
