This movie made me so stupid that I felt the need to create an IMDbis account to share my opinion with you. I liked Ashton Kutcher "Like Love" and that's why I still wanted this movie despite the current 4.2 rating. It is highly appreciated. I trusted the actor (any of them) to evaluate the script and refuse to participate in such low / now high quality production. This is very disappointing. "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo" was much better at home sitting. Things that didn't make sense here: everyone in the fist, the owner of the house leaves his precious pet to someone who doesn't know anything about caring for it. Secondly, the rule is not to let anyone in the house, but the janitor does not follow this simple rule. The door is not locked?! And so on..
