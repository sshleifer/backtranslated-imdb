I had a great hope for this hope, being one of my favorite works. <br /> <br /> Indeed, much is reasonable: Helen Baxendale is not bad for Lady Macbeth, but she has no devil that the original character is infused with. Many smaller characters work well and Scottish settings are great. <br /> <br /> For me, it is a great disappointment for the title as Jason Connery: he seems to be reading his lines with the wrong card. glasses - certainly for the first time. He can do that much better. Any production, compared to Ian McKellen (Macbeth 1979), who, in my opinion, gave the gold standard, will fight to evaluate it, but I really slept and had to go back before I could get through it - hardly a big sign. <br /> <br /> Honestly, one avoid.
