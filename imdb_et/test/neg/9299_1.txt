I was hoping for this movie full of hope. With so many capable and humorous actors led by Sir Ben, I thought it was a little treatable. The fact that I was wasting 93 days of my life was a film that was clearly DOA. There are some real problems with this movie and they are probably easier to list; 1. No jokes, I am not particularly hard at comedy - with high or low angles - but there is really no laugh in this movie. <br /> <br /> 2. Sir Ben mumbles every row, should he be drunk or not?!? 3. There is no effort to start, let alone how to develop the relationship between the interests of love. 2 people who accidentally get to each other on the street would be more instantly. <br /> <br /> 4. The whole talent put together is completely wasted. Don't be fooled by looking at its names. <br /> <br /> 5. By rubbing the cold ass, he rubbed more people in Gandhi than this unpleasant waste of time (by the way, like colored beards really looked horrible). I was hoping it was a slow burner, but in the end the only thing that could inject any life - and justice - is that Frank pulls out his 9 and gives up all the pain, starting with the road and ending with himself - sorry that it was so bad.
