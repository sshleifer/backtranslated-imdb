When my parents rented this movie, I was expecting a very funny movie, as Randy Quaid is very funny in comedy films. But this movie is not so funny and it is somewhat boring. You can see the surprise that comes a mile away and it will last a long time for a movie that is supposed to be only eighty minutes long. So I can honestly say it's not a movie in my favorites list. It can work for some people, but it just didn't work with me, it turned out to be quite slow in construction, almost nothing that amused me in the movie. Randy Quaid is wasted and the rest is a list of very delicate actors and actors. The prerequisite for the film was potential, as was the Quaid casting, but all this was just sprays, and adding a horror element just seems superfluous. One diary that the boy jumped over to the bed, and suddenly became a bloodthirst, was very well done and would have worked very well in a movie that was supposed to be a pure horror instead of seeing the first genre of comedy.
