I found myself watching the men of Sex Lives Of The Bulato who have a brilliant brow that is puzzled why so many talented and spiritual comedians decided to participate in such a totally humorous movie. <br /> <br /> Poo and wanking jokes are funny when you're at each other. Eighteen plus and you start losing friends around the water heater. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this movie may be a pleasure if you are a person who often plays practical jokes related to dog nonsense, brown bags and may or may not compete in "male" competitions at night by involving your peers in vomiting / urine, etc., if you are not back in your parents' cellar, which strikes your teenage wife. <br /> <br /> Even then, "Sexual Life ..." is hard to recommend. Perhaps, if you are truly strange in masochistic cranial operations and spend evenings happy with elderly people or looking at toilets, you may think that close-ups of the bogie are worth cinematographic distribution. <br /> <br /> I'd discuss characterization, narrative, or performances if I hadn't been turned off after a long tuna paste / vaginal comparison.
