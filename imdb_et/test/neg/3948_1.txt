Plot: A group of young people with ridiculous names (Hutch, Swink, Phineaus, and October) have been killed by their equally ridiculously named friend Nature. After the funeral they decide to share the property of their later friend. Among them is a video game called Stay Alive. The group decides that there is no better chance of showing their grief than everyone involved in small virtual bloodshed. But the more they play, the more they understand the connection between the game and the death of the 'Loomis' of the bad being. <br /> <br /> Production: This movie is just another new income from Hollywood's lowest budget, the PG-13 horror, aimed at capturing a youth high school crowd. The direction is insignificant, saying the fastest, music video-style cuts that make it difficult. The dialogue is so bad that it actually kills brain cells. The plot itself is so full of holes that we never learn where the game came from or why those who play it are dead. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this movie, though not entirely original, was a promise. However, poor performance of the camera on both sides makes it one big. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wanted to "kill someone in a video game, they will die in real life", take my advice and leave Stay Alive at a higher Brainscan.
