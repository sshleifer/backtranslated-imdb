It could have been a really good movie if someone just wanted to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> The story went exactly and headed to this point on every movie where "gray" characters become "good" and "bad" guys get their desserts and * boom * ... that's like a script and cast started doing things. <br /> <br /> What wouldn't it be? t has been so bad ... when the cast had just continued developing an already created character. But this is not the case and the film will soon become confused. <br /> <br /> My recommendation is to watch this movie for the last 30 minutes ... and then turn it off. Then imagine how you think the next 30 minutes will be based on what you have seen so far. <br /> <br /> Believe me, the end you come to seems much better than this movie actually. Trust me in this.
