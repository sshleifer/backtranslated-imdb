OK, this idea is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 1. Children do not own planes 2. Children do not fly with dirtbikes 3. It made the air force see as idiots 4. The father of the child would not endanger his entire career to allow his boy to rejoice with him. Reservkolonel <br /> <br /> The conclusions I am sure were worse than those. The soundtrack is the only quality of redemption of this cellulose waste. I'm sorry, but I just don't understand why in the world someone writes directly and would bring such an unbelevable junk. The Iranian Air Force is happy to filter a few parts of the aging F-14, and this boy speaks not 1, but 2 full loads and fueled by F-16? Give a break.
