I loved the original, look at it every year. but the other is garbage and it should never have been done. The other could have worked if there was another location. The son was not original and did not even function as one of Eddie's children. The third was too smart for Eddie because it reduced the role of the father. No other children out there. It was just better. I don't know why they even tried to make this movie. There was no continuation of the first movie. I did not even exist. It is sad that the actors did not even see that they were fools. Really bad movie. I just think I was wasting one hour or more on a bad movie and I really love all the national lanterns.
