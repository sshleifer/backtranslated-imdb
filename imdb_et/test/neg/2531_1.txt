I was so disappointed in this movie. I know the case very well, reading Timothy Dumas not only Mark Fuhrman's book, but also a much higher "Evil wealth: True story of Martha Moxley's murder in America's richest community". Anyone who looks at MURDER IN GREENWICH should know they're watching Mark Fuhrman's story, not Martha Moxley's story. This movie is nothing more than an ego trip to Fuhrman. Just see how his character is around, as if he was the second coming (yes, even women). Children playing actors see their roles too old and the repercussions of the 1970s are absolutely convincing. If this story is a hero, Marta's family, her mother Dorothy and brother John. They kept this case alive two decades before entering Fuhrman to make a name for themselves. They and Marta deserve a true story.
