There are many "bad" movies. Tune to channel 5 every night of the week and may be treated with one filmmaker or some other daily, shocking job. Perhaps there are movies that have caused more pain - it was harder to sit down - but in terms of writing, functioning, direction, cinematography, and cinema empty bases, Inbetweeners is a truly amazing effort and should be avoided at all costs. The only laugh she gave me was on the DVD behind documentary films, where geeky director Darren Fisher explains how it was his script that attracted the project's "talent"! Never underestimate the power of self-deception. <br /> <br /> Darren Fisher - UK Response to Edward D. Wood Jr.
