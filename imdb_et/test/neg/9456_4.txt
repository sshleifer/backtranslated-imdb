Ouch !! What a mess we have here. Not as much confusion as a painfully boring, semi-excuse to exploit. Brought to you only one, J.G. "Pat" Patterson, yes, the same Moonshine Mountain. Doctor Gore, formerly known as Body Shop, is, in my opinion, somewhat inspired by Frankenstein and God knows what else. Later, Mr Patterson also celebrates this joke, such as a heart loss scientist / plastic surgeon, who has recently lost his wife in a car accident and is saddled until it turns out that the next step is to kill countless women, perhaps to rob some of the tombs for body parts to be the perfect companion put together. It is not easy, but I thank the goodness of his Gregg, which is guaranteed to give hand and provide moral support. <br /> <br /> If there is evidence that some people's goals are not meant to be, gang. This Patterson hay plant was obviously never leading anything much less by following the good core in the footsteps of H.G. I've never seen a gore movie that just demolishes refuse to view the viewer as a single reason to continue watching. Even gore is boring. Almost alternately humorous, but it is impossible to say whether it is intentional or not. I choose "no". <br /> <br /> Shot in Charolotte, North Carolina (California Ax Massacre home), most likely a three-digit budget that a man, as he has been impossible, would probably rate the trash so we should give a good test for JG, I thought he tried (I assume) what is mostly the most said and this film is better than all the big budgets of the super heroes that theaters put out these days, though I realize it doesn't speak much. Moreover, Doctor Gore is a healing of Patterson's earlier failure, The Electic Chair, so it would be a little possible that he would have improved his craft in time if he hadn't died, so maybe it's not all that terrible, especially when compared to another movie DVD, how to make a doll that fuck, look at it. 4/10
