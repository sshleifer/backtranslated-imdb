Anyone who thinks this movie is big, desperately needs his head. It seems to me that this movie is fun. He has no good points. The props cost about $ 10 and the whole set looks like it can fall any time. Why are such films first made? It also had two of the most annoying characters I've ever met in a young boy in spacecraft and twentieth century red boys. This movie is almost as bad as "Cool as Ice", which marks an incredibly talented Vanilla's "wrong" ice.
