Deep Sea 3D is a stunning review of the underwater world, but few have had the opportunity to look at their first hand. <br /> <br /> In the opening queue, when the wave pulls into the audience that is sinking into the ocean now, filmmakers are using IMAX. The marmalade fish field fills the whole theater, shark strength toward us, predators catch rocks and eat their catches. It's a beautifully caught sea evening for the eyes. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, our ears do not provide the same treatment. The movie has been told by Hollywood stars Jonny Depp and Kate Winslet. Both sound so ridiculous that they enrich the visual pleasure positively. Depp sounds a little boring when Winslet sounds as if he had read the village idiot sleeping. I was shocked that his status actor would have been able to do so wrong. The script is rather silly and has very little depth. The soundtrack is full of strange, unrealistic sound effects, which I assume are funny, but they actually damage the material that should have been spoken for themselves. <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman has given an excellent score that will have a great impact on the life-undergoing life and humiliation of the marine life if he is allowed to play without foolish bubbles of sound or cancer balls that are pepper. Film is a technical admiration, but it is a childish script, annoying narration, and wrong sound effects that cannot be taken seriously.
