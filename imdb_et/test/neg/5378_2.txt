Okay, this movie never wins oscars. Citizen cane this movie is not ... But why should every movie be checked? when was the last time you saw a movie that was funny because it was not good, but because it was funny? does anyone remember the roger korman, the king of exploitation? <br /> <br /> Well, I had fun. I liked the cheese. just go do not think and prepare to throw a popcorn on the screen.
