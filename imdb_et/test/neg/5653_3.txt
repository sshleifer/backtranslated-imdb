Miranda Cosgrove is known for her debut at the "School of Rock" with Jack Black and her role in Megan's "Drake and Josh" exhibitions and has become a public fan of Nickelodeon, so it's no surprise that Dan Schneider would create an exhibition for him. Unfortunately, it is as bad as, if not worse, "Amanda's show". <br /> <br /> "iCarly" has about three friends, Carly, Sam and Freddie, who have become idols in the junior high community through the webcam show "iCarly". Carly and Sam are hosts and Freddie shoots. Carly also has an older brother, Spencer, who is a fun Jerry Trainor who is known for his work "Drake and Josh" as Crazy Steve. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you this. Do not believe that 8.3 out of 10 exhibitions would be sent because it is pathetic in almost every aspect. Probably Dan Schneider went through about 5 minutes of teenage learning because I can see he says, "iPod? Iphone? Shine? Aha! Teenagers love something, starting with" i "!" and most of the concerts used in "Drakes and Josh", if not, they are just very dry and forced jokes that don't even read generosity, like "Do you want me to lift AC to 60 degrees?" We want you to make it up to 60 marinades! " Not only that, but when you look closely, almost all the sets of "Drake and Josh" and "Ned's Declassified" were just spitting and polishing with random things to try and make it different. br /> <br /> Scenes where the show shows iCarly's network transmission are as terrible as the entire series itself. The dialogue that takes place in them is a terrible bad thing that some may accept, because it is just two friends who are playing in front of the camera, but what is actually strange, humorous, what they like "Random Dancing!" And it just gets deeper there. <br /> <br /> Miranda and Jennette don't work the most. Nathan Kress, who played Freddie, is unbelievable from time to time, but he does a good job. The person who actually steals the exhibition is Jerry Trainor's humorous ability, who fits very well with his "defensive parent brother" role and his wide-mouthed kissing can make pretty funny segments. Too bad that they are not frequent because it could have shown the show with an extra star in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Dan Schneider has to do this exhibition only to give Miranda Cosgrove a playground that was born on his cable to get around and uncomfortable jokes and pathetic chip cards in all directions, because everyone else has an exceptional talent that is buried under ill-performed script and weightless behavior. Dan Schneider did a great job with "Drake and Josh", so it's a real disappointment that "iCarly" is such a mistake. Jerry Trainor's action recorded 1 out of 10 in this exhibition, but he alone cannot save iCarly as terribly as it is.
