Technically terrible ("jumping") and awesomely amateurs "meat" require a lot of patience to sit down and most likely turn off most viewers; but the dialogue is truly astonishing and Joe Dallesandro, who reveals his body in almost every scene, also gives a completely convincing performance. Certainly, the polished "trash can" made two years later is a definite step forward. I suggest you look at it. (* 1/2)
