So after the first disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie, which seemed not to be like the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy: Advent Children has given itself a warm welcome and now a special fan base. The reason for the success of the film is understandable, as it has lush graphics, fast moving combat sequences, and some cool as hell signs. However, if you have not played FF7, you are unlikely to enjoy this movie because it is a feature film without any explanation and you will probably disappear from the ticket even if you have played the game. Secondly, there is no character formation without the prior knowledge of the game being limited to "cool" and "not cool" opinions about characters. Of course, for FF7 fans, the movie is definitely at least entertaining for entertainment purposes, and it's cool to see all the characters you love about the game made with pretty amazing computer animation. The last complaint, the film, at least in my opinion, was trying to cram too much in less than two hours, so it seems so hasty in the last half hour. If you played and enjoyed FF7, if it is useful to watch, though something too special. If you haven't played FF7, it's best if you watch that movie before.
