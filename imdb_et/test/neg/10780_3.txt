If you are at home at the weekend, very dull and have no need to move, you can't do anything better with your life in the next few hours. Making this movie and scripting and making movies in general is not so bad, so it's possible to sit through it. This is obviously a film they would show in high school health class to teach the dangers of pre-marital sex. Or they could also show that they teach very flat music threats - that "rock" band Brian Austin Green is really terrible, I think it is a much greater threat to society than unwanted parents.
