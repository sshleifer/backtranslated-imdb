This film talks about the complicated friendship, romance and fraud that occurred between two men and two women during World War II. <br /> <br /> A lot of effort has been made to make the "Edge of Love" the right time. However, I think this effort is too great, especially with regard to the color tone. Most of the first part of the movie is processed so much that it has a strong bluish tone. It's hard to find out who's in that tone. <br /> <br /> Another harmful point is the imaginary use of an image splitting lens. There are many scenes that have three or four images of the same thing, such as three Keira Knightley's smiling faces or four pairs of hands. It just makes the film confusing and difficult to follow, not artistic. <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, it is plain boring. The way the story develops is not involved at all. The unstable nature of Sienna Miller is annoying. In fact, all the main characters are tedious and unlikely. Keira Knightley's accent is impossible to understand, making it an additional obstacle to understanding the plot. <br /> <br /> I strongly advise you to avoid "Edge of Love" if you watch a movie just to understand great costumes, nice sets and lighting.
