This is a flic that can be safely avoided. a childish plot and poor Cameron action (he shouldn't take those serious roles - they're not suitable for him) In addition, he sees more prominent, we see, big is Charlies in Angels and he was great. Mary ... The Pope wouldn't be a good US president and on the contrary, my position is that there are some actors / actors who are fit for some type of character and Cameron doesn't fit this serious housewife type - there are a dozen other actors who would have done a lot better work. The film itself is quite unbelievable and minor in the plot (did I write to Juvin correctly?) I noticed a comment from another reviewer who has given The Box 10 ratings, who were commenting on other evaluators who gave 1 or 2 ratings and could not write. I mean whats the spelling got the movie to watch? Does he think that those who write correctly would appreciate this film more than those who could not? Professor at C'mon.
