What can I say about a movie about a cross-sectional gangster? Not so much. In the era of making an average indie-style movie, the timing of this film is wrong. Editing is just terrible. As for the story of gangsters, it could have pulled out if the gangsters had no character. Everyone just seemed to be there for some kind of stroke. None of them was funny. The usual suspects in this film are a golden-headed whore, a dead mafia father who wants his son to make his business a legitimate, best girlfriend in one lining. But the main character, the gangster, who likes to dress up as a girl. Only his motivation to dress like a girl is that she got into the wife? Weird. The end of the movie had to be a pound of coffin. At least, it was anti-climate. I mean, I understand how indie filmmakers don't have the equipment to turn it out, but they can also use water sprayers. In general, I would say that the jump that would lead to it (red carpet premiere in Vancouver) was disappointing.
