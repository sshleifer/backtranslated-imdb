... out of this movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry, it was released at Cleveland International Film Festival. There was no subtitle on our copy, so I asked the festival staff if there was a problem with the print. "Not so ..." I said. "The director wants it this way". Again, sorry to say my French language is hardly a high school optional level (more than 3 decades ago). Much of the original dialogue is in French, so I'm sure I missed some of the key words in the nuances and many details. <br /> <br /> I have rated it "1", mainly because the director who has ever made subtitles refusing the subtitles in the movie seen by the American audience. Excuse me, even if most Americans don't know where Europe is on the map, even the film festival audience should not know the "native" movie. Even if some of us do not know Finnish, I still look for some subtitles of "dolts" that are not complicated enough to have 37 different languages. I put this ego on David Lynch, not Litvack.
