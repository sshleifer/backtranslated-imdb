This movie was potential. The script was not bad, and it gave an interesting dark atmosphere to suicide, patrol issues, regrets, and - as Chris says - "10 years now". This is a sharp contrast from the original MAG7, which was brilliant, humorous and even a bad guy was lovable. <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting change in tones, and if they had developed more characters, maybe I would like to but it's too much time for free and together poorly edited battle scenes. At one point you will see a fall of the horse and 5 seconds later you will see the same scene. But not many people notice this because there are already two dozen horse rides (I'm not exaggerated), and then we've gone down. <br /> <br /> What brings me to my headline review. This movie was widely cut due to the cruelty of the animals, so the probability (if you decide to look at it), you get a dehydrated, child version. There's a bullfight, where the matador pulls the bull and suddenly, when the crowd rejoices, there is no bull, just the matador in the empty arena. Like wow, maybe the bull was Jedi, I know. More likely, the scene is cut. <br /> <br /> Later there is a race where one of the birds in the original version is terribly upset before luring the crowd. It was cut. But we still see enough to get pretty annoying. <br /> <br /> But the worst scenes are the horse throws. One after the other, you can see the legs of the horses, sending thousands of pounds on the horse's head. In one scene, the horse is thrown and when it hits the ground during paralytic seizures, the risk of explosion goes underneath it. <br /> <br /> This movie was produced in 1966 when Hollywood just started to regulate the brutality of animals on film. This is probably one of the last ways to see it. So, when such things float on the boat, check it out and get some excitement. But if not, you're upset or bored.
