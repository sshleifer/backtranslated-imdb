Harrison Ford plays Dutch Sergeant Den Broeck of the Columbia Police Department. He's trying to get bad guys, but he doesn't do a very good job. When we meet him, he tries to catch a corrupt secret officer. Kristin Scott Thomas plays the New Hampshire Senator, Kay Chandler, trying to re-elect. She runs against a candidate who has a lot of money. The last thing she needs is the death of her husband. He's a politician - he can't kick off feelings. <br /> <br /> This story moves slowly and painfully. I looked at my watch every five minutes and thought when it was over! The story goes missing, the manager, Sydney Pollack, doesn't have to take it. We don't want to know about Dutch police investigations. They outline some insight into the spin control of politicians and campaigns. After seeing the film, I was still wondering why they were romantic. Does anyone mourn anymore? Don't you need more than two weeks to consider even a horizontal approach to someone else? <br /> <br /> It was good to see actress, comedian, Chicago native and Second City Alumni Bonnie Hunt. His role is not necessarily a comic relief, but he was the only one I wanted to see more. Do it yourself, wait for it on the video if you want to see it at all.
