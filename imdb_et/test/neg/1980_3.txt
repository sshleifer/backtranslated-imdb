I was dirty with girlish-glee when I got this movie right after I looked inside the spirits. Well, November came. And went. Followed by December. Oh, look, today January 31st, 2006. Not yet published in the US. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm so glad I had a friend who had a booted subtitled copy. D <br /> <br /> Well, cg was great. Not as good as expected, but almost perfect. However, I struggled for the unnatural movements the kids made during the movie. I thought we had adopted it now. I also didn't care about the appearance of the anime given to their faces. I had the impression that they were shooting a film with a realistic look, but most of the characters are bigger than ordinary eyes, especially girls. But they had a personality, but I give them that. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not a big fan of anime, I have to say I'm impressed with wild fighting scenes. They were animated beautifully and were hanging on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> About the first two. <br /> <br /> And there's the biggest mistake of Advent Children. This is usually just a bunch of hyperstilized fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> Another epic proportion of FF7 had been promising for years. Instead, they gave a little piece of cg with a lot of ground to apologize for being just under two hours long. You don't really know the characters. The only way you could understand most of what happened in the movie would have been if you had played. We barely looked at them before they fought this current threat. <br /> <br /> The more wounded the fans are terrible, which most FF7 characters were given. They were nothing but a cloud "I call when I need you, but I probably didn't sing singers." And to add them to the sick, they would throw each character alone and above the cloud alone. This little part here was so cheesy when I almost turned it off. I would have been much more impressed if he just jumped all over, ritsocheting out of the walls to bring himself up. <br /> <br /> It was even more damaging if they reduced the Turks less than - just a comic relief. It was good for the game, but it's a cinema. People do not act in a tough battle like characters. They took away their dignity: / <br /> <br /> And the spoiler (yes yes, most of you probably already know). Who remembers that Darth Maul has been upgraded to SW: Episode 1? Yeah, now, look, but with Sephiroth. This is correct. He had 5 minutes of screen time. Maybe it. Finish the Pile: P <br /> <br /> If this movie is for fans, then make the pitch. If this refers to the direction of the FF series, I doubt you will see much of your money. I played your games with great story and great characters. <br /> <br /> You were able to do something epic. Something a really beautiful masterpiece that rides all of the Disney CG movies. <br /> <br /> Instead, you gave us a piece of meat with nothing to keep it together. How to go. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure the rest of the fans paused for a moment and just tried to draw attention to everyone, but CG they know what I'm talking about. Well, I appreciated it 5/10, but after thinking about it, I'll give it 3/10 because they could have done better. They've done better. And it's just sad. <br /> <br /> If they want to do something about FFVII again, they have to do it for the first time.
