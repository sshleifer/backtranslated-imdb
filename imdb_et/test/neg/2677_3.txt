There's a lot of wrong with this movie. It can be said that continuing "Halloween" was a bad idea first and we should be happy that previous entries, even the lowest, were still traceable. But even, "Halloween: The Michael Myers Curse" - even today - is so bad, it's shocking. Poor movie making is the worst. There's so much to blame. But where to start? Which shoulder is this fault? <br /> <br /> Was this overall management of Joe Chapelle's style? Well, at least the sixth installment is fresh on the visual front. And so far from the visual effects, you can see that Michael kills in some pretty terrible sense, even if it doesn't match the overall tone of the series. <br /> <br /> "Difficult script is the culprit? To be fair, he did the best. By the time you reach the sixth box in any series, you go away. Finding Rimi as a reason for Michael is not so bad that it it is interesting, especially how it is dealt with here. And it really does not help that the movie was hacked and stitched back so many times that the story ended completely lost. Afterall, this was the first studio movie "Halloween" and we all know what happens when too many chefs get in the kitchen Heck, look at the incredible areas they dragged "Hellraiser"? I think everything is to blame, because besides the actors and the visual effects boys it seems that no one has tried to offer a decent flick. it, slice it, dice or electric shocks until it explodes, "Halloween: The Michael Myers Curse" was never a good movie, marking the lowest level ever for this series that almost destroyed with a great deal of credibility to Michael Myers, "Curse" is just that: cursed. The nail angle was never interesting and probably not expanded. Unnecessary gore is so inappropriate and replaces the tension that is the trademark of "Halloween". After all, the movie ends the mindset, stops pushing the plot, and simply tries to find ways to kill the characters and finish the movie before something else disappears. It is sad that Donald Pleasence's end result is immortal in this film, even if he did the best he could in the worst conditions. And in most cases, this film also has other strong cast members. Paul Rudd, of course, plays a strange, social adult, Tommy Doyl, while Marianne Hagan is doing a fair job under the guidance of a sympathetic female. On the other side of the coin was the disgraceful transformation of Jamie Lloyd and, thanks to God, Devin Gardner no longer makes films. Like a child following "Man in Black", Danny is against Jamie because he is annoying, somewhat unbelievable in his role. It's sad if you can't even feel sympathy for a child in a horror movie. But I think it's "Halloween 6" at a glance. In essence, it is an anti-"Halloween" made by a director who didn't know what he was doing and a studio that had his own agenda. Hell, even music is bad. Many try to update it - "Halloween" because it is a sci-fi twist, but in fact it's just stupid. Save some good visual and decent characters, "The Michael Myers Curse" is almost as bad as it gets. And it's from a fan!
