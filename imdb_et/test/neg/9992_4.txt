Some describe CALIGULIA as the most controversial film of this era. While this is debatable, it is definitely one of the most embarrassing: almost every big movie related to the film has tried to stay away from it. The author, Gore Vidal, actually digged (with mixed results) to remove his name from the movie, and when the stars saw the film, their reactions varied loudly from an outrageous strategic silence. Of course, they wanted to go away. <br /> <br /> For some time it seemed like this. CALIGULA was a large post office and critical flop (Guccione had to show it for general screening), and although the film appeared on the VHS home market, so many censorship issues were raised that it was edited and the edited version was the only one widely available for over a decade. But now CALIGULIA is on DVD, available in both edited "R" and original versions. And undoubtedly, John Gielgud is glad he didn't live to happen. <br /> <br /> The only way to describe CALIGULIA is that it is something DEEP THROAT meets with David Lynch DUNE with Fellini out of the day. Vidal's manuscript fell into the hands of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, who used Vidal's image to lead the project and attract big stars - and then threw out Vidal's biggest script and brought soft porn director Tinto Brass. When Guccione felt that Brass's work was not clear enough, he photographed Giancarlo Lui hardcore material cleverly. <br /> <br /> Viewers who watched the edited version may ask what the whole noise is, but those who watch the original cut will quickly realize that it will not leave any imagination. There is a huge amount of nudity and it remains in the editable version, but the original is accompanied by XXX scenes: a very clear gay, lesbian and straight sex, kinky sex and grand orgy with dancing Roman guards. for a good measure. The film is also incredibly violent and bloody, rape, torture and distortion. In a particularly disturbing scene, the man is slowly pushed to death, the woman pushes his body and his genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs. <br /> <br /> In the documentary film Guccione accompanying the DVD, he said he wanted the film to reflect the reality of the pagan Roman. If so, he was left unmarked. We know very little about Caligula - and what we know little is questionable at best. This exclusion, slaves and random sex was not common in Roman society, where adultery was punishable for a crime. And, of course, ancient Rome has ever looked like a strange, somewhat oriental, strange space-age set and costumes that designers offered. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, these kits and costumes are often fantastically beautiful, and while cinematography is widespread, at least they are fair; the score is also very, very good. The most successful member of the volcano is Helen Mirren, who succeeds in engaging our interests and compassion with Caesar Caeson; Gielgud and O'Toole also flee in relatively good forms. The same cannot be said about McDowell, but he does not have much work to do. <br /> <br /> The film has a dark charm, but ultimately it is strange, more interesting for her design and planar wonders than for content. Some of the bodies on the screen (including McDowell and Mirren) are very beautiful and some sexual scenes work very well as pornography ... but then some of them are so harsh that they can force you to abstain and the bloody and grotesque character of the film reduces his eroticism. Once you've done that, it's worth seeing once, but once is enough. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
