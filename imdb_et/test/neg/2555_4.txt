I couldn't do the woman who played the mother. I wanted him to close. He had a strange way of speaking and the lines he read did not make it better. I had no idea why the men of the city were so involved with him to create all these problems, except that in the city of men he seemed to be the only woman over ten and sixty. Even after a terrible tragedy, his voice was not human, he seemed able to capture the events of his life. He gave his lines to the same emotion, he said, "I love you", "I hate you", "the bank is closing", "my dress is fire". Was it actually filmed in Ireland? The sun created throughout the film and the characters seemed surprised at the harvest shower at the time of harvest. I lived in the summer of 2002 in Ireland, in the wet summer of the century. Most of all was still harvested. If Irish farmers could only be harvested during long periods of dryness, then the country would be hungry for hundreds of years. It doesn't seem to make much money to make a movie. The black and white setbacks seemed to be filmed with the security cameras you get at Sam's Club.
