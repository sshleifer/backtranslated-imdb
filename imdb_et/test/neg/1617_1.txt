* Spoilers here * <br /> <br /> Where do I start with how stupid this film was? "Mole-sized people living under the garden, attacking the inhabitants of a larger house" !!! When I first sat down to watch this movie, I didn't know that the protagonists with poltergeists and the like, just 10-inch high goblins, seemed very easy to bother. I watched it because I like to see the end of movies even terrible. this movie was terrible. My girlfriend, who went to sleep in the first ten minutes after finding that it was good to sleep, thought it was fun to be bothered to look at it all. <br /> <br /> Small goblins, even in large quantities (the idea is silly, I know), are about as scary and threatening as the flat cola. They managed to drive only one guy "deadly" and kill the cat before they were blown. I mentioned suck it?
