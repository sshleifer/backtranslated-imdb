I was caught up in the assumption that the exhibition was demons. Hell. And the doorway to hell. What I didn't know was that I was watching some boys running around the tunnels threw the little kids who might / might not be demons for the whole movie. Of course there was some dialogue and a great underground landscape, but the lack of the plot, the advanced characters, all the shocks or the development of development was not very much at all. Oh, and there were no special effects. The entire budget was spent on actresses' salaries, kits, and a lot of time running around with the camera. <br /> <br /> The end was one of the typical eternal boring endings that would make you say, "I suffered this movie of boredom !?" If you want to see demons and a doorway to hell, I promise you that it would be better to serve trailer viewing for Hellgate: London, which is shorter than this movie for 5 minutes, pack more dialogue, character development, action, plot and satisfying conclusions than that. <br /> <br /> The second star is an effort, but generally it is a rating if can't stand out for a film that is eye-catching, and more promising than promising.
