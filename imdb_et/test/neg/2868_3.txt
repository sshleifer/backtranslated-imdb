I was just looking at Fingersmith and I'm stunned to see an 8/10 average rating for the show. <br /> <br /> Not only is it difficult to follow the plot, but it seems that the character was applied randomly <br /> <br /> The characters were enough, but their characters are completely one-dimensional in the process of making twists and turns. When this happens, the story really strikes the plane and becomes annoying. And if no one sees miles of miles of predictable lesbian size, it is at home in the most banal terms at the end. The end of the scene is disappointing and called, and anyone who sat back and went "Ohhh, so they were carpets all the time!" Must have been in the evening. br /> <br /> Two stars for almond hockey in an earlier scene that was at least a bit dirty, not the rest ...
