Susan accidentally gets into the drug smuggling ring, while her realtor gets a flat tire to see her house. Mongo (who only has one week to retire), who thinks he knows much more than this effervescent blonde, is actually trying to make sure he doesn't tell anyone and therefore starts one of the more bone-based films that I I've sat through. <br /> <br /> All the participants in this movie can't really do the least. Susan makes a pretty hero for most of the film (she would never have escaped repeatedly, if not, because apparently every member of the film wants to have sex with her) and she doesn't take offense for the last 20 minutes. When he goes out, some general "I have had enough" talks, preach to the sister, that I thought many times when I watched it. <br /> <br /> My degree: D-
