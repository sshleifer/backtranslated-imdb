This episode sucks. <br /> <br /> Over the past few years, I've been following all the "next generation" and "Voyager" episodes and now looking at "Enterprise". <br /> <br /> I am enjoying this series thoroughly. Until this episode. I looked at the screen for fear of destruction of nature and entertainment. This is rather a hit test. <br /> <br /> It does not create characters, but throws them out of the limb - and leaves the audience feeling. It doesn't help to build a series. <br /> <br /> Why it ever got into the air, amazed me. Was it written? Was it management? Was it a manufacturer? We probably never know. <br /> <br /> But one bad apple is not bad. I say I hope this is just one.
