Since Disney often ignores the quality of animation and the need for its good plots, it was actually a nice surprise. I don't know why Disney doesn't pay more attention to his descendants. The quality of the graphics is always lower; there is no background worthy of Disney's name, unsuccessful plots, and a worse dialogue, where the actual story is ignored, or caricature drawings are almost always worse than Saturday's drawings and quality. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is still poor compared to the Disney originals, and the dialogue is quite a trick, the story and overall performance were really quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Although it is not so exciting, it doesn't first capture magic and / or mystery. There's some clue that's drawn here and there. <br /> <br /> Kids love it anyway. <br /> <br /> This price is 4.5 / 10 ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
