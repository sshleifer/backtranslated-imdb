Directed by Diane Keaton and Franz Lidz. Young mother Selma Lidz (Andie MacDowell) struggles with a very serious illness and her self-proclaimed inventor, Sid (John Tururro), has little in the emotional department. Satisfied with the new home situation, their sensitive son Steven (Nathan Watt) decides to stay with his two eccentric uncles Danny (Michael Richards) and Melvin (Lou Cutell) until his mother is well. Steven seems to be happier and even interested in his strange uncle's lifestyle; he even decides he wants to change his name to Franz. At the beginning of the 1960s, this drama was a bit comic ... it became guilty. Not a MacDowell fan, UNSTRUNG HEROES ensures my attitude; although i enjoyed the movie and it is not all waste.
