One of the worst movies I've ever seen! After watching it, I walk out of what happened? I'm confused today if anyone could explain this movie to me? The level of performance and image quality is so bad that you think you are looking at a school project made with a home video camera. First, I can't believe how some people can give this movie 10 stars. Because it's an incredibly bad movie! This movie is not scary at all! There is also no typical horror. The plot and the film's operation was terrible. It's not fantastic, surreal or spooky, it's just a badly bad Turkish movie. And finally, there were many unnecessary scenes and unnecessary characters. When I looked at "Gomeda", I fell so hopeless, so sad for a young Turkish filmmaker. Please do not make "cinema" like that!
