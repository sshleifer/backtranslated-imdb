This soap is worse than it is toxic. Several television programs that have been corrosive to British society over the last twenty years are the best example of Eastenders. Over the past two decades, this exhibition has celebrated an oaf, a thug, a broad boy, sour, gobi, violent, sexually incontinent, criminal, ignorant, ambitious ... <br /> <br /> How many times did Eastenders "reflect life"? Exactly life on the planet? <br /> <br /> It is written in "working class" characters, as middle-class people have taken a creative writing course. You want to show your middle-class peers how familiar they are with the "working class" that they dream of a lumpen, a citizen of Eastend. <br /> <br /> It has less toxic effects on some minds than the others to treat fiction, and so we find members of the real population who expect attitudes and behavior from Walford residents. <br /> <br /> So it happened that Eastenders reflects on life; but only after life was Eastenders reflected. <br /> <br /> Other soaps have followed the footsteps of EE, filling their stinky weapons with ugly, potato-based, shaved elephant characters. constantly.
