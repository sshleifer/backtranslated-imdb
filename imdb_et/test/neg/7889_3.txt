Indeed, as a light entertainment, this film is a success both in the first half of the year and when it goes out quickly when it falls fast. Harry (Judd Nelson), "reformed" burglar and Daphne (Gina Gershon), an ambitious actor, work as a living window mannequin at a department store where they leave one night and they are locked, after which they feel their less than protective glass, seeming today killing. The seeming murderer Miles Raymond (Nick Mancuso), a local sculptor, will return the next day to watch the dummies, because he realizes that they are the only possible witnesses for the last night's violent event, and when one of the posing "flinches" begins to have fun. Daphne and Harry report their findings to the local police station, but when a detective who takes a crime report remembers Harry's criminal background, he becomes cynical. The film has many ways of filming, and it can be used by most of them, including a mandatory slow-down bedroom passion. In Vancouver, a low budget, even the procedural aspects of the police, was shot. Always capable of Gershon trying to do something, but Mancuso is incredibly hysterical because he is obviously attacking his lines. While the film tends to be pointless, operator Glen MacPherson prefers not to follow, as he creates a camera and illuminates some of the perfectly realized compositions that the viewer can focus on, ignoring plot holes and without dialogue. A well-drafted result based on action is provided by Hal Beckett. This dialogue is initially somewhat fresh, and Nelson and Gershon gave it poorly, but in a later context of consistency and logic, predictability changes. The direction reflects the absence of original ideas or viewpoints, and post-production errors make the job go back beyond what is expected of a main thriller.
