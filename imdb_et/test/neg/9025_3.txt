Even John Johnne's dead fans have to admit that this movie is a mess. Wayne's character, John Tobin, is a gang who killed his parents, led by half of Apache, a half-white renegade Pandro Zant (Earl Dwire), who is the name of Mexico. <br /> <br /> There are almost too many stupid features that need to be read, but those who stand out are Sheriff Williams (Jack Rockwell), who attaches Zanton to his launch ring, so all Zanti must do that release. his boot! Tobin's friend Dusty (George pre-Gabby Hayes) takes a knife thrown back and goes back to the new story. In the chase scene, Tobin traverses the intermittent inflow of log walls surrounded by ears and loses his mark, drives (actually walks after) Zanti walking through the desert. Zanti is looking for water and drinks from the water, but OOPS !, he didn't see the sign above the water body, saying, "Don't drink poison". When Zanti dies, Tobin continues his surveillance after the rest of the gang, and kills the whole batch by blowing up a stone wall that seals the secret passage to the Dusty's cabin - as comfortable. <br /> <br /> At the end of the scene, it seems that the new Sheriff Tobin speaks to the new Mrs. Tobin (Sheila Terry), Dusty's daughter Ruby, who was previously the target of Zanti's gang abduction. Apparently, the studio's Wayne's desire to become a girl in almost all of her films, because this type of ending is almost predictable for almost all Lone Star films.
