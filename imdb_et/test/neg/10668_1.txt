If you feel Reshammiya as the singer has too much pain on TV, try to watch her in the movie for 2 hours straight. His face is boring throughout the film and it is very comical to see that he is acting in demanding and intense scenes. It's far from a true love story (getting the right spell, Reshammiya - it's not luv or reeal) and has been doing Mithun da dance with him, car rickshaw scenes, Himesh being imprisoned, Himesh accused of murder, he escapes from prison, etc ... If you you want to laugh, there's nothing like this, especially scenes where he calls Mehboobas. If you despise the nose and want curiosity to know what two hours of Reshammiya can do for you, don't miss this movie. <br /> <br /> The End. The only saving arm that this movie has is cinematography, locations and a few songs. Even if you are a dead Reshammiya fan, avoid this movie at all costs.
