The plot of the movie is quite simple: the outbreak of the virus made the population's meat eat zombies. Those who left were "hunters". <br /> <br /> First, it's not the worst zombie movie. Among the worst is "Zombiez" and the infamous "Zombie Lake". <br /> <br /> I think the idea of ​​"Quick and Undead" was very good, just disastrous. Given the budget they were supposed to work on, this film seems very good. I didn't forget to look at it at all. Special effects were strong, although they used CGI once (the fat zombie got off the head), but everything else (gore, guts) was pretty good. However, action is terrible. Our main guy looks like young Clint Eastwood, other "actors" aren't even worth noting. As far as the plot is concerned, they didn't work enough to develop the story. <br /> <br /> Bad: Action, low budget. Good: special effects, movie idea. <br /> <br /> In general, this flick deserves me 4/10. It's not as bad as people say. Imagine ZOMBIE WESTERN, then watch this movie.
