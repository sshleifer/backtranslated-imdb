Honored Western author Budd Boetticher is a strangely inappropriate story of today's police and robbers that suffers from a strong lack of emotional belief. Boetticher seems to have abandoned his trial and solved the first race because Joe Cotton and Rhonda Fleming made little effort in their roles, giving the lines a secure and energy-free. The light polite employee Leon "Foggy" The party works in an internal work that goes bad and gets killed in the process of his wife. She flees from prison and immediately tries to kill her detective wife. Hundreds of police officers have been mobilized to keep him from entering a program that has moved to another place, but do you not know the last moments in the movies when we have a blurry back leg behind the victim (who thought the bus was going) back to the house was a sound move), while when the police company watched and took over what action to take. Sound potty? You should see it. It's all so and more. <br /> <br /> The Lucien Ballard camera work does a decent job of bringing a knife to suburbs, but editing is inadequate and formless, and it clears its speed and pace. Like Poole, Wendell Corey is the best film that can create great compassion when she gently moves from the soul to the murderer. Aside from these attributes, Killer fails evenly in construction and execution, making this message clear. Go west to the old Budd.
