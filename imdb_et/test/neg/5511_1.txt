I've been trying to commemorate the name of this movie for years (of course not sequentially). I saw it in a local dollar theater when I was 11, and it was so cruel that I almost went out; I don't think I was allowed to leave before the movie ended. Anyway, it just seemed to me to see the worst movie. I can finally give it a worthy evaluation. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (it was strangely satisfying)
