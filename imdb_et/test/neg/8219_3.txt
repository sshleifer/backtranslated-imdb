Of all the drivers who ever sit behind the camera, Wellman could break your heart faster. Even Ford. But that's one of his worst. Even he seemed to know that, probably because of this Jewish treatment, not much over Bonanza or Big Valley. <br /> <br /> However, one moment, typical of Wellman, who goes somewhere to crush you, is the death of a Indian Gable woman. He's gone to give his child some water and WHAM is killed with an arrow. No warning. Nada. <br /> <br /> One of the most shocking, unprepared deaths in the cinema. Especially after the whole hour of love for a woman is what seemed buggy. Of course, his follow-up is burdened with Wellman's complete indifference to the film. Even so, it is a reminder of the power he has always had at his best.
