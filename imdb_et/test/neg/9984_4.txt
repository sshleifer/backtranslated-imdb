Although his plot has been taken from ancient Roman history, Caligula is not made of an epic of swords and sandals such as Spartacus or Gladiator. (This style of filmmaking was in the late 1970s). Rather, it resembles a soft core porn film and a video with an unpleasant cross. At least the shortened 150-minute version does it. I've never seen a full 210-minute version, but on the basis of the descriptions on this page, it seems to be closer to the cross between a tough porn movie and a video unpleasant. <br /> <br /> As you would expect from a Penthouse publisher movie, you can see many bare muscles and loves filming Caligula's sexual perversion, including his blood with Drusilla. . Perhaps the editor of a magazine so closely related to the heterosexual male lifestyle is unexpected that there are so many male flesh and many scenes on the screen. The gender obsession is counterbalanced by an equal obsession with violence, as Bob Guccione, Gore Vidal and Tinto Brass tried to kill two stones with one taboo. (A remarkable coincidence is that the director of such a harsh movie should be called "brass" and the author of such a passionate scenario should be called "Gore"). The characters are killed or violated in various sadistic ways, and there is a charming scene of homosexual rape. Emperor Caligula and his predecessor Tiberius were certainly known for their spoiled lifestyle, so the focus of the film on gender and violence might not be historically inaccurate. But I doubt whether such a concentration is necessary to help us understand this period of time in Roman history. Both the fall of the Roman Empire and the Gladiator were determined during the reign of Commodus, both the Emperor and Caligula. In either case, the filmmakers did not consider it necessary to make their movie "Up Pompei!", "Emmanuelle" and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" blends, and both films are much better than Caligula. <Br / The action in the film is not very bad except for some exceptions, such as the terrible wooden Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla. Malcolm McDowell makes Caligula suitably crazy. (Suitable, that is, in the context of this film. True Caligula was undoubtedly both cruel and eccentric, but historians have discussed whether he is actually mentally ill. The great mystery is precisely why so many outstanding British participants should have participated in such an embarrassing production. In the case of Helen Mirren (the only British Empire Dame who was a porn star of the past), it was probably related to her rather unfortunate tendency to alternate between ear and slippery, but the sky alone knows what Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud thought they were doing. Unlike other famous actors such as Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton, Gielgud didn't always look at the cinema at home, but here he gives Nerva, a dignified and respectable old school senator. Unfortunately, in the context of this film, any kind of dignity attempt is uneven as a pearl on a reed. <br /> <br /> Guccione obviously succeeded in his ambition to make this film a cult of decadence. (Brass and Vidal had the same ambition for the film, questionable). However, the film does not succeed at any other level, as a study of art cinema or dictatorship policy. Even eroticism is a secondary price. 4/10
