If this film was just outrageous, it would be good, the problem is serious. In short, some points: <br /> <br /> - There is no story, no focus, no control, and all the questions raised do not find the answer. All in all, the film is very repetitive and boring (I have been in war-torn African countries many times and found that local affliction and hopelessness are very painful to look at, but still pointless). <br /> <br /> - The issues raised are pure manipulations and the truth is that they are not questions but statements. <br /> <br /> - I am not a doc filmmaker, but what is the point of raising an example of a weapon smuggling when the only item that has brought the audience is a local reporter's statement? The director does not worry at least when he waits near the airport, trying to spot heavy-duty trucks that leave the area immediately after landing. <br /> <br /> - The fish story lasts less than 5 mn and is supported only by the sequence where the director is filming the documentary shown during the local conference. Did this man do any work ???? <br /> <br /> - Endless poverty is always shown in endless sequences, but where is it? Anywhere in Africa you can go hand in hand and shoot the same pictures unfortunately. Where's the big news? <br /> <br /> - Prostitutes filming and crying for the images of their murdered friend and prostitutes are worth the worst emotions we see on thrash and real TV these days. <br /> <br /> - Over two million famine and fish exports between devastating famine are inevitable, dishonest and pointless, but viewers are usually manipulated in the anti-globalization and the western sense. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting debate in France after the academic commentary on the film with a very detailed commentary that brought numerous more details to journalists working in Africa for decades. It turns out that: <br /> <br /> - The fish waste that is sun-dried and collected by some local inhabitants is not intended for people to eat, but is collected for reasonably good money for export. for animal feed. I think I'm not the only one who had the impression that the director suggested exactly the opposite. <br /> <br /> - Arm smuggling is a reality (but there again, where's the big news?), but not this movie explains the problem. When empty planes landing at Mwanza take part in the smuggling, they actually send their shipment from another location to Africa, then go to Mwanza to get the fish out, so as not to make the trip back empty. Mwanza ...). <br /> <br /> - People eat fish locally, as opposed to film (about 40-60% of what is taken out of the lake) and thousands of people live with it. Good for them! It is a private company that one day takes African countries out of poverty, not from western weakening and endless foreign aid.
