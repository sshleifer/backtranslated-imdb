Marlene Dietrich is great as Concha Perez, a tempter who drives all people into despair Josef Von Sternberg's "The Devil is a Woman". His performance has nothing to do with "acting" in any conventional sense, but he is a glowing, real star under the full command of his material. But he's the only good thing about the film (he's so good he's watching this cluster, I doubt if another actor could have done the same thing). <br /> <br /> The story is a terribly flat melodrama, (surely Pierre Louys' novel is better), where Dietrich's immoral Concha destroys two friends played by Lionel Atwill and Cesar Romero, who are stiffened by restraint. And for Von Sternberg, this is a ugly-looking movie (perhaps in line with this rather ugly topic). On the other hand, Bunuel thought enough of it to restore it as a "wish for this hidden desire", emphasizing its surreal aspects, up to two different actors acting in the same role. Neither film is the best director of the director, and although the Bunuel version may be a better film, it is Dietrich's "performance" you remember.
