It was one of the worst films Sandra Bullock played. Ben Affleck should stay behind the camera and continue writing scripts. This is definitely his forte and no action. I actually spent 54 minutes in this movie before I was so bored that I felt forced to leave the theater. Anyway, it's up to 54 minutes from the beginning of the movie. The premise that "I think what happened to me on the road ..." is fatal and backward. Somehow it doesn't seem funny or romantic when people cheat on each other. Parents should be aware that this may not be the right film for your teenage kids, especially the impressive film that may look like Sandra. There is a scene where writers / producers / directors thought it would be nice to show "acceptable" to drive .... to smoke together ... and then they have no consequences at all. I'm not a bride and I smoke my part when I was younger, but I guarantee you that I will not take your teenagers to see it and they are certain A&B students. If you want to see a good Sandra Bullock movie, rent "The Net" or "Hope Floats", which I think is two of her best work.
