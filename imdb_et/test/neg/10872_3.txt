I have had a more boring 80-minute stretch in my life, but there is no mind right now. Hell Ride is based on the 70s of retro culture that Tarantino brought and did right in films such as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The problem with Hell Ride, unlike PF and RD, is that the story is garbage and so is the nature of the character. How many movies does Bishop think he might steal? Short case of Pulp Fiction, air gun not in country, etc. Etc. Speaking of the bishop, what the hell is he doing in this movie? I couldn't laugh in those scenes where he was trusted with his pelvis, trying desperately to feel like a hardened biker. Nothing in this movie is plausible. And why Dennis Hopper? Did they really have an Easy Rider motif? I blame Larry Bishop for his terrible plot and dialogue, not to mention his failed leadership. Don't bother watching this movie, it's a waste of time.
