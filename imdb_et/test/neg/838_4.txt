Recently, I have seen many Western peoples from the 1930s to the present day. At the end of the 1960s and early 1970s, some large low-budget spaghetti is on the west coast. This film had all the elements of a decent Western: a good story with talented participants and everything else. Although it is a looting of this genre and it wasn't for me that it worked and made a disappointing film. <br /> <br /> This movie can be easily divided into two parts. <Br /> <br /> The first part is great; it has great opening places and an interesting story that arises from a wage hunter (who is a stranger) who travels after a bandit who goes after a big bankroll supervised by a banker. In the film, these three characters make money transfers that try to get money. For the contests of earlier films in this genre, there is a fine comic, but comedy does not interfere with the overall story. <br /> <br /> The other side of the movie is where the comedy goes up and essentially destroys the movie. The turning point is right in that the bartender causes the dwarf to stop shooting when he is waiting for other patrons who seem to have met four corpses who place this place. From that moment on, the film moves from decent western spaghetti to comic undertones to foolish stupidity. <br /> <br /> There are three terrible fists-scenes (one by the river, one in the market and one in the baths) that follow each other quickly as if no one was bad enough. The fight is so fake that it is ridiculous, and because the sound is out of the picture, it makes it even worse. On the market, the banker fights for bankruptcy hidden trampolines and rotates around the poles as he is in the circus; it is clever. Although the worst part of these fighting scenes is music; it's a light-hearted, sparse-blended square dance, or "Hee-Haw" episode. These scenes are practically robbing the main story. If you want to see a good Western violation, look at "Blazing Saddles". If you want to see good spaghetti, beware of this movie.
