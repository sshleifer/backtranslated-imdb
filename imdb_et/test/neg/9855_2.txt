Looking at the company for the first time, as we all undoubtedly communicate with all the exhibitions, I went to it openly, enjoying about half of the previous efforts of Star Trek and disliking the other side. <br /> <br /> The company is short, but this episode "Night In Sickbay" seriously questioned me why I am worried about displaying shows on Sci Fi on Monday night. Episodes of the Day of Life, in which we know what certain signs are acting as humanoids, seemed to the writers forgot that it was to be a ship's ship, not Ricardoes and Mertes. <br /> <br /> The planet, especially one whose people had previously been offended by the company's team (for public eating), was not a place for the dog. As an animal lover, I would never have taken one of my pet's environments that had been tense in the past. <br /> <br /> But what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem of all those ST examples that consistently represent things that are sacred and offensive to other cultures because they provide some insight into American religious interests. <br /> <br /> Aliens were now offended when the dog urinated on a sacred tree, but foreigners were quite capable of offending the dog's urination. <br /> <br /> Strangely, how dog urination was not considered a form of worship. I don't know how it got by exhibition writers. <br /> <br /> From there we got to the captain who was wrong in his duties. Following the episode, it was very easy for me to forget that Bakula was supposed to be the captain of the ship. <br /> <br /> She chose to sleep in the hospital and from there we get more behavioral disorders that we should not understand and cause us to shift the buttons. <br /> <br /> Your doctor will not shoot long, hairy toenails and feed them to hungry drilled animals. Ewwwwww! Then the white bat creature escapes. <br /> <br /> Oh, how should someone fall asleep with it! Cutting the toenails to shout out loud! I had waited for something to nourish vomiting. Then we had inexplicably thought that the captain was in love with T'polis and that he might hide these feelings with his concern. <br /> <br /> Endless quantities of garbage. <br /> <br /> "Your dog is sick, so go for sex. You feel better." And, of course, the captain had to apologize and we had to find our apology completely ridiculous because we are so (everyone laughing very sarcastically) narrower! Saw images like this endlessly droned out of TNG. <br /> <br /> Strange, the only thing missing from this terrible episode was that Trip Person offers their smirks and downhome boyisms, thoughts Bakula seemed to cover all of this with a silly dog. <br /> <br /> Oh, the dog lived, so now go play.
