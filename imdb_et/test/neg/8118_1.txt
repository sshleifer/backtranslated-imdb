If there is no tremendous ironic conspiracy, my jaw dropped when I read the positive comments on that film; I can't believe this movie was even released, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> I admit that it's not my movie, but I tried to look at it objectively, you know, it's so bad it was funny and was still offended by its just terrible. <br /> <br /> The actor is terrifying, they can't look at the rushes and I think one scene was one, it's really terrible. This is the worst film I've seen for years, I wouldn't even call it a movie, it's a tragedy. A gay black friend whom no one actually calls "gay" is just that he's so crazy? Homophobic. It is not good, in fact it is directly vomiting. Jokes die for their miserable donkeys, music is so bad that it believes. The person who made the soundtrack essentially chose the bad songs they had ever heard, and put them in the waste of this movie. Oh my good Christ I can't believe the garbage of the 80s is like that, I grew up through them, and I can't find anything worth mentioning here, it must be a dark time to be a cinema visitor. /> <br /> If you even think about watching this movie, check out this psychiatrist, then he will hit you, you're sick, sick.
