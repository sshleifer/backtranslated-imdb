The plot is simple: The American couple is on vacation in Thailand. Somehow they are attacked by the "omnipotent" Chinese vampires and the girl being kidnapped by the vampire's great boss. This is OK so far. The girl's partner remains in her search. And now the horror begins. He comes to a strange group of half-circles or something (they only drank animal blood). These vampires are at odds with the bad for about 800 years. But with the help of "good vampires", the guy starts looking for his girlfriend. The other thing I've noticed is that vampires are very ugly. I mean .... a vampire is an old-fashioned man (he's alive since ... forever), he has a style. There are also modern vampires, but in this movie the vampires are ... weird. Like, come, they're riding a bike, they're all dressed in leather, and they're all destroying their way. . The script is boring and the actors are not too talented. The music is pretty good, but the effects aren't that big. right or not.
