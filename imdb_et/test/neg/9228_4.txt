What this film actually does. Great check piece. This movie deals with the sister and brother of the Bonnie and Clyde type duo, which creates their party line to attract their victims and trap them and kill them. But for what reason? Just for having fun? Richard Hatch, who has come across as he is ridiculous, comes in. A true BAD version for women. And he goes together to find out who is behind the killings of all LAs. Finally, she meets teens who help her find her killer and rest for her fun and amusement. But this film has parts that really go to me like a scene where Lief Garret dressed her mother's wedding dress, like a sister in front of her sister, telling her she needs her and can't live without her and see how she strikes her face he is dominated. I can't believe it was Lief !!! Well, I think I can. But it's worth a look, but only to see one of Garrets' worst movies he ever did.
