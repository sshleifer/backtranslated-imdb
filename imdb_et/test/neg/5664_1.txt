I watched the Halloween episode ... oh my god, what I wanted to die for. The action was just terrible. These lines were utterly unconvinced. It is also a bad idea for the exhibition, I mean, who would look at such a web sample in real life? Miranda Cosgrove played a supporting role in Drake and Josh, but has no character to anchor her character. I'm even more irritated because his departure is the main reason Drake and Josh ended. He turned to his show ... he jumped on the ship Drake and Josh. They then decided to make Drake and Josh go to college explaining the loss of Meagan's character, but Drake was already thinking of moving on to bigger and better things. he's not. The best part of the exhibition was the theme song ... memorable, good tuning in mediocrity. Of course Drake Bell Miranda copied the voice for the whole thing and wrote this tune ...
