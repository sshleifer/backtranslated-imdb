I wanted to like this movie. The previews showed a little funny, but I thought they would put most of the funny things in the previews. In that case, they did not do it alone, but they turned the clips so that they appeared much more funny than the real film. I like John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Vince Vaughn, Rock, Cedric the Entertainer etc. so I wanted to like this movie, but it never seemed to do anything. <br /> <br /> I saw Get Shorty and I didn't take much care of it. Too slow and uncomfortable for me. This movie is definitely not better, and even worse. There were many opportunities for some good comedic moments, but none of them were. <br /> <br /> The actor was fine, but even John Travolta looked toned. Cedric was okay, but he was too overwhelmed to be really funny. Vince Vaughn and the rock were pretty good and ready to be funny, but they just missed it all. I want them to have the opportunity to watch their fun things they set up, but instead she just went back to the same old thing and just set it back to Vaugh and Rock to be funny (though never allowed to give it) Punchline or comedy). <br /> <br /> In general, it was a very disappointing movie and I am happy to see it only on video. At least it was cheaper than the theater.
