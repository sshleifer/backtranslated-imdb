I rented this movie after hearing Chris Gore saying something like "five stars". Exhibition exhibition attack. Well, when I turned around the DVD and it showed three stages of hell, I had to buy it. Just to see the mother who cried to her son to leave her second son in a flaming hole. <br /> <br /> I did not expect ECW or CZW for an hour and eighteen minutes, but I expected at least a concise version of what seemed to be the main emphasis of this film. Unfortunately, there was nothing like that. The three stages of the deaths occur right from the beginning and it goes down a lot. Nothing happens in this documentary. It was pretty raw, bare and unbiased. It's not a bad thing, but it's a narrator. You expect him to have opinions on this documentary, but he doesn't. What would have been nice, the message or the reason for this document. There was no real narrator, there should have been just a text that explains some of the less obvious scenes. <br /> <br /> The lives of these wrestlers are also not explained. It shows some moments for some dramatic scene that sounds interesting, but reality is not as big as it sounds. For example, her mother looks at her son to wrestle with light bulbs and strikes the public park for the first time. Instead of seeing their reaction to wrestling, they show that it reacts to the camera instead of saying it later to the interview, or simply actually reacting to it. <br /> <br /> Legitam document wise, it's not. The starting material was weak at the beginning. There's nothing really deep or interesting. For some of the more interesting stories there is no conclusion, no real point or final thinking in home wrestling, poorly edited, and this and its basically cheap failure. smart, it's pretty boring. Better bumps are beginning and slowly become less amazing and shocking. If you've seen Japanese wrestling, Indie wrestling, or even Backyard Wrestling DVDs, this shock and scares you. If you want to make a wrestling, the same mistake I made and see it doesn't do. Instead, go to a CZW ECW or XPW DVD. <br /> <br /> The only thing I got out of this documentary was how stupid people might be. Not to support self-harm or to do dangerous tricks, but to justify their actions. The returnees seem to be fools in wrestling. Most of them are unemployed and are likely to have some problems, and wrestling is therapy for them. As supporters seem more idiotic. Mothers, in principle, take the whole "if you don't join me" to deal with the fact that their sons are killing themselves. School power representatives support their students in their dangerous tricks as it is an alternative to joining gangs and, to a lesser extent, making drugs, which is funny because this segment took place in a rural area where as people live 20 miles apart. People are stupid. Thats what I brought out with this documentary. <br /> <br /> If you want to see thinking and thoughts that somebody is wrestling in the wrestling and basically this rear of the DVD, take UNSCARRED: Nick Mondo's life. Its more amazing and more interesting than in the backyard and much more fun. Oh and its really good.
