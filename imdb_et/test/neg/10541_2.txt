Yes, it has long become a tourist attraction. Now there is a prison again. Something similar. Well, this is an airport that is mixed with high school, but there are many guys running with orange jumpers, so I think it's like a prison. Not quite. When Sasha, Steven Seagal's character, enters the prison, he crosses and travels to the other line so he can talk to his friend as he is in the airport security check. Then, before he misses his punch and his friend for a long time, they pair the security guard. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something. You're attacking a correctional officer in a federal prison, they're shooting you on the spot. And Rule would have shot about 30 times before he threw his second punch. Oh, and there are guys who wear beans and bandanas and that's not. Prison. Federal prison. <br /> <br /> You do not get this kind of clothing in most American gymnasiums. <br /> <br /> And speaking of the rule, I must say that the person who apparently enjoyed his activity more than anyone else on the earth, including Ja Rule himself, had to be 50 cents. Immediately before this movie, I watched one of these major celebrities on television, and as number 7 or 8, it was a 50th contest that had lived a real life and a Ja rule. Who wasn't. Every time I saw Ja Rule on the screen, the only thing I could photograph was 50 Cent laughing at her ass. And the rule looks like a dirty 9-year-old every time he appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, return to the plot. It's funny. Sasha is an FBI agent who works secretly and agrees to give himself to prison to get behind a criminal organization. He was sentenced to five years, and it disappears immediately between the determination of the old line and the stupidity. Nothing else is insignificant in the film, it becomes meaningless for a series of activities, most of which are not even well-choreographed. <br /> <br /> Oh, how, the helicopter runs through the roof of "New Alcatraz" at one point, accidentally releasing all the prisoners. And what do they do? They all stop their cells and play basketball in the middle of a cell block. Without as much as a basket. They had a ball, but that doesn't matter. The scene is so stupid that they could also play hopscotch. <br /> <br /> So some men will be seen as the first people Alcatraz has now filled in the executive chamber, probably not stealing $ 200 million in gold, but not where he was hidden. <br /> <br /> Hey, good thinking, people. If you can't get information from someone, kill them. It's a great way to learn the truth! So some gangs will break into jail to stop filling and get a $ 200 million position. <br /> <br /> Oh, and $ 200 million is gold brick. I doubt they thought about how difficult it would be to convert it into a convertible currency. <br /> <br /> There is also a prison custodian question. He is a somewhat hard wader who thinks he is a barrio hardcore chollo that reminds me of jokes. I saw the comedian who talked about people living in California who talk about each other and homes all the hard and the other kind of nonsense. These people go to Mexico, the comedian says, and they're like, "Oh my God! People live there? It's like a full hat!" <br /> <br /> The best thing is when the Supreme Court of the United States of Justice arrives, and this man tells him that his men can't carry their weapons in prison, "I don't care if he is justice to the United States Supreme Court!" <br /> <br /> This woman can beat her like grapes and she thinks she is responsible. Ha. <br /> <br /> And by the way, the Supreme Court, who has taken hostage in the film, tells the bad man that he is 53. It's a year younger than Steven Seagal. I just thought it was funny. <br /> <br /> The only good scene in the movie is what is in the jail, where Ja Rule begins to beat the prison, like this little Asian woman. It was a more fun thing I've seen in the movie for a long time. <br /> <br /> You know, I'm working on behalf of the company that created the movie (which I watched), and I still have nothing positive about it except, of course, that one scene where Ja Rule got this Asian woman . <br /> <br /> So read my review of Malena and see how strongly I sometimes disagree with professional film critics, like Roger Ebert, but when reviewing this movie, Ebert wrote something that I had agreed as much as he ever wrote: <br /> <br /> "I imagine flyers at MPAA congratulate each other for a good day's work when they rated" Half Past Dead "PG-13, after the anti-gun movie" Bowling for Columbine "and R." <br /> <br /> The way to go, guys.
