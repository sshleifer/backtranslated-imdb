OK it includes a spoiler. Now I have never seen such a large pile of bundles, because the laxative / feed mixes in the zoo in the elephant's envelope! It's more of a plot of holes than moth to eat lace and like a "realistic" plot line. Well, sexual slavery is terrifying and very real in the world, and this pill tomb uses this plague as a plot device to bother and tempt, embarrass all relevant things over its questionability. But back to the movie, if you intend to rob people from the airport, otherwise the safest and happier places in the world today, why sit in the bathroom, doing everything until the plot needs twisting. Wait until you are out of the airport, pull the gun, pull the passengers out, drive in the store and kill the guys, work done. On the passenger side, the good men have at least three bad guys and they are armed, WASTE! When you are in a movie, you can just be acceptable if you don't leave the bad guys on the skull but THERE is three times! And after he killed most of you. The guy is also ready to put down the gun to stop the scarred cheek, but kills the girl's yeast infection, which can be cleaned with $ 20 worth of drugs. I could go ahead and complain about it, but I don't waste my time anymore. Suffice it to say that such a terrible piece is rarely so insulted and the true problem of sexual slavery is that girls go voluntarily to new jobs in distant lands and abuse, rape and often kill the gang. master who answers them from the boat / plane and takes his passports and freedom. This s ** t is offensive to anyone whose life has been affected! Don't waste your time!
