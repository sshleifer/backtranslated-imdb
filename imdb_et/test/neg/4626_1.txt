I saw it on a Sci-Fi channel, so I knew it was a bad start, but I was surprised how much worse it was to wait. The CG effects on the dragon were terrible, even for the Sci-Fi channel and writing was pathetic. I couldn't tell if it should be as stupid as a joke or if it just came out like that. The only quality of redemption of this movie is that it is so terrible that it is almost funny, especially the part where Patrick Swayze's knight's character goes home to his knight's father, who has retired after losing his legs and who is only now in your army bed. let the audience know that he is a knight. Most of the movie focuses on a huge dragon egg that moves into a not-so-huge baby dragon with some of the worst CGIs I've ever seen. It was just terrible.
