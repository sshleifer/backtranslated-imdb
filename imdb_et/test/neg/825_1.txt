My God, how bad it is. Who is this impostor pretending to be Ali G? Avoid it at all costs. It replaces the smart multilayer satire and his show humor and outside the toilet with humor. <br /> <br /> It was obviously an attempt to get him known before he released his show at HBO. br /> <br /> One commentator here argues that we do not appreciate the film because of the advantages of the show due to the difference in media. While it is true that the standard format of the exhibition could never be transferred to a large screen, Sacha Baron Cohen would have been able to ensure the intelligent use of his comic style on a more conventional film line. Instead, we have this confusion that is not honestly associated with Ali G, except on the packaging. <br /> <br /> Terrible disappointment. Go look for Inn, Aiiii or Bling Bling DVDs with some real Ali G.
