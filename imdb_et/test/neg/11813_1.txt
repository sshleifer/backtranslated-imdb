The worst part of this movie is that it doesn't have to be so terrible. <br /> <br /> They had a nice budget, though so many movies; they made it slippery and beautiful, and they were the best in the 21st century with a lesbian-savvy audience embracing the lesbian positive film ... and yet the writer and director went out to raise the lesbian torture and confusion in the internal educational institutions around every single movie (you know, that the place where all lesbian lovers and die). <br /> <br /> This is a topic that has been done over and over again in AGAIN, but something that viewers, if someone uses this voting forum, doesn't seem to be enough. <br /> <br /> Every element in this story was up, too fake, and realized that it was painful to sit. The guides say it all: crazy, abandoned, genius, rebellious lesbian tough girl (well, they took a super beautiful femme like Piper Perabo and tried to tighten her up, but it wouldn't get too busy) seduces a pretty rich girl who is meant to betray her. <br /> <br /> Looking at them every step of the way, the character 3 is brisk, well meaningful, with a wide eye, a good girl's observer. I say "every step" because he shares it with every thought audience through the most rigid, most uneven monologues. <br /> <br /> His lines seem to be written at the age of fifteen, although they are trying to do so hard as a fifteen-year-old really, you know, well ... talk. "Listening to them (love) for their noise, you know, well, well ... okay!" she talks about her two unpleasant roommates who roll in bed next to her. <br /> <br /> Later, he asks Graham Greene, who is a native American actor who is wasting a gardener (!) "Is it wrong to take care of what people think?" <br /> <br /> Sorry, but is she a teenager, or is she 7 years old? <br /> <br /> Piper Perabo (Pollyna tortured) dyke) and others are struggling to work on horrible lines they are forced to proclaim. Perabol has a nice energy level and is probably very comfortable in front of the camera. He would have done well in a decent project, so it is by no means a criticism of behavior. <br /> <br /> But this story is SHAMELESS to embed any stereotype of lesbians who are all one sign. They could not stop if he (Polly) was an angry, crazy passionate genius who ended the math problems for an orphan teacher. Oh, but this is after he says to the teacher who dares to blame him for "gabbing". <br /> <br /> "It's the word they (men) use against the US (women)!" he says, out of the classroom. <br /> <br /> Is it all the writer could come up with? Or maybe we should ask: Why stop? <br /> <br /> Half and lid. went on and made Polly a poetic dark child who interacts with wild birds, shouting their name in the forest. <br /> <br /> Cue atmosphere, sci-fi, Xena atmosphere! <br /> <br /> Then we have to write for our birthday ... (most lesbians are loved starved orphans when you were in the dark). <br /> <br /> Then we have two teachers (one upright, one generation of open-necked cubs) who move around all the way around (the school looks awfully big for only 2 teachers) ... and gives a dark child / seducer / birdie tense look. Hmmmm. I don't know if anything well you know that FUNNY is happening between these two teachers ?????? <br /> <br /> There is simply no excuse for what it has done badly. Heartbreak happens, but surely the writer and director know that lesbians exist in much more complicated times than this scheme. <br /> <br /> I can't reveal the end of respect for those who force themselves to sit down, but if you don't laugh, I can only guess you're crying. And not for the right reason. And I don't mean wimpy to make scenes.
