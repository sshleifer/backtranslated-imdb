Take it as a camera that worked from 1946 to 1950 in Studios of the Republic, then from 1950 to 1993 at Warners Bros and Paramount, this is a piece. Of course it would be nice to show it to your favorite friends at the house party, but trying to sell it on DVD is completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I've seen bad action on my day, but it's not working. The hero is almost ridiculous and he really thinks he appreciates his comments on special offers. I hate to see my fan club. The old movies were not in action with many scenes. What the hell was this garden image with the three worst actors. I never saw a garden on the ship. They couldn't even emulate. I wouldn't like to remember it if they had an ounce of action once, but the only one was a man with an accent of Translania. I'm sorry, but it's not a crazy movie because some people say. I think this movie would be offended by horror movies.
