This movie is a disgraceful result that happens when: <br /> <br /> A) It is an idiot written, staged and produced. and / or B) Produced in a hurry to saturate poker / Stu Hungarian craze. <br /> <br /> The story from the beginning is uneven. Vidmer spends too much time in Hungarian childhood and is not enough for some legendary stories - for example, reading cards, his blackjack escorts, money roll id. He also excludes other poker prizes such as chip reese, brunson, etc. Film is a complete confusion from start to finish. <br /> <br /> If you want a full and accurate account, read the book "One Sure". If you thought the movie was good, read the book and change your mind.
