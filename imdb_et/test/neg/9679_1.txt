I've seen some Bible-based trash. It's all up. Worse still, it takes about three hours. A terrible waste of time if you don't want to match your child's biblical knowledge with countless aberrations. Benefit - Walk in Sahara. Since I need to give you ten lines of confirmation not to watch this movie, just let me say that it has no redeemable quality. God's conversations with Noah are ridiculous. The whole thing is nervous: "Let's make the Bible account look slow." The main logic goes when they spent money on biblical film, why not make it worth it? Since the basic logic is not fulfilled, there is something wrong. The film begins with a disclaimer about poetic licenses ... this is a century's underestimation. Poetic rape. But then it would be poetic unmerited.
