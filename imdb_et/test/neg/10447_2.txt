I was tempted to look at Shark Hunter with comments posted to IMDB. The film was bad, but shark was cool blah blah blah. So I rented it. Bad idea. That movie was so bad on so many levels that I was happy to have the opportunity to move on. The shark itself is ok. Its appearance is decent and this is the only thing that saves it from movie 1, (I gave it 2). Operation is incredibly bad and dialogue is just as regrettable. I didn't expect much, but it was a surprise that I was breastfeeding. Antonio Sabato Jr is a biologist or scientist or something I didn't really pay attention to. He goes under the submarine crew to find out what happened to this underwater station, which the shark, of course, took out. By the way, all the scenes that show someone working underwater are not underwater. First of all, when they just go down to find out what happened to this station, what are all the great darts and harpoons and things in the sedatives. Are the things you usually do with your accident investigation. Hai theory progressed on the way of Antonio, so it didn't like when they knew what they were against. Antonio and this young college student, by the way, a terrible actor, just jump in sub-control when the sub is in trouble. What's with it? If someone does not get any kind of pre-school training before leaving high school, I find it a bit stupid. The director seems to think that if team members work in the background, it is a good idea to put someone in the background for welding. Metal crafting is very important if your subconscious. Anyway, I could go ahead, but I've already said too much. Bottom line: Go to your local video store, rent this video, and then destroy it. Then send an email asking IMDB to remove all of this movie from your site. All the memory and the evidence of this movie must be destroyed. We can do it when we work together.
