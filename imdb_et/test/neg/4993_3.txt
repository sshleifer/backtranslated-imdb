The rise of the Undead begins with a huge nuclear-type blasting through an unnamed American city, some people live in the building, relying on the door, so it stays closed and keeps the nastiness out! They claim they are among the times, it seems that the monster is seemingly somewhere and will kill them one by one ... <br /> <br /> Written, directed and directed by Jason Horton & Shannon Hubbell to say that the rise of Undead is terrible . The script takes itself very seriously but doesn't make sense. The first thing I was asking was, is there a huge nuclear explosive thing going on outside the city, why are these people still alive? Why is the building still standing? Then I asked myself when something really happens, the first 20 minutes in one room, actually it's a bit generous, it's a corridor rather than a protagonist. Then it turns into a life-lost return (1985), which ended a government-created virus that makes people zombies before one of the steepest, pointless and seemingly random plots of land I've ever seen, which changes most of what just happened to complete time wasting. Then in the last 30 odd minutes, the Rise of Undead turns into some strange sci-fi-type things, because something that resembles the energy ball swims over everyone's killing, is I the only one who asked what this energy ball is and where did it come from? Back to what's happening outside of that, what was the reason? Oh, that's right we never talk. Undead's rise is confusing, the character is terrible and not even given names, but half-twisted is that you tear your hair in frustration, dialogue sucks, nothing is explained and there's almost no story here. The last 10 minutes (maybe a little more) There is no dialogue on the Rise of the Undead, and the movie has suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> Director Horton & Hubbell apparently worked on a low budget, the entire movie set in about two rooms and three corridors! Photography is terrible, they use irritating color filters seemingly random and sometimes it looks like a Rise of Undead camera. There are no special effects, there is a little fake blood, but there are no real make-up effects. There are some CGI shots in the city that are burning in flames that look honest, but the floating ball of the energy entity looks terrible. Early on, there is one terrible picture where two people are sitting on the corridor wall and talking, somewhat odd, because their heads are cut off at the top of the screen! Just see the lower body of their neck, but there is nothing else in the frame, they don't move and there's nothing else, but for a strange reason, their heads are cut off from the top when they talk to each other! It is quite strange to look at actually. <br /> <br /> With an extremely low budget of around $ 10,000, and according to IMDb over two weeks, I have to congratulate the creators for getting ready and unpublished, but this is where my congratulations stop because otherwise it is a terrible production value and has been placed around three corridors located somewhere in Louisiana, Louisiana, in New Orleans, where the Undead rise was hit. Good sucking so I don't live it. <br /> <br /> The rise of the Undead rises, it sounds like a zombie movie, but to be honest, it's not all about that parameter and I know filmmakers worked on a small budget, but that's not really a problem. This is certainly not recommended.
