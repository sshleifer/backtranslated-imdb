What can I say? After reading Herbert's books and loving Lynch's film version, I was very disappointed. I felt like I was looking at Buck Rogers' rejection. Sets looked like Star Wars TV special! I felt it was mostly amateurish. The costumes were delicate and longer, giving her 60s of Flash Gordon, a pulp. Worms! They should be Sand Worms, and yet they appeared to the "big stalagites" by the mouth. Impacts were generally quite at a different speed. I'm not even going to get a shameful "Navigator" effect. <br /> <br /> This so-called Frank Herbert bone was not even credible to his books! It should have been called "Frank Herbert's Dummies". Elements of the key image were omitted, names changed, and the "feel" of the whole story was "disinfected". I didn't even know Harkonnen! In fact, most of the signs, like Herbert's descriptions, seemed to represent them. I'm getting upset, just remembering what the tragedy was. I am glad that I was unable to pay the second installment in the stomach.
