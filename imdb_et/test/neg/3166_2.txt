It's Valentine's Day and we decided to stay, enjoy dinner and watch this movie instead of TCM to go out. We are in our 40's, we love romance and we are both "softies," but this movie was bombarded just for us (it's hard to imagine it was assigned to the Oscar, etc., but I think it was then). The cinema was beautiful, but mostly the film is terrible. Jennifer Jones's character gave her so many references to Eurasion that we started counting and after a while we started to say it. Add that throughout the movie, the "theme song" was constantly playing and we couldn't wait until it ended so we could watch the evening news.
