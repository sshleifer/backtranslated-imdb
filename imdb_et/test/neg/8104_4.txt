This movie is really an excusable excuse for making a movie. Stimulation is bad, the budget must be low and the action is cut (ie excluding Bela Lugosi). Sound is also terrible at the moment because there is so much more noise in the background that it sounded like it would have been if the jet had come out for the whole movie. If these things disturb you at all, don't look at this movie. <br /> <br /> If you can bypass it, you will find that the movie's idea is very good. Japanese workers hired a German plastic surgeon (Bela Lugosi), who acted with several Japanese agents and turned them into American businessmen robbed and killed by Japan. After finishing his work, he betrayed Japan and was thrown into prison. Later he escaped and traveled to America to seek revenge for his patients through a number of highly publicized murders. <br /> <br /> Bela Lugos seems to be the only decent actor in the film and honestly, the rest of the participants were completely forgotten and stodgy. The leading actor was rather boring and stereotypical, while the police officer assigned to his case was a regular, chauvinistic, and always correct dominant man found in many films of that period. I also found that the camera work was completely endless, often taking the same corners of the same spaces again and again. After a while, it tends to drag the film, setting a very slow pace for "action", which is more or less non-existent anyway. <br /> <br /> For me, the idea of ​​an exciting and better writer, director, script, equipment and actors can be a great movie. Unfortunately, these shortcomings keep the movie back and I can't recommend it to anyone other than the most open film students.
