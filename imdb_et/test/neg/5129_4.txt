SPOILERS, WARNING !!! Flashdance, in my opinion, is an honest film. Some things make me confused (for example, Jeanie asks Alex how long she had been so good for dancing; Alex answers "About 25 years", Alex hasn't been 18?) And some things I care about (I loved spinning!). In general, it was interesting to me. When that movie was made, I wasn't even born. I did not experience the eighties (I was born in year 85) and I have to think: sometimes Alex ran a little, or throw himself over, not dancing, just colliding with things, snatching him. head back and perception of his arms - was it considered dance? If that were the case, then I'm not sure if I could have done that. Turns, flap, fluid movements were great, but part of it - my neighbor's toddler could have done better! Also, if Alex is a welder during the day, wouldn't he be tired after a hard day? If he doesn't work for almost a week, will he not be released? Living in stock - I see it almost, but not quite. It does not seem right that he is a welder, has a warehouse, and tries to get into the ballet. None of them really make sense. I shouldn't consider my background, but please. Maybe Jennifer Beals is too feminine to see her as a welder, I don't know. In both cases, however, they would have become a better actor. The participants were good. I even liked romance. You make your decision. But it's rentable to me, I don't see it again - it's not worth it.
