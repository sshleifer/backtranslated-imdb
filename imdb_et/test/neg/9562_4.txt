The reality of the Mafia environment is an absolutely dog-eating-dog that kills a gangster to show signs of weakness as they become responsible. I have no problem with the portrayal of the human side of ganstide, but Bugsy is too soft, comical, toward the man. The film is enjoyable, but it's just a light entertainment and not a human biopsy, which, though exciting, was extremely dangerous and frightening. <br /> <br /> Actress is all good and the direction is very strong. Locations and era are very well represented and the topics are very interesting. Did Bugsy really want to kill Mussouli?
