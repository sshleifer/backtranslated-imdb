I was so excited when I saw this "Pulse" after Amazon and I have to say I was completely disappointed. Maybe I think I was too resurrected. I had fans' expectations that were simply not met. After loving other Asian horrors, I thought I knew it would find a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The story was slow, painful. I'm a versatile fan of horror. I love the brutal and bloody madness of "Rejecting the Devil" and I love the constant and growing macabre of the "Two Sisters of the Brain". Unfortunately, the "pulse" offered little to each spectrum. <br /> <br /> With the slowness of the plot, it was also very confusing. I had no idea why the characters did what they did, and how what they did would help their problem. It seemed as if the director had imprisoned him in a sentence or two and the rest was impressive for our actors. Unlike the "story of the two sisters", which also has a rather hard-to-track plot line, "Pulse" cleans up very little at the end and left me feeling frustrated, confused and uninterested in the efforts of the characters. There was a contradiction in my final report plot. At first it seemed like a story that the ghost world was overwhelming and their average escape was the Internet. This is a damn original idea. I like it. But when the plot invasion, plot holes and unexplained events that grow their heads, it seems that the director turned off some apocalyptic story (as the end shows), which was simply not precise enough to fill it. <br /> <br /> I understand the toughness of the frames and the setting was deliberate so that the viewer would feel gentle and isolated, but only the grainy, shady surroundings reinforced the film's mood. I admit that there was a certain sense of surrealism in the film, but that may be a reduction and a decrease in my attention. <br /> <br /> The action of some characters is also a bit ridiculous, and maybe, if I had a more fascinated story, I would have been able to stop more inconvenience, but I myself didn't motivate, so some characters were. As I mentioned earlier, the logic that some characters lacked and contributed to the plot's inconsistency. Perhaps it was the consequence of the plot's inconsistency that the characters did questionable things. Frankly, it doesn't really matter. <br /> <br /> The show was decent. Certainly nothing special, but nothing terrible. Whatever the race to mention should not be brilliant or ordinary terrible on either side. <br /> <br /> Now, I stop so sour and mention that there were a handful of scary moments. Ultimately, especially if it were more similar, I would have (almost) completely enjoyed this movie. I thought it was quite confusing when the website was shown, and some ghostly encounters see our two main characters. The things that went on between these strange races were just too weak, terrible and "WTF" that really appreciated me. <br /> <br /> Now Something About DVD ... Unlocking Magnolia "Pulse is subtitles, yes, but subtitles are off. They are not said in real time at the right time. It may sound funny, but I feel it is the only release of North America in the movie, although you have to deal with or look at the duplication (NEVER CHANGE !!!) I tried to like the movie, I really did. to live the movie until the leap ... but unfortunately it fell to me slowly. If you are looking for another horrible Asian cinema, I can recommend you "Audition", "Shutter", "A Tale of Two Sisters", "Strange Circus" and "Marebito" All these are more of my palette.
