So I got it from the rental office where I work before it was released (press release is 8/21), I looked at it today and now I'm speechless. They could have been a decent movie here, but they turned it in a painful way. <br /> <br /> First, the parts of John Krasinski were fun and the only reasons I gave it over. 3, but they have broken up with bad and terrible "serious" reflections of life between the main character (Andrew Keegan) and his girlfriend (annoying Lacy Chabert). It would have been much, much better than a straight comedy area lock, a backup and two types of smoking. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like it because I think Krasinski is funny and wants to see him well. The story was also not bad, just not very original. But management (and many actors) was terrible. I swear they had trouble seeing people facing and still going. <br /> <br /> Their negligence is shown when a weapon expert corrects another character and says "Dirty Harry" is not a. 357 magnum, but 0.45 (it was, as everyone knows, 0.44 magnum). <br /> <br /> So look at it 1 - like John Krasinski 2 likes like low budget (and badly) - or 3 has too much time on his hands (that's me!)
