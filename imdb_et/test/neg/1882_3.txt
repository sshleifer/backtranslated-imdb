Unlike Endearment and Steel Magnolia's, I left the very disappointed movie theater. At first I started to get involved in the characters and their complicated mother / daughter and father / daughter relationship. I even cried. But I had no sympathy for the end signs. The final act did not seem to be in line with the mother's character. So, while the action was pretty good, I thought the whole movie was disappointing.
