I'm not sure why I didn't like that kind of movie. Maybe I'm too old or too male or too much. Who was the target group here? If you are and you liked it, then I'm happy with you. Personally, I found this a little bit. The characters were uninteresting and unlikely, the script was just embarrassing and some, though not all, were forced. Mawkish, annoying and occasionally nausea - is definitely something better. Does anyone else have it?
