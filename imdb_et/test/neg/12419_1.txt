I just hit "Wild Rebels" from one of the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" archives and this movie was so bad that even the MST3K team couldn't make it fun. There are some MST3K "targets" that were films whose concepts were so dirty that they couldn't have been good movies (such as "The Green Slime") and others whose main rooms would have been really fun movies if their filmmakers were not hitting them in execution. "Wild Rebels" is a film whose main prerequisite for DID is a good film three years earlier when Don Siegel directed his remake of "The Killers" from Universal. Both films are about an unsuccessful racer who has attracted femme fatale to ride an escape car in a kid's boyfriend's kidnapped robbery - only "The Killers" leader was John Cassavets, the wife was Angie Dickinson and the offender. (cast wildly but successfully against what was his last film) was Ronald Reagan. Steve Alaimo, Bobbie Byers, and Willie Pastrano are pretty fit! But what really makes "wild rebel" a terrible movie is the direction of William Gref√© (note the focus above the final "e" on his screen credit), which has absolutely no pace and it seems that each shooting lasts at least one and a half times as long as you need your dramatic point. It is only a pity that no one has made this movie's ridiculous comment (2009); The comparison between Steve Alaimo's hairstyle and Rod Blagoevich would have been irresistible!
