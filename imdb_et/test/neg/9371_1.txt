Tru Calling was good, but it could have been great. The concept was intriguing and allowed for a strange and frightening story that could be explored in the future. Unfortunately, the writing of the cargo and the actor show. <br /> <br /> Writing was not too bad, but there were holes. In the episode 13 "Drop Dead Gorgeous", an incredibly toxic poison was used to kill the victim. It was so poisonous and killed so quickly that the victim had no time to lead or even get help. However, there was no plausible explanation of how the killer got such a powerful poison. <br /> <br /> In Episode 15, "The Getaway", a responsible policeman responded unrealistically. In the second dining room, he speaks (foolishly) of the dropping of a gun to a robber, and if he does not follow the queue and actually changes the weapon towards him, he in turn allows him to become static and then expand into a hostage? the situation he had warned. His answer should have been to shoot a robber when he failed to follow his command and his pistol by turning on him. There are also other mistakes in the wild, but I leave it to two examples. Regardless of writing problems, as I like to show it. <br /> <br /> Another problem I had was that I just couldn't take Eliza Dushku in this roll. In my opinion, he is too inexperienced and light to carry this part. He didn't go anywhere, he marched; and too often he stopped with his brand. He also lacked a truly emotional facial expression or intonation. It has a nice look or a lovely smile; rarely are other emotions evident. When he tries to appear dramatically, he begins to look at his lines and then turns his eyes to his companion. Or he can start his line by looking at him and then looking at it. Both are annoying replacements of emotions. An example of his lack of intonation is in episode 20, "Two Weddings and Funerals", the second wedding competition has no emotions (eg hearts in our hearts). <br /> <br /> I liked all the other participants in their parts and they were all plausible. With better writing and changing leadership, Tru Calling would have done so.
