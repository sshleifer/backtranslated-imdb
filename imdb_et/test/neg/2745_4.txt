- SPOILERS ------------ I am a fan of the 70's French cinema of the 1960s, but not necessarily more modern, so I was honest about watching it because of Bellucci. beautiful and supposedly the film where they met Cassel, so it gives it special importance. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a very nice style that resembles DePalma. going back and forth, which gets tiring.I don't mind one flash back but do it and get it over man !!! Anyway, the movie is still interesting to me up to the point where the first and definite hole in the plot, allowing the rest of the story, won't let me ever rest. I can allow small holes here and there, but not to build a whole plot of hot air. who is directly looking for an old flame. This is the main plot. I'm going together when the story at some point persuades me that there are really mysterious things going on, but th is a story where there is nothing truly mysterious. leave for some work in Italy (not the farthest part of Paris) and he leaves him a message that, for later reasons, explains that he does not. Don't do that, right? Are these people not phones? Supposedly he was 2 months away (not exactly a century) and he didn't invite him to Paris to see how he was doing? Of course not. Instead of even taking it back, he forgets everything about him. And this is good, but later in the film he tells his friend that it was his greatest love and he was ready to commit for the first time in his life. he couldn't call him for 2 months and he never tried to come back with him. And how about Cassel's character? He could not find him in Italy, really hard to find anyone in Italy, probably like in Siberia, especially an actor who is probably listed even in art papers. And after 2 months, when he'd come back, really hard to find him and ask for an explanation. One thinks he wanted to prevent him, but no, we know they just can't meet. So it's hard to meet in Paris. OK, I don't have to go any further because it's the case where the whole movie is based. Worse still, Bellucci is not really the star of this movie, but that other girl is Bohringer.
