Leatherheads is the right title, but a leather strap would be useful to buy a ticket to watch this poisonous event for entertainment. Clooney's attempt to express self-expression with humor comes quietly because his behavior means he is something other than. Maybe with another actor who plays the role of Clooney, the film can be a little tasty. Sorry, George, I doubt Oscar will nod this time. George Clooney is definitely catching the comedy out of the water (if you don't refer to your policy). Anyway, only the hottest fans of Clooney will enjoy watching Leatherheads, everyone else on the long quiet day.
