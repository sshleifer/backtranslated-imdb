"Blame it on Rio" is a romantic comedy of 80's style that is more than eye-catching throughout the 101-minute working hours. <br /> <br /> The plot has two middle-aged men in crisis, one sorting through divorce, the other dealing with the same outlook. Both are good friends, they decide to rest in exotic Rio de Janeiro, both with their daughters. Complications that occur when one of them participates in another daughter. <br /> <br /> This potential story of rebellion is quite funny and has some good features, but it is never funny as it might have been. Any attempt to deal with a moral problem would not work seriously, and perhaps the director Donen would have had to hold on to the humor. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, but what's really ruined is Michelle Johnson's terrible performance as a naughty little primitive Jennifer. Although he uses his body completely, it is the only thing he has. Michelle's ability to act leaves much to be desired. No wonder we haven't seen anything else. <br /> <br /> Friday, January 7, 1994 - Video
