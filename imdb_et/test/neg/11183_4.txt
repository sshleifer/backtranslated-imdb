Fred Astaire has been reopened with Rita Hayworth one year after their big hit with Columbia, "You'll never get rich". It was a film that put Hayworth on a Hollywood card, but his performance in this romantic musical does not make a recommendation as to why he was so popular. The Buenos Aires Road requires a tyrannical hotel owner to marry her four daughters by age; one may think that the film will be in the 18th century, but no, it is the 1942's. Astaire is a former hoofer-turned gambler who goes to dance to earn money by mixing the beauty of Hayworth's stone-cold society with the sculptor's admirer. Fred looks at Rita with a brotherly smile, but he's so dummy-like (lip-synching his songs like a wide-eyed windshield) that all romantic sparks rush quickly. They dance quite comfortably, but Jerome Kern's score is unemorable, but not too bad. ** from ****
