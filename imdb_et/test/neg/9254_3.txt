I saw this movie purely because it was on the DPP Video Nasty list, and while I'm glad I saw it because it's now "the second Video Nasty" - Andy Milligan's movie isn't really in itself. it is worth disturbing. Of course, the infamous list has much worse movies; but it does not make it easier to see. The movie was obviously hit with a very small budget and it is a translated script; as a veriter works on an idea that is often seen in the cinema of fear, and does nothing new to it. Basically, the plot focuses on three couples who come to the house waiting for the will results. It's not a long time before they came out ... blah blah blah. Nothing happens to most movies; and when we finally get to the scenes that are the basis for banning the movie, they are so amateur and foolish that they can't be taken seriously at any level. It is very good that this film does not have a very long working time, otherwise it could have been used as a particularly unpleasant method of torture. It all stays in an appropriately annoying finish that can be non-epic. Apparently this movie is still banned in the UK; but I doubt that this is due to the value of this shock. Basically, looking at blood rituals is not worthwhile and I see no reason to suggest it. If you haven't seen your business on the Video Nasty list of course ...
