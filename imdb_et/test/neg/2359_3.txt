"The Best Movie of the 90s" "Welsh Trainspotting" .... Aye, right! I went to this movie with very high expectations and it was downhill. <br /> <br /> This movie was supposed to be the archetypal film of the drug culture of the early 90s that allowed us all to see this scene and break the media's perception after the moral panic that followed Leah Bett's death in 1995. Unfortunately, it's a bit short. <br /> <br /> When Trainspotting was able to treat you as an adult, and the potential problems surrounding drugs, it just gave us some of the miracles of drugs and how you like it, just like in a totally open mind. Cue some fear of Bill Hicks and Howard Marks nausea. It is sometimes painful bad. I mean, the result of the scene between Lulu and her aunt was to laugh out loud to me. <br /> <br /> Now, maybe I'm just a cynic, but the way Jip leads us through this story is like listening to this acidic frazzled man you've ever met in a house that tells you how "man" keeps us back, and how Acid has released him from the strains of modern society. You just want to shake her somewhat and ask her to leave the room. <br /> <br /> The script was a real problem for me because when Trainspotting had an excellent book from Irvine Welsh, which it refers to, it was written and directed by Justin Kerrigan. The words "Jack of all occupations, no champion" must be reminded. You can see where his inspiration comes from, especially the narrative style of the main characters from Jip (which determines the main character in a social situation where he speaks directly to the camera and describes what his thoughts are when the scenario is playing) The problem is that some camera calls are just painful. This mainly concerns the absence of Jip's empathy, but they are so desperate for philosophical that they just sound like your average A-level drama project. The direction is good, and the intentions are good, but it is so lacking in any integrity that you start thinking about what the leap is. <br /> <br /> However, saying it is not all bad. There are moments that are really fun and fun. Moff is a highlighted film for me. For an independent film, he also succeeded in attracting a large number of high-quality British actors / actors, perhaps describing why such a buzz was on the film. Not a long shot, but if you are looking for a definite Sunday night, it may be your bag. Inevitably, however, the leap in the film is flawed.
