I saw this Hallmark television movie when it was originally. I lost interest in this story because the character was a witch. I was not in the right view to watch this movie. But Hallmark stands for the best and high quality movies. Now there is a reason to give this film another look. Clive Owen, who plays "Damon Wildeve", may be able to choose the next James Bond 007 when Pierce Brosnan passes on. Clive Owen may need to wait until 2008. Another reason is female leader Catherine Zeta-Jones is now a celebrity (she was unknown at that time) and became the Academy's award winning outstanding supporting actress in 2003. Joan Plowright as "Mrs. Yeobright" is also in this movie. I like the opening of this movie: "Bring my heart from this terrible lonely place. Send me a great love somewhere or else I will die, really I will die."
