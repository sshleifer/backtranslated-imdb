For me this movie is just a very flat teen party movie with all the usual clich√©s and boring stereotypical characters (Nerds, Jocks, Popular Girls, Sleezy Boys etc) but it is based on the anti-drug / drinking theme. <br /> <br /> If you ever have an unfortunate chance of seeing this movie, then follow all the references to hold it and keep it real (if you don't yet say it), I think the only thing that would make this movie cool would be it is when they play a fire on television. It or the DVD was exploding ... <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10,000 - Watch Animal House.
