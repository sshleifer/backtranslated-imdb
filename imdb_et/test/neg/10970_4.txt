Although he made his debut in Australia and left the United Kingdom and then the American career to continue, Australians say the biggest film star they've ever produced was Errol Flynn. I'm not sure he ever went back to Australia after his failure in Captain Blood. Yet, I attribute the dignity of Aussie, known to this film, for suppressing one's reputation. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem that tells about Errol Flynn's biography was that he talked high enough about the law in his life until his end in memory, My Wicked Wicked Ways. I saw that a lot of movies were based on that and reading the lines of that book. <br /> <br /> His mother's infidelity against his father was not written, but it could have been concluded that I read my evil Wicked Ways. She didn't particularly like the woman, which is clear from some sources. I want the film to be more engaging with New Guinea's adventures, for me, my Wicked Wicked Ways was the most interesting part. As for the street fighting during depression, I tend to believe it. Even if he had done so successfully, I guarantee that it would be enough to destroy his appearance and never to have been a senior man's career. Sydney's atmosphere of depression was well taken and Guy Pearce is a charismatic Errol Flynn. American viewers know him best as a bright but honest Lieutenant at Exley LA Confidential, which came out the same year as Flynn. <br /> <br /> But LA Confidential was a much better film.
