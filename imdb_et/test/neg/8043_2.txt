Ugh. This film has so many incredible features that they did what might have been a good film for a terrible confusion. The story is half-decent, but plot holes make literally ridiculous. We really have to believe that the secret service would be in conflict with common sense and would allow the President of the United States an incredible risk. If this is an indication of what the mindset of the President's defenders is about to make a good decision, then we are all in trouble. Roy Scheider is a good president, but unfortunately it is compensated by the real reluctance of Patrick Muldon (who somehow continues to create jobs in Hollywood, relying solely on his good looks and his unpleasant ability to smile regardless of the possibility that the script requires smoking). Maybe someone sees it and is inspired to make a good movie from the premise - or maybe someone sees it and says, "Hey, when they get a movie that's bad, maybe I can!"
