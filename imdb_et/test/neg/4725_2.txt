The next "review" is one of the wrong side of the stories, which means two things: You do not listen to anything but praise me and do not let me be deceived. I can also tell you that this survey does not include a spoiler, but technically ... it's wrong. <br /> <br /> Well ... Turn around. I'm just a little bit going. It has been some time since I had such a bad movie so much fun. And if you can't enjoy that good spot, you just don't have a sense of humor. First of all, this film was to be taken seriously and this is the main aspect of the fun. Story? The doctor's son has become ill. Daddy-Doctor decides that the charter transplant must be the only way to save his son. So, in the style of a mad doctor, he decides that the heart of the gorilla does this trick. Of course, the gorilla heart is a "too human being", so the boy-boy becomes such a terrifying Ape-Man who breaks right away and continues to kill and rape (because that's just what every horny beast would do, isn't it?). Our Ape-Man's structure is fun. There is simply no other way to put it: the boys face looks like turd! I'm talking about human faeces here, solid brown! Beautiful! This flick gore is also great: in addition to the actual film material for open heart surgery, we also have incredibly fake (but rather nasty) blood and gore effects: decapitation, eye contact, laryngeal ripple, tilt of someone's skull, ... It's fun and really is it is incomprehensible why WOMEN'S SMALL APES has ever made this notorious UK Video-Nasties list, because all the nasty things depicted in this movie are just too ridiculous to be serious. Oh, and there's a bloody monkey running around. So it goes without saying that LA HORRIPILANTE BESTIA HUMANA is the story of this terrifying and convincing science that is terribly wrong. depicting female nudity, this film can be very entertaining with ingredients such as meaningless dialogues, cheap cardboard kits, stupidity and incredibly poor performance. Maybe there are just a few random examples? Sets: It is obvious that the set designers used the same walls, doors, windows (etc.) over and over to build different sets of interior (eg: one side of the hospital room - side of the window - where there is an unconscious wrestling girl, suspiciously similar) like the cellar-side of the window from which Ape-Man flees, the compilers have made one side window in the laboratory, making it a bit bigger and just placing it in the hospital conference room, all the walls of the building are the same gray, ...). Then there is the park. It is clear that the studio shows (many times) that the grass is open. Whenever a fight / fight / rape occurs, the grass moves directly and mixes and you see gray concrete underneath the studio floor. <br /> <br /> Only a few random lines that come out of the actors "mouth: <br /> <br /> - in a conference room where all doctors are discussing the disappearance of consciousness wrestling (disappearance, which of course would mean a bad public in the hospital), Daddy-Doctor intelligently "We find ourselves in a difficult situation". <br /> <br /> In the same discussion, a colleague-doctor explains intelligently "Dream Dreamer!" "The disappearance of an unknown wrestler. <br /> <br /> - After our exploratory detective, his logical deduction concludes an amazing process and tells his boss that the murderer must be half man / half beast, his boss answers that this is absurd, adding a line "It's more likely to be late, more and more, you watch a lot of these fear pictures on your television ..." Truly one of the best features of the movie. <br /> <br /> Other sources of laughter: <br /> <br /> - These two scenes were Daddy-Doctor and his Igor-like assistant, who kidnap gorillas from the zoo and the anti-conscious wrestling hospital - these well-thought-out robberies are like taking candy from a child. <br /> <br /> - Daddy- Doctor talks to God a lot, isn't he? <br /> <br /> - Sonny-boy who calls Daddy-Doctor "Papa" more than once. <br /> <br /> - Old lady shouts "Aaargh !!! Dead man! Dead man! Dead man! LIKE MAN !!! ". <br /> <br /> - The plot stops periodically in women's wrestling to go ahead and do nothing with this concept. Of course, Daddy-Doctor replaces Sonny-Boy's gorilla-heart with a second unconscious wrestling girl, but do you think after that, something wonderful happens like Ape-Turd-Man grows breasts or something trying to rape men at this time? Our leading life-wrestling (Norma Lazareno) does not even go to a climatic wrestling competition near the Ape-Turd-Mani film final ... Aga Ape The Turd-Man begins to show some mother's love to the end ... almost (and I say almost) ") a real KING KONG style (ie the upper part of the building and the people on the ground who point and shout). <br /> <br /> Okay, I think it's now enough. The rational assessment of Vomitron for this amazing relaxing staircase: 2 / 10.Vomitron rating From the wrong side of the routes: 8/10, see this movie, people. well worth it!
