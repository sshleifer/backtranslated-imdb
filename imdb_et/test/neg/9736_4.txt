Despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century, historians and World War II are, in general, a good gentleman of Erwin Rommel, a soldier's soldier and a brilliant tactician in the field of manned warfare. If only Hitler had given him his troops and the material he wanted in Africa, the statement would go, things would be very different. And that is probably true. In fact, Rommel was a military genius and honest in all accounts. <br /> <br /> But this film goes out to portray him as a near-feast. He does his job of trying to defeat Hitler's war, but constantly Fuhrer intervenes and gives him ridiculous orders that Rommel (James Mason) expresses astonishment, but rarely actually questions and never, never. Only when it is obvious that Hitler directs Germany to destroy, Rommel thinks of betrayal against him; this dilemma plays the main theme of the movie, a good person in bad situations, trying to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> Mason is good as Rommel, but it's hardly a memorable force to say, George C. Scott as Patton. Of course, Rommel was not as colorful as Patton, but this film is so deliberate that he would look like a decent person who would forget to make him interesting. From time to time he loses his sex as his wife, Lucie (young Jessica Tandy, well cast), but is usually asked Mason to give bold British results? as if the Britons had tried to demand Rommel for himself (although all the Nazis have English accents except Hitler). <br /> <br /> Made inexpensively, any battle scenes sweeps the stock and beaches in Southern California for Tunisia doubles, there's nothing particularly to recommend for this movie. Transformation may be interesting (I chose Ed Harris only because of the slight physical similarity and well, Harris can act) when it tasted a little, but this film proved to me how much more demanding we have become as viewers in the last fifty years; biography, this fool will never cut it again.
