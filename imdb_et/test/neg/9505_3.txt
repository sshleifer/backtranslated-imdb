It is very difficult to understand this film, why the couple wants to divorce? There's no reason we don't know anything about their life in Lisbon and even something about Marie's work. We can only understand that a certain hole appeared in this life. We don't even know who the divorce is. <br /> <br /> The way of filming is special: I didn't know the name of the director before the end of the movie, when I read it on the screen, I realized why it was so slow, just 42 pictures in 100 minutes (I thought of them)! It reminded me of some of the Japanese films I saw in the 90s, actually we have to accept that this is an expression of another culture, even when the set is random. I don't know if this story would fit a Japanese pair. <br /> <br /> The logic of the scenes can be seen, but the result is clean, but I decided to look at it as I wanted to get all its spirit and meaning. In fact, I only realized that the story of these two beings might not be over, as the train leaves the station without Marie. It's been so long for so long! I can't recommend this work.
