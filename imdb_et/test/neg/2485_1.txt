I saw this movie on a video tape with my younger brother for a long time, despite the fact that I was a young boy with hearing impairments. I had no closed caption decoder at that time (it was 1986, the year of the Transformers: film), but I could track the plot and understand what was going on. It wasn't my fault that I saw an animated film for girls. My father rented this video to show it to my other sister. <br /> <br /> Ten years later, I rented a video (50 cents) to watch again with a closed caption on. My memories of this movie completely destroyed none other than WRETCHED SCRIPT. I've seen a lot of badly written movies (such as COOL AS ICE and JASON HELL: FINAL FRIDAY), but I've never seen (or heard) this dialogue badly, but only enough inanimate to smile your head in hysterical and screaming pain that lasts torture of this movie. In spite of good plots and intriguing story concepts, the script must be one HIGHLY WRITTEN SCREEN, BAR NONE! The incompetent Howard R. Cohen should never work as a scriptwriter, professional or otherwise. I can't believe they would even allow a terrible script to show such a movie. Did the Japanese producers read the script in English or translated it before they knew what they were? Even nonsense like G.I. Joe's film and my little pony Movie have redeemed the values ​​compared to its abomination. <br /> <br /> If you're a big 80's animation or just taking a nostalgia trip, STORE RAINBOW BRITE and STAR STEALER! It doesn't matter if you missed an animated movie with a live or traumatic scripted script or haven't seen this movie, HOW THE FOLLOWING MOVIE IS NEXT. Watch the movie with a precaution to learn how not to write a bad script!
