... and I bought the Vampire Motorcycle staggers all over the line like drunk with his shoelaces tied together. Some "bad" movies are quite enjoyable (like Norman J. Warren's inseminoid), some "bad" movies are just bad (like Kent Bateman's chiefs), but "bad" movies that try to postmodern awareness bad should always be very careful. Many people think, for example, that Troma Terror Firmer is a masterpiece of bad taste, but I think anyone over the age of 19 will loot it as a worthless dreck. Then there is John Carpenter's Dark Star. Yes, it is a peculiar and definitely product of that time, but as a film it is just above the upper value of two dents. This British black-comedy-horror outing strives to achieve a satirical tone with endless references by his fellow explosive clip (including a lot of Psychomania, a horror hospital, and Pete Walker), but because of the frustrated ways of performing on the other side -string TV actors (the leading lady looks like Amy Winehouse), a script that seems to have been written on the back of a skinned beermat by two "boys", not realizing how movie comedy works, Dean Friedman (intentionally?) Lift-rock soundtrack and production values ​​that don't rise above average will result in a movie that can rather laugh as an AT than not. If your idea is an anthropomorphic turkish, then Chinese-called Fu King and references to long forgotten television advertisements will enjoy it, but don't wait too much.
