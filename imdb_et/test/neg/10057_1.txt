Nightmare star Robert Mitchum as a world-tired private eye exploring the case of a lost industrial company (Mike Connors). She is hired by a lost man's anxious woman, Jaclyn Smith. What Jaclyn Mitchum does not know is that she knows the whereabouts of her husband completely. After all, he was the one who helped his lover James Franciscus dispose of his wealthy hubby. <br /> <br /> What else to expect from rotten slasher film Robert Mitchum? Mannix goes west, monkeys are abused, models adopted against classical cars, and Sybil Danning has continually refreshed Smith until the giallo-style wrapping process brings the whole sadness to the bitter end. It's a BAD movie. And this movie is so bad. It looks like Halloween, mixed with Trick Or Treats. Avoid this. <br /> <br /> R rated for graphical violence, nudity, and sexual situations.
