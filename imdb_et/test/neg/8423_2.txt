So, what is one do if you are a black-out star star? I know to become a pop star! This documentary - and I use this concept loosely - follows Colton's trials and misery when he tries to change himself from a homosexual star to an electronic (reading: dance) music singer. I just want Mr. Ford's voice to be as muscular as his hands ... sorry to say his vocals are painfully thin. Not much interesting here, but Mr Ford and friends are eye-catching. <br /> <br /> Look at her to record a song that sounds just like every other pointless dance. See him traveling to New York to make "connections". Look back at L.A with little success. See yourself in the mirror and ask, "Why do I waste time watching this confusion?"
