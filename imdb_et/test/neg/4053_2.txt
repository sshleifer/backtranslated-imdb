The only act they have ever done, the NSW, refused to finance the film. The producers took a big smell and they were gaining publicity for Victoria. In addition to the lost work of technicians, NSW was happy that he was not involved ... <br /> <br /> The film does not work on almost all levels. Postmodernism fails, casting fails (what is the nature of Rome's Byrne, which one-dimensional nervous nasty did Hugo Weaving's channel? What the hell does Pia Miranda's character do?) And the story is a clich√© of contradictions. In fact, the story runs rather than as a plot of a full plot with a drawn preface. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this was the way that "pop culture meets depression" style was better thought and done. When casting was quirkier, if the style was less serious ... if almost everything was different. <br /> <br /> In addition to the usual top quality in costumes, design and cinematography (like most Australian films), the movie is just a complete rescue. <br /> <br /> In a report over $ 7 million, "Tender Hook" is a symptom of Australian film industry malpractice - wrong people and wrong projects get funding. Compare this nonsense "Noise" (under $ 2m) or "Cedar Boys" (under $ 1m) and you get that idea. Harsh, interesting films are fighting for funding and loose, overwhelmed by the names of overwhelming projects. <br /> <br /> The financial institutions that invested in it deserve to go the same way as the character of Hugo Weaving. the end of the movie.
