I never started to look at the exhibition until it was canceled and started showing again. I enjoyed this first to third season. When I saw the fourth and fifth things I started to anger. The first problem was that they did this irrelevant, a scenario that repeated itself (Jr, who had a child like his parents). The second was to be where they had everything with someone (for example, Katie and franklin). The third was when they made Jr even more idiotic than before, which started to be annoying and embarrassing to the point where I wanted to go to T.V. and beat him foolish until he was unconscious. The fourth was supposed to be such an avid dork that Clarie claimed to be a boy. Fifth, Katie was supposed to be too good and treated her with a "boyfriend" Franklin as she was. Last but not least, Noah Gray-Cabey !! Franklin, Franklin was just scary. It was just as annoying as watching the terrible combination of Urkle and TJ Henderson !!! They jumped seriously when they came to the show. There was little reality with his character, and how he laughed was an obvious force to show that Noah could not act. From time to time I saw the boy just made me fool. But B.F. (before honesty) it was funny and very fun.
