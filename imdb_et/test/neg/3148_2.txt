As a child of the 1980s, I grew up with so many educational and extramural programs (or both) and learned them so much now that I admire their wisdom. After Sesame Street has learned to name the best example, it is not just the fact that before reading adults I could read at adult level, but only raised the disgust that I feel about not only the Lyon company and its product, but also those who protect them. If I believed those whom we give to protect us or our children, Barney & Friends still pollute our waves after more than ten years, discriminating not only for the FCC, American trade and its makers, it is a discriminatory collection to humanity. In a world where I cannot be approached by police, welfare services, and child protection agencies for just different births than people in power, broadcasters are allowed to force this home without question, you have to ask what you see in a world where we expect us to behave like adults and our own We are considering what we say to our sons and daughters is important because they often have consequences long after we have gone. Our attempts not only to make our children more ordinary, more like, more thinking, potentially devastating, which we finally teach them normal, also play a big role. So the question is what Barney teaches our children normal. In addition to such lessons as we are not good, if we do not have good feelings, or that someone changes the rules to make us happy when we get short, there are other shocking things shown at Barney's show, Barney's child harassing. The issue of kidnapping and torture of children is great in our society, and since then we have begun to pretend it was not, but that would be one of the most inappropriate ways of presenting the subject. /> <br /> So far, I have only mentioned inappropriate and emotionally harmful lessons that Barney himself introduces. Adding the problem is shown to children. I use the word "kids" loosely here because the age range shown is three years and fourteen. However, the difference in emotional response is not shown in either extreme. Fourteen-year-olds react to Barney and his proposed situations in exactly the same way as five years old. Childhood and adolescent autism experts find this particularly incredibly inaccurate that children are allowed. Autistic spectrum adults who face growing problems because their needs were not only met but also failed, have a tendency to look at it and get into the trouble of Barney doing things that would make fourteen-year-old cry. Like the older children's market-oriented exhibitions, as you can't do on television, they're so uneven and sick that they're all over Barney, showing that not only different ages react the same thing differently, so So in response to mdmireles1295, I must say that I hope they do not have children as hell. Every time I see a parent who shows my child this generation, it gives me a huge desire to report them to the police about child abuse. And I'm talking about a man whose whole upbringing was dominated by abuse. They can sing behaviors, loving, caring or sharing, but the examples in the examples are not only so small that they would be an educational opposite, but they lack the reality to become dangerous, as the Light Triton has already pointed out. The lessons learned from Barney are that people do not change, feelings must always be suppressed and the rules are completely arbitrary. Compared to the lessons that vary around the world and even the bitterest feelings have the purpose of television teaching me as a boy, it still thinks that the authorities have not yet stepped in and encouraged it in the trash. air. If a parent did with her child what Barney was doing all over the world, they would have a criminal charge. <br /> <br /> So I gave Barney my favorite two out of ten points, which I give to everyone a completely unrecovered value for garbage. There is no place for adults in the world who know how to respond properly to their children.
