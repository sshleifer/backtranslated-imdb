This movie "Vampires: Returning" is not really worth two out of 10. The film is very predictable from the start until the end of our hero killing the leader of the vampire cutters. The use of music in this film was even bad, it played as if you were expecting something important in every other case, although it never did. Action was the best B-rank ... And the movie was fair, boring. The only reason I give this film out of 2 is because the story was potential, though it couldn't deliver. Did I mention a wardrobe? The wardrobe of this film was probably a cheap "nonexistent" because our hero and his girlfriend (whom he is trying to record the whole movie) wear the same clothes throughout the film. I recommend this movie only if you are really bored and you don't have a good wall with fresh colors. ~ Dave, Horror Cowboy
