One mother, her son and daughter and their hippie chick friend are camping in the woods. The yellow ski mask appears on the muscle, a mechanical maniac. He will terrorize and sexually violate the family before they murder. Wilderness is loaded with ugly hardcore sex, forced incest and blatant racism. It's just as politically wrong as XXX roughies get.The score is stolen from Hitchcock's horror classic "Psycho" and also "Jaws." The action is terribly terrible, editing is bad and logic is bad The repetitive nature of sexual scenes reduces the film after this, so a short runtime is a blessing. Violence scenes are quite disgusting, for example, a hippie girl is drilled with a mechanic in her groin, and blood from the 10th can see her foot and blood is generous.
