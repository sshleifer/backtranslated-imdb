I rented a bunch of wastewater, hoping for a few good laughs. With a title like "Zombie Bikers from Detroit" and Dead Alive products that are attached to the front cover, you might think it might be a funny / harsh film, but not. This is the worst film I've ever seen (and yes, I've seen all the police academy movies). The story (inside the joke) and the dialogue are cruel. Seeing the so-called zombies looks like they used one of these two dollars: "Make yourself a Zombie set that you buy in K-Mart. honestly, I can make a better movie for $ 3, some popsicle sticks and slinky.I feel like 90 minutes of my life being removed from me and taken to the Suckdom country. The label of the production does not guarantee a great flick, but you expect your money to be worthy. "Biker Zombies from Pittsburgh." I know for the people of Detroit that they wasted their hard-earned money. If you haven't lobbied? Don't buy, rent if you need? But ??. You regret it.
