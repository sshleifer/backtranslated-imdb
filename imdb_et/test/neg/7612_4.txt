I found this movie very disturbing. Treadwell is mistaken and disturbed until he is likely to suffer from mental illness. The footage shown is his and not the actress, but it still shows behavior that ended with death. Is it appropriate to show the actual material of suicide? Don't stop words. The film shows images showing that Treadwell is a hero, and think again. His film is about him and not about the bears and foxes he is supposed to help. He did not study his habits or numbers and did nothing to protect them. All he did was run around the bush and convince himself that he was better than everyone else. The reality is, helping animals to desensitize people, a great threat to them. His self-conscious behavior did not cause his own death, but also the death of his associate Amy and revealed his beloved bears and foxes to greater harm. <br /> <br /> But I am also worried about Werner Herzog's activities in compiling it as he did. <br /> <br /> Friend and I have had this movie that loved this movie. He believes that seriously disturbed people are doing interesting topics and quoting Downfall as an example. But when they fall, they use actors. We didn't see the real Madga Goebells cyanide caps from their children's mouths. <br /> <br /> Grizzly Manis found something real that reminded me that the terrible tragedy of the football stadium, where people were dead and photographers who could have helped, simply chose to record horror. <br /> <br /> Herzog's film shows that Treadwell's footage is more about Treadwell. But Herzog has done the same. His own personality and opinions are in the documentary that is said to be somebody else's. Scenes such as where he listens to the tape are not necessary. We already knew what was on the tape because the coroner had told us. We didn't need Herzog to tear it as one of Treadwell's former girlfriends. The film did not add a movie. <br /> <br /> The film showed us that Treadwell was very self-conscious, but it also showed us that Herzog is.
