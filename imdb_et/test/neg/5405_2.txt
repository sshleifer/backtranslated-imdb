Scientist Charles and his wife (or assistant) in Marissa get some items and a skull from an old Indian cemetery, and the mysterious creature, the skeleton, is attacking and murdering the vase. The military unit led by Captain Leary (Michael Rooker) then tries to search for two groups of four soldiers lost in each jungle. They face a skeleton by shooting him when he kills every soldier. Then the skeleton man goes to the power plant and Captain Leary explodes the facility that destroys the supernatural nature. <br /> <br /> I bought "Skeleton Man" on a DVD, waiting for a funny trash, but I found a terribly boring, annoying and pointless mess, shoots and explosions. The story of Imbec is completely disconnected and makes no sense, and the military team consists of imbugens, demanding a supernatural skeleton man until they are completely killed. Their leader is also the most stupid - the blasting of the entire facility will end to destroy the supernatural hanging of the extra-terrestrial soldier Predator. It is possible to use the fast and fast button of a movie on a DVD and reduce the viewer's suffering. My voice is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Skeleton Man"
