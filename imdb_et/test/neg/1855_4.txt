The surprise of this effortlessly light film is how such top spirits are put together, something other than hammy uninspiring. Probably it was a proverbial snowball that ran down the hill and quantity and shape. One can imagine that by the time Miranda Richardson contacted her representative, the conversation went over the following topics: "Do you want to film in Dublin, written by Neil Jordan? Michael Caine and Michael Gambon are already in! This is a boring "comedy" that looks like Michael Cain and Dylan Moran and are going to be well off when Moran needs to imitate London's gangland boss (whose arrival is coming soon) to raise a significant amount of money from the local shaft Michael Gambon. The rest is just an unforgettable romp, which is fortunately quite fast. Moran is somewhat amusing in places, but this evidence is better suited to life on small screens that have hit comedies like Black Books. Caine is undisputed in her role and provides lasting performance without being overloaded. One can only imagine what made him log in to the movie - it can't even be read in Dublin in the summer because many scenes are positively behind in the autumn. Gambon steals the show in fact, and anyone who has heard some of his performances like the "I I Got News for You" knows that he is a wonderfully funny man. All in all, the result is disappointing, and it seems that Neil Jordan was already a lifetime of dealing with Mona Lisa's high quality films.
