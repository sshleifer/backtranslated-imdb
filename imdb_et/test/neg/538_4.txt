It's absolutely okay that people die in animation, but it's just too much death. Start from the beginning, the story is about battles, fighting, death and revenge. It goes on and lasts for one and a half hours. At first it was interesting, but after the exhibition I grew up with a tire. Unlike other animations, it is a lack of humor. There are not many interactions between characters. Good thing is a sword fight scene that looks pretty good and the characters are beautiful.
