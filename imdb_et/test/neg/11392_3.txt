This strange little movie begins with the story of Bruno (Alex Linz) in a Catholic school who has no friends and everyday. She likes to wear dresses and her obese mother Angela, a dressmaker, doesn't think their son likes anything. Angela complains to her mother Superior (Kathy Bates), but ignored and when two of them walk back, they drive with other children to harass and lay eggs. Bruno's father Dino (Gary Blue) is divorced from Angel and his son is a sister and he practically denies him. Bruno meets a new student at the school called Shawniqua (Kiami Davael), who is a free spirit and dresses like Annie Oakley with uprights. Angela has a heart attack and Bruno's grandmother takes a step to take care of her when Dino refuses. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a very hard and unsatisfactory view of all involved characters. Angela is wearing Bruno dresses very much when she practically encourages her. Dino was told when she was her young boyfriend because she was a sister because she liked the opera, and now she refuses to help Bruno when she needs it. The Catholic school that Bruno is visiting is very restless and all the children run rampant and even call Shawniquat's "N". When Shirley MacLaine enters the film, she shifts and becomes more family oriented. **** SPOILER ALERT **** The end of the spell of the bee is incredibly built and "feeling good". Bruno, journalists who follow him, suffer and rejoice and photograph their papers. At the same time, Shirley MacLaine acts as a "tough old" who clicks on everyone. One of the things that no one has mentioned in these comments and related to his masculine nature is the character of the Macain in the film. I think Helen's character can be a lesbian! He is very tough and strong, and at one point he shares a whiskey with Bruno and smokes a cigar at the same time. I don't remember anyone in the movie, mentioning who his wife was or was ever married! That's why I think his character may be gay. There are many other good players in the film. Joey Lauren Adams, Jennifer Tilly, Brett Butler, Gwen Verdon, and Lainie Kazan would have had a better look at the script before they logged in. I think when they heard that MacLaine was driving it would be an honor to be part of it. It is very difficult to feel any regret or understanding of any character and the subject is probably impossible for most. The actors are not bad, but exactly what MacLaine was trying to do? Tolerance against young boys who want to wear dresses and freedom of speech? We get it in the first 10 minutes, the rest of the time I didn't catch it.
