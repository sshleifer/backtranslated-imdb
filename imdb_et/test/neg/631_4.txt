Not a terrible movie ... But there are monster scenes where you roll on the floor laughing - not a good act / thriller. In general, action is pretty decent for a SciFi movie. Barry Corbin plays a trusted US Senator and Lou Diamond Phillips once again gives us a decent military / police / sheriff / agent / marshal. Special effects are very "special" - for example, external train shots are obviously a model train. <br /> <br /> Goofs: A meteor opens a stationary car. The car breaks into flames, but it doesn't come in customs. After the collision, the meteor is placed at the top of the car's body - impossible from the low angle that the meteor entered. <br /> <br /> Spoilers ... <br /> <br /> A good part of the movie's events are predictable, from a helicopter crash ("Pull up, pull up!") that distracting people will end up with a classic blown bridge over 1000 feet of abyss waiting for the train. end setting. <br /> <br /> Scenes from aliens are fun. They are cruel dolls and are moving at a lighter speed - do you remember the Monty Python rabbit? Spoiler Goof: In one scene, four people will not be able to capture a single creature after the clip is stuck because they are moving at a flash speed. Later, Todd Bridges speaks of a small flame thrower he uses to send many creatures in the vicinity. On several occasions, Lou Diamond Phillips can easily grab creatures with his bare hands.
