Dear Dante, <br /> <br /> Dude, seriously ... the title of the exhibition is "Horror Masters". And, as it is, it should be an opportunity to show your horror to show the world why you deserve to be called the "captain of the genre". Obviously, this exercise was misunderstood. You probably thought it was your chance (or worse, your obligation) to educate the American public about your political beliefs. And your experiment comes as nasty, overwhelming and above all glorious. <br /> <br /> The only reason ANYONE noted your short, high score is that their political views are right for you and they are the people who I don't think such a policy should be thrown under their throat. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I don't give what you believe they believe or believe ... I just want these obvious (not subtle) and uncomfortable (not satirical) messages from my fear. And while there were definitely other "horror masters" that were great disappointments or where I was just confused about why this director (william malone?) Was considered a "captain" ... you just miss the whole series just for the rest. <br /> <br /> So next time ... can you just keep your preaching policy yourself?
