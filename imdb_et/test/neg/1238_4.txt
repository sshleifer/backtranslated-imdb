I'm not sure this review includes a spoiler, but I play it safely, noting that it may be. Regardless of this, it is unlikely that anyone will not look at the film that does not know the book. <br /> <br /> There's an old wisecrack working hard and highlighting the mouse. "Comanche Moon" is such a mouse. <br /> <br /> The novel focuses more on Indians than Americans. When adjusting to TV, McMurtry and Osanna rightly argued that the audience is more interested in white than red. Unfortunately, there is little in the novel that we do not yet know Gus, Woodrow and their friends. So the film usually gives us a terrible preset of the "Lonesome Dove" event. Indians, who have their own story to tell, have largely fallen into the background - so much that someone who hasn't read the novel is not sure why it is called "Comanche Moon". /> The novel has no general story or "point". It could have been confirmed in the film, pulling a stronger contrast between the Indians who lose their land and lifestyle for the urging Americans who bring civilization. This option was missed. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Loneome Dove", "Comanche Moon" has scarce scenes that develop character or relationships - at least among Americans. Extended scenes with Indians have been largely removed or shortened. And for a four-hour movie, it's very episodic and dirty. Feels that the script was initially longer, and cut to reduce production costs. <br /> <br /> The scenario consists mainly of clich√© dialogue, aphorisms and platids. The author of "The Last Picture Show" is an amazingly bad script. McMurtry and Osan had the opportunity to solve the story and testimonial problems, but not. <br /> <br /> Some of the best romance dialogues are missing or obviously unjustified. For example, Clara (Cassie) shows her intense hatred for Woodrow (Jack), condemning Guse (Ennis) for always being his "duck". Clara's sexual jealousy, this small perceived revelation has disappeared. There's a place where ur-tight Woodrow warns Maggie that she won't compromise on Jake Spoon. Romance exchange is shorter and tougher; The film brings it down and does not represent Woodrow as a rather socially stupid, emotionally frozen stone it has. (When I read this in a novel in the scene, I wanted to hit Woodrow's stomach - or worse.) There are other changes, some of which are understandable. Inish Scull's eyelids are not cut; this would require costly CGIs. But Buffalo Humpil is not a hump! (Perhaps it seemed unreasonable to ask Wes Stud for such a huge prosthesis.) And the character of Buffalo Hump is "kindler and gentler." He's not nearly as grotesque as he was in the novels. Gus McCrae. It's crazy. He duplicates the Duvall manners and the way of speaking without ever being "deliberate" or self-conscious. Like Duvall, he is completely inside the character. And he actually shows us that Gus will become "more" in the third part. <br /> <br /> The best thing about "Comanche Moon" is that it does not violate our "Loneome Dove" affection, not just the great Western but great American film. PS: For those who think Rachel Griffiths was up - it was like she was in the book.
