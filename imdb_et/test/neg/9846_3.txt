This movie was terrible in one word. It was boring, predictable and even terrible. I was expecting it to end and when it was done, I was scared. The end was a bad taste in my mouth. My advice to someone interested in movies related to female sexuality: stay away from this movie. Such films give the classic name Lolita a bad name.
