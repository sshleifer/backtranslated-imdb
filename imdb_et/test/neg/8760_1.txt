Always enjoy classic horror movies, but this movie was really a waste of time and when John Carradine didn't play a mad man's doctor who can control people through his experiments. This film was made during World War II and John Carradine was a German Nazi worker who found a human weapon against the world. Bob Steele plays in many roles like a cowboy or gangster, and in this picture Bob seemed to be bored when he participated in his film, and acted like his first film. Mantan Moreland (Jeff) gave excellent performance with excellent comedy that helped keep the audience focused. I hate to criticize a film made in 1943, but it's really a big disappointment. If you like John Carradine and the roles he played with Count Dracula during many films during the 1940s, you might just want to see how John does his best.
