CANNIBAL FEROX (1+ outta 5 stars) Fake excuse for a movie you might like to enjoy if you really like boring, pointless jungle movies spiced with graphical violence scenes. A couple of drug dealers travel from mobile to the jungle of Paraguay to search for emeralds and cocaine. They meet another young traveler and his two hot babies, one of whom is an anthropologist who is finally trying to prove that cannibalism has never existed and never existed. One of the two dealers turns out to be a little psychopath, and he tortures and kills a few natives so that they can tell him where they hide their gems. (And how could they even tell him if he doesn't speak his first language?) Well, natives are not suddenly too happy white people in their jungle and they are all grabbed by reluctant torture. Poor performance, bad plot and bad direction. Not a decent 90 minute tense moment. Even special effects are not particularly convincing (though a few frames still make the most of the viewers). The only good scene in the whole movie is when two women are imprisoned behind the mud and seem to be touching the hearts of indigenous peoples with the transfer of their "Red River Valley". The following is a movie quoted, but I would not be surprised how many viewers would not say exactly the same thing: "Oh God, please let him die soon. Oh, let him die soon.
