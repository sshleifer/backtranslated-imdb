Let me point out that I am writing, I'm a huge fan of George Clooney and I love John Krasinski's 'job'. Well, I was and I did. <br /> <br /> It was the world's worst hanging nail and took 113 minutes. Stunning boredom only interrupted my frequent attempts to read my watch and evaluate when it will be over. <br /> <br /> Every funny scene was previewed. All three of them. The actual story, character development was not and the script was just bad. I have had a colonoscopy that was more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The title should have been SuperDuper Bad. This movie is a Razzie lock. It should get the whole Razzies. I want my money back.
