Oh boy, oh boy. This film is something for lovers of "true" cineatique art. It really makes no sense at all. It's totally boring, especially because it's "anti-climaxes". All people behave more than weird and unreal. Sometimes it seems like sitting in the theater, because in the dialogues the actors stand in front of the camera (and hence the audience) instead. As I said earlier, if you are in those more Artistic movies that Cannesis shows, go to it. If you are not, leave this film alone because you are more than frustrated and finally you know you have wasted your time - as I did. Two thumbs down ...: - ((((
