I'm sorry, but they gave the impression that these squads fought before the zombies. But they certainly didn't act like they even saw a zombie before. Jumping and turning them back like amateurs. Secondly, the characters are quite poorly written. Participants did the best they could, I blame for bad writing and bad leadership. Finally and here is where the spoiler warnings are greatest. They lose the sample twice and the girl Jennifer Holland doesn't know if she's been a little or not. How stupid is it? As far as it is bitten, one might think that you would know, plus a gallon of blood that leaks from your body, is a good idea. Dumb, the first film, had some drawbacks, but it's traceable again, unlike the movie disaster I barely got through once. I'm giving a house to twenty people: NO GUTS, ALL STUPIDITY CRAP-O-LANTERN
