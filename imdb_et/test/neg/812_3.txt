Outside Sweden, this movie is not expected. Head to you. There are several actors who are an important part of the history of contemporary Swedish film. And still .. <br /> <br /> Peter Dalle seems to have had only a 20-minute idea. Robert Gustafson has been fully exploited in this film, trying to copy the younger GÃ¶sta Ekman. By the way, Ekman is the only one who meets expectations. <br /> <br /> The credit you can give is a photo, a great black and white idea. The music is fine. <br /> <br /> But it is all a waste of gods and time of the audience.
