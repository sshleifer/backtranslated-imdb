This home video is basically scandalous garbage, but you have to try 3/10 of them. Blood is garbage, but the grandmother who kills them is pretty funny and I think this concept is good and make-up for home video is OK. But thanks to God, it was only 55 minutes long, and at the end it was literally a Fight Club (just like a trash as a movie). Just read this comment, don't look at the movie.
