This is the worst film I've ever seen. If I didn't look at it for free, I would never have finished it. The creators of this movie should be ashamed of themselves. It looks like it should be in the scenes of Scary Movie and Date Movie (a terrible movie, but 10x better than this), but it couldn't be miserable. The only joke in this movie seems to be based on slapstick. The guy falls off, somebody gets hit by the bus and the like. No idea is wise, basically the worst assumption of the film. The plot (or lack thereof) is completely slowed down. There seems to be a coach and his family in the middle of the plot, but there are so many other things in the film that are completely ridiculous. A terrible and terrible movie.
