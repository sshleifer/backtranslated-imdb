AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HOW TO HURTING STOP? That's what I said somewhere between the beginning and the second part of the movie that really did. This movie slipped almost all my life and I've been sitting through some very bad movies. Actually, waiting for Puppet Master fan, I hear it, but it's true. The plot is a dude, special effects are terrible, the sound is watching the most benawl, infernal branding I've ever heard. Oh! I almost forgot the actor, it was so bad that I forgot it was there at all. The only redeeming factor in the movie is the dolls they actually have stars, and everyone could act, except Guy Rolfe himself (he is a puppet scientist), and while you see your wires and strings, they carry me Retro-Puppet Master all the way to the painful start. i finish. Ultimately, PM7 is recommended for real fanatics who are masochists. <br /> <br /> Roach <br /> <br />
