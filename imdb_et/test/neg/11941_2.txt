Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart in the "romantic" drama celebrate Zeta-Jones, a player who plays his niece when his sister is killed in a car accident. Although he has taken care of family problems, he has been replaced by Eckhart. <br /> <br /> Unfunny maudlin story that has no chemistry between anyone (he is dead fish and he's okay, but not much). Looking at this, I wondered why anyone would want to see it because the nature of Zeta-Jones is so unlikely. Come on he is so obsessed with cooking and is the best he does is cook his therapist or talk about food. Ugh. I'm not using any of the many ways of thinking. I couldn't finish it.
