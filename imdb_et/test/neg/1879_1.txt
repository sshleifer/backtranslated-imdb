Cronica de un desayuno combines the worst drawbacks of the Mexican cinema, which is a rare play today. <br /> <br /> It's pretentious: he wants us to believe it's deep, just because some scene is out of focus, the other is pseudo-surreal, another is playing Eisenstein-Infante-Caifanes With a tradition of laughing at a laughing face, the edition is fragmented and it's all so festive. <br /> <br /> She has a weak script: the main story hardly evolves, so it has three smaller, unnecessary stories. They're just fine for the film to last longer. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting is bad. A real performance that reminds us that many famous Mexican actors were cast. <br /> <br /> It is an abuse of unnecessary language. In the sense that Paloma, who symbolizes the dreams of a child's freedom, uses it quite well. <br /> <br /> It's homophobic. The character played by Eduardo Palomo is sorriest and the most punishable transexual I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's very boring. Finally, I impressed people who left the theater before the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever it is trying to do, it's better done in Mexico and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> In the second words: "Para partirte la madre, nada como una mala pel√≠cula"
