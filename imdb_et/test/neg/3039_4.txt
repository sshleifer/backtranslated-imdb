When strangers talk to this year's transformation group, movies like Poseidon are over the horizon. Directed by Simon West (Con Air), this is an updated version with many relatively unknown references that indicate whether mortality is high (it is not), or that the stars created are clear from a possible turkey. In its relatively short 87-minute period, it is mainly two laws. The first one that takes one hour is the setting. Our heroine Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) spoke about 800 minutes of talk time on his mobile phone (doing mathematics) and, as a responsible person, his parents had seized and grounded their mobile phones. To pay off his debt, he works as a part-time babysitter and took care of the wealthy children of Mandrakis, his first stint. <br /> <br /> The giant Mandrakis manor will receive full treatment because it is the place where all the actions take place. Lots of rooms (doing good hiding), an indoor pool-sized aquarium pond (getting wet, treating wet T-shirts) and checking that motion sensor lights that you just know will contribute to intimidation by manipulating luminaires and shadows. Of course, Mrs.'s speeches, the red herring are surprised to tell about the running time of this act, but most of them fall to arbitration. <br /> <br /> There is a small trend in which the participants are invisible, offering and through their voice. The latest tests include Edward Norton in the Kingdom of Heaven and Hugo Weaving's V Vendett. Here, Lance Henriksen respects an anonymous, unnamed psychotic killer, but it just falls. Why? The script does not give him much dialogue. Most of the phone calls made were of a silent (masturbating) nature, which I felt like waste - they could have done some unknown things instead and work continues. <br /> <br /> The second act where the main activity is taking place is too late. And bogeyman is very clean. Those waiting for blood and gore are disappointed because it is basically one woman who shows your attention in the first hour (eyeballs always succeed), and this action solves all this in a double-fast time, Rachel McAdams Radish Eye. Do not wait for any form development form or sub-blocks that deal. <br /> <br /> The end tried to be too smart for himself and found an inexpensive way to finish the movie. There is not much goodness to bring about this movie - there is no fear, no excitement, no mysterious offender, and a lot of security errors, especially in the case of the alarm of the door - the only thing that is good is to give the number to 4D.
