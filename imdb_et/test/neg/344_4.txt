This movie is proof that you can't just go to Redbox and read the movie descriptions and choose one and give it a try. <br /> <br /> Although I give big credit for getting a movie with semi-special special effects for such a low budget, and at least a semi-decent script and story ... unfortunately it was just: half-decent. <br /> <br /> If you like movies where things are, it's not all properly assembled and don't forget the low budget effects that you like about this movie. To be honest, it wasn't really my cup of tea. I should have gone to bed rather than see my time. <br /> <br /> For better science literature, even from the LOWER budget (!), see "Primary".
