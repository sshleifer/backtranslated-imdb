"Airport 4" is basically a universal confusion for Universal Studios to try to work with a new twist - the Concorde supersonic aircraft - in its "sky heaven" formula. involuntary humor, the best of which is when George Kennedy is holding his hand from the Concorde window at supersonic speed to follow the firearm's heat-seeking missile on the aircraft's trajectory, and the simple fact that these fools travel again on the same plane to continue their flight despite all the air problems . It has many stars, including Robert Wagner, Sylvia Kristel, Alain Delon and Martha Raye as a nervous traveler. <br /> <br /> Not really related to other "airport" movies.
