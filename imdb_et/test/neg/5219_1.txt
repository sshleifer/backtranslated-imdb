OK, Chuck Norris has appeared in many entertainment films over the years. It's not one of them. I don't even bother trying to get to the plot when the Bible shipped wrong. The "acting" of the main characters is wood as Pinocchio would have done a better job! The synthesizer-based soundtrack is even worse than Deathstalker. Traditionally, low budget spooky movies often try to catch their audience by adding a lot of graphic violence, but it tries to listen to the viewer to see religious mambo jumbo. The plot has different versions of the Bible.
