Today you died in the fourth Seagal movie I just held. Wow, I don't know where to start. He seems to poison his lines more and more as time goes on, and the scenes between Seagal and Treach, where they seem to improve, are embarrassing. And what does his girlfriend's dreams relate to something else in the plot? I can't recommend it to anyone else who is the most deadly fan of Seagal, and even then you're better off with your previous job. Four of my films on my marathon (submerged, sun, alien, and today you die) were the worst today. The previous reviewer mentioned this, but the inventory was quite obvious.
