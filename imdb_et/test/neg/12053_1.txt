Yes, I bought camp blood and it wasted about 86 minutes of my life and 5 pounds of my money on that mess, I mean, I didn't expect an amazing movie, judging by the front cover I didn't expect anything big, but at least not the first 3 seconds ( I do not complain about boobs). I complain about what the devil has to do? this movie should have kept it there at home ... they suck ... when the blood was brown and swollen like this real blood ... ... cheap i say i dont color they were just tinted yellow, And the second thing that made me laugh at this sad excuse in the film was that they tried to pretend that the clown was a woman at all times, although it is clearly a flat chested black shorthair man. ..did someone else noticed that the only special effect in this movie was slowing to jump .. it was also a bad oh and solving effect you find in many basic computer programs like ... powerpoint ... this movie blows
