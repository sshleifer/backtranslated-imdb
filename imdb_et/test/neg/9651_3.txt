I think the film was based on a bouncing book. Considering the number of characters and sub-blocks in Katyn, I thought the film's creators, perhaps a writer or director, wanted to create an epic film. But there wasn't enough time to properly spend on developing characters or stories. There were many interrelated side effects that could have been changed. <br /> <br /> When I associate the massacre of all these intellectuals and officers, I do not believe that the film explains all the reasons why the murder was necessary. Was it political? Philosophical? Revenge? An interesting part of historical films is personal motivation or emotion. Instead, Katyn's murderers seemed to be automated, fully controlled by Stalin, who seems to be occasionally framed as charcoal. The depiction of Russians and Germans seemed completely one-dimensional. (Are the Polish people angry with the Russians?) In addition to the choice of music and cinematography, they felt poorly edited and biased or at least unrealistic choices with one another and the film inappropriate. I do not believe that you can make a truly epic war movie or war event in a handheld camera. (But if the director went to the story of characters, perhaps focusing on one family, it might be convenient for the camera to work better.) And if you use truly dramatic music, it must be more balanced with the type of shot.
