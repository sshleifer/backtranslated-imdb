I love Jet Li movies the most (except Romeo Must Die) and I bought this movie very cheaply in three packages with "The Master" and "Twin Warriors". Although Twin Warriors was very impressive and I was very interested in it and the captain was a bit "Karate Kid" but also enjoyable, I thought this film was TERRIBLE. I'm just not saying this because I'm used to better movies. I say it was almost "Kazama". Fighting scenes were terrible (blurry cameras and a real fight) and the plot was your typical "stupid kung-fu plot". If you have a plan, then this stupid (see "man becomes a woman to become almighty, then falls in love with Jet Li") has the best struggles to go with it. If you are looking for an original HK Jet Li movie, I suggest you rent a "Shaolin Temple 2" (aka Kids from Shaolin).
