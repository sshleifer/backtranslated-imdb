The tempest is based on the same name of the classic Shakespeare, but it is little like the source material. tedium. The original tried to assume that people have a side of evil that would not be destroyed if it were unchecked. Here you just get an uninteresting medium life crisis (spider) who has gone wrong in his personal and professional life. He is blessed with the supernatural he uses to control his environment; in other words: get your way. <br /> <br /> Every few minutes, when something else goes wrong in his miserable life, he finds a separate place and starts to hit "Show me a charm!" at the same time moving your hands around and expressing "serious concentration". The way in which these scenes are taken seems to be trying to make mistakes the other type of error. Perhaps the spider is turned into a cockroach, but by then it doesn't care. <br /> <br /> The story has made her life with her daughter on the Greek island somewhere, so it's an uncomfortable relationship with some of the girls she meets, one of the films' eternal novels. The story climbs and moves slower and slower. You never have any reason to please anyone or not. <br /> <br /> I give it 2 because of beautiful Greek location images and a semi-optimistic conclusion (although it is not clear whether the stamp power brought it to an end or not). The spirit of Shakespeare's work is much better than other films; one notable example is the "forbidden planet", which testified to power control. <br /> <br /> In this "Tempest", its only magic is to cure insomnia.
