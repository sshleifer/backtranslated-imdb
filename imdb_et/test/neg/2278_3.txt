It was called "the image of women" and later "chick flick" when times and movies became more minors. The plot is just a soap opera for women and only against those types. The only complaint to most men is if they want to see that the thin Mary Tyler Moore is too thin in the leotards. (If you are of a certain age, like me, it may still be enough to look at it.) Otherwise, MTM will give another of its typical numbers that it has given since the beginning of the 70s when it took it to heart that he was American sweetheart. Christine Lathi gives one more of these abrasive and unpleasant performances that appear to be her real part of the person and apparently only for this type of complaints. (Sorry, but this seems to be true.) Ted Danson is too young as MTM's husband and usually makes a slightly creepy complaint, unless he has a working partner who can soften it. And that won't happen here. Allan Burns wrote and directed and apparently got it all because she worked before Mary, wrote for this project for her, and she had juice for that time to do it. There seems to be no other purpose for this.
