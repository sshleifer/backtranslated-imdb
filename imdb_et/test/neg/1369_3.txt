I was a teenager when it first appeared in theaters, and I saw it in Japan. The film's plot wasn't my cup like a high school graduate, but I went to see it in the 3-D process. It was ballyhooed in the press, so even the carers of foreign workers had heard of it, even though it was not seen at the post office. <br /> <br /> The film started the trend of throwing audience objects. absurd levels with later 3-D movies. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it qualifies as a spoiler, but you are warned if it is. In many films of this time, the actors often work in front of a "rear projection screen" where it can be predicted that the backgrounds may appear to be in a different environment, such as the jungle, when the participants were actually in the sound stage. It works well for conventional films, but when you see them in 3-D, they look like a flat scene behind the actors. There were several scenes in the movie that used the rear projection, and it didn't work well in theaters. If this is seen in 3D, it is another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The only importance of the film is historical, because it was the first of its kind.
