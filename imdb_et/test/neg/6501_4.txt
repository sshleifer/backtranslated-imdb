Avida is a mix of words that combines life and zeal, but I personally think that this film was overcrowded because of its ambitions and does not justify its title. It collects a set of uncomfortable characters that are linked by incredible links. Moreover, the way everything is connected at the end is, in my opinion, a bit pathetic. There were still pictures ... interesting, but that's not enough to be a good movie. I believe this movie should be a comedy, but I certainly didn't notice! The pointless and caricatural nature of a movie is actually the only good thing, but when it pulls in and in, it doesn't become acceptable anymore. I have to say that I fought hard to continue to see it, and I'm still not sure if it was worth it ...
