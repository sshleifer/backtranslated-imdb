There are current streams in the positive reviews of this movie - it's just useless comedy, don't take it seriously. Chillax dude !!! Well, this is one view. The second would be why we accept exactly the same script, the same formula, and the same unsuccessful people in all these "comedies". <br /> <br /> What you get is a beater who, due to some totally unrealistic situation, has to change his life (always a), overcome a number of things that only cause a raccoon or teenager to beat the same stupid bad boy, who is trying to steal him with whom he met two days earlier and won while slipping but more money / self-esteem. On the way somebody does something rough but very illogical. This means that the viewer can call someone after the movie and say something like "you don't believe in this country. This man thinks the stomach has sunk into the diarrheal bucket, the other boy after he drives laxative cookies. your shoes with it ". Fun. <br /> <br /> Most common names appear. David Spade and Rob Schneider make unpleasant shticke, but they are crrrazzeee characters - Russian and I hold my side, a waiter in a vegan restaurant. Adam Sandler, the king of brainstorming, an illogical comedy, produces together and some talentless someone called Dante appears again. The US has to explain to the rest of the world what this man Dante has become famous for. Allen Covert plays a 36-year-old who got the biggest laugh of me. He was 42 years old and seemed over the years. <br /> <br /> Did I smile? Yes, but not more than I sit on TV and I don't have to pay for them. Please stop making these movies.
