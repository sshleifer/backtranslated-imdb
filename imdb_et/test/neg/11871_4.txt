Let's take one thing straight: I like a lot of Snipes work. Unlike his other high times (Seagal and Van Damme) he can actually act. This film, however, does not help to increase its reputation; it's not exactly traceable, but I'm not in a hurry to see it again. In fact, if I never saw it, it wouldn't bother me - there are just a lot of better movies to waste! It is a pity, because a bit of imagination and some fine changes could have been a worthy film. Instead, the director has chosen to try his audience almost and force too much into the overall violence and with very little characterization. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have with the Snipes co-star, Silvia Colloca. It bothers me that the producers of this movie went all out to rent a stunning beautiful (for my money) and talented actor, like Miss Colloca, and gave her such a pathetic one-dimensional character. If he had been hired to just add the "glamor" of the movie, he wouldn't even do it very well; the film has no nudity and no reputation worthy of sex. Weird, really. Given the magnitude of the violence in this film, it disturbs me why manufacturers have taken such a conservative attitude to gender and nudity. Do We Live In 2007 or 1957? What the garbage producers (and probably also the actors) have forgotten is that the films are for fantasy. Like most people on this planet, my real life is very boring. I would like to be behind terrorists, be able to behave like Mr Snipes and get involved with a beautiful young thing like Miss Colloca. This film does not fit well with any of these fantasies. That's why I give him such a bad overview!
