It's really one of the most terrible movies of all time. It is boring, pointless, poorly acted, and teeth loosely pretend. <br /> <br /> I looked about an hour to wait for some drama to open before I realized there was nothing. The shoe string budget was particularly painful. These must be the worst days for a night frame from the ninth plan of field conditions. <br /> <br /> The only barely redeeming feature is the ridiculous "demons" that migrate in the countryside with a plastic cart. How terrible is it? And I did like the moggles used as extras, I think they are the cheapest. Though it seemed a little obvious that some of the tuna placement was attracted to the camera. <br /> <br /> This movie is so terrible that it should have a public health warning. In my local video store, the order was when I took it back, people demanded their money back. I'm a boy you are not!
