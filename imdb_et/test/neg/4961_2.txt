With my two stars I probably get that IMDb? I Hate the Leader "- this is a list of the obviously popular TV series. <br /> <br /> At least thanks to the enthusiastic comments on this site, I decided to buy a series of DVDs because I usually find the British humor the most suitable for me. According to the comments, the most funny bits were already over. <br /> <br /> Now I know that, according to another comment, I have no sense of humor, but then I had to laugh like crazy watching (and watching again) Fawlty Towers where Black Books are "though weakly" thematic. Why different reactions? This can be just a generation, but differences can still be pointed out. <br /> <br /> Both Fawlty Towers and Black Books are created for companies that are intended for their owners Both companies are not successful, but they seem to be happy to survive. Fawlty Towers is funny because the protagonists have to deal with situations they can't do e come in. Funniness lies in making serious efforts to succeed and while laughing at them. Black books don't have situations, it's just there and the owner suffers for himself. When a situation threatens to occur, it is quickly destroyed. It is remarkable how fast and how often the subject is abandoned and when the main characters turn to something completely different to get an extra joke. Talking jokes ?? and not very good - all black books seem to be. Why a bookstore? The iron shop would have done the same job. <br /> <br /> No, stop, wait. This is a bookstore, because the main persons must be sensitive and CULTURED plywood below the rude, vulgar and arrogant. They are not some low-handed gorillas, but worship half of the intellectual losers. Hey, they're like you and me. The only way I can explain this success is how the series makes this statement. There is nothing significant in the activities of the chief man, which is special to them - their economically unrealistic living conditions that many viewers may be envious of. This protagonist, who is a narcissist and coat of arms, expresses a sense of belonging and companionship, seems to be the first time that First World is currently living. <br /> <br /> Recently, I watched Tittybangbang, as well as a fairly new British TV comedy show. I found it amazingly funny. Is it often quite tasteless or xenophobic? but always with the aim and hitting the bull's eye in his social criticism. Humor is mainly created by situations or characters. IMDb's low ratings may indicate that this sense of humor does not match with time, but I am glad that it is still alive and strikes and I hope it will continue.
