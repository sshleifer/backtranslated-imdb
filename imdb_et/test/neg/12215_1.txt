Negative Numbers are not available for this movie's hack! The wood works together with a story that has been repeatedly repeated. Everyone in this movie should participate in anonymous superstars. You think the original story could develop from a general concept. Young men in prep school bind Pearl Harbor bombing. This raises interesting questions, but the way they are transmitted makes it fun. Typical characters were there, including passionate jock and nerd (including glasses). I couldn't care more about the wooden dialogue and the clich√© characters. When I finished the movie, I had to throw the DVD in the trash. Stay away from this dud! You can't get your life back for 90 minutes!
