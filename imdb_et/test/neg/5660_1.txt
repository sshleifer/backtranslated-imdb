The first shutdown is so terrible, except for the actress who plays Spencer. Mirinda Cosgrove doesn't deserve to show her. She should be with Drake and Josh. The only person I like in addition to Spencer is Nevel Hes Super Bad @ $$ He chose Carlys Crews @ $$ And I liked it <br /> <br /> The episode I hate a lot is what I get angry with to this young fan he made me almost kill myself Fake is a good word to describe it please don't look at this on TV is good to go with classics like family things Good show Ban Icarly Allows you to go back to Doug Nick's version, please don't check that I hate Icarly ' d Oh also Nathan Kress is Wannabee Fredie Highmore
