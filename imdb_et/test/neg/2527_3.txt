While everyone is doing a decent job in this movie, I agree with another comment: it's too loose and scattered, too much like less scripting with really talented participants. As such, your attention is not enough. Having said this, there are some really funny moments, one of which is related to Dylan McDermotti and the flaming fire that I think everyone who has been drunk would be as funny as me; the other is split seconds with inflatable dinosaur. Crispin Glover does his usual nut crack and does it well, Harry Dean Stanton makes his usual nut patriarch (Repo Man, anyone?) Etc. Good cast, not enough to continue. Just a few gems, seconds.
