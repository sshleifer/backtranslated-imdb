This episode has just appeared in the UK. <br /> <br /> With disappointment. Humorous feelings with heavy hands were poorly appreciated, children, and reduced by what might have been a good story. I can't believe Jerry Bruckheimer promised this episode. I've seen all the previous episodes of this show, and even the episode where Jack played his parent, was in front of this episode. Lesbian kiss was a pathetic sensation. <br /> <br /> There was no continuity from the previous episode. There was nothing in style that would investigate Martin's dangerous behavior or possible drug addiction. Similarly, nothing was explicitly written about Jack's growing relationship with Ann. Usually without Trace, this consistency is pretty good. <br /> <br /> The next episode must be a significant improvement.
