In the follow-up to this permanent civil servant, we see Quentin Crisp last year in New York. John Hurt is Crisp again (come who else could play that part?) And the role he lives up to disappearance. For me, Hurt Crisp and I have always found that the man himself is very difficult to take, because Hurt was more than he was. Its masterful performance. His equal is Denis O'Hare, like Phillip Steele, Crispi's long-standing friend and trustee. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, movie fiction is not highly recommended. To be sure, the movie gets the right details. The film, filmed in New York and its surroundings, seems and feels like New York and its surroundings, but dramatically its inertia. His filthy talks to spiritual people, trying to reach an agreement with the world as he is (he regretted some badly chosen words about AIDS) and dealt with the weaknesses of the old old pushers. Man Quentin is always interesting, but his life is really not. <br /> <br /> The film is disappointed. I have always admired the man and his unique perspective. I just want his film to be better than his life.
