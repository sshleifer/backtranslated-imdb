I enjoy the same scientific literature as the next man? but what the hell was that? Apparently, he was shot for more than three days using his excess movie stock left from his previous film "Nana (1926)". In 2028, after a great war, Africa has become the most civilized region in the world, and what was formerly Europe is "Terres Inconnues". African researcher? Johnny Huggins, a black man dressed as a white man, dressed as a black man when you follow me? rides his Parisian ruins on his spherical aircraft and lands outside the Parisian wildlife (Catherine Hessling, then director's wife) and his primate companion, perhaps the creepiest ape-man costume I've ever seen. Wild, as part of some strange ritual of sexual initiation, begins to show the researcher Charleston's dance, which he rejoices himself. <br /> <br /> It doesn't help a movie that was Hessling, who was wonderful next year's Renoir 'The Little Match Girl' (1928), '' there is not much dancer, although the widespread use of slow motion adds surrealism to the ceremony. What's more, I am quite shocked that Renoir would use his wife as such a blatant sexual object? it will not come as a surprise to discover their divorces only three years later! On the plus side, I did a general sci-fi concept behind the film and a dirty satirical touch of revolution, which are typically racial roles typical of such stories. However, why Renoir decided to dress her black actor as a minstrel will remain a mystery at all times. Dirty, raw and pretty nonsense, "Charleston Parade (1927)" is a strange one of the most caught offspring of cinema art, and maybe he's trying to forget. The DVD version came without a musical soundtrack, but I was able to make different choices at Dmitry Shostakovich's choice.
