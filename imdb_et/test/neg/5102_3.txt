It was a very nice concert with one and only MJ. The choreography was great and the costumes were decent. The song was fine. I must admit that his vocals were Human Nature and Billie Jean. You couldn't hear him for half a time. Other songs are singing. The most important themes of the exhibition are: Jam Smooth Criminal I can no longer let you love, because he is out of my life Triller Billie Jean (dancing did not sing) Black or white man in the mirror The concert was almost perfect. If it were someone, but Mj would have been 9. That's black. I wish I was born then I would have received a ticket to the 1992 best concert.
