Ring! Ring! Have you been a hotline helpline, how can we help you? Yes, Pronto! I mean hello, my name is Rugge? error, call me your initials R.D! Let Mr R.D what's the problem? Well, the reviews of my last film "Dial: Help" were all negative and harsh, and frankly I feel that my career has also seen better days. Let Mr. R.D and why do you think this is? Well, I got a fame and earned a cult status thanks to my controversial and shocking film about the cannibalistic tribes that attacked the film team and another relentless thug who terrorized the wealthy people in a house at the park for which I borrowed from Wes Craven, but "Dial : Help "spins? was it wrong? do not mind! No, no, Mr R.D, go ahead and tell me what the movie is. It's about a mentally acquired phone line that hides a sexy model and kills people around it. Ah, I see. Indeed, this assumption sounds a little silly and not as rigorous as cannibals or rape, but I think your movie has deeper themes, right? Oh yes, sure? What do you mean? Well, is the phone line symbolism not another type of terror? Or is it all happening in your female hero's mind? Um, fast ?? It's just a phone that goes berserkile and kills people with wiring, vibration, electricity, or even ordinary coins. Interesting, Mr R., but how do you explain this supernatural thing to the viewer at the end of the movie? You see, I thought the plot of the slow-down phone mystery wouldn't be as important or relevant, so I just focused on processing all possible phone tricks. Phone Gimmicks? What do you mean? You know, like the wind is blowing through the horn, the tones and the airstrips get into the air! Very original, Mr. R.D, but not exactly a terrible and experienced director, you must know that people are finally expecting a reasonable explanation of all these events. Oh, but there is! It's all about negative and unpublished energy when I remember correctly! It's a bit cloudy, I admit. Hmm ?? I see. Well, as they always say, a good movie is based on movies more than just a story. Have you processed at least some of the usual brands in the movie so your fans would know your style at least? I tried! The Lord knows I tried, but murders and bloodshed are not just shocking! That's a pity, Mr R.D, but what about sex? Everyone in their horror films likes a good deal of slipperyness and nudity and you said that the film focuses on a dangerous sexy fashion model! Yes, but ??? But, what, Mr R.D? Really to prove that we promoted "Dial: Help" as an erotic thriller, exposing Charlotte Lewis shots on the cover, but in fact the sex of the movie and Charlotte even refused to go topless. Mr. R.! Now I'm really disappointed, it's just shamelessly hanging on people and luring them with false promises! I know, I know, and I'm ashamed, but I wanted everyone to "Dial: Help" and love it! Well, to round off, I can comfort you by saying that every big director has the right to make a wrong decision without affecting his career right away, but be careful next time and do some research first, right, Mr R.D? I'm gonna; thanks! You are welcome. Tell me, do you already have ideas for future movies? Yes, if it is, I'll do it! I was thinking of making Giallo with a murderous washing machine! Isn't that amazing? Hi? Hi?
