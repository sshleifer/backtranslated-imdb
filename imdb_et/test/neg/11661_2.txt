Kamal Hassan's director and Mrs. Doubtfire's Hindi remake is a somewhat dirty version and not as good as expected. <br /> <br /> Kamal Hassan clearly fights the price dialogs even after all these years and can't handle even one scene effortlessly. The boy is outdated and should rest. Hassan does not produce any new role or character like to say, Dustin Hoffman makes Tootsie or Marathi actress Macchindranath Camble makes Mavshi (aunt) character "Moruchi Mavsh" (Moru aunt, comedy game). <Br /> <br /> What was the boy who played with parsley if it wasn't Diwali? Most of Chachi's romantic cross-ties - Vs Amrish, Paresh, and then Johny Walker seem superfluous to the main style. The taboo on the bath was unnecessary. The family is northern India, but it has to be reminded of Karva Chauth overnight as "Maharashtrian" Chachi. Yes, right. No one of the four actors, Tabu, Om Puri, late Amrish Puri and Paresh Rawal, has lost the skills in this film. <br /> <br /> See the original Mrs. Doubtfire - clean, crisp and comforting, unlike the Chachi 420.
