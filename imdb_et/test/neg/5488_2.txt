The story is: a century-old group of actors, with producers and theater owners, is a very difficult relationship. The resident playwright has written a psychological drama. He wants to get a good production on the stage, but he can't, if he convinces the pariticular reviewer to reconsider production and gives a positive view. If his production is not continued, The Doll House will be set up recently by Ibsen. Many different relationships between principals are studied; none of them is interesting. However, engaging characters with each other will result in the resident playing another game. <br /> <br /> This movie is just an excuse to meet the director and his friends and make a movie. Story lines are inconsistent for anyone who is not a single star buddy. The only reason I did not leave the theater after about half an hour is that the lady of fat rested in her line at the end of a full meal.
