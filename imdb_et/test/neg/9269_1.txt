Its hard to decide where to start. I bought this couple quid and its worst couple quid iv never wasted. There were no pictures on the back of the DVD, and a couple of lines on the plot, which should have warned me, but I like to laugh at bad movies, so I decided to go for it. The film is made up of three short stories, each of which revolves around someone who was on a particular bus at one point (it never made it clear what the importance of the bus is or what city it is). <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILERS (as if there was something corrupted) The first story relates to a man who persuades the car to accept his wife's wishes. his life is different. <br /> <br /> The other is about a man who ever cleans his fridge and a man of monsters is growing out of it. The third is a woman who goes to a dating agency, only to discover her date is not all normal. <br /> <br /> We have a bus (or A-bus) frame between them, while the narrator falls into the garbage load (really, he says "relations") <br /> <br /> there are actually no redeeming functions. Functioning, costumes and little Spfx are all It seems that even all the attractive female cast members admire. Simply put, this movie is an attack.
