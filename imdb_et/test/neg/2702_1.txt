As an old series fan, I have to say that this is at best a loved series parody. First of all, the old series would try to follow at least some military structure. I know that P.C. the world is not the thing to do, but hey does not make it into care carts. In the old series, Beachead was a scary soldier, now she is a teenage mutant turtle. Another thing is a flying tank, ok it flies out of the cave base and bounces off the helicopter and they're both ok ???? Lets face if the next is not better, it could write G.I.joe end.
