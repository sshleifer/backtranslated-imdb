There are so many things about this movie that I don't even know where to start. The story is not uniform everywhere. I guarantee that the average viewer will scratch his head for five minutes in the film. <br /> <br /> Here is what I remember about the movie before I was unconsciously bored with the girls sister through the house, but it's not ultimately so abusive. On the next scene, the girls will be around 15. They will travel with their parents and hit the deer. The deer must be explosive because their car blows, one sister pulls another burning tube. Then the girls drive by the lake in a boat and make a huge plan to go to Kentucky (??) and start a new life. On the next scene, the girls drive towards the military base. And what is the military base. In fact, it is rather a tail farm that has been transformed into a military base with many confusing additional actions that play "soldiers". The Chief of the Cabinet is especially fantastic because there are occasional things like the AK-47 hanging on the wall and the drilling hat that is mounted on the board (????) so the audience is sure it's a military. Then there will be a random guy pushing the motorcycle, and the base commander tells me to go to the "city" to buy porn pictures and make sure the soldiers don't believe he is "pink crew". So our character takes a call that looks like a military truck "to the city", and loads a box that is "an uncomfortable" bookstore with a front door with a knocker. Girls hide a man in a truck when he stops to gas up , and watch porn to find items like "anal intruder." I think this plot is enough for most people to scare. Forbidden Fruits While Scene When Slutty Sister Fills For The First Person For The First Time, Or For The Camera Too Long For Certain Images To Try To Forward "The Message". <br /> <br /> Either way, no money is worth it.
