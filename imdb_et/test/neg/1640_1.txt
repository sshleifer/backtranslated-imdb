BOOOOOOOORRRRRINNGGGGGGGG and STOOOOOOOPIDDDDD. He kept sleeping. If you want to see Miles O'Keefe's hairy Speedo ring, you can rent this movie. If not, don't worry. Was it supposed to be set in the age of ice age, iron age, steel time or cause? What was the reason why a black nylon wig boy was dressed as a Genghis Khan? Was it supposed to be Genghis Khan? If Ator had access to so much advanced technology and science, why did we wait for Leonardo for another 1000 years? It is never clear where the Ator comes from or whether it should be some kind of superior nature. You don't know if it was first explained in the first movie, but after seeing it, you know you're never worried.
