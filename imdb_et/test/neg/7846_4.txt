Tycoon is never considered to be John Wayne's better post to Stagecoach. It's good places, there are some fine action sequences in the cave and also in the flood top. But the plot leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> There are two guys in Tycoon who don't know each other thoroughly and don't stop them from working as a team. Multimillionaire Cedric Hardwicke has hired John Wayne and James Gleason to build a railway. But then he refuses to give them the necessary funds to do the job. <br /> <br /> Things become difficult when Wayne falls on Hardwicke's daughter Laraine's day. After the evening, when they have to spend their time alone in the destruction of Inca, in South America the Wayne and Day shotgun will get an agreement, though nothing happened. <br /> <br /> What would have happened would have been the two of them were locked in the room for 24 hours to work out their differences in one way or another. Their small spits cause death for Wayne's team. <br /> <br /> But what Tycoon is best known for is another pettiness. Laraine Day was married to Leo Durocher, who was the head of Brooklyn Dodger when filmed. He was in a constant presence in a set that was mistakenly jealous of John Wayne whom he thought he had a wife with. Nothing but he made his wife's life unhappy. <br /> <br /> Not one of the Duke's better efforts.
