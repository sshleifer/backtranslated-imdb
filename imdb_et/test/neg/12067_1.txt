The cover and the assumption of writing is so promising. Like a magical maniac, I hope so much. But what the hell is going on. The film is terrible. The direction of the cast, the plot, the intercourse and the act are so amateurish. I even thought they were using a home video camera to take it. Good luck, he still has good moments for me to make me like. Thanks for the bad package called "Camp Blood". <br /> <br /> 1/10
