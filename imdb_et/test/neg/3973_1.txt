Parts: Clonus Horror is fear all right. Of course, in the late 70s, bad fashion is. Dick Sargent is really bad for Peter Graves. And then the clones themselves. Their days consist mainly of running, jumping, cycling and wrestling with each other. If they don't, they learn from America. Not a band in America or Neil Diamond's song, but America, where they go part of society. But they are given some strange medicine, they have all their body fluids drained (General Ripper was right!) And they are placed in the freezer and waiting for Thanksgiving or Christmas when thawed and roasted at about 450 degrees. Sorry, it won't happen, but it would have been much more interesting than shown. Mario, the celebrity of Super Mario Brothers, is making an astounding boss as a physician beating Dick Sargent.
