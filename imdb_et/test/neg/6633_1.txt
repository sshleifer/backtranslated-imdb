Bad movie! Bad! Go stand for a discount. Carrot Top should really stay in low-light comedy clubs. Such films make old Jerry Lewis films like Shakespeare and John Agar, like John Barrymore. Coutney Thorne-Smith (exquisite talent) is completely wasted. His goal looks mostly beautiful and unnoticed. <br /> <br /> The only enjoyable thing about the movie is that Raquel Welch makes Alexis Carrington's role and Estelle Harris the owner of the house. That's the only way I can imagine that someone who thinks it would be a good (not sophomoric) movie would be if a fourth-class child of the manufacturers had to choose the script. Well, maybe his third grader. What this film really needs is rubbed into the nose of its creators.
