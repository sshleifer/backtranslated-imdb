I'm pretty much a mammal for their Ghost Hunter. From Cheesy mockumentaries like Discovery Channel's "The Haunting" and Scooby Doo reality shows like "Ghost Hunters". When I saw ads on A & E's "Paranormal State," I knew I was watching. Especially when the "Paranormal State" was in conflict with a weak Monday night football game. Bottle Max Von Sydowi Holy Water and assures him that he also has inaccurate child experience with things that "came out of the closet" and (Catholic) Church gave him Holy Water Keep things coming out of Closet. I knew I should have given another picture of football on Monday night. Ghost Hunting Club. Or society. Or Super Adventure Club. And they run around in Pennsylvania, exploring the most terrible huntings and the missing plot on M. Night Shymalan's film. <br /> <br /> "They" is a sort of misconception. Really Paranormal State revolves around Nittany Lion named Ryan Buell, who is likely to work for Penn State's annual Anime Convention if not shown. Often it is accompanied by "research" hot co-authors and some other people who are looking at credit, but rarely have a camera. Hey, are they ghosts? <br /> <br /> This is Ryan Buell's show. A paranormal state is his "vehicle", as we want to say Biz. And what a dull ride in the vehicle, can he be. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that Ryan speaks less of a "director's log" of the entire episode of the State of Paranormal? Almost immediately, it gets annoying, because the obvious intention is to give Ryan a ghost some trouble, but his filtered monotone does nothing but provokes and laughs. Seriously every serious intonation sounds like a radio conversation about Call of Duty video game. <br /> <br /> "Investigations" - The plots that each episode rotates are interesting on the surface. "Paranormal country" has no haunting inns or restaurants. This is an example that shows that you do not know how a good Catholic boy is, and they give you fear. Little children are being harassed, things in the dark, voices encouraging to kill, and Aleister Crowely rubs my hands on me. From the two episodes I looked at every violent, nasty fatal violent bullying. Maybe. <br /> <br /> Maybe not. <br /> <br /> Everything in the "Paranormal Country" is a short half hour, "Dog Bounty - Er, Ghost Hunter" blocks. Every time there is an interesting, verifiable evidence - family murder on the 1800s farms - the proof is looking at the viewer like an artist who is trying to convince you of blood samples that are now your nose is proof that ten million Nigerians are coming and then gone before you get a good bell. <br /> <br /> At least the Sci-Fi Channel's "Ghost Hunters" have a somewhat exhaustive need to prove all possible evidence and present them to the viewer. EVPs, which could be rat farting, cold places in jail, and "orbs", even by Ghost Hunters itself, create dust. This is a sort of Scooby Doo approach that makes "Ghost Hunters" ... almost plausible. <br /> <br /> As "Paranormal State" claims to have EVP, it gives Garage Band a tenth video clip without sound. Yeah, look, EVP, right? People argue that there are dark numbers in the basement ... Well, we just go and look at it ... leaving the night-vision camera in a living static living room. Ryan, Head of the Penn State Graduates Package, says he sees "visions" of the demon name he knows and may be related to a paranormal ghost ... But he can't tell us the audience or his team was gothed out undergrads because ... He can't. You never say the name of the demon aloud, Ryan informs Co-Ed, who dares to ask. <br /> <br /> Well, how very comfortable for you. Especially since it's a television show where the audience can't read your mind. <br /> <br /> "Paranormal State" is all Turn and no Prestige. The audience is told what is supposed to happen, but you never see an ounce of evidence that the horrible child sees dead people. Not even a sharp video from a video board, nor a black brother moving between cells in prison. Something. You'll be told exactly what Ryan had another mechanical voice. <br /> <br /> If you try to try it out, then dress a little. If you're trying to impress me, show me an orb or bubble, and I have a greasy chick working on a hot topic in the days, tell me why this black orb really is the spirit of the ax. And if you want me to look at the ghost forest, give me something besides letting Lorraine Warren out for another episode. <br /> <br /> "Paranormal country" is a weak sauce. Not really worth it if you are not busy with TV or if you have a DVD collection so thin. Or if you don't want to know what actually happened to the Holy Water in this cabinet.
