Day somewhat in the life of a cab driver for some time at Christmas: the cab driver takes the ticket price ... they have a "really reasonable" difference ... he falls from the ticket price ... he picks up the second fare. .many interlude ... and it will continue in 90 minutes ... none of them will convince (or interesting) even within a minute ... SKIP IT!
