Previous Tarantino films were from a boy in love with other films. This is a man who is in love with his writing. It's not Inglorious, its nasty. <br /> <br /> I hated Inglorious Basterds. The whole point of the movie is entertaining - if u call people's heads and remove their scalps for entertainment !!!! - And if there is one unforgivable sin, the film can be committed, it is extreme boredom or disgust. <br /> <br /> Film is a collection of endless and embarrassing scenes where people speak tables in different languages. . There's even one scene where 3 people talk for almost 45 minutes on the same table, luckily they've all shot. I wanted them to be killed after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to close F ** K. <br /> <br /> This board style is the Tarantino badge, but in other films I was interested in what they said and the people who spoke. Here I don't care less. All Quentin films have great confidence, especially Jackie Brown. But here, in all scenes, there is a widespread feeling that Tarantino had no idea where he was going with the movie. <br /> <br /> Is it violent? Of course there is torture and scalping, but you have to remind me. Fortunately, the film was so thin that I didn't even remember that I had seen it before when I saw the title of the review on MSNBC. <br /> <br /> She is tricky and probably dying to write a novel. But do we do the benefit of QT and save us the movie. <br /> <br /> I went out of this movie and would never want to see anyone, no matter what the hard quarantine fan. <br /> <br /> I'll give him 0/10.
