Steven Segal's film career is a respectable cinema. I'm tragically bored of each of them as soon as I realized they were even more unrealistic than Jean Claude VanDamme. Has anyone ever noticed that he never hit ?! I mean, give me something to root out ... a hard fight in the fight against the bad who is scary. Twenty years and he's still filming the same fighting scenes. Fighting scenes can often distract you from the fact that your hero cannot act. The boring choreography of the Segal film puts his lack of pain in action with a sharp relief. Worse still, it is a strange shape. That's what we need, the fat stiff who sees him as the leading man. There is no cinematic value redemption within ninety minutes. DON'T look at it if you don't feel like you want to throw your life for one and a half hours.
