There's something about a movie that includes female bodybuilders who get me on the screen every time. <br /> <br /> I have seen "Iron II pumping", "Aces: Iron Eagle III", "Raven Hawk", and even television "Getting Physical", which had some great names in sports. They were tolerant in their own way (mostly because they had Rachel McLish. ROWWR !!). <br /> <br /> Then I went and watched "Nemesis III: Prey Harder", the only reason for this was lighting such as Sue Price, Debbie Muggli, Sharon Bruneau and Ursula Sarcev. Love ladies, always, but after that I'm glad that I missed the first two "Nemesis" flicks. <br /> <br /> Well, first, anyway. Most of the footage here is "physical" (and hitting and shouting) raised from the bottom of "Nemesis II". In fact, it seemed a little fun with the evidence provided here. <br /> <br /> But while the price and company are flexible and generating, they don't get much opportunity to do something else (for example, ACT!). In fact, this whole movie is an exercise (Get it? Ha ha ...) for slanting, obscure characters, and making an open movie (both filming and story). <br /> <br /> Nothing makes sense, but even if it were done, there would still be problems - for example, making small parts of such larger than living women. What is a crime. <br /> <br /> Of course, Albert Pyun wrote and directed it, so what did you expect: Cohesion? <br /> <br /> Only one asterisk, considering all the work that Price, Muggli, Bruneau and Sarcev obviously put in their bodies, not the "handicraft" in the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Thank you, ladies.
