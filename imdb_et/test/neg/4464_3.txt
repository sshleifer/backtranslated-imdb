In this desperate and profoundly silly attempt to keep Hammer Dracula's franchise alive, despite having lost most of his power long ago, our legendary vampire returns in a 1972 vortex in London. Just one hundred years after his destroyer, Van Okkultlik, named Johnny Alucard (get it?), Collects his shameful friends in the abandoned church in Helsinki, including Van Helsinki's great granddaughter Jessica and fulfilling a satanic ritual that restores the fog of Dracula smoke. Dracula's only mission is to destroy the entire Van genealogy and the fragile Jessica is the best victim to achieve this. This is probably the only 70-year-old movie that moves from above to see 70's movies! Considering the six Drakula films, all of which were in Victorian timing, director Alan Gibson really wants to emphasize that we are now in the 20th century, and so he has his own movie with intolerable hippie characters, 70's fashion relationships and terrible 70's music. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing seem hopelessly lost in this environment and their performances are regrettable. The opening order (setback) and the peak of the showdown are quite enjoyable, but all in the meantime are painfully boring and frightening. The biggest elements of this film group have always been Dracula's dark castles and joyful trainers' competitions and obviously there is no such contribution. Fortunately for fans, Hammer Studios released modern vampire-based films ("The Vampire Lovers", "Twins of Evil", "The Legend of Seven Golden Vampires"). Not recommended.
