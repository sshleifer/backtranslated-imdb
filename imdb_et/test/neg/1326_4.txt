Do people really appreciate this movie because it's a movie? <br /> <br /> For me this is nothing more than a bad Hollywood war movie in Germany. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad on so many levels. Even mentioning it with a platoon or Full Metal Jacket is absurd. The battle sequences are pathetic, dialogue, and act as frightening. <br /> <br /> This so-called storm group is regular in Wermacht. Not SS troops. There's so much wrong in this movie when it's sad. Bad editing, bad performance. It has it all. <br /> <br /> The film continues and continues as the audience should have suffered as much as the soldiers did. <br /> <br /> I read in the review that the budget for this movie was $ 20 million. <br /> <br /> True? Where was it spent? Counterfeit Train Car Sequences? Regrettable "special effects"? <br /> <br /> As a World War II history buffer and World War II film fan, I found this film to be a serious disappointment. <br /> <br /> Explore The Beast with a great alternative war movie. (Not a World War II movie, but still outstanding) <br /> <br /> Don't bother.
