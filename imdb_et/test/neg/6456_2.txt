There is something wonderful about the Revenge movie. Everyone wakes up in the morning believing that he is a "movie" star and that anyone who interferes with their personal agenda is in some way an enemy. Revenge films work especially well when a person has a low self-esteem. Instead of fighting back, the "hero" relies on built in anxiety to deal with one act of power to restore balance. Of course, in the "real world" this type of revenge rarely relieves tension because life is not a film; after the revenge has come into effect, the measures taken have their consequences. A good revenge flick helps people ignore this bitter pill. Films deal with final credits and all responsibility. <br /> <br /> "Horse Swimming" is advertised as a comedy, undoubtedly an act of producers to find out how to sell this strange thing. It's dark, but it's not dark comedy ("Company Of Men" and Todd Solondz's works come much closer). The parts of the movie are so cruel that they are timing the current "torture-porn" genre that everyone has become so obsessed with ("Saw", "Hostel"). Some laugh. "Saving Private Ryan" is also laughing, but it is not labeled with comedy. <br /> <br /> The essence of this movie is that it hasn't got its revenge. This is probably the young man he is being abused by his boss and finally taking his boss to "pay him back" for all ill-treatment. The hero (named "Guy") is "eternal" so vague that we literally know something about him ... what does he do with his free time? Does he have friends / family? How did he get where he was? What are his interests (this becomes the current motive of the film, undoubtedly inspired by the film's own struggle ... "What do you want?" It is very difficult to take care of this character even if it worked well (even Tom Hanks gets the wrong roll, for example " Punchline ") Kevin Spacey as a boss," Buddy "should be a monster, but he's too charismatic as an actor. The best laugh came when he abused his assistant - he seemed almost as surprised as the audience was likely to be what Guy could withstand. The character is tortured, suddenly made into an empathy for him. Guy is filmed suddenly as a rational monster without rationality. Here, all the messages sent by the author have disappeared, there is no "hero", ergo, no reason to take care of it at all. <br /> <br / > It's not a stretch that this story is based on the author's own career in the film industry, I worked with a similar boss and I can make sure it's not so far drawn. I have the same wishfulness fantasy and I thought I was justified. I thought you could win the story of the most beautiful woman (in fact, only the woman who seems to be about four in the universe of this movie) just being your eager, naive self, this zeal won the prizes and the boss abused you because she was the average person . Time and tide have shown the truth that most "monsters" are really just an individual's personal psyche demons and resentment is usually in itself. As the movie shows, when Guy was so unhappy, he just had to leave. The film does not provide any space at all, despite this surprise. We still don't know about the main characters, we can't even be sure that everything they said was actually based and everyone gets magically their cake and eat it. In short, this story did not make any sense when it was noted that (shock!) Filmmaking can be quite brutal. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of good movies that say a solid and satisfying revenge -style fantasies, so good ("9-to5", "Work Girl", "Devil Wears Prada") and not so much ( "The Roses War", "The Hills Have Eyes" Remake). This is not one of them - despite Benicio Del Toro's fun approach to "Prada" as Emily Blunt's role and some interesting works by Spacey and Michelle Forbes, it is a frustrating, medium, confusing and a bit boring creation itself. - the director's suggestion that he "worked it all out" ...
