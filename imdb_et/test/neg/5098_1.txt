Set in the mid-1800s when the British clean up New Zealand to reverse colonies. The daughter of British army surgeon Sarah (Samantha Morton) falls in love with one of the Maori's son. The Maori are a tribe of indigenous peoples and dangerous people for Europeans. By the time Sarah's child she calls "The Boy" is born, her father is dead. For six years, his father's family is kidnapped by a boy, and Sarah begins his quest with a man (Kiefer Sutherland) who is deeply in love with him. <br /> <br /> Double Oscar nominee Morton is definitely the star of this movie. Sutherland is the whole waste. Cliff Curtis, Stephen Rea, Temuera Morrison and David Rawiri Pene are also starring. This film is rated R for sexual content and violent battle scenes. I find the title RIVER QUEEN very misleading and the DVD covers only Sutherland and makes you believe he is the leader star.
