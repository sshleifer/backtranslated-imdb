In fact, I feel that my review would be one word. My friend, whose opinions I almost always trust in films, especially in fear films, warned me not to rent it, no matter how tempted or boring or desperate is a new horror film, because it was a total waste of time. Unfortunately, I haven't spoken to him at the same time, and I hurried to pick a movie and thought, "What the hell, how bad is it?" Why don't I learn? What did I mean? Did I think it would magically become a better film if you were sitting on the shelf for years waiting for rent? <br /> <br /> "Plot" refers to a man who changes some company movies. His boss is a jerk. The man who had a job before him went crazy and blew himself up in the pre-credit order, so for some reason the boss chooses the special project "Lo" of the Loose Limbs project. He never says what Ed should edit, but I think it's not important. Ed is upset about some of the clips that work in this house all by himself, so the boss has decided to relocate him for no apparent reason. He asks his boss whether he can stop or make another project, but his boss doesn't care. He is slowly going crazy, probably looking at clips and wanting to carry out murders in real life. Or has he been so? Note that I will make this plot much deeper, more interesting, and more consistent than it really is. <br /> <br /> We don't care about characters at all or do not recognize compassion or even hate bad guys. The plot is really boring and predictable. The sprayer is not even that harsh or creative - it is not worth renting to see the gore because what is there is not interesting or original. <br /> <br /> All "Books" for Sam Raim just come out like really bad ripoffs, and nobody in the movie is good at all, because it looks just like Bruce Campbell, so you can't deviate from it. I think the "Evil Dead II-Dead by Dawn" poster is only visible in one scene, in the hope that Sam Raimi has been attracted and has no legal action. A trained chimp could have written a better scenario. Every time I hear lines like "Do we still have fun ...?" (which even the Re-Animator's bride couldn't pull me off without struggling) I feel like I'm taking some deadly weapon. The characters just appear somewhere without explanation, wandering only to kill. It may be OK if the movie was even far from amusing or entertaining, but it was all I could do to mostly go about it fast. Fortunately, I decided to pay some bills and balance my checkbook while the movie was playing. Trust me, it didn't require my full attention - I still felt that 90+ minutes of my life was wasted just in the background. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it, no matter how tempted you are - you hate yourself for wasting your money. Horror fans are totally nasty when incompetent it is. Even those who haven't seen too many splatter movies should stay away because there are so many movies that you can rent that are worth a while. If you want something pointless, low budget and fun, rent something else. Complete waste of time without redemption features. Be wiser than I was at this time and don't be fooled by the "Warning - not for the conscience of the heart". You have been warned! <br /> <br />
