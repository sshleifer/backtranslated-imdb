Frankly, the popularity of this exhibition is bad for me. Inuyasha is definitely not terrible - he has some good moments, occasionally smart humor, and unlike so many anime, dignity. Nevertheless, it is missing the essential elements of the story. From the outset, it is a stereotypical prerequisite. The main test center focuses on collecting broken pieces of jewelery before they can be taken against evil, and is, as a suspicion, a completely epic fantasy thing. The story follows a familiar example of how to fight against different enemies for jewelery and is therefore quite predictable, complex, and easy to find. But as so many animes have shown, deep realistic characters can save a bad assumption. Unfortunately, no one can get to Inuyasha's story. Kagome, the main character, is a stereotypical anime heroine (and reminds too much of the main character of Akan, the original work of the original comic book Ranma 1/2); He is friendly to other women, but treats many men, especially his love interests, with unfair, unresponsive and unjustified brutality. Inuyasha is a hard-outer-but-sweet-inside-type, and Miroku is a "perverted" unfortunate stock character. <br /> <br /> Errors continue with what happens to this plot and these characters - namely, nothing. Despite continuous action, the story is not progressing. Regardless of the usual romantic moments, there are no major relationships. Despite a lot of time, the characters never really change. And, in order to add to the cherry mediocrity, the entire stagnation is stretched to about 150 episodes. <br /> <br /> My last criticism of this anime is animation. Although it is certainly not ugly, it shows the almost disrespectful laziness of the creators. The animators are delighted with Inuyasha's long scenes that jump in the air when they hate the wind where they have little to do but move in the background. <br /> <br /> In short, all the beautiful animations in the world have no reason to see Inuyasha.
