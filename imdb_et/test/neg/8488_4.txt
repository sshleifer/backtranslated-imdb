In fact, his wife's son laughed a few times ... mostly thanks to the comic jokes that made Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner so funny. CGI is very impressive and this movie is widely used. For example, Garfield does not have a CGI for the right, but I give it the same voice. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows this story ... which wasn't so bad for the KIDS movie. Yes, this is a KIDS film ... and should therefore be treated. Jamie Kennedy is not very good at her role. His attempts to act "crazy" are not very good and overall action is bad. <br /> <br /> All others are not too bad. <br /> <br /> In principle, I looked at my 2 and 5 year olds without filing a complaint. At least I could sit through it. <br /> <br /> This film is no worse than ** shading ** Class 1999 1999 / CGI and a couple laughs.
