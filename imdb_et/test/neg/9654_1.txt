I bought it because it was $ 1.99 and Harry Carey was in it and my friend was $ 1.99, how bad would it be? Then I read some comments about the movie and started to get excited - maybe it was really a lost pearl, one of those terrible little B-films that everyone had forgotten but was resurrected. ERROR! I'm not sure how anyone else could give this thing because it's got some of the places here, but I found it to be one of the most annoying and probably filled-up movies I've ever seen. And I'm not talking about Richard Carlson's Texas accent (straight from Georgia to Texas). It's just stupid. No one in the film acts like a real person. Nobody. And no one believes or cares about anything. It's not even a clich√©-fest. It's just an 80-minute frame. He even managed to get bored by Harry Carey, Maria Ouspenskaya and C. Aubrey Smith. Now it's incredible.
