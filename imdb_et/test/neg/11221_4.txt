I share the same opinion about Underworld as the previous comment. <br /> <br /> I sat in this movie for 1.5 hours, wondering what the story was, and more importantly why the author and / or the director have made some decisions on the plot. All in all, I found the film unbalanced, which consisted of strange sub-plot (IMHO), which in fact had nothing to do with the film. What's more, when writing a thriller, I would say that you want your viewers to think about the story and not how the story is filmed ...
