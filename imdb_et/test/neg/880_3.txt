Frankly, after the cotton club and unfaithful, it was Lane and Gere who were watching this film because it is BAD. Action was bad, dialogues were extremely low and insecure. It was a good hit, but again it's a big budget movie. It was too predictable, even for the chicks flick. I knew from the beginning that he would die, the only thing I didn't know was how. Too politically correct. Very disappointing. The only thing that really was worth was the landscape and the house, because it is beautiful. But if you want it, look at the national geography. I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie. As far as Gere goes, he is a good actor, but he had such films, so I'm not surprised. One and a half hours I wish I could bring back.
