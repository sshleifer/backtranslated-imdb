Perhaps the government's bureaucracy is not the most glamorous way of living, but it is still an opportunity to earn a living. But after watching this movie, one might think that every government's bureaucrat is a lazy, swollen, imagined, paper-pusher who lives only during his next lunch. Not a very beautiful picture, but it is a picture that the audience has to endure when you look at what is something other than a tedious, noisy and excessive action film. That's what the doctor ordered ... right? How many of these films have made Hollywood? Thousand? Two thousand? The formula for making these films is so beaten that now it should be completely recognizable. Local areas are changing, but plots remain the same, and as trained performers with the same low character and equally low activity, they are asked to enter the pseudo-comics and act accordingly. In the meantime, this film seemed to be running. "When does this movie end?" I thought repeatedly. Leonardo DiCaprio was incredibly incredible for the CIA, but what has to be one of the biggest disruptions, Russell Crowe, plays CIA bureaucracy. Note that this film has a "lean and average" operation on the spot, while its table drink instructor is fat. It's called a stereotype. What was the director's thinking? Why shouldn't Jack Nicholson play an overweight office officer? Or does Nicole Kidman play a frump department store vendor? And the story was so fantastic that no literary permission could be considered reliable. Obviously non-Arabic (Mr DiCaprio), who is trying to speak as an Arabic language, speaking freely in Arabic ... trying out all kinds of hair-brain schemes that are doomed ... trying to figure out and truly Arabs who are totally ridiculous with his ridiculous arabic disguise ... trying romanticly for Palestinian women, while doing a very sensitive and complicated espionage mission ... etc. Next time try real Arabic. Even the most naive filmmaker can't believe it all. There should be a tough balance between the sooner and the antagonist. In this film, the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that it leaves a shadow. The next stop for this movie - DVD land and forget. And one more thing. Don't let this movie stop you from working for the government. The charge may not be high, but the fringe benefits are excellent, critical to the fact that this movie is comfortably excluded.
