This abomination and sequel to ONE TIME (not thanks) and foolish disasters by Jerry Lewis, such as DON'T PEOPLE WATER (why not just), led the cinema owners to close their doors, not to force them to lead the movies. True: in the late 1960s, movie blocking was still applied in unhappy suburban and landscape cinemas ... that means that in order to get a good movie, the cinema was forced to run such amazing journalists: I remember well in 1974 FIDDLER IS ROOFIL or something like that, myself I was rescued by a sozzled salesman at a United Artists booking office who flushed the flop before the flop page: "Now, before we get to it, let's see the first of that date". which basically means "book these dude and we will give you a tired blow". The way and why so many cinemas were closed, forced to look at the screen, and to worsen their diminishing target audience, are the attacks of the assembly with flat comedians and dull talents. Cinematographers who are completely closed, sold to a petrol station and saw the cinema being demolished. These days, movies of the same type (eg: NO PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK AND LARRY) get to a 20-seat cinema for 99 out with the mouse on Google's plex. Not much changed. FREDDY GOT FEDERED ... anyone?
