Bulletproof is a rather disposable film. The kind of bullet attacked by good guys and bad guys is shared everywhere, so you shouldn't see them as people. The wounds between the Wayans and Sandler lines are indeed extensive. They are trying hard, but unfortunately, and in itself, the person is not a good cinema himself. Jimmy Caan plays a nice cable, but he's always been on the edge of it. My favorite scene is the recurring clips of TV advertising, where Caan shows that American virtues can be shown to the world in 2 cars in every garage. In addition, this is a friend's movie with brain weapons. Forward it.
