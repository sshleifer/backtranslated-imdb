A waste of time, talent and shelf space, this is a really exhausting film. What are the big leaf holders like Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Dan Aykroyd, who are wasting their time in such rubbish? The little criminal Reeves turns to his brothers (Vincent D'Onofrio) and ends with the bride. Comedy ?, thriller ?, romance? I don't know honestly! Reeves is a lead wood and Dan Aykroyd's casting as a policeman is so terrible that it must be believed! The only dark dark tunnel on the bright spot is Diaz and even he is not so good. Rent something else. all those involved in this confusion should keep the head in shame and get lost in the years to come.
