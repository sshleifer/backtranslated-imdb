How does David Lynch do that? Unlike the thick-black-framed-eyeglass-wearing types and pretentious film critics who praise his name, I just don't see how this guy pays for such a break. How can Lynch conspire with the meaningless, poorly-functioning mess and critique of material left by unsuccessful TV pilots and, in fact, in this year's best lists? <br /> <br /> I'm confused. If you are looking for a good movie noir, hire "Bound" instead. If you are looking for a good "puzzle" movie, try "Memento". But do not hold this skipper if your idea of ​​a fun night does not throw away 2 1/2 hours of your life and $ 3.50 for your hard earned money.
