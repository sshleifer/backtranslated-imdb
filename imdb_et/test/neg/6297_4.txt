Basically, it's a movie. Gay, transsexual and other gender issues are quite disturbing, especially when the child is involved. You have to hand it over to costume designers. As for the actors, the only one I was familiar with was Terence Stamp. I think it was a very good result from your (or someone's) normal range. The movie as a whole was low, just a rider wise and stupid. All in all, I don't recommend it.
