What a waste of energy and money. What a waste of talent was. <br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez was completely wasted and mostly unused. Jon Lovitz was very light, but meaningless. Harry Dean Stanton - Why Barely? And whether it was just me or Kari Wuhrer could hardly act on it. <br /> <br /> The story was quite non-existent and really separate. One of my biggest problems was the reaction of the signs to the events that appeared. Like surfing "dudes", does his life give up every time he was threatened in the last half? But how did you ever see them surfing once !! The construction of some scenes lasted as long as there was not enough reward to give us a damn. Nothing in this "movie" really felt real or real. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say is some of the (very few) landscapes that were filmed nicely and some scenes were lightly interesting. Don't look at it if there are so many better useless movies.
