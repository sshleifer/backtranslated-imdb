Although this movie was not something special, I have to notice at least one factor that he decided to make - the leading female performer of Dyan Cannon. Despite the ridiculous line of the film and what he is going through here, he was the best-performing film in the film, so it seems more unbelievable. His amazing scene with gay photographer David Hemmings must be credible. Good work, Dyan.
