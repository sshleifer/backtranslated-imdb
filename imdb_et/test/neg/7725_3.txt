I saw the first cemetery and waited for the root canal to be more pleasant, so if it wasn't so bad I was surprised. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I got my hope that the other might be fine ... and I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Probably one of the few people who saw this movie that thinks it was bad. <br /> <br /> I don't know if to watch it again and force myself to see what all the people who gave it a good look at, or don't know if I saw the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> Ed Quinn as Ellis and Emmanuelle Vaugier as Alexandra 'Nightingale' Morgan did a great job under these roles. They deserve to be in better films. <br /> <br /> Special effects were okay and some of the characters love / hate what has been done for the allowed clock, but most often it was a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I have to ask for it, because I found myself asking it wrong, all through the movie ... did anyone know how to close the doors behind them, so zombies wouldn't just walk into the rooms? Only once this happened, (zombies migrate) and I found that a little comfortable ... soldiers get into the room, leave the door open, pay little attention to none of the same door so zombies can just go in if they feel like it is (unlucky "living" in the corner without escape ways) and only when zombies ever followed them. <br /> <br /> Nitpicky? Perhaps, honestly ... if I were to fight for my life, the last thing I would do to walk into the room and leave the door open was that zombies could spit and eat. <br /> <br /> This is really the only thing that plagued me during the movie, and it was this movie that was mostly a bad sequel to not completely disgusting the original.
