I saw this movie more than 20 years ago and I had a very nice memory of it. Again, at Cinemax this month, I realized how little the impression of movies from that time was. This is a very common western spaghetti. Script, direction, action, photography are all great blah. Stay Sergio Leone with the West Coast!
