if I could reset it, I would come from someone who loves movies of time and shock / exploitation, and at all I have to say it's useless. <br /> <br /> It does nothing, serves something, an idiot camera, and a desire to prove its intelligence against social standards, that's all like that. <br /> <br /> This totally amateur, both in principle and in terms of execution, makes no sense, its digestion of reluctance, whistles that are useless, pointless and meaningless. <br /> <br /> Someone said that Waters was "bad" for all the bad press and disgust that others gave with this movie, but why? If I made a short film that depicts a man in the bathroom, taking t * t directly in ten minutes, would it be the same, but why would I be proud or "laughing"? Could it be because I am so unintelligent that I have to use it to say "HA! Take that censors and mainstream! <br /> <br /> For the sake of protecting or protecting this film, it is to protect something that is deliberately intended as an anti-cultural struggle that comes in the modern world. In the sense of raising the mainstream audience, this movie is a hot topic for movies. <br /> <br /> The obsolete and obsolete movie poster calls for rebellion.
