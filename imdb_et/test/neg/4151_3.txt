My wife and I never reached a movie. We thought it was the way to sloooowwww and many subtitles. I realized they needed them for Vietnam, but took a long time to get out of Asia. He wanted to say that. Better. It has never done so, they had a tough time trying to get to America, but I wanted to see her and find her father. Not at the end, but forming a relationship. Do I mention that it was slllloooowwwww.w. at the end of the movie I don't feel sad. I know they don't make a lot of good movies now a day. I think the movies are the only ones to watch. I have rented a lot of netflix and now blocked, maybe 20% is worth seeing. Realism or facts are just a movie that is fun and makes you feel good
