Well, "built" by Doris Day (as Ethel S. "Dynamite" Jackson) is mistaken for their Ethel Barrymore and falls in love with dancer Ray Bolger (like S. "Sam" Winthrop Putnam). Elder Frenchman Claude Dauphin (Philippe Fouquet) also digs Dorist. Honestly ?? What did they mean? - This wildly inappropriate musical music plays the Lady's Day, which usually sings in "April in Paris" and others. Certainly nothing is as good as his Columbia recordings; and something is approaching the stunning of the day and the future "Secret Love". Although the material does not work well for him, it is nice to see Mr Bolger. Some musical numbers are unpleasant. <br /> <br /> **** April in Paris (12/24/52) David Butler ~ Doris Day, Ray Bolger, Claude Dauphin
