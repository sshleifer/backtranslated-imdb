Tedium, because it can only be done by the French. I checked my watch for the first time in 7 minutes and after 143 minutes I stayed on the walk. I don't even try to discuss the inconsistency of the plot and the inability of the characters to be friendly, because after about an hour I realized that none of this was important. It was not merely self-conscious or pretentious, it was a vacuum. Vacuum sucking the breath. This film has no sustainable grace, no pleasant character, no fun, nothing sad. It is not smart enough to be a drama and there is no moment to be a little bit far away. The most intriguing thing about this film is how it has been able to get the most glowing and positive view. I was deceived by these comments, but you don't have to be a gentle reader. All I want for Christmas is my three hours ago.
