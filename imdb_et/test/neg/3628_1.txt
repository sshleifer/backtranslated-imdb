It shows suck. it was put on a skateboarder for a couple of days, and although it undoubtedly destroyed the rolling theme of Friday programming, I appreciate it rationally ... I still think it sucks. It's really super lame. Zoey and her foolish friends have weak characters and the pot sucks and is really flat. Flat continuuity and pot sucks and I think dialogue and joes are weak. Weak humor and stupid sucky characters suck and the whole show is, frankly, a disappointment that isn't worth watching. It sucks and is really very flat. It really has to be one of the darkest shows on television, not really worth it. I mean, how weak is weak and happy can you show before it becomes a tent?
