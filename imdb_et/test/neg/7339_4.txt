I love this book. It's a passion, a romance, a tension ... and the movie draws two bright stars with it. Kylie Minogue was already a big star in Australia, playing with her neighbors and releasing her first single. The decision to take him to Delinquents was definitely a marketing project. For me, it didn't pay. <br /> <br /> Kylie might have been big in her neighbors, but she was too cute and innocent to play Feool Lolat ... and she wasn't as Asian as Lola was. Charlie Schlatter was a great Brownie, but there was no chemistry between him and Kylie. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was boring. It pulled on, he lacked the passion of the book, it was heavily focused on Kylie and was generally disappointing.
