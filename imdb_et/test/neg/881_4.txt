Richard Gere and Diane Lane star in the chick flick romance, to the end of which I really get angry ... just let me say that this is not my cup of tea, as well as the dime romance is not my cup. <Br / Krund has a doctor who stops at the inn and meets the woman that she has a deep but short thing. She goes away with her strangers and she goes back to her life. <br /> <br /> Well-done and well-made filmmakers forgot the real plot line. This is a dime romance that makes women sweat and men tremble their heads with disbelief. I would not be so damaging to both the film and the meaningless romance, except that the film in turn takes the final roll that is so far from the left that it would be incredible. Why do certain types of movies have to do stupid things like that? That's broken for me. <br /> <br /> If you like romance, wait for it to come on the camera.
