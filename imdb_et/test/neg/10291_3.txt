This movie was * good * during the first part of it. <br /> <br /> We have a story from three perspectives. So we'll find some hints and story. Oh wait ... no matter important, because the FBI guys are bad guys! Although it was a big twist ... it was almost a terrible twist. I immediately downgraded the movie from 7 or 8 to 3, based on the last 10-15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else see why torsion is so bad? Yes, it's a good shock. But it is bad because it has nothing to do with the last hour and 20 minutes. There is no connection with the killers. <br /> <br /> The killers are about 5 minutes from this movie (as killers) and two FBI agents are only 15 minutes from the previous hour and twenty. <Br /> <br /> We get this ... monitoring ... Oh, Killers is voyeurs. WHEN SENSE DOES NOT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED, THAT THEY ARE DESCRIBED ONLY ONLY AS A Psychopath. And the hours and twenty minutes we look at three readings will go out of the window because everything is dead in 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> All this makes the ending even more ridiculous. Oh, they first killed a number of FBI agents ... which FBI agents are sleeping together? All in the same room. To find and murder amateurs and then wake up people who don't know anything about FBI agents? The police, apparently 3 meters away, will probably not be hit by anyone with a normal police outlet gun. I hate movies that try to make you feel that it can be real when they make absurd jumps they think we believe. killers with a girl who's standing there somewhere ...
