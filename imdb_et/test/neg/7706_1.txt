So many of these types of movies come out these days. This zombie flick falls into the main "cheese" category, unlike the much more polished dawn and dead day of the dead. In all justice, these two films were the big studio publications behind the big budgets. But they were also good movies. However, a low budget movie can be good if only they stop receiving and using the worst scripts. Anyone who wrote this movie had to be drunk all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie had both special effects and a very uneven line. One of the major differences with other types of films is the time it takes people to zombies. It seems that they only need a few seconds to die and then become a zombie. But due to the ease with which this "infection" spreads, you may have zombie blood all over you and do not even seem to be at risk of infection and believe me in these people with blood. <br /> <br /> The main problem I had was that our two main stars from time to time walked around the dozens of zombies and didn't get it. If all the others become amazingly fast zombies, these 2 were spit zombies when they were even unarmed and could get out without problems. Our hot chick star even missed a missile at the building where he was. I smiled at that moment. Unarmed, with 10 zombies and a missile hit the building, but can he get out of scratch? OK definitely .... <br /> <br /> Also who advised these people how special forces will ever behave in the army. They should have looked at a movie like Blackhawk to get at least a sense of how they behave in combat situations. <br /> <br /> One soldier was PRIVATE PRIVATE PRIVATE PRIVATE Private. LOL was good. The other one kept the zombies thinking that they were surviving, even putting their weapon on one point. These men are there to fight the zombies and they acted like movies in Stripes. Special forces, lol ... <br /> <br /> Then they reach the point where they try to explain the zombie girl in the rubber space and the whole thing gets very confused. The explanation is confusing and does not even follow the first film. It didn't make any sense at all. The only thing I liked was Anti Bush's jokes. At first, the military told them that the order fell from the vice president to the president, and eventually he was vice president of the "undisclosed location", giving orders. That was the best film for me.
