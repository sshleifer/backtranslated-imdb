Another terrible movie from Hollywood. This time, the female revolution helps in Central America. yes yes yes. Hey lets you make a movie without any reality. I'm so sick of such movies. Actors and actors are bad, the effects are hair and dialogue is terrible. And suddenly I see John Rhys-Davies as an evil president. Between Gimli and Hugo Louis Ramos. I bet he is very proud of it. Well I shouldn't expect much of this movie and I didn't do it. And I'm glad it sucks for a long time. I don't know what people like this movie. I think younger people aged 12-16 years. And I think some people like Kristin Dattilo. Well I am neither of these groups and I hate it. Rating: 2
