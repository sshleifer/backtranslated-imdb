Reviewing the old movies you thought was not necessarily good. Sometimes they get worse. At Fangoria Camp (celebrated in Gorezone as "the most frightening film from Texas CHAINSAW", no), LUTHER GEEK inexplicably developed a culture that followed the "intense" horror scene. In fact, it's just an average stalk and a slash, a biting film that shuts off the package briefly. Yes, it tends to be like a chicken. The filmmaker's credit, at least they didn't make the killer right. It would be just stupid. <br /> <br /> Narrative logic is completely abandoned by LUTHER GEEK. I'm not saying that slaher movies are rich in intelligence, but at least HALLOWEEN escaped Michael Myers. Luther is actually for a long era where people claim to have been reformed, although he clings like a chicken and has razor-dentures (which he probably made in prison). This is a movie where the couple sees the pool in the door and the girl fires it, saying, "Oh, my mother must forget her keys. She forgets a lot of things because my father died." A movie where a hysterical mother runs into the police looking for Luther and tells her, "The killer is in my house!" So what does he do? He grabs him and literally pulls back to the house and says, "Show me where he is, and I'll do the rest." Why not call back? It's too bad that the film is full of terrible action and dialogue, because the Luther character is actually quite interesting. Most credits go to Ed Terry, who is Tom Noonan's dead ring at MANHUNTER, who gives the bully Luther a real threat. With the right director, LUTHER THE GEEK can be on the same level as SONNY BOY or SANTA SANGRE and be a true kinematic strange. But Albright is not a director and just puts Luther's exciting character into annoying slips.
