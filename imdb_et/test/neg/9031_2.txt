"Escape From Hell" is not done artificially enough to hide what it is: using a crass. Direction and writing are both desperate: for example, the camera's work during the fight between Cintia Lodet and Ajita Wilson is so bad that you can't barely do what's going on; as well, if the alcoholic-sweet-hearted doctor had not killed the caregiver, the guards would never have escaped after him and the girls - the "fake plague" plan had worked well so far, but he had to simply destroy it. I would have given this movie out of 10 out of 10 (a sweaty lesbian scene is not bad and Christina Lai has an amazingly beautiful face and body), but a particularly nasty abuse line forced me to cut 2 more points. Of course, some patients take it as a recommendation. After all, one thing that is even more annoying about this movie is that some people gave him positive comments!
