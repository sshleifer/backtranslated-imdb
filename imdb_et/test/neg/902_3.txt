Some movies are amazing, but enjoyable, but many movies are simply strange. Motorama does not fit into the latter category. Many seem to be pleasant because they are endless due to the presence of guests and lack of thought, but these two things can still be taken by the movie, and "Motorama" just doesn't have anything else for their credit. <br /> <br /> "Motorama" is unlikely to rejoice in the plot. Its main character, Gus, is a 10-year-old cussing, set on a journey mode over an imaginary state, trying to collect pieces of the game to win $ 500 million. None of them have noticed or worried about being 10 years old when communicating with adults. At first, it is incredibly funny, but it quickly becomes too unbelievable, especially considering the people it runs, and the fact that it seems so puzzled as many distracting (someone that age) images around him. Gusel has no depth, and an anti-hero who has no problem causing the misery of other games is hard to find out. <br /> <br /> Visitor Appearances, with all the odd ways of Gus Gus. In addition to the fact that the already worn plot is even more unbelievable and less enjoyable, the characters share the lack of depth of Guse and are equally unememable. Character activities may be a bit interesting, but the actors themselves do not add anything to them, thus canceling the whole point of getting big names (they could have been played and the character would have been the same). These guest appearances appear to be more valuable than anything else. <br /> <br /> "Motorama" should be interesting - this is a unique idea, but the script has too little thinking to work. Incidents that are supposed to have anti-heroism and a constant impact on the viewer are not, as the film quickly moves from an incident to an incident, hoping that something will eventually make the audience sad or understand Gust. It never happens, because it does not allow anything to be connected, it just runs back and forth like a conveyor belt, one case after another. Such a meaningless story ceases to be a pleasant and main character who will never be able to take care of himself or anyone else at a higher level, "Motorama" has little to offer except for circumcision and abundance. Why should we care?
