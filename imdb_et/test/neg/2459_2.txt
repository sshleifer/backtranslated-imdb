I don't like many of the factors others have adopted here - acting, lighting, etc. In most cases, these things were filled well enough to film and put points on it. It's just a horror movie. <br /> <br /> What was hurting me was scoring myself. Because it is a deeply moral film and its morality is deeply sticky. In fact, it is actually a fundamentalist Christian morality and it is a fundamentalist Christian film. See "sins": <br /> <br /> * The child of Sutherland was chosen by the school when he was a pre-teen, leading to his accidental death. <br /> <br /> * Baldwin's character's male wives, persuasion and good looks, to rub quite a few women, some of whom she recorded. Ooh, pigs! How unhappy is that women are such passive, giant creatures that they have no relevance. <br /> <br /> * Roberts's character's father came back from Vietnam to a junkie who was so ashamed to seize himself killing himself. Yes, what a terrible sin! Why couldn't he just be an alcoholic like everyone else? <br /> <br /> * and Bacon's character chose another school student. How terrible! The fact that he himself was a child obviously reads something. It seems that the children are divinely evaluated according to the adult criteria. Well, maybe a lot of people support this level of moral absoluteness. Certainly, it does not appear in the comments of the movie. Do everyone buy this stuff? At least human laws treat children differently from adults, recognizing that their ethical meaning is partly formed. This film lacks such abilities and I find it quite reluctant. Think of the idea that women are helpless, fluffy creatures before the evil lust of young men. Or that the Vietnamese vet who drives drug addiction is so shameful that suicide is a valid choice. Pathetic.
