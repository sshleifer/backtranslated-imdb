Why restore the original "attack"? In my opinion, Assault was the real masterpiece of Carpenter. It was all the elements of good Carpenter films contain. An external threat to a small group of individuals. People are challenging because they are forced to do so. Isolation! Keep in mind that carpenters' originals did not sound, thus being much more dangerous than conventional equipment. And now this remake. Focusing on "the main character Psychology and its relationship with the main character II (evil, but respectable). Anonymous danger in Carpenter's film was replaced by quite conventional conspiracy / corruption." "Remakers" simply did not understand the original plot of the original.
