It's a very famous Ninja movie, but it's not a nice movie. If you want to see ninjas and some numbers, you want to know that Ninjas sees this movie. This movie is only for ninja fans and wants nostalgia. <br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes and 20 minutes of the movie are the best. Ninja figures can be seen and fought in this scene. Between them is below average, almost bad for the film. Action is bad. Sho (black ninja) is the best actor in this movie. Frank Nero is a good actor and charismatic, but he can't fight good. The scenario is also not good. It's that simple. Franko Nero comes to the best old friend of the army and war. She also protects her from the mafia, but she's sex (in bed) with her husband and her friend knows it, but says nothing about Nero's negative. Is it possible in life? What friendship! <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie started with a genre; Ninja movies. There are also ninja captain Sho Kasug, but some fighting scenes are neither realistic nor fast. This movie is smaller than average, even if it's classic.
