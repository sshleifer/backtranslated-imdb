Before going any further, I have to admit that I only saw the first episode of this exhibition. If I had time, I would have had to watch it every week if only to see how the season was playing. However, it was very clear to me from the start that Martha Stewart's "The Apprentice" simply didn't fit. Martha Stewart made a career to be a happy home god, Oprah Winfrey and Julia Child's domestic god. It was only since his scandalous legal concerns and subsequent imprisonment that his public image began to reflect his actual hardness. Of course he was convincing for a while and this whole series raises an interesting question about what it means to be a woman in business. Does he have to come cold and tough? Shouldn't he? <br /> <br /> But the truth was that when Stewart came out of prison, he never attempted to catch the interest of the observers for a very long time, albeit certainly justified. Perhaps a real return would have worked if he had come home calmly and waited a year or more after his often-spotted ankle bracelet was removed. Instead, he desperately put him in the 2-series all over, the other was his syndicate Martha, like his old show, but more of a mainstream with famous guests like Bette Midler. Of course, even at its top, Stewart was never the mainstream, so it's too much to ask the American audience to immediately accept his fictional reality TV. Perhaps America wants Stewart to start his return, not the basis for it. <br /> <br /> The exhibition was basically tired of Trump's Apprentice, which still has interest. , Cast and Trump Shooting Decisions (often contradictory - probably for this reason). The letter was not a clich√©, but a little unpleasant. The fact that Stewart never says, "You're fired!" What is mentioned on the message board of this site is particularly disturbing. The producer Mark Burnett should be admired for being honest with the Stewart prisoner, trying to make him a hero, but the truth is that anyone who looks at it can say that he is basically trying to show that he is that nice businesswoman. Again, Stewart no longer has Oprah Winfrey's compatibility and detectability and Donald Trump's admirable, charismatic "strength". Yes, it may be a gender biased assessment of his character, but I mean that it is more about the nature of his activities. <br /> <br /> It's not a shock that Stewart is fired, but I don't know if they always plan to do it for only one season?
