FW Murnau, Fritz Langi, Carl Dreyeri, Marcel Carn√© et al. People's expressionist black-and-white films have a pleasant half-hearted respect. Allen plays a character caught in a Kafkaesque nightmare, at first I thought he was part of a vigilant group trying to kill him and realizing he might be a suspect. Writing is a little forced (that is, Woody Allen, who is trying to be a coy Kafka), but the thing is done and there is no harm. Cinematic art is interesting, about 100 gray tones, but make sure you look in a very dark room with a good screen, or the details absorb the fog. This is a fun little movie with some laughs, which is actually "uh-huh". It's a good thing to do, given the strange vehicle and it's worth checking out if you're a big Woody Allen fan. It is also of interest to those who express expressionist films. I'd give it out of 10 out of 10.
