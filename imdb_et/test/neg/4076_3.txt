If you are not a fan of the 80's and you have to be a very strong fan or one of two supporters, this movie is not recommended. <br /> <br /> The story, as others have said, is a boring, almost aftertaste of the main idea of ​​the characters and the idea of ​​making a mania comedy lightly. I looked at it for about an hour, hoping it would change in the corner, twist, or be in gear, but not ... It's not traceable, it's just boring. It goes. It goes crazy about running pictures, capturing strange angles of legs, a bit of mad clotting, but I didn't get real energy or mania for fun, it was just forced. Needless to say, there was nothing to laugh at. A little light amusement here or there, but nothing else. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by mentioning feminism, but that means almost all the main cast is women. If anything, it's really cloying ... Two female leads, good, great, drug dealer is a woman, okay, their landlord is a homeowner, well, their friends are women, okay, the only other person we especially see the same building, oh, bitch ... I didn't have a look at it, but after a while it seemed that there was a conscious decision to throw the movie so much, and she felt a bit forced and astonishing on the plus side when you're in the 80s fashion and a cultural fan, there is much to see and if you are a fan of Helen Slater, she is a fun and enjoyable watch. Carol Kane also has some screen time that is great, but not enough ... <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10. If you're a big 80's fan, Helen Slater and Carol Kane, maybe you might want to drag them to 5, though there's still the fact that it's not a funny comedy that hampers it. If you are not a fan of these things, you can also do 0 because there is nothing else here.
