I saw it at Sundance and I can't figure out why she won the driving prize. It was painfully slow and literally colorless. This is a type of film that is only appreciated by film festivals who think that every movie that many people want must be under them. <br /> <br /> This year, the Sundance Jury knowingly knew to reward the underworld with very low budget movies. It's all good and good, but this wandering, dragging mess looks like a home movie. The mini-DV snow covered gray winter image results in a drab search for drab. <br /> <br /> Certain motifs (snakes) are beaten to death, even though they don't let anything to the story and make no sense as symbols. <br /> <br /> It wasn't all bad now. Vera Farm has a phenomenal role as a mother with a drug problem. He goes to places and he deserves it. His co-star Hugh Dillon is doing a good job. Frankly, this movie has many exciting moments, but they just don't fit well.
