That's pretty much what I can say about the flat and involuntary remake of the 1979 Carol Kane vehicle. Camilla Belle is not much of an actress and she does not give Jill Johnson, the babysitter, an anonymous phone call harassed, the power and vitality. <br /> <br /> But if you are looking for some great home architecture and interior design ideas, this movie will give you more inspiration than what you see on TLC or HGTV. Jill spends nearly 90 minutes at a rich medical and female house, for whom she offers her sessions, looking for the strange sounds and things that go on in the evening. When he runs around corners and peers, we see a beautiful bathroom with his bath and his sinks, which look like Roman baths, a large kitchen with an incredible backlit glass shelf and a piece of resistance, a stand-alone fortress and a coy pond with a self-immersing system. <br /> <br /> Since the film is not convincing enough to pull Jill's fear, we are disturbing the grandeur of the house, which is nothing you should do when you look at the thriller. Even if Jill lives with the seemingly maniac, we ignite it because it crushes precious items and often interferes with it, not because it is murdered. and the end is something other than the original. By the time it was over, I just wanted to find out where the hell this house was and whether it was real. Don't forget that Jill and the babies she was a babysitter were <br /> <br /> 2 stars - both for the house.
