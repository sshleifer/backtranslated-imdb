It is not easy to find a VHS with a Jewish kiss (it is not available on DVD), but I wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my Alan Rickman movie collection. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how talented Mr Rickman gets into these mediocre films? Judas Kiss has many wonderful actors, an interesting plot and an intriguing twist, but his strange visual travels and editing of chopping have destroyed what could have been a major crime drama. Many scenes seem to be missing important information to explain a character's action: Why was our hero immediately suspicious of his superiors? Why did he trust a detective who replaced him? There were times when, frankly, they didn't say whether the director meant Judas Kiss was a legitimate criminal drama or campy spoof. Why else would he throw a topless / alien / lesbian porn scene in the first two minutes (this little surprise made me far because my kids were playing near!)? Did he instruct his two outstanding English actors (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use such terrible New Orleans accents? Like Alan Freak, I testify that I still thought that Mr. Rickman was sexy: drummed, tired, "take him home and tuck-in-in" a sort of. <br /> <br /> Judas Kiss is not a great movie, but it has some intriguing moments, but I don't recommend it if you don't want to get into Alan Rickman.
