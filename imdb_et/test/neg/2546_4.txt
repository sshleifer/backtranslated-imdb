May be spoilers, so don't read if you don't want Just like watching TV news, everything has already happened, a big tsunami hovers over the Gulf of the city and CUT, no longer seeing, Tokay suffers a great earthquake, did anyone see a big earthquake more than 5 seconds did I see? If you want to make a love story, make a love story, but if you want to use the title of a disaster movie, please show me the effort, pd after watching the movie JISHIN RETTO or some GODZILLA movie that was ready to see people yelling and collapse of buildings that didn't got the chance to do that in this movie. Don't take me wrong, I love disaster movies and I love the original Nihon chimbotsu and Jishin rettot, I like even the newest Poseidon, not a lot of story there, but very good and graphic catastrophe, New Nihon chimbotsu loses a point as many times as a pearl or tomorrow day, but at least two movies show good disaster sequences, as well as costly currencies that didn't show anything, give me fake buildings if you want, as long as you destroy them properly I know I should know a sadistic freak, but I went to see Love actually when i felt like seeing a romantic movie, grrrrrrr even kimpachi sensei makes me cry and this movie didn't come: t. In 1975, the TV series is called napping chimbotsu, I have a DVD and it is much better
