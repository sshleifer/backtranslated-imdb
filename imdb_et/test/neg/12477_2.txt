In 1994, Power Rangers had become a major franchise and vv. The leaders of the US Network hoped to get involved and came up with Beverly Hills tattooed teen fighters, where the evil Emporer Gorganus, who looks at his home-made Darth Vader costume, and his spoken bird, looks like a rubber dog jaw, come to earth to penetrate this gigantic monsters that look like rejection of the 1970s Godzilla films. Fortunately, Nimbar calls an alien who looks like a gigantic piece of clear rams, recruiting four teenagers to protect the country, and gives them a tattoo for every other constellation that allows them to turn eighty-year-old technicians into dancers. they could also combine a huge knight. Forty episodes were made. The US network obviously had no money to try to adjust the Japanese exhibition, such as Power Rangers, and compiled this exhibition independently using the budget of the 1950s sci-fi. Fighting scenes are common, special effects are bad and some sets look like they may fall. The actors realized quite a lot about how the exhibition was ridiculous and pretty much up and over their teeth. I can only imagine their shock when the display was canceled.
