I always hated this slow motion exhibition. I liked the Cartoon Network exhibitions like "Dexter Laboratory" or "Megas XLR. But I never liked this piece. Basically because it has stupid signs (good or villain all seem to have slowed down mentally) they have foolish voices (specially Bubbles. be the "cute" character of the show, but it is incredibly annoying) the story is very, very stupid, some episodes might have been interesting, but almost always the example of a child and a corpse does not like it, the music was terrible and the animation is the worst I've seen. " Powerpuff Girls seems to be one of the worst cartoons ever made. Fortunately, the same creator of "Foster Home for Imaginary Friends" is better.
