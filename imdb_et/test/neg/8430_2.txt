I remember seeing this small series for the first time in 1984 with growing anger and frustration. Having read the comments on this title, I have to agree with the opinions of the people living in Greece. It was prepared for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games, and it seemed to me that it was nothing more than practicing jingoist, flagged American nationalism, in which American athletes were honored at the expense of all others. Some other nations would have the full right to feel a deep insult in the way they were portrayed in this series. However, it may help explain how many American spectators behaved in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and on television, which seemed to be interested only in the events likely to be won by Americans.
