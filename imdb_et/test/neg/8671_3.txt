It was just a TV channel in the US. Others have commented on the novelty of the novel (or its absence); The 1983 BBC version is much better on this and all other issues. Given the scale of the novel, it would not be necessary to shorten it for 85 minutes. Key parts must be rushed or referenced or omitted; there is hardly enough time to get to the chronology of events, so that the character's evolution must be sacrificed: we can't feel much of the people that attack us from what makes Austen so great. <br /> <br One of the main negative for me was cinematography, which I thought was just terrible and literally bad. The camera constantly takes ultra-close-ups and turns around the circle. Maybe this is OK for a small TV box, but our 40-inch hi-def screen was so irritating that my wife and I had to go away from the device (my Dramamine supply was over). it distracted quite weakness as if I was reading-what-in-the-script (isolated scenes are nicely done, but not to save things). <br /> <br /> Adding a Point to Complete AND Competitions: I'd appreciate the success of "Northanger Monastery" because the superior direction and product values ​​(and story better suited to short treatment), "persuasion" OK (though not equal to other versions) when condensation is again to blame), both far from this interruption, I hope to be better in the other two novels of the Digest Jane Austen TV reader, like others, I am grateful that they left P&P alone!
