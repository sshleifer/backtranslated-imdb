Now it's 2008, who actually takes care of DB Sweeney in the world for a similar man, even then he wasn't a big deal. <br /> <br /> Two tickets to Paradise have been described and well-established, where three friends hit the road with every personal situation. Again, a proven plot. The problem with this movie, except that it is "so bad that it's convincing" is the script. <br /> <br /> After Cliché Clichés, three men are doing the same things you've seen on all other movies ... John C. McGinley's mission is great, especially compared to late DB Sweeney. (His career is dead, so it's late. Although I hear he's going to the TV, he's good). John C's film is also probably the least terrible. <br /> <br /> The result is so general that it looks like you are watching 1993's third course movie or Jeff Anderson's movie you know now (put me back a few years ago, but at least it was more fun.) I mean yeah, i think i enjoyed the parts. But the funny man is annoying, DB is trying to be this coolly failed guitar player (with some harsh influences, like some of the worst classic stone) who has a strange relationship with a stripper and John C is a gambler who is a woman and the child leaves him after his father's death and also visits from your bookmates. <br /> <br /> I mean how to make this movie better. But I think burning the script would have been a whole start. <br /> <br /> But as I have always pointed out, this is not the worst film. And the chance I have to see McGinley starring in, I'll take it. Hopefully he will start better projects.
