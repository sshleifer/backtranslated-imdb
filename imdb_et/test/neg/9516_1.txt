This movie was so embarrassing to watch. Shared screens do not allow you to participate in the participants' emotions. I went back and forth, looking at all those tiny pictures I finally found with wiplash. It's basically hanging on "Talent Mr. Ripley" and "Timecode". Catching this filmmakers to be cool. I wish I had gone out like many others.
