No Holds Barred is a movie that should never be taken seriously. It sucks hardcore as a serious movie. See it more than you should plan for 9 spaces. They're the same, both of them so bad they're funny. No Holds Barred's funny moments are usually those that shouldn't be. When Rip (played by Hulk Hogan as only he can play them) grabs the limousine driver after the first meeting with Brell (Kurt Fuller), and this is one part of the movie that every person should see. It can be a more fun scene ever, I swear. <br /> <br /> Anyway, how anyone thought this movie was making money, I never know, and that person should probably make it. I hope they were shot at least. This movie earns 1 out of 5 on my scale, and it's just involuntarily for fun parts.
