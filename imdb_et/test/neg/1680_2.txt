Elite American Military Team, which of course happens when two good views are involved and a man who does not quite understand teamwork, many bats, some terrorists, and the Spetznaz team, acting like a gang who can't get straight. everything was thrown into the middle by blending. It has nothing to do with it. The characters are not convincing. Even the great opportunities have a Pennsylvania countryside, not an Eastern European exotic Boreal forest. <br /> <br /> Bats are definitely wild. They can even get a man and have a few feet (harpies?) To fly or cut their hands. You see the power of Delta, surrounded by hundreds of bats and boys, who let them attack rifles and pistols and bats on the ground. It would be like trying to shoot a skeet with a gun at 3 feet. Absolutely helpless. The dialogue is unrealistic unrealistic, boy / girl joking and flirting in the midst of the tense parts of the mission. One team is blowing by me and the first scene just vanishes on its body, stunned, not even distracted to cover or secure the area. In fact, after showing the rest of the group, he talks about how this area is like a mining field - thanks to good bubbles. <br /> <br /> If you want a contrast, how a horror movie engages a small army group can do a little budget well. Harvest is not the movie you want to see. Actually, I think I'll give him two instead of three if I get it through the other half. It seems unlikely.
