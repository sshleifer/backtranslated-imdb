A stupid and violent thriller, hanging from "Deliverance" but without magic and intelligence. The plot is ridiculous and the cast seems to be tired and wants to be free from such unpleasant entry. This film is a strong example of a bad plot and a very bad idea. It's a shame that good actors like Thomerson and James are living in such a mess.
