Modern scary movie? Yes, it's .. <br /> <br /> Hippies, headbands and environmentalists came together to give us a movie of fear. I didn't feel it when I looked at it just 2 years ago, that it was a fear film, but that's exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> and there is no difference between the movies we did about them. It's pure propaganda and only talks to them. that believe in foreigners, 9/11 plot plots, counterfeit moon landings, oil excellence and high environmental protection. What I can say is that the movie doesn't hit the buttons, you make questions, and finally forget it. It's a scary movie. When your scars get into your houses, lock the doors and stock up for this nuclear winter, which we all know will come when the bush provokes a Chinese nuclear war.
