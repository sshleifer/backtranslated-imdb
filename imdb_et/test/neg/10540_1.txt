The best thing about a movie is its name because it describes both the plot and the actor. At least they can't say they didn't warn you ... Like the "Don't push it" button. <br /> <br /> Segal has to run that moves like planes, trains and ships, but the plot remains the same. Under the cover, who is fighting slowly, but still wins like 40 mercenary types and does not even blink. I'm surprised that Segal is now as big as a barn and bad guys can't beat her with a machine gun and 50 clearance. Where are all these balls actually going? The only redeeming feature of this movie is to look at Nia Peeples's Pound And Rule (the real name of Jeffrey Atkins is not that fine) on the floor. I could spend days watching the woman hit her leg like this ... especially wearing clothes like this! It was just a bonus, looking at Jeffy's * ss kicked, and amused by the hope that one of these beatings would actually land. Sorry, it's just a time when we get foolish harsh men who can't shoot movies. PLEEEEEASE! Who came with the idea anyway? I would set the odds that was the one who decided that Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore would go to funny athletic angels. and come on Jeffy and save the day. Undoubtedly, Snoop (under my mum as Calvin Broadus, which he does not sound like Cal) again, would throw some characters in the film and probably saved Segal's life or something.
