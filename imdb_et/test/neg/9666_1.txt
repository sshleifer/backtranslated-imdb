I got it for my birthday in a box called Broke Skull. Well, after watching the DVD and pleasantly surprised, I jumped into this imperial. It was worse than I expected, and I didn't expect much. This movie is basically a complicated story of a man who dies and lives with a cell phone and other bullfighters. There were some interesting ideas that were never followed. Now everyone has said there is a lot of gore, can anyone tell me? I saw blood from the crushing head, brain tissue (or something ...) and the penis area twice badly. I have to say that this part was when the man got his man's closet bitten off, made me worship, it was the only good of this movie. And this gay sex scene was just there for no reason. Acting on it was Atrocious, really, it blew. This Asian chick was a tedious, then irritating Mexican boy who just had to be killed. I say if you get this box, it's good, but don't spend any money on it.
