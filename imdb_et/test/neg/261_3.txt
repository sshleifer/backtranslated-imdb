When I read Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye's comments, I thought, "Huh?" It was confusing. Surely I went to watch the movie and what do you know? This is a remake of the "Wedding Singer". Several scenes have been modified to fit the whole of Indianess, but the rest is a direct lift since the 1998 Hollywood hit. Bollywood is not a stranger to do it again, but it is so poor that it just bothering me to watch it. I dropped it so much and I realized that I'm not the only one who does it! One guy walked out of the theater and never came back! Salman Khan should seriously stop making comedy roles. He punishes and beats too much. Why doesn't he just take it? He does not properly respect the original role played by Adam Sandler. He has no sense of Sandler's comic timing. Rani is a great actress and one of my favorites, but she's not Drew Barrymore. The scene in which he stands in front of the mirror to practice his new surname ("Hello, I'm Mrs. Pugalia") does not match the Barrymore version ("Hello, I'm Mrs. Julia Gulia"). I felt embarrassed about watching this scene, even though I loved the original. Music is not too bad. This is probably the only rescue arm of this otherwise terrible movie! Avoid it at all costs!
