This game is a good looking first person shooter. ----------- Hang on ...... <br /> <br /> Of course, this genre will have a story around it, so a rather innovative plot for the soldiers currently controlled by the world to save the drug and kill the terrorist , a nectar is an optional drug that creates a superhero. Great, now just give us some fun and complicated missions, throw in some great new weapons and free off-road cars that you can drive during our free time. I'm quite happy. <br /> <br /> NO !!!! <br /> <br /> The creator of this game decides to create a propaganda, military race that tries to understand our fears of terrorism and democracy. The game has twisted ideals that simply enforce the morals we learned in primary school, nothing new to us, but "drugs are bad ... mmmkay". Then it was pushed in ... Yvan Junk Nnnioooojjjjj! (join the navy) on how to stand for general well-being, taking into account normality and abnormalities, right and wrong .... GOOOOOOOOOOD WE IT IT! LET's KILL SOMETHING !!!! <br /> <br /> NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> You can't, you are forced to withstand extremely long gaps in BULLSH! T to accomplish its goals, such as "Run to Helicopter" ....... "Go to the Army Group" .. ... Then when it is completed ......... CINEMATIC takes over .... ..... You are sitting there for at least half of the game, looking at the few scenarios that characters play. DO NOT skip but sit and wait, sometimes when people don't even talk, sit and wait for the helicopter to land! A bad game by a ridiculous group of programmers! Don't worry about you because I see a movie!
