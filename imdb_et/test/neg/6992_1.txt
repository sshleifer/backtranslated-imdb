Everyone loves to see a very bad movie. You look at it, laugh and forget it in the next half hour. But this is not one of them. This is the worst thing that will appear in front of the eyes for a while. <br /> <br /> I would like to see someone responsible for Dante - he is really the most stupid will you think: a boy in leather pants that speaks with a voice and wins a laugh like 50's Dracula. How can someone come with this boy? And the hero ... "The Dragon" or whatever ... my grain box has better performance skills than he (maybe all of them), it's incredible. But the worst is the fighting scenes where you think there may be something. They're so flat, it's farther than any description. Not ashamed, I just can't believe how this studio promised no movie. But I'm just excited about it. Tracking it is a self-harming pleasure. Look at it only when you're in search of a movie, and in that case it's a winner.
