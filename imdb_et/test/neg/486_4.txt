Okul "Kool" is the result of the new direction of the Turkish cinema. Having used the same stories over and over again, the leaders of the new generation will eventually come up with different ideas. Of course, this does not mean that they are all big. I think Okul is one of them. It should be a scary movie, but it is not. Nor is it terrible. What is that? The actors are so average, especially Deniz Akkaya is quite annoying about the role of the teacher. I'm sure it could have been better than trying it harder. Maybe focus on one topic, as it is scary or vice versa. But the directors have forgotten the target this time. ** at the end *****
