Greetings, Moviegoers! Looking at Octopus II, I consider the natural stupidity of the Octopus / Croc / Dino Horror genre. Many moviegoers can blame poor behavior, a meaningless scenario, or a poorly constructed plot as the cause of OCD movie mite. These reasons may indeed be sliding factors, but filming at the heart of flatness is inherently difficult. <br /> <br /> You see, this technology is not yet realistic, the life-size OCD and CGI technology, which is currently used by studios, cannot smoothly mix with real-world environments and characters. Even in the case of smart cinematography, you can only shoot in the sea / semi-dark forest / semi-dark cave / half-dark corridor as many times before the Sci-Fi enthusiast becomes completely boring (OCD sub-genre, that is). <br /> <br /> What can you do, you ask? I would not recommend that the genre abandon the cheese, but the other way is to be explored. We can't really return to the "Fade-to-Black" day that someone has been killed. Or can we? If we are unable to achieve the goal of realism, we must compensate for other things, such as the plot's twist, enthusiasm, and the photographic field. <br /> <br /> It is a brilliant and alternative method to improve the flatness of the disease, which is so common in the sub-genus of OCD.
