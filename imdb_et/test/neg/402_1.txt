I usually love these movies. Give me a good old B movie every day, but it was just terrible. Action (?) It was terrible for almost the entire moment the movie was turned off completely. I thought I was worst all the time, but that's right there with the Killer Tomato attack! Frankly, it was an actor who made this movie for me. <br /> <br /> I found the actor clumsy and the driver man / woman was very boring. There was nothing in this movie about it. I can ask a ridiculous question here, but why nudity and sexual scene? Did the producers think that no one would watch if they left? I think they were probably right! Oh, where's Price and Tingler, if you need them?
