This movie is a mediocre and low budget flick. I've seen much less in MST3K, let me assure you, but it's still a pretty dirty movie. <br /> <br /> The film is Clonus, a top secret government agency where clones are used by organs for politicians. In fact, it is almost an Orwellian society: almost (but not quite) effective. <br /> <br /> The film begins to descend downhill when the main cloak (celebrity of Tim Connely 'Emergency') falls in love with a female clone (Paulette Breen, who appeared in it and up to four other films {and was not her first film}). They're going to suspect something. After the beer arrives in a nearby river, the plot starts to break. The clone does not get answers from the main stadium (Dick Sargent 'Bewitched') or 'Confessional - a computer that probably knows everything so that it breaks into the main building of Clonus and (in the fun-destroyed scene by Mike and Hilaria) the Bots) Truth (including clone video that shows exactly the same method used to clone Dolly five years ago ... and this film was made over 20 years ago). He breaks freely, guarded by two guards. He has one hell that breaks through the high fences of two legs, although it is much harder to climb into boulders. From there it moves forward. Peter Graves ("The End of the End", "The Conquered The World") also appears as President-in-Office and Keenan Wynn ("Dr. Strangelove", "Piranha", "Once upon a West") and Lurleen Tuttle ("Ma Barker Killer Brood") , "Psycho") as a couple of elderly people who help escape from Clony. The MST3K version was invaluable; One of the best episodes ever. <br /> <br /> Four stars for the movie, 10 MST3K versions.
