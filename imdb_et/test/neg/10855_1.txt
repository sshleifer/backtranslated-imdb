This is an opportunity I've ever seen in the worst and disappointing film. I have spent four years in two universities and know that a good film has to be made of experience. That's not the case. "Acting" is God's terrible and primitive plot. <br /> <br /> Here are some of my one-year-old residence halls. <br /> <br /> 1) Posh boy who unknowingly got into a transvestite. 2) Pairing your best friend with two girls - one with a big breast and the other with a nickname "brick". 3) A couple moving too loud. 4) A boy who gets all the girls 5) A boy from Northern Ireland who is very hard to understand. 6) McDonalds In Bed 7) Curry Every Week Weekly 8) The students' bashing, a couple of my companions came to the hospital. 10) Flood 11) A boy who wakes up on his floor to find that all the furniture has to be taken from his room. <br /> <br /> And when I get out of this list in 5 minutes in real life, I'm sure a couple of script writers will get better, much better. <br /> <br /> And Sleeper for a song called Britpop's track?
