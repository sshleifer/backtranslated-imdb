After his widow's father dies in a terrible accident, the young Tom Burlinson (like Jim Craig) is left to lead his Australian winter winter farm, with the help of a hostile, peg-footed player, Kirk Douglas. The times are tough, so Mr. Burlinson is going to work with Mr Douglas's wealthy, silver-haired brother Ranch Harrison (also played by Kirk Douglas). How much work will be done, silver hair (parents?) Think Burlinson is too young and inexperienced to go on; so Burlinson falls behind and falls in love with Bossi's daughter Sigrid Thornton (like Jessica Harrison). <br /> <br /> The least satisfying aspect of Director George Miller's "Snow River Man" is the weak storyline. For example, observe that "Jessica is missing" event sequence. The girl gets lost in one of these "freak" storms. His worried father rounds up drunken men after predicting bad weather. Damsel "Jessica" rolls to the edge of a cleverly appearing rock. The Father and suddenly the men who are sober do not control the Burlinson farm. Hero Burlinson discovers his mother. After building a fire he decides to kiss him. <br /> <br /> "Romance" is played too innocently as obvious as the attractive man and woman like Burlinson and Mrs Thornton. Even worse is the Douglas brothers in the "dark history" that appears before the mystery emerges on this issue. The main attraction here is the Australian landscape. <br /> <br /> **** Snow Man (1982) George Miller ~ Tom Burlinson, Kirk Douglas, Sigrid Thornton
