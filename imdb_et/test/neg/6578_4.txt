I like underdogs. So, 12 years after Star Trek V saw for the first time, and thought it was unpleasant, I gave him another watch, hoping to find some of the redeeming qualities I first missed. <br /> <br /> I don't. <br /> <br /> Writing is half-baked, and although the quality of the exhibition first is stable enough to keep the movie on your feet (albeit trembling), the closer we get it to the plot. The last quarter of the movie is just ridiculous. Worse still, the original POV was that it was the first ST movie that appeared after the franchise returned to the next generation television, and the next generation's average episode would put that shame on * - including special effects! What is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> The ultimate limit is not deeply sad - I gave it to 4 out of 10 - but it's so much below your predecessor standard (yes, including the first) that the only reason I can see it is the fact that you appreciate other movies more. <br /> <br /> * if this is not an episode of Tro's mother.
