It contains some spoiler information, but the movie is still not worth watching ... <br /> <br /> Why Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson agreed that writer-director Damian Harris is part of this attack. The story is full of unrealistic police investigation techniques that include keeping a suspect and calling him suspect in his home and becoming intimate with them. The story also includes a male psychiatrist who seems to have only female clients - and she sleeps with them all. <br /> <br /> What's more, the overall idea is that female victims are terrible S / M crime is a big but mysterious group of S / M lesbian leaders. <br /> <br /> Complete with bad editing and continuity errors, the movie is sterile in all your embarrassing places, including the Barkin Detective Salary Apartment. And the flat dialogue is perfect for sleeping. <br /> <br /> Damian is a bad writer and a bad director. He tried hard and barely to create an occasional noireque atmosphere. In addition, she couldn't get Ellen Barkin 110%. I firmly believe that he realized that the film was pathetic and gave up the test. <br /> <br /> Standouts was Peta Wilson who wasted time with Dominatrix for this part. Very little appreciated character Marshall Bell gave his absolute best, as always. <br /> <br /> And since Damian was unable to deliver at some level, it was hard to feel any character. Most importantly, he doesn't know much about BDSM from the real world and decided to create a typical "Hollywood reality" that is beautiful for men and women who are perverse and dangerous. <br /> <br /> Save your time, money and braincells and move it one by one.
