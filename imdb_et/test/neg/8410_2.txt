With its few surrealism factors, LWHTRB works as a low-grade horror, but if it is a great post-treatment of the original, it will start shamefully. <br /> <br /> Things are going to give you some hope when it comes to opening a movie. We see and hear a number of interesting shots and sounds: baby black crib with raised, turned cross; vegetables Rosemary wore Castevette's apartment and fell under the shock (the hardware was pulled out of hardwood floor); and Bramford's emptiness, without tenants or furniture (voice calls are heard here from the previous movie dialogue). Also interesting is the Easter egg, where the title child participates (eggs and baskets are also black). When the story rolls, it never "rolls" ... And what happens to Rosemary when he runs this unmanageable bus, and it's thrown away to God - where? <br /> <br /> Patty Duke (a bad substitute for Mia Farrow), Ray Milland and Tina Louise (like Southwestern Whore, who raises the child, "Adrian / Andrew") head to this almost-star cast, with Ruth Gordon "Minnie "repeating the role. <br /> <br /> Although this was not a complete failure, it would have had to be published first in the form of a book, maybe we could all have been a little better informed ... and not completely left in the dark. Quite a recent novel "The Son of Rosemary" (1999?) Is the lawful follow-up of Ira Levin. <br /> <br />
