It was the worst of Wrestlemania in history. The only good matches were Ricky Steamboat vs. Hercules Hernandez and the title of the label between the British bulldog and the dream team (this is classic). Everything else was bad or terrible. The idea of ​​the three host cities was unnecessary, confusing, and confused with the flow of the exhibition. Celebrity guests were terrible in the comments, especially Susan Saint James. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in WWF from the mid-1980s, you will be better off renting or buying Wrestlemania 3 or almost any other PPV for that.
