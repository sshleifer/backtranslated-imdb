The limited landscape views were the only rescue grace otherwise unustentful and boring film. Action was an absurd limit that blamed the script and scenario. Nicole Eggert did not see part, did not work in part and was absolutely convincing as a mountain guide. After watching it, I felt that some of my friends had some free time and decided to film. It must be made from the pocket budget. The plot was, at best, thin and occasionally operating with a low caliber asking, "Why are we doing this?". I managed to sit through the film, but I asked myself, "Why?".
