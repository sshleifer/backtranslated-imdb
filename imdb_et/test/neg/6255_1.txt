This movie was just bad. I can forgive low-budget movies for a low budget, but it wasn't funny, it wasn't wise, he didn't have any redemption features at all if you really didn't want to look at a fake breast. I don't know what this genre is, maybe an erotic horror, but if so, it's not so sexy or scary. Tying Slumber Party Massacre movies was useless; I never saw the former movies, and after one scene that was trying to put it together, I had no chance to find out who the escaped psycho-killer "Cheerleader" was or why they were disturbing, especially since (and I don't think I was here to reveal something), it was really obvious that in her movie, her cheerleader was not her killer. What about the real murderer? All I can say is flat. Really flat. If you find out why the killer has a spanking attack (and a team coach and two starters who happened to travel by bus) and the bus driver is probably for this hell, then you sit there and go-- WTF? The worst excuse to murder murders ever. "Actors" (two of the guesses why I quoted) generally saw a small budget of pornography they were likely to have. Those poor people who are trying to break a "legitimate" movie. One of my friends told the actress who played Buzzi, the bus driver: "He looks like a man who knows he's really going into it, and his face gets all the reds and things." We had a good larva. Half of the other participants were all skill and skill of the "Annie" sixth grade production. The other half seemed dead to the dead (especially in the deleted scene, this redhead ...) and in ten minutes I was with that movie. <br /> <br /> Note: The DVD contains one deleted scene that would have made the movie R-rated NC-17 if it were left in place. It was completely free and adult entertainment has no quality. The only reason to disturb it is to laugh, a lot, to the bad.
