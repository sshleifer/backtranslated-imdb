This is the first time I feel the need to comment on IMDb, write some kind of review, and it happens so often, not because of a really great movie, but because of a really terrible one. <br /> <br /> Take the narrative style that the youngest can relate to Max Payne's video game series, which is virtually unkonwns (which is not in itself bad), a bad dialogue, some dark scenes, but not enough, and make a movie about it . Don't worry about bad behavior, length (too long), lack of language immersion (the guideline must be one of the most interesting things I've seen for a long time - don't care less than it died), or often the ridiculous solutions they find to some issues that the wizard finds . <br /> <br /> I wouldn't have written anything if there wasn't another review here, giving it 10 stars. I gave him four, but maybe three are closer to what I feel. Not only do you want to see it again, but I just thought it would take me dangerously close to wanting to kill me. Oh, and the so-called Noir movie is nothing good without being here. The final song sounds like it was more suitable for Western film. <br /> <br /> It's not romance, it's not an action, it's not a noir, it's not good. This would be my review if it wasn't at least 10 lines.
