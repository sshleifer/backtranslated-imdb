Stephen Seagal plays a guy who talks about driving a military car to a bank that holds and rides everything that comes across his path. However, the police seem to be very fast on the pitch and Seagal smells like a rat, who gave the police an idea. The story goes into many twists and the money from the resurrection has disappeared and no one knows their new owner. Bad Seagal gets a little bit of it, and of course he's looking for a person or people trying to take him away for a long time. In this film, Seagal tries to be a good man, but the evil force is against him. Unfortunately, this is not a great movie and is quite boring and too long.
