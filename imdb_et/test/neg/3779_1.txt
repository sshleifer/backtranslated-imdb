I've heard that this move was put together by a lot of high school students. It is not too bad as a college art or theater project. If you didn't live in the mid-1970s and didn't know someone was involved in making a movie, it's pretty terrible. Most participants are probably not participants, but volunteers. Bob Wilkins (original creator features in KTVU in Oakland, but only about a minute). Some monster effects are made with stop-motion animation and some with a monster man and everyone is working properly, but there is no consistency between them. Despite dialogue, you expect the film to have two monsters. I think the most untenable aspect is that even the main characters I assume are behind the child, not even pretend. These kids must be involved in the theater in some way to do the project, but they show zero-believing emotions in front of the camera.
