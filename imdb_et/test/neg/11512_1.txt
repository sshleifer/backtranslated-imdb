For those who are part of the real world of ballet, this film is completely ridiculous. Ivan Kirov was basically a gymnast, not a ballet dancer. Viola Essen was at that time a Ballet Theater, now an American Ballet Theater and a relatively good dancer, but with the exception of Dame Judith Anderson, the actress is amateur and Checkov is absolutely up. I saw this movie at the age of 14 and at that time, having ever seen a ballet, I was very impressed. But in later life, long after I had finished my career as a dancer, I bought this videotape, curious what it was like for so many years. I couldn't believe how naive Hollywood could be in the ballet world. But it was done in the mid-40s, before the Red Gift or Turning Point, the latter giving a true picture of the ballet world. The entire Specter is now dead ... Ivan Kirov (not his real name) died at the age of 79. It was his only film, which is then kept by a Chicago businessman.
