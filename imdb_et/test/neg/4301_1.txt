I don't understand why someone does such a movie. From start to finish, this movie is really bad. <br /> <br /> Characters are all very low, terribly acting and completely annoying. There are no signs or drawings under the surfaces. <br /> <br /> "Humor" if you can invite it to an adult audience (I assume that language and nudity) are mostly toilet humor and have problems even with a smile of 16-year-old foams. <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this apology for comedy. It has nothing to please a movie fan. Existing laughs and barely existing plot ask me, "Why is this movie done, why, why, why?" <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing this movie all the time. 100 worst films.
