In 2003, I was astonished by the control of director Antal. His first American project, Vacancy, was a less impressive but decent start. Armored is his second characteristic, and although the visual signature is recognizable, the film never rises above B-level. <br /> <br /> It is a disgrace because all the components of the twists and the ensemble that contains many high quality actors are the main prerequisites. Antal could have made a great movie, but it is getting more and more. Then he could have shot to cool, but it doesn't support this department either. <br /> <br /> What you have left is one incredible situation after another, a group of badly-sketched characters and battling over money. If you look at sharp cinematography, cast and tight music scores, you missed what could have been lower than the average direct video than Van Damme or Seagal. <br /> <br /> This was probably a little disappointing film for me.
