Grandma is definitely one of the worst fear films in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> The script was horrible, so bad I almost wept with some of the things they came out of. The action was almost as bad, they would have been better at playing roles in playing traffic cones (they would have done a better job). The murders were ridiculous, there was no intercourse, the camera's work was ineffective, and the "big" plump at the end was reluctantly inappropriate, it just got worse and worse. <br /> <br /> "Granny" is perhaps one of the most unpleasant crooks caught in the movie, it seems to have a cheap mask from the supermarket (nylon coat caused endless laughter) and frilly nightgown. Would you be afraid of that? I certainly didn't. <br /> <br /> If you like watching bad movies (see Manos, Troll 2, Michael Bay movies ÔÅä), that's black. Those who do not like bad movies and do not like shockingly laughing at a bad conversation, avoid like a plague.
