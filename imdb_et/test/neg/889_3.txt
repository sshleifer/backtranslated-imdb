I'm not sure why the manufacturers had to trade somewhat with the name of a successful movie franchise, because the title suggests it is a sequel to the first three films that it doesn't. Although Marques Houston appeared in HP3, he played a completely different character in this film (he was eight years older). Okay ... so Reid and Martin were not the most talented and could not carry the film, but on the HP franchise, it seems to me that there might have been some reference (albeit insignificant) to earlier films. I'm sure everyone who wanted to see was "hinkwinked" - I thought they saw a sequel - not a completely different movie with a familiar name. And I am sorry ... Kym Whitley is not funny and did not get a candle late in previous films for Robin, Ketty Lester or DC Curry. Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow have important visual deviations ... I have to give it! Naming "Last Minute" would have been OK. In addition, the Hudlin brothers (who made the first three films) did not participate in this film.
