One of the few reasons why these films are is to give some participants a chance to hopefully make better films when they're running, is good. The only good thing about this movie is the actor, three female leaders are better than such horror films. There are 2 scenes that can cause an unexpected jump. <br /> <br /> Young little kids use mine to crawl and open the dynamite to explode mines. When a person causes a collapse, creating a cave for all children becomes zombies. The mine's adults remain dead, there are no reasons why children become carnivores. When they were still alive, they seemed to be caves of innocent caves, so they had to rage about every adult who used them in the mines (the only reason to remember). <br /> <br /> Mom and her 2 daughters go to the land near the mine, with the people of the country who want to build the resort and the other of those horrible people who seem to know exactly what's happening, but no one believes her. <br /> <br /> Something new here, you are ordinary clich√©s, predictable, a lot of negative for this movie, very few positive.
