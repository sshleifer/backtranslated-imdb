Even worse then is the incredibly boring "Emery Rose exorcism". It started properly and until her mother said to her father, "Look, I knew he was in possession," I said to you. It was a terrible line, badly talked about, and it saw the death of this amazingly bad movie. Every family member has a priest from the past. The father begins to accuse all those who love his wife, or to deal with him, which ends with his friend's killing, even when he realizes that his friend had not slept with his wife. People die, others are in possession and most of the viewers no longer care. With the exception of their employee Miguel, none of the characters in this film was really pleasant, so it was difficult to take care of them. Working was terrible and writing worse. Glad I saw it for free; although I feel that for such a film I owe money for the time I lost.
