"Solomon and Sheba" was a movie that you had to look back at in the late 50s when I was a boy: a biblical epic that was remarkable for well-known performers, unusual costumes, many extras and battles. So I went to see it; but I remember that "Solomon and Sheba" didn't impress me at all, which was strange because I had a lot of "Ten Commandments", "Quo Vadis", "Helen of Troy" and others. The thing is, if you are a child, you ignore things that adults don't do (for example, a bad actor), and it's easier for you to love your army with your armor, battles, swords and activities, so if you're not impressed received such a genre. <br /> <br /> This movie, although it has some of these features, is definitely the standard and average. The Hebrew King of Yul Brynner's tree does not appear even when he is strange and half naked Gina Lollobrigida, who dances around him provocatively. He's better and takes acceptable action. George Sanders is not interested in what he does, and Marisa Pavan (Pier Angel's twin sister) does not add any Brynner conscience at all. <br /> <br /> The final sword-duel Brynner and Sanders is just for the plot and has no interest and intensity (all filmed). <br /> <br /> Don't say goodbye to Director Vidor, Solomon, and Sheba, because Ty Power's last unfinished picture is likely to be remembered.
