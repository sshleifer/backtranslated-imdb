It's strictly for Pryori fans. Just because he was a great, funny guy, it doesn't mean it's more than a B-film. The script is terrible, it just tends to be around the ridiculous crime and the prisoners of war. It balances comedy and melodrama and keeps falling on your face, doing it fairly. First of all, is a 30-minute Vietnamese prison war unrealistic? boy playing basketball at one point ... How can you put your audience on the table? ... This prison time is boring, persuasive and already easy to sleep. <br /> <br /> In the United States, this war is considered a hero without any real reason. However, the public has, of course, quickly forgotten about it and seems to be stumbling across all kinds of unpleasant accidents. Or are they really? We'll soon discover. Yawn. There are annoying clich√©s: her sick mother, her little daughter she never judges, the hero falls in love with the hero, and so on. It is very strange how this film is constantly changing from tragedy to shock. Not working at all. In general, it is actually just a comedy and imprisonment. Just because this man was a big stand-up comedian, played in some good movies and died in MS, there is no reason to disrupt this foolish, convincing and unreasonable comedy. But if you like Richard Pryor, he will probably be delighted by reading Dada for 3 hours.
