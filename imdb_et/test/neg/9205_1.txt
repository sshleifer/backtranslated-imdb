Now, I love bad, old skiffs as much as most people. And I understand that the budget is the budget. This means that the Dinosaur planet is as bad as a bad film. It has no participants and only one attractive female they kill two minutes after shore swimming. In this wasted pulp pile, there are literally redemptive qualities. The only thing that wasn't wasted was paper ... the scenario should not be longer than four pages. Certainly no one in the WROTE dialogue is meaningless. I'm surprised that such films have ever been made, much less liberated. I'm just glad I didn't pay for this waste of time. It's 75 minutes of my life when I ever return.
