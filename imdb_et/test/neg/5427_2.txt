Ughh this movie is terrible. Script is stupid and of course it doesn't tell zoey that she doesn't love her !!! Like every episode ... you never understand zoey 101 (see), why is it because Logan's father is acting in SO. And it's just for zoey and is tracking what other characters are. It's always the same in every episode Quinn does and inventing something wrong in the invention misleads and the zoeys brother is always involved. If you haven't seen it, you won't waste this time watching this cuz to waste your time! SMaybe may be interesting for an eight-year-old 8-10, but I imagine that any one of the parents watching this retarded film. But what can we expect from the Nick?
