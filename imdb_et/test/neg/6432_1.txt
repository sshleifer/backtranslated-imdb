I hired this movie out of my local movie shop, but didn't expect anything to flash or fancy. Because it was a Class B movie made from a very tight budget. The scenes that opened the film were quite original and so was the plot and what made me rent the movie. However, the film becomes very boring and frustrating. The story was rich in it, and the actor also had a fair share of disappointments. At the end of the film, I prayed that the higher power would strike me where I put it, because I was extremely bored, but more importantly, how disappointed was the story. I still don't understand what actually happened and I don't care. All in all, the devil cries desperately to know that hell (his domain) was used as the basis for such a filthy movie.
