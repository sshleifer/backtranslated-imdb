Of course I am gone to the movies. Neil Young's Concert "Golden Heart". <br /> <br /> Over the years, there have been many great concert films. Best of all is Martin Scorsese's 'The Last Waltz', which was filmed at Filmore West's last concert. A phenomenal concert and phenomenal film, that is, if you love rock and roll and felt you were born into it and were part of the music and could be in the band if you had a better guitar and someone would have shown you chords and some chords and lyrics or two of you you could change the world ... as you probably think I felt that all five are the bottom of my twenty-four year old soul. <br /> <br /> Neil Young was "The Last Waltz". They had to digitally grab a large hanging cocaine, which had been extruded from the nose, before the digital reality, so that the film had a bright light that was not the Bethlehem star hanging under its lips and nostrils. it is a famous bit of rock and roll history. <br /> <br /> "The Last Waltz" was made when Band and Neil and everyone else were in their thirties and "Heart of Gold" was filmed last year when they are in their sixties and their band looks like they are In the late 1990s, the whole film can be visually used by Christian Right and DEA in the same way as those of Ohio State Patrol Films that were associated with the dangers of drunk driving, used in high school where dying teenagers hanging through windows or wooden hanging or ditched blooded. <br /> <br /> Close your eyes and this is a terrible concert, open them and look at the hidden portrait of Dorian Gray. In the case of the once ethereally beautiful Emmylou Harris, which literally came from the darkness with Nile and the dark light, it seems to be a ring wraith, jumping from the river to Rivendale. Strange, ghostly, nose that does not appear in nature and is not an advertisement for plastic surgery, the eyes that make the buttons of the dolls are viable and the ability to express any emotion, human being or not, limited by unlimited overcrowding in Botox. My mind reeled ... porcupine ... Peruvian ... Jack Daniels ... lives hard decades ... my god ... sweet Emmylou Harris, whom I saw in Fred Boulder for free, the 2000-year-old dead Pharoah disagrees. But the voice, as pure as Boulder's brewed butterfly from Boulder Creek's water, and I closed my eyes and smelled ammmmmbbbererrrrrrrrrgerrrrrrrssss (tribute ... any movie review must be honored ... Fred's hamburgers in Boulder and Steve Martin Pink Panther). <br /> <br /> It would have been a terrible concert that sat in the dark auditorium of Ryman, maybe twenty lines back. But close-up, in close-ups, was a medieval moral game that depicts the horrors of horror and the consequences of sinful life. <br /> <br /> A concert theme adorned with the landscape, A Prairie Wind ... the last song, massive guitars (I thought eight), and wondering if irony is playing. I do not belive. Native American bass player, a leading guitarist who saw and dressed like Buffalo Bill, a piano player whose face looked like a screamer on the face of Munch's The Scream, chick singers (actually matronly singers, mostly reminiscent of one of the lost young parents of United) who are still traveling friendly in the sky) dressed with appropriate full-length denim dresses ... not played directly. <br /> <br /> No one of them, I bet, a powerful wind. <br /> <br /> This is a great CD, and it would be nice to talk about hippie dippy Boulder's stories when they had a long-haired Canadian crown whose unclear words reflected heartbreak and loss, feelings like universal, as they are today. <br /> <br /> But only the dark ribs.
