<br /> <br /> This movie was a bitch! The first was better. No one from the first has come back in this foolish order, and in some way it is good because of bad actions, but the characters in this movie aren't even better. Killjoy in the woods? Come on! Leave me alone! I'm surprised to killjoy friend, Blair's witch didn't come home. Bad behavior, bad story and just silly and boring. DO NOT REMOVE TIME!
