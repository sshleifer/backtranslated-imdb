This is one of those films where I was rooted who could quit the movie fastest. I wanted to see police officers killing Keaton AND Garcia to overcome it. Basically, this is the case - two police have to die and a third must get terribly burned by his face, so that Garcia's son can get a bone marrow transplant from a convicted killer Keaton. Is it worth it? No!
