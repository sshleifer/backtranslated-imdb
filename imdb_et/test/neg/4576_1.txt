I was going to look at the way of thinking because I usually get out of alternative reality from the genre of novels, ie "Sliding Doors", "Me, Me, Me" and so on. <br /> <br /> The worst I've ever seen! I had to sit through it. I didn't even miss out on loans that were unknown to me. <br /> <br /> The magical realism was completely lost because Demi Moore was gloomy and the lovers he had twice were men who usually play villains, although everyone was so sexy and tempting. <br /> <br /> For a double life, a psychological explanation was provided, which was a terrible innovation for The Elektra Complex; maybe magic should not work for this genre. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 28/22/2000)
