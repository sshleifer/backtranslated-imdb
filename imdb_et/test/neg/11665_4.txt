It turned out to be more of a woman's romance-soap-mid-speed than what I hoped was just a tight thriller. Yeah, the last 20 minutes were tense, but much of the previous 75 was just plain annoying. <br /> <br /> Ruter Hauer was a bit too weak, not playing his usual intense character. Natasha Richardson's sport is somewhat awkward, most of the time and her character was very unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The story is so. It's not as bad as I earn, but it's not sure I look again, and the reverse side of this movie, VHS, was misleading.
