Traveling with Miss Galaxy's dispute team, Maximus Powers (Eric Roberts) and Mike Saunders (Charlie Schlatter) are breaking an isolated airplane with Noah's Gulf, protected by Jurassic Pork. While the group is struggling to survive, aliens are primed by monkeys to use the ship to destroy the human race and dominate the planet Earth. <br /> <br /> I like parodies, but "Miss Castaway" is an insult to the human brain. The terrible story and special effects are very, but really very bad. There are spam "Lost", "Castaway", "Jurassic Park", "Sixth Sense", "Titanic", "Apeside Planet", "Lost Ship Raiders", "Congo", "MIB", "Perfect Storm", " Austin Powers, "Jaws", "Impossible Mission", "Third Kind", "Star Wars" and "Hulk", but the problem is that most of them are very stupid and not funny. Finally, the trailer is better than the film. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Missão Quase Impossível" ("Mission Impossible")
