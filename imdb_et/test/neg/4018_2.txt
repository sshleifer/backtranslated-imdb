If you are always used twice with Lana Turner and compare it with this low budget, low talent, low quality movie, I was just embarrassed by East Lupino's 'singing' (more like talking) and not piano games. When the first non-singing scene started and all the people just looked at him firmly, I was positive that they all started to roll and start their eyes or at least talk to each other (he stinks, let's get out of here). The actors are flat - emotions are emptied. And East is a real corrupted bi-otch - it's just a 100% launch. It was like Betty Boop's conscious sedation that corresponds to a petrol station somewhere. The story was flat, the music was flat, the actor was flat, his chest was ... never. I felt sad for the rest of the participants. Perhaps, if the right actor had been given a leading role and men's actors had more emotions, the film would have been an opportunity. We apologize for the violation of those who thought it was out of this world. I wouldn't have thought it was out of this world.
