"Bland" is probably the word I would use to describe this movie. I only looked at it because there was a good rating here and I was so I let down. <br /> <br /> In principle, the film about racism on September 11th in America, and the director went to it with a migratory herd! There were no nuances in the movie, and it seemed like they were trying to make the film look like Magnolia - it's never a good idea, because this movie was three hours of tedium and confusion just to make it fall frogs at the end ... <br /> <br /> All in all, there is tremendous disappointment.
