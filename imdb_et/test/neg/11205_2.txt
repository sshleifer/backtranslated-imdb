Look, this movie is terrible ... "The plot" includes twins who have been neglected by their self-absorbed parents, and are leaving in the order of the babysitters and babysitters all the kids are going to be completely uncomfortable. Finally, the child engineer ex-convicted Beverly D'Angelo to be their new babysitter. And D'Angelo looks at TV shows about selling children and decides he's trying to sell twins ... and well, oh, you don't want to know. It's all very unpleasant and not at all funny. In fact, the announcer slipped this movie before he came to the TV channel, which I watched! Just do not worry about your life in this trash bin at once, look?
