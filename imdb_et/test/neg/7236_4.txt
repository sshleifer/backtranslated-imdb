This is the Octopus sequel. <br /> <br /> Pff ... OK. A lot of stock footage, but pretty good. I'm surprised that they actually had a giant robot octopus that wasn't really that bad! I was actually quite surprised. <br /> <br /> The movie was just fun. It never explained how the octopus was so big and never tied to the first one. But it was still fun. <br /> <br /> The end of me and my friend laughed. Basically, after the octopus blowing once, the two main characters launch the bomb and the screen displays five explosions, most stock materials! We joked that they went to the dollar store and bought "five rockets in one" toy! Believe me, it must be believed! Generally just stupid fun. It is worth giving the opportunity to buy when it is cheap.
