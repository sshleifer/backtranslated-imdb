Amazing documentary. Louis Kahn's son, who saw only a small amount of his father in his childhood because he was only a member of a family of three fathers, assumes more responsibility for his father to learn more about his architecture and his life. It sounds like the idea of ​​documentaries, but it gets flat and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the main problem is that Kahn's son Nathaniel is not just one of the main characters of the film - he is also a director, writer, producer, interviewer and narrator. Nathaniel seems both too inexperienced and too close to the material to work well in these roles. What's more, although he seems to be a nice enough guy, he doesn't have much of a screen, so the fact that he's the only constant is to wear. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel also meets an unprepared and amateur interviewer - there are several points where the interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement, and the camera cuts Nathaniel's shot, offering little more than an empty foam and a sort of "uh-huh" fear, as if he were a little panic, he had to say something in response. Sometimes I felt embarrassed to look at people who could say really interesting things about Kahn (or at least better things with their time) that they seem to realize they were in the hands of the interviewer who relied on them to direct the conversation. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel's double role as a documentary as well as a lost son seems to do more than hurt the film. One seems to say that some of the interviewees do not really want to open up the negative aspects of Kahn's personality and career, probably because it is not clear to Nathaniel whether he wants to complain about the truth or just wants to hear beautiful stories from his father - preferably those who affirm his hope that his father cares more about Nathaniel and his mother than likely. His passive approach as an interviewer can be directly derived from this conflict. The only person in Nathaniel is her mother, but these conversations tend to feel a bad teen drama (are you not, mom?)) And do not offer much help in understanding our (or Nathaniel) Kahn or the loyalty she pulled out of the surrounding people. <br /> <br /> What the film is in desperate need is an experienced and independent hand, not to rule out Nathaniel, but to balance her subjectivity and inexperience. is left out of the material, considering more thinking about what the interviewees could give, and hopes that it will cut out those parts of the document process that just don't work like a strange segment with a man who claims to see Kahn. die (which made it seem like Nathaniel had just redeemed) or a whole bit of Kahn's first cousin who had nothing to add to Kahn or Nathaniel. or a stranger near the Kahn building button to tell them that his father was a designer. (Ahhh? Huh. Thaat is great, sir. Umm? I have to go now.) I understand why these things can be important to Nathaniel and that showing the documentary process is sometimes interesting, but this is one example of when the documentary may be too personal. <br /> <br /> I thought the score for the movie was great! (But one of the most wonderful moments for me was when Kahn quoted a quote to compare architecture and Beethoven's fifth symphony during a tour of the Kimball Art Museum. Beethoven's ninety symphony, bug? Accident? Who knows? That made me laugh.) <br /> <br /> Kahn was a great architect and it is clear that he was an unusual person and had an intriguing story of life. There's definitely a good documentary. It is wise for Nathaniel to look for a father he didn't know, but I'm not sure if this is an interesting story. Not so well in this movie.
