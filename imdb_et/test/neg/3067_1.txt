OUCH, There is nothing else to say. This movie made me commit suicide. Among the big fans that are zombie movies, I found that this is probably the worst attempt I've ever made. The movie never looked NOW! Whatever it was, I feel hopeless and lost. It was so bad that I didn't even justify it anymore. I'm just gonna stick in the closet. Now I tried to submit my comment, but the server only accepts comments that are ten or more lines. So here it goes ... Bad, horrible, not where it's close enough. NO TITS !!!!!! How do you have a zombie movie without tits. In fact, the female lead was one of the hell and the only reason I finished the film was to get a glimpse at random. FAST! Of course, there was one line that deserves to be mentioned, a line I look forward to using myself for a while (if I just feel the need to hit my face) "That hog can't smoke" This movie is bad, so bad.
