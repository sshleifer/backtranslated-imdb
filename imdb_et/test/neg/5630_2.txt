RIDDLE was written and directed by Brendan Foley in what seems to be an attempt to draw the secrets of Charles Dickens' novels into a contemporary story, but this test is hampered by the choice of using two time formats during which "the mystery is open. In spite of the well-known actors, trying their best to pull it out straight into the DVD movie, the final product is a long, tedious and amateurish confusion that can only be considered entertained if the viewers are otherwise fans. movies. <br /> <br /> Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) is a journalist who confines himself to reporting dog racing events while dreaming of important reporting tasks. A series of similar murders includes an old friend Mike's - Sadie (Vera's Day), who runs a pub on the banks of the Thames, having just discovered Charles Dickens' old valuable unpublished manuscript and having a golden heart of sandwiches for such pathetic creatures as the old tramp beachcomber (Derek Jacobi). Sadie's murder attracts Mike to the role of detective journalism, and with the help of police officer Kate (Julie Cox), he begins to tie up the research tips he finds while reading the Dickens manuscript. Stopping the flow of this rather simplified story is the use of setbacks to Dickens' time when Dickens (again Derek Jacobi) talks about a rather personal story of special murders. The parallels between baptism and the baptism of actors may have worked in another, but the finishing of such a business flees from the writer / director Brendan Foleys. He draws the story close to (finally) the end of a tired Hollywoodesque. <br /> <br /> In addition to Jones, Jacobo, Cox and the day, the film somehow attracted the attention of Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng, PH Moriarty and Mel Smith: their stakes are minimal, but they are disturbingly happy. This is a little bit of a syrup that leaves the viewer wondering how the films of this quality will find funding. Grady Harp
