I watched this movie last night, I'm a big fan of the book, and I was quite pleased with the version that Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon celebrated. But it's just terrible. Oh, God, I don't understand how they dared to rip this classic story and made those characters completely different, starting with changing Beth's younger sister and making Amy third. And his interpretation, terrible, Jo was a feminist, intelligent and confident angry young lady, and the actor in her film is like a foolish and very annoying little girl. And what about Laurie's war? I'm OK with the fact that when a book is made for a movie, some changes have to be made, but not the whole story is rewritten. very very bad.
