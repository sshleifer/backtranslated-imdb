This movie moved too slowly to my taste. The concept of story is refreshingly different from studying family dynamics to live with a family member with intellectual disabilities in a way I haven't seen on the screen before. Fulfillment of the concept was wrong. Every character was fully developed in his first appearance scene, then he had to endure the feeling that every character spent the rest of his way. This means that every character has a discomfort in his / her human relationships. relationships with others in the film I find to be an emotional and social retardation form. I think this is an artistic value given the irony that the story focuses on an intellectually slowed person surrounded by average intelligence friends and family. But the action was exceptionally well done. I agree with other reviewers that cinema was beautiful. All in all, I think the film has a strong artistic value because of the fine. cinema and cinematography, but it fails because of the shortcomings described at the emotional level.
