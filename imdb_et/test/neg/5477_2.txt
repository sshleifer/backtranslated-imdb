It should have been a moody, sharp, film that remained in memory as a public relations exposition where the dominant personality survives only because the dominant personality does not see the hope of change. <br /> <br /> Action was intense and skillful, dialogue worked, but the film was irritatingly ineffective: too many distances, which referred to a lack of focus rather than a broader picture. Poor flow. The first 5 minutes could have been omitted at all. <br /> <br /> I suspect that with a different edit, this movie would have been convincing. <br /> <br /> In its current form, it is flat, formless and extremely disappointing.
