He has very good music and performances; Kid Creole and Coconuts, James White and Black, DNA, Tuxedo Moon, Plastics, Melle Mel, Vincent Gallo, Lydia Lunch etc. But beyond that, there's not much more to it. The dialogue, especially narration (Saul Williams), is actually pretty good, but the performances are all pretty nice or bad, no matter how many hipsters are thrown; Debbie Harry and Jean Micheal Basquit (the latter being the lead) both still lack enough culture to keep this movie novel. This is about the spontaneity of Jack Kerouac's style of racing, but he does not realize that it is moving, which is where the band's performances come in. I think this is fairly balanced between music and bad behavior, and I didn't like it, but I was expecting more. Although he has the end of a fairy tale.
