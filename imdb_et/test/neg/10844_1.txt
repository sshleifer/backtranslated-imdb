This is a strong suggestion for anyone reading this review, who has never seen Total Reality, don't waste their time and money to rent this poor apology for the movie. This is the single worst single film I have ever seen in my life. I had a nightmare of this movie since I saw it. Action was terrible and every amateur filmmaker can make a more decent film. The film obviously hangs much higher sci-fi movies, such as TimeCop or Total Recall (where the title seems to be derived). Sorry, but I think looking at the cardboard box is two hours more entertainment. If you have already seen this movie, I feel sorry for you that I did what I did.
