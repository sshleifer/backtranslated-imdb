Watching this movie made me wonder why Universal had exported such films? They had all the classic horror movies with great movies. The dawning of the atomic age led to the attack of the films of giant creatures. Spiders, ants, praying mansion. With deadly Mantis, we have a giant praying mansion that flies around the Arctic, scares the Eskimo and is hunted by the armed forces. The mistake reaches the tunnel in New York, where the soldiers finally destroy it. Of course, it's all much more observable, looking at it in MST. Who thought it was a good idea to start a movie?
