This film seems a little clumsy around the edges, as it wasn't quite enough if it had to be. But I enjoyed it mostly. <br /> <br /> Style is more than a little inconvenient, so your viewing experience should have no expectation of "something real". Check your brain at the door. This is not necessary and may be an obstacle otherwise. <br /> <br /> I liked Clennon's performance as a real Dr. Baird. His role was to give Aykroyd's character to the main character. What the real Dr. Baird was. <br /> <br /> And Matthau was pretty good as a token. Disruptive at first, but finally lovable. In some sense. Something similar. Or at least something that would have to be used with soap and plenty of water would have been more useful. <br /> <br /> Is it really worth checking out? If you're in the mood to redeem a psychiatric profession, why not.
