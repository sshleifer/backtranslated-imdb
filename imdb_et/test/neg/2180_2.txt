It should be Charlie's masterpiece, but I say it's actually one of his weakest films. First, it's not funny. Not one thing in this film was laughing. Okay, it's a quick jump to the box that was strangling, but it was desperate. Tramp's first and only speaker where he speaks (he sings in an earlier movie), but his confident dialogue shows us exactly why he was so happy to watch "Modern Times" and "Gold Rush" - two movies that are at least ten times better than this movie. In this film, there is literally only one good scene where Hitler plays with the world like a beach ball. That's right. <br /> <br /> Okay, so it gets a lot of praise for being the first winning movie, even long before the war. No. Not true. It's just not true that praise can be rejected a bit. The Three Stooges did it on 19 January 1940 with "You Natzy Spy" - ten months earlier than the Chaplin movie's October edition - and this movie was actually funny! If you want to watch Chaplin's biggest movie, just look at it for reference. And then pop "Modern Times", "Gold Rush", "City Lights", "Limelight", "Kid" or even "Tillie's Revised Romance".
