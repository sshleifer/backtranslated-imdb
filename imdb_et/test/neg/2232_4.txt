If it is considered an independent line, I can't say it's bad at all, but from where I go, and the original "Lady and Tramp" don't agree with each other! These are two completely different movies with different styles, different vocal qualities, different narratives, and the only thing they share with each other are the visuals (such as Jimi's expensive city, Darling, the lady and the tram) and none of them If you've been looking for any continuity years after the original was released to them for memorable songs like "Bella Notte" and "The Siamesse Cats Song", this sequel will not give you at all! Almost every song has a little butt and these good old characters like Jock and Reliable, Jim Kallis and Darling and Aunt Sarah and her cats are good to see, but they seem to be somehow replaced with new letters, not to mention Peg, whose voices are pretty annoying. Even Lady and Tramp don't seem often enough and like Scamp? He's so spoiled! And he treats his father Trampot completely unfairly, then runs away without regret even after he has left home! And they called their shameless escape for adventure! I'd say Scott Wolf really brought out a malicious bad boy Scampis, wiping out a typical cute Disney animal. Even the old characters force you to lead this madness; Reliable sounds like Goofy sick in bed, Jock (Jeff-stupid-Bennett) - and his VOICE - no sound neither Scottish nor listen! Zap her away as far as you can to free our poor ears from her voice and like a fool, feathers burned, EXASPERATING JUNKYARD DOGS !!!!!! Someone put them !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> "Lady and Tramp 2" is not entirely bad if you are not yet a tough day, but I'm looking forward to much more charm for the true classic - Scamp is chavvy, so is her girlfriend Angel and is weak storyline. However, I think you should try it at least once, because as I say, it is much worse in movies.
