Ru Paul plays Starrbooty. He competes with the other pusher queen to fight evil Annaka Manners (Candis Cayne) and get her kidnapped brother back ... or something like that. Seriously - I had trouble concentrating on the plot! The film is probably seen by someone with a serious ADD - a fast camera that reduces the stop, making it impossible to focus on anything. Dialogue is sometimes incomprehensible and when you hear it, you want it to be incomprehensible! Actually, it's really OK, except for Ru Paul, who goes beyond the embarrassing degree. The film is also full of disgusting bathroom humor, which is just sober and not even funny. After 30 minutes I had to leave because I was bored, sick and just couldn't tolerate it anymore. I'm proud to sit through something, but it went beyond my limits! People compare it to John Waters' early work. I disagree. Water work is sick, but good - it's just sick. Avoid.
