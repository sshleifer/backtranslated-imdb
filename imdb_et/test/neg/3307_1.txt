OK, so he has no caller ID. If you are accused, you GET IT! And no cell phone? If you are accused, ONE will be if you are one of the few full-time parents who is the head of the household who does not already have it. This mother gets a big zero in the parent's department. So her mother is in the hospital and she decides that her shopping trip will help her out. Just a stupid movie. I'm glad that I have a Tivo and FF button far away. And with a 10-line minimum, I don't have much to say about such a bad movie. I think I can ask why he opens packages that he has no idea who they are from. The son also didn't add much to the movie. Police officers were also big zeros. Now get to the nearest Verizon and get a mobile phone. @@
