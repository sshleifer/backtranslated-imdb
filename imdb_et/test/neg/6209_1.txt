There was no 0 in the voting option, so I was forced to use the next available number. <br /> <br /> This is a sad day for boolean when there are no other types of movies with star images than the number of minors and terrible scripts. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a Hitch clone anywhere. Salman Khan's usual start-you-shirt theme and Govinda's in-humorous laughs. If someone had said two decades ago that I was writing a comment about Salman (after his success with Maine Pyar Kiya), I would have written it.
