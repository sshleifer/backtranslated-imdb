I've seen "professional" comments claiming that Julia Roberts is playing "smart and very funny". I don't think so. An actor who plays himself? And doing it with the same common dizziness when trying to try comedy? Tell the Hollyweird Narcissism in the most extreme way. Why he just doesn't stand and go, "I, I, I. Look at me!" The director and writer should be kicked off to not think right if it could have been a charming sequel. And by the way, Steven, when the audience begins to pay more attention to strange corners of the camera, is a story that has a problem. Capra, Hitchcock, used some creative cameras, but they were talented enough that they didn't lose the audience or just show with the camera. You seem to have forgotten the cardinal rule of "style". Pitt and Zeta Jones's chemistry is pretty good, maybe if they'd focused on the film around them and gave up the narcissus it might have worked on. Zeta Jones once again shows her more talent and beauty than Roberts could dream of. Unfortunately, this movie is wasting talent and not able to run on many accounts. I want my money back.
