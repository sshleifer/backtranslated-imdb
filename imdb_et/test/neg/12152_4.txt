Native Mongolian speakers lacked emotion and pressure. He used too many non-native speakers, especially Jamukha. Too many deviations from actual history. Terrible terrible subtitle !!! I don't know where and who did this subtitle. It was in both English and Thai. I don't know how bad the subtitles are in Thai if English subtitles were so bad! Described as one of the greatest leaders in life is very uninteresting. The films made by Mongolian directors have been very low in the 1980s. Honestly, I mean, are the film critics of the Academy Award mild or what? The only good thing in some fighting scenes was some good CGI only moderately ... not over CGI
