The only reason I gave it to the "Masters of Horror", rather than having 1 of two, is that the two leading participants are good and VHS did not do so. The story, dialogue and plot are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Talking / driving zombies who come back to vote and keep the political rise against the war! Leave me alone! What's next, zombies who come back to go for a stepping stone? Maybe zombies who return to host QVC? <br /> <br /> I never supported the war in Iraq, but I support the courage and sacrifice of men and women in our armed forces; and "Homecoming" was disrespectful of the fact that it blocked the real horror of war. <br /> <br /> Since zombies are massively produced in today's market, it is a zombie entertainment SPAM. How "Homecoming" made this "horror masters" over me.
