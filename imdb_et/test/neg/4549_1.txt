It must be one of the WORST movies I've seen. I tried to like this movie, but they managed to confuse almost every single aspect of this movie! Inexpensive dialogue, character formation, no tension, not enough story to pull you in. They seem to have tried some things in the kit and said to each other, "Hey, this seems pretty cool, why not put it in", after which the director probably said, "Yes ... YEAH this is a genius!" and got back to coke or something. Acting, I think the only person TRIED did is Daan Schuurmans, but in the end it is nothing. Reason for this movie SUCKS !! 2/10
