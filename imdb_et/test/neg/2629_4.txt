Four young girls in classical school feel the murder of one of their classmates during the time they thought they were just an innocent game. The killer is a strange young boy named Milo Jeeder. Sixteen years later, four survivors of the event united in a happier environment in the same city where it happened. They believe Milo drowned in the river shortly after the murder, but soon find out that the demonic killer Milo has also returned, still a young boy, unchanged for almost two decades. <br /> <br /> The cover of this movie makes it very cool (but I thought it would be bad movies). When I put my player in the DVD, the menu appears and it still makes the movie cool. Unfortunately, this movie is not everything he was excited about. The film is your average test of Slasher's film and when I say the average, I mean just like any other low-budget movies that are mostly blessed with open weapons in most of the horror members (I'm talking about you, a spooky fan). In other words, you can walk with any horror blower and most of the answers would be "it sucks". <br /> <br /> What kind of mistakes did the film make? First of all, the DVD cover design makes Milo really dark, but it captures everything, showing its face in the movie in many different scenes. He had the potential to be very amazing. Secondly, the backside tells Freddy, Jason, Chucky, etc., to pack their bags and move on, because Milo is so much better ... why do you want to say something like this is not a -name, a low budget movie that probably failed ? This means that it simply raises your expectations of the movie, making it harder for you. In the last trench to attract attention, he says (in very big characters) "Anaconda Creator". Just shows you how low they pay as much attention to the film as possible. <br /> <br /> The movie's mood sucks, the director gives you some horrible angles when Milo attacks anyone. Music is not so bad and I never fell asleep during the movie (congratulations). I'm still trying to figure out what Milo really is. My best bet would be that he's a zombie, if anyone else knows, tell me. You can be sure that I will not lose sight of it.
