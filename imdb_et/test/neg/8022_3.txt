Three young college women, Simona (Iva Krajnc), Alja (Tanja Potocnik) and Zana (Pia Zemljic), go to the Kolpa River, which shares their Slovenian neighbor, Croatia, with the 2002 Slovenian film Maya Weiss. What could have been a well-known and exciting 1972 Deliverance Eastern European version, for me, turned out to be a completely unicircular image of flat characters that denied sympathetic identification with characters. <br /> <br /> Alja and Zana are not convincing students at all, although Alja expresses a desire to be a writer and both use what I thought was too bad. Alja is bored with a girlfriend and she seems to be just living. Zana, even less scientific, is a self-absorbing adventure seeker with an interest in other women. I had some sympathy for relatively innocent Simona, conservative and stars. These three travel ideas just don't work for me. The disappointment that Zana and Alja are showing Simona doesn't make sense - why would they choose her travel companion to start so firmly that they need to know their behavior and attitudes? <br /> <br /> Three start a ruthless journey on a river on two canoes, which is not about a newsletter about the disappearance of a woman by the river. Things are getting tougher than the mysterious appearance of rabidly conservative fishermen's policy (Jonas Znidarsic), sometimes real and sometimes hallucinatory. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the scenes of the river and small villages in the trio village. This may be due to a lack of cultural understanding, but the film did not change me otherwise. I was surprised that the film has won some awards.
