This film was a collapse that went on forever, but never. It was just a boring look, so I could never really get into it. This film is not a horror film by the imagination, the video tape cover made it one. Instead, it is a thriller-type film with some elements of fear that make the movie more interesting. Of course, it doesn't help the movie at all. Most of all I remember is that this movie was similar to the 1970's movie "The Deep". A bunch of treasures, competing groups of this type. Here, too, there are supernatural turns, but to tell the truth, I was so bored when I looked at the film I put out into a zone, so I can't really tell what supernatural elements were. I remember the footprints on the seabed, so maybe it was a dead walk or maybe I mean instead of Lucio Fulcio's "Zombie" movie, it was a horror film created on a tropical island and as extreme as it was that movie was a lot more interesting. That day we learned a valuable lesson, never rented a movie based on his cover art.
