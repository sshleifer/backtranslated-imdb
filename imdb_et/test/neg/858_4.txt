"The Duke" is a film located in the heart of British aristocracy, where an old duke dies (John Neville) and avoids his great wealth and enormous wealth that he will die after 2 deadly aristocrats (Oliver Muirhead and Sophie). Hey man); she goes to her girl's dog. The "best friend" of the dog, an American girl named Charlotte (played by Courtnee Draper) whose parents die, has been orphaned by the former Duke, because she is her great uncle. The young chef Florian arrives, with whom he and Charlotte instantly combine the creation of a romantic sub-block, which in its own way acts as a basic piece that is Hubert, Duke and his many activities and love interests with other dogs. This is followed by James Doohan, who plays Butler, who has decided to try and serve his old duke by doing his best to serve his new master Hubert. Doohan acts as a parent there to look after and advise the younger while he looks and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master. The result of fine comedy mixed with drama elements to end the fine and influential actor career. <br /> <br /> Although this movie doesn't like the movie from a technical point of view, I was just looking at the role of James Doohan. While the plot is good, the elements of writing and managing must be hidden. Ignoring the absurdity of "Doggie Duke", I don't like personal and resentful jokes over "bad" characters because of their ridicule. Dependence on hygiene-related humor, as you like, is too obvious and the general stupidity of many characters doesn't like me. Director, Phillip Spink uses too much over-emphasized voice with too long a frame or affects the overall sound quality. Plus, the action of Muirhead and Heyman, although it is dramatic and romantic, drops drastically, fulfilling the wholesale requirements imposed on the role. <br /> <br /> But as a mature film fan, I have a simple look at the ultimate critical of a simple family film that is meant to laugh. I can admit that I found some bits of fun and other bits that touch the plot, which may be far removed, but have fixed connections. I don't recommend this movie to mature movie fans, but I highly recommend it to dog lovers, families who want to enjoy a funny movie for their child, and James Doohan fans who want to see their "final role".
