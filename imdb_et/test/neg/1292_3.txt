I'm sorry, but this movie is just low for me. Here is Perez's taxi dancer with boy Keitel, who is trying to make this actress. First, what the hell is a taxi dancer? Even after sitting, I still don't know. Oh yeah, Perez also inspires DeLorenzo to follow him like a lovesick puppy. There is no reason behind love, it just happens. There are times when characters and events are really trying to pull their hearts, but rarely works. The only sign you really know is the character of Keitel and that's just because he does a good job. All other actors and characters would have been like others. <br /> <br /> The script is basically an uninspired transformation of how difficult it is to act as an actor / actor. It has been done and said before, sounds and the dialogue sounds like it is written in the street pimp. The end is ... well, I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say it's not happy. I would be upset if the story was good. Management is average, but nothing really wonderful, but something that is really painful to look at. The only thing that makes something worth watching is Keitel. Although I could have lived without her underwear underwear in the tiger. <br /> <br /> Yes, Eddie Bunker will appear. As random as it is mentioned, it's as casual as in the movie. And Tarantino makes his director in favor of a friend, showing up for about 20 seconds.
