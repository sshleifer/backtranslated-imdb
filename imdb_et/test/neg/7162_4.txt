This is a fine concept and Brando's acting is a good job. Dean Martin is not bad and Montgomery Clift is also pretty good. Unfortunately, this is a very inseparable, very long piece that should have been closer to two hours (almost 3 hours). <br /> <br /> We observe the life of the third man of 1938 after the end of World War II and see if they discover who they are and what they can get when they discover both the world and what they have done . For some, it is the women in their lives who bring it to life, for others they are wider in general. Too often I found myself what just happened or which scene to import.
