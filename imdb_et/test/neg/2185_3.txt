This movie starts from A and never reaches B. Its title promises much more than film. It is superficial and full of ordinary story clich√©s in which a man doubts his sexuality. People are pleasant, even obligatory terrible. Lead (Kevin McKidd) crosses if he has reason to act at all. Simon Callow, who plays horny straight, is always worth watching and is by no means the only reason to stay with the film. But the "meditation" of his group of men, or whatever they grow, are extremely tiring in the short order. They seem to have been thrown into lightweight blends of the film, trying to change and not stop the device. The same comment applies to a very strange and convincing camping trip. Don't worry about stopping the tape so you can have a snack. Let's go; you won't miss anything. The character of Hugo Weaving is superfluous. He appears in the sequence with one of the smallest drivers and does not even match the rest. The result of this sequence is not explained and Hugo's real estate transactions have nothing to say. The film is finally a total disappointment because there is no resolution. The thing just disappears and we send the closed credit. It is a structure that has no structure.
