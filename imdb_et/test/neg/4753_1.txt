This item does not contain a spoiler. It doesn't have to. The film is as predictable as sunrise. The element of the first foreign film was that something could happen. It was so on the first two Predator films, though less common. Requiem has completely removed the temporary element and replaced it with blood and gore. You know people are dying (well, this is the AvsP movie), but you know that WHO dies and when they die, and WHERE they die before it happens. Directors should learn from Hitchcock, who said, "The thrill is not a time bomb that goes under the table. The thrill is a bomb that is NOT under the table." What is the point of going to the movie, if you know exactly what will happen and when? If you really want to watch this movie, wait until it appears on the video and then rents it, but never ever buy it.
