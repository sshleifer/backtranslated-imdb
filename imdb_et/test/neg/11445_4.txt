A young woman, Jodie Foster, knows the mafia murder, reports the killing to the local police, and is a target for mobile men. The professional killer, Mafia-hired Dennis Hopper, hits him to prepare for the hit, but eventually he falls for him. Then, as the Stockholm Syndrome parody, which defines the case when a kidnapped hostage likes to co-operate with a kidnapper, Jodie Foster also falls on his abductor, loves and both are preparing to escape. <br /> <br /> Denis Hopper, an actor, is trying to drive himself with Dennis Hopper's creative ambitions. The result is disappointment and cannot keep up with the artistic level of Dennis Hopper. There is no real excitement and the script is sometimes naive and predictable. The film is recorded to some extent by the performance of Jodie Foster, who is not his best but shines with his talent, beauty and gift. With a historical interest, Vincent Price's short look and little act of Charlie Sawn, known for his great part in Wall Street. <br /> <br /> If you decide to spend a 116 minute movie, it is not a complete loss; this movie offers easy entertainment, but we look much easier at the "Easy Rider" director and actors who gave us the character of Sarah Tobias "The Accused".
