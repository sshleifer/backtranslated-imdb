I can't believe I spent it in almost three hours. It has to be one of the most unbelievable, predictable and cheesy telephones I've seen for a long time. I was hoping for some good special effects and activities, instead I spent all the time rolling my eyes and yelling "OH COME ON !!!" on the screen. Dialogue is low and obvious, sometimes tense, and when the story moves, it's not just funny how it all happens at the same time ... Not to mention the obvious and nausea end ... now seeing more than my part of the catastrophe movies, I'm really a big fan and think that they can often take away unrealistic things when it is fun, but that is certainly not the case. It's just an insult to intelligent viewers everywhere. What did they think about making this movie ?????
