I love Ben Kingsley and Tea Leon. But this is just the worst film I've seen in ten years, and I see my part of the movies. Stinker. This is a bad idea of ​​a badly performed movie. Something about this is not funny, reliable or interesting. I was looking for smart, irony and real humor. Instead, it seemed that most of the cast members were making their way to Leon. It is too bad if such an acting talent is wasted on such a cavity. Do not worry. I have to think about the opinion of the filmmakers to the audience that they would come up with the idea that Polish gangsters in NY will send a contract killer to San Francisco to get a body assistant at AA meetings. Bill Pullman should start reading scripts before he agrees to participate in the movie. Sad.
