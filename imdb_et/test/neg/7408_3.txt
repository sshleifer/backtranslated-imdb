I'm not sure what it is, but it seems to be some curse when it comes to movies about the big Bigfoot. There is still no film that intelligently approaches the subject and does not make any real relationship. Both "Legend of Boggy Creek" (1972) and the first film "Sasquatch" (1978) have become small cult classic, but neither of them was very memorable. Both films were aimed at a family-friendly audience, thus preventing them from actually scaring anyone. "Harry & The Hendersons" (1987) was the first big budget movie that used Bigfoot, along with Rick Baker's superb creature. But they also decided to target younger audiences, but this time with comedy (like "Bigfoot" in 1995). I've been waiting for a long time for someone to deal with this issue as a thriller, perhaps in the "jaws" or "predator" veins. When I saw it in my local video store, I thought my dream was fulfilled. Boy, I was wrong! Lance Henriksen plays a billionaire who will lead an expedition to the Pacific Ocean hopefully to find his daughter when he was on a small plane when he fell into the mountains. The assumption is interesting and promising. The truth is that it never builds any real tension. I've never been interested in any characters at all, because each of them was very two-dimensional and quite boring. Even believing Henriksen always seems to be calling in his performance. Every time he appears on the screen, he usually looks bored. He should be, because there is no need to talk about the first hour of the movie. What is the creature I start with? At least I thought we could have a cool view that runs around in the woods, but instead we get it bald (yes, I said "bald!") A man with dark black skin and furs here and there. Picture of the cross between "Swamp Thing" and Chaka "Lost of the Lost" and you get an idea. Nothing like works on the cover image, I assure you. Sloppy editing and negligent direction also adds confusion to half the time when everything seemed to be sequential, while the other half of that film was used continuously with their long, slow fading (which was not worth any or any purpose). They even stole the entire infrared vision of the P.O.V "Predator" creature, which just seemed too silly and inappropriate to be effective. Perhaps all this proves that Hollywood should simply forget that it is trying to make Bigfoot movies because they haven't done what it does. So far, everyone has been as scary as the "In Search Of" 3/10 episode
