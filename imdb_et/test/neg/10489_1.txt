I'm a fan of bad horror movies from the 1950s and 60s - both ridiculous and foolish movies that they're good at laughing. So, it's natural to choose this movie - especially because it was practically bad with John Agar. Unfortunately, although it was a bad movie, it was the worst type of bad movies - incredible and unsuccessful. At least with foolish and general bad movies, you can laugh at terrible monsters and terrible directions and action. Here you will never see that much of the monster (mainly because of the darkness of the print) and the actor, while the bad, are worse than bad energy ... hopeless and dull. <br /> <br /> The film starts with some young adults who go to the hollow neck of Satan. Well, given the name of the place, it is not surprising if it is later found to be chewed! Don't let Satan hollow! Well, it is known that the sky is some kind of crash, so what do teenagers go? Yes, throw a dance party - a very, very slow dance party where children dance almost slowly. So it is the task of the sheriff (Agari) and his men to ensure that teenagers can dance in peace without fear of mastering. <br /> <br /> For Monster, this is a guy in a gorilla suit with a silly mask - a bit like the monster ROBOT MONSTER. Not exactly original and not just high technology. To make it worse, it makes it chewing and moving very, very slowly - so slowly that even the most casual teenager could easily cross it! How it can kill repeatedly is behind me. <br /> <br /> Generally it is too weak, even if you are a fan of a cinema fan.
