While I was voting, I was going to give 2, but when I saw 1 was terrible, he hit the nail head. The depiction of North Americans as thirsty wild blood is deeply disturbing to me. This is the third film I've seen in D.w. Griffiths, where men's races are stereotypical in stupid directions. The man can't tell his story, so I'm trying to prevent Mr. Griffith from attacking. In my opinion, the three films were likely to affect millions of people and the children of their children. Such films are probably made with many fools that are still associated with us. Some may say that the camera's work was great, this is the first thing. negative, it's like someone who takes you $ 10 and gives me back to make up for it.
