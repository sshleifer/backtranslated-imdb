The characters are annoying, immature and flaky .... Madison is the most annoying. OOH ... the cold spot! Such a terrible threat! The ghost of every house would have escaped in self-defense! Long story short, this movie is boring. Seeing a chair in a flying chair can be horrible, but it's as intriguing as it gets. I watched it once, and when one of my kids wanted to watch it again, I was tempted to put a baseball bat on the television instead of looking at the garbage again. If you want a good horror movie or even a comedy, it's not! The only good part of the whole thing was the "roach scene" and at the end of the movie you came for a spunk!
