It may be that the film I saw was completely different from what others saw, but since the participants are the same, I can only think that I saw a cut in Europe differently from circulating in the US. Anyway, it was the worst movie I saw in the last five years. (Watch more about Waterboy ...) <br /> <br /> Why: Since I think this director has taken elements from all the previous thrillers, mixed them up, put wrong music in the wrong order, and (Examples: nothing happens, music is scary, and nothing happens. "Dirty" officer us in a dirty way so that the actor would hit all the classrooms - a friend-time that doesn't come out of the end, is an inevitable scene, and in the next scene all the problems are gone.) <br /> <br / > If you want to see a smart movie, see Memento. If you want to see a better thriller, check out any pleasant thriller. If you want to see Patrick Swayzet: see Dirty Dancing.
