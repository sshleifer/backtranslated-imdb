This is one of the worst films I've seen for years. Style has a potential that is never realized. Actors are a bad choice, but given their screen writing, their talents are not wasted. I really wanted everyone to die as soon as possible so I could get out and see something else. Unfortunately, I was left to the end and smiled at the murmurs of those people who were drunk, how it was. There was no bow, it was England, just gently moaning how it was. Then I look at IMDb and see that 288 people have given it to 10 out of 10 people. I don't really see how these people can give this score. They must be a PR company that works with a distributor. At the end of the movie, there is a fun problem when looking at the vicious landscape touched by the cemetery and the hick attacks (if it should be brick) - the blood factors are Waaaay OTT - the film feels like everybody, the director fears.
