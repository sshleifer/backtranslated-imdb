I really enjoyed the first movie and when he thought again, thought or checked, I took a family of friends to watch it. I was ashamed that I was so pleased about it. <br /> <br /> Disney processed the original text as a tasty food by treating the human body - takes something good and turns out ... well, you know. And if the FBI has a dark-skinned person, the informant's fingerprint results were modest. <br /> <br /> Assuming this is an isolated movie, it's not too bad if he likes this strange sort of thing, but when you read the book or see the first movie - terrible!
