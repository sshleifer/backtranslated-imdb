After looking for it for a month, and then buying it inadvertently, it was disappointing. I heard about it on the DVD-R site and it sounded crazy. <br /> <br /> But no, what I got was a pretty martial arts movie. Kung fu was not too bad, but the rest of the movie was quite terrible and made the movie really long, much longer than the 85-minute running time. <br /> <br /> Positive Please note that the monkey was funny for a few seconds (especially if I think they only captured another movie on their face) and the black man who appears halfway was funny because of this one line which unanimously saw all black people look like complete simpletons. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it wasn't enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
