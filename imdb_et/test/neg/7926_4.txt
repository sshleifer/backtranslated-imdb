My first impression of the trailer of the Saikano: Live Action movie (visible on YouTube) was "Wow, this may be one of the few real-time live anime adjustments." <br /> <br /> This time I was just wrong! Simply put, the live-action Saikano movie had some pieces of missing puzzle; collect just enough to get its vague image. <br /> <br /> * STORY * <br /> <br /> The movie's story is obscure with anime and manga, but the movie's story is just a frame by car, not a full car. It seems that many of the original stories of the anime were omitted, changed or completely changed. In fact, the ending is completely out of the manga or anime end. <br /> <br /> Special characters; many were left out or had a different feeling. The link between Fuyum and Shuji is diminishing to Shuji knowing him because he is a video store. The character of Chise seemed too strong and only declared the notorious fact that I had several times in the film. The same can be said of Shuji. We lost a terrible, but also a tall man leader, a song he hugged, and his frequent activities calling Chise foolish. In other characters like Tetsu and Akemi, they knew differently, toning. Perhaps the fall of the other characters and the toning was much more focused on Chise and Shuji, which he did. Too much. Waiting for many sweet scenes like a trailer? Well, don't! Those who have a trailer plus a few minutes are the only amount you can get. So many movies tell me that when I was browsing a movie before watching the movie, I thought I had a drama of normal Asian romance. <br /> <br /> The movement was too fast. In the film, we see the famous Chise scene, armed with small wings and a chain weapon in just under nine minutes. There is very little time to learn about and interact with characters. What they should have done was divided into two films or even into a trilogy. If it hadn't been so much, then you need to change or lower them. <br /> <br /> But again the film behaves like a frame. Anime was more of a full car, because even if all these little details and such are small, they can really get up. <br /> <br /> * PRODUCTION * <br /> <br /> Visual. So many special effects turned out to be looking for quite cheese, especially CGI. Unfortunately, they were similar to the Sci-Fi channel movies. They are tolerated and this film is not for effects. <br /> <br /> -Music- Music was average. Much of this was the background music of the orchestra, except that the topics were not really there. The film has made an addictive song that Shuji animes was always moving. A remarkable piece of music, however, is the final song you hear in the trailer. Not a bad and somewhat beautiful song. It's disgraceful that it's not integrated into the movie itself or the orchestrated version of the song. <br /> <br /> Casting-Saikano was also so-so. The main star was Chis actress Aki Maeda, who is best known for her role in the Battle Royale films. The actor who played Shujit was pretty good, but they took the glasses out of their original character. Oh yeah and Tetsuo look like Lupine 3. <br /> <br /> Unlike what I have heard from some other, the action of live-action Saikano was not so bad. Rather, I feel guilty that the story has been put out and only a two-hour film made in the series. <br /> <br /> * What you can learn from living activities in Saikano: * <br /> <br /> - CGI-I really want Saikano CGI not been so bad. But even for that reason we could have got some more fighting scenes! Probably the most viable anime adaptation is not suffering from Neon Genesis Evangelion, because they currently have WETA Studios, which are designed to act. <br /> <br /> -Modernism - Fuyumi acquired a video store. Chise used a music cassette player to listen to music and gave Shuj a tape for her birthday. Why? This movie was made in 2006! Not only that, in reality, in movies, they can create such a thing as Chise that it doesn't happen in the 90s! The future is the age of CDs, DVDs and MP3 players. Hopefully, Evangelionis Shinjil is a Sony Walkman MP3 player. Not one that plays cassette tapes. <br /> <br /> -Story & Pacing - As mentioned earlier, the Saikano movie moved too fast and forced the story to leave many details. It was a smart move for ADV Films and someone else to make Evangelion a solid trilogy, thus allowing more time for the story to be considered as true to the original. <br /> <br /> - Characters- Leave most character designs alone and let them tell classical quotes! What if the lively action on Evangelion was not Asuka "What are you, stupid?" or Shinji is "I must not escape!" Sometimes these frequent quotes are as small as those who are those characters. <br /> <br /> * CONCLUSION: * <br /> <br /> Overall, the lively action on Saikano was a potential. That really did. Those who are not fans and watch this movie: you don't want to start an anime or manga (so don't look at the movie first!) People who saw and liked the anime / manga won't get your hopes about it. Research shows that you are probably disappointed. It was still fun to see that the anime is alive in life, but it could have been so much. <br /> <br /> I reluctantly give Saishu Heiki Kanojo (Saikano) a 2 <br /> <br /> As Chise says, "I'm sorry" <br /> <br /> ~ NekoTakuto
