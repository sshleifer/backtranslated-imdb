First of all, let me tell you that if you haven't enjoyed the Van Damme movie from the verdport, you probably don't like this movie. Most of these films may not have the best plots or the best actors, but I enjoy this type of film. This film is much better than any movie that other activities (Segal and Dolph) have been thinking of in recent years. Van Damme is good in the movie, the movie is only worthy of Van Damme fans. It's not as good as waking up to death (which I highly recommend to anyone who likes Van Damale) or hell, but I think it's worth it. It has the same feeling as running. Good fun stuff!
