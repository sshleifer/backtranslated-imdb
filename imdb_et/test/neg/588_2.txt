I didn't like this movie for many reasons. It was interesting how they thought about what the future should look like, but seriously I was looking at it boring. There was hardly anything. Although the soundtrack of the classical orchestra was very nice. The visuals were very creative. When this movie appears on the TV, I feel that the station will change immediately. Not because it's a bad movie, but because I know what I'm watching for it - complete and boring. This is the film I saw when I was young, but I never got into scientific literature ... because it was just not real. Just like this movie - very unreal. I never understand half the movie.
