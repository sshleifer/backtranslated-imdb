This film was disappointing. The story is basically The Shining with the castle (or a very cheap kit that is a castle that is specific), replacing ghosts instead of a hotel and a monster. The budget is the same as you would see in Cinemax's soft porn porn, as well as the photography, kits, lighting and video that has been made. The story is an unsuccessful attempt to sincerity: it is no easier way to feel your audience sympathetically when you show them emotional trauma. And the trauma of this movie is pretty tritiated. Do you want, for example? The blind girl who listens to teaching Italian-language words starts shouting, which she never sees. <br /> <br /> This movie, however, was some of the things he had anticipated: the monster is actually cool, pretty scary. And Raffaella Offidani has a pretty decent nudity, which is the star of Italian "erotic" movies. However, Gore leaves much to be desired, as do the actors, even from Jeffrey Combs. In addition, I've only seen two other Stuart Gordon movies: Re-Animator and From. But I won't let this little footnote look at my movies more in my career.
