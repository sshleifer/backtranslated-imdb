Again, Woody Allen seems to be completely without any inspiration, except for the recovery itself. Here is a nice documentary (like Zelig), the film's structure is the Deconstructing Harry series of anecdotes (Radio Days, Broadway Danny Rose) set in the 30s (Zelig, Purple Rose, Bullets) genius, he releases away (ditto). Considering this film and Harry's deconstruction, one wonders whether it is Allen's justification for his own actions against Mia Farrow's daughter; Yes, I was a jerk, but I'm a genius so you have to love me. <br /> <br /> Allen has only produced two good films in the last ten years; fine but redundant bullets over Broadway, and a great but largely ignored Manhattan Murder Mystery. His other efforts range from small ones (New York stories, Mighty Aphrodite), to Edgins, but from experimental (Husbands and Wives), pure drek (Alice, Mallid shopping center, shadows and fog, celebrity, Harry deconstruction). His films no longer even catch the narrative arc, and his humor seems to be focused on amusing fun, not fun. After Harry's deconstruction, I finished watching my films in theaters; they can also be rented after Sweet and Lowdow.
