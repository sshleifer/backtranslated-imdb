This movie was Jerry Bruckheimer's idea of ​​selling some items. Not serious. The idea behind this is that if you made a full-featured pop song, you could capture songs, sell and make even more money in the studio. You can also release a few stories that are one-time, and combine a movie clip with a promo video, so when MTV plays the route you actually get for free movies. It's a good business deal, but an artistic catastrophe, because many of us are still nightmares of Hollywood movies in the 1980s, and I value American filmmaking in the mid-1980s for a poorer time and FLASHDANCE opened the door. A 90-minute movie instead of a movie "<br /> <br /> Jennifer Beals plays a Alex Owens dancer who works as a welder to make an end and immediately logic disappears with this career choice. Welding is quite a tricky trade, it's not something you do There are other gaps in the logic, such as ballet dancing and "flashing" are somehow similar, ie if you are a ballet dancer and you are doing some hot, dirty flashdancing, then men's judges want to meet you after listening, but you don't get the job it is like saying that screen writing, novel writing and writing are somehow the same as they're not, but I think none of this is important to Jerry when he asked the director Adrian Lyne to make a movie. makes a very sexy movie, JenniferBeals is very sweet and innocent. Fortunately, I took out why her face is tightly lit while her silhouette is dark. kad, except when the camera cuts close-ups of its heavenly toned body. This is because the body double is used most of the time and often the body double is the man! I bet there are some naughty guys who feel guilty, not to mention a little resentment
