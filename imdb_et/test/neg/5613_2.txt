This movie has been made because the concept is well transformed into two sentences that can be used to attract investors. This means that the assumption is interesting and marketable. I thought I rented it on the basis of the summary. The problem is that nothing is far from being in the original sense. There is no single plot, full signs, real comedy, interesting landscapes, surprises or good performances (except Jon Herder, he does very little). It would be like people who enlightened this thing, did not read the script, but only a summary. And if I have so many people like me, it can even make money. <br /> <br /> For the future viewer: don't waste your time, here's nothing funny or interesting. To the creators of the movie: Hey, you have your own movie, so what if it's not that big. Most people can't see themselves or their work on the screen.
