I stopped this movie in 48 minutes and changed it ... I don't know ... maybe it's because I'm not a Swedish or French (cannes commenter) ... or any of those other sleepy places where previous reviewers were ... born and raised in NY. lived in San Francisco for a quarter of a century. and now Holland. I love a good independent movie as much as the next movie enthusiast ... but it is by no means funny. look? Now, it's funny ... that you mean I made a mistake. I said, "word", but then said "not funny" ... quick. no problem. if this is your humor, I would say that you don't really have a lot of life ... keep in mind the recognition of this movie as a symptom ... and never write another review ... I have a tendency to believe them when they are unanimous. even before I had only 3 reviews ... I thought I could actually save someone if the EU was bored ... waiting for laughter that would never materialize ... I smiled once or twice, though ... when I started the movie ... and when I stopped it. it should be 10 lines.
