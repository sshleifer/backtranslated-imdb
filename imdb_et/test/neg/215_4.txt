New guards at the armored truck concert recruits its associates to steal 42 million trucks. No bad guys, so nobody gets in, right? Of course things go wrong and the new guard decides to have a conscience and make things right when a person's life is saved. <br /> <br /> I admit that I didn't care about this movie, but I didn't care about Fantastic Mr Fox and this movie made my top ten years. It is even more frustrated than I thought it would be. As a hunter, it cannot deliver goods, it is boring and full of holes in parcels and jumps with logic that someone thinks about it. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film is somehow really big, but the film doesn't even use it as an advantage. Everyone seems to have wasted wooden characters that make stupid choices. Columbus Short is an uninteresting leader that is never charismatic and never makes the audience a little. Matt Dillon is behind the heir and initially he plays Mr Nice Guy, when things don't go to him, he quickly becomes a villain. The other impressive part is Lawrence Fisburn, Jean Reno, Skeet Ulrich, Fred Ward, Amaury Nolasco Prison Break and Milo Ventimiglia Heros. None of them do much and if they actually do something, it is without much justification. <br /> <br /> The film is relatively short, but even if it lasts less than 90 minutes, it seemed to be pulled out. How long can you shoot a boy trapped somewhere? Phonebooth did a decent job and it was even more limited. The logic of the plot is tragic. 42 million and all security is a check every hour or so? The whole plan of my understanding was to bring the trucks to the abandoned warehouse and hide the money. Please note that trucks will hit and burn. Then they went away with the money. Of course something goes wrong or the movie wouldn't be? Through various unfortunate events, the so-called hero is injured by an officer inside the truck. The rest of the movie is Dillion and his team stuck in the doors. How very exciting. <br /> <br /> The script requires our hero to get financial trouble, he may lose his house, which in turn will make him lose his brother. You see, both of their parents died and it is these two who look out each other. So now he has a reason to join the throne. At first he didn't want to, but his cash problems are just the right step to throw him into things. How convenient. <br /> <br /> Armor's entire spin in the hero-genre is that it is armored from a truck that drives it. After this basic situation, the film falls on that face. I found that I want to finish it sooner and earlier every time someone talked. Talking about the end, it sucks. <br /> <br /> Skip it.
