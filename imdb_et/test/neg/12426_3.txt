What can I say about the movie as bad as it is? The people who made this movie did not even try to make this monster realistic. You never see more than his head and head is just a giant doll with little movement unless it opens the mouth of the mouth. And the sound they used to roar is the best part. At many points in the movie, it sounds like a TIE fighter flying over! I couldn't believe that when I first heard it and I had to roll it back several times to sink it. Apart from this terrible appearance and the noise it produces, this film has a lot other than a few dirty attacks. scenes and crazy Scotsman, who is attacking children who are trying to catch the intimate moment of their castle. However, it is traceable if you like this trash. I know I do.
