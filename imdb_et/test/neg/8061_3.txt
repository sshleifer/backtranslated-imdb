One of the most famous 'Video Nasties' banned in the 1980s is also superfluous. "Do them Slowly" is what you expect from Umberto Lenz's jungle potboiler, which is an invented (but poorly modified) native torture method, some ridiculous "social comments" (yes, even quieter than "Cannibal Holocaust") and many nerves chewed. The exploitative violence of the film is often only shown in short proximity and never lives for a long time, which reduces its impact (interpreting how you get it). Dialogue is Lenz's usual stupidity, because our male heroes show their affection to women, calling them "tw @ t" and others. Casting of well-known faces (including Lorraine De Here, Giovanni Lombardo Radice, Zora Kerowa and Robert Kerman) will do everything in the form of increasing idiotics (including the completely ridiculous "castration"), but will not get the excess, sad effort.
