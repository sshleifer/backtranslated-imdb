Green horse pastors in Buenos Aires have been with Manhattan's Crawfords for a long time, but what happens when a black-eyed Latin son falls on a certain Crawford with bright eyes, blonde hair, and some supernatural movements on the dance floor? 20th-century Fox music has shiny plywood that looks a little around the edge. It's a dirty, gymnastic dance that is an extremely thin story. Betty Grable (Alice Faye's 11th Replacement) gives her a boost, though she's involved with lead Don Ameche (reddish brown and slippery hair). It is also good: Charlotte Greenwood as the aunt of Betty's aunt, limousine manager who is constantly working and Carmen Miranda is playing herself (who else?). Argentina's stock shots surpassed the action on the back of Fox, and some supportive performances are quite terrible. Until the end of the big horse race, most viewers have been enough. * 1/2 from ****
