When this series was incited, I watched it mostly. I think it was supposed to be a long series of "The Fugitive" and "Incredible Hulk" veins where the protagonist is driven across the country looking for solutions to his problems. In this case, the hero's problem is his progressive aging in the opposite direction. I liked what I saw in these shows. The action was good, especially the sad relationship between the sign and his wife. The problem is: they canceled it before it was able to stop. (whether or not I missed the last episodes). <br /> <br /> They could never hit the story knowing it was canceled. It was just gone. But as I said before I missed the last episodes. But the opposite proof is this: I recorded the tape. Where I left the series. The lead character of a woman dies during a fire that began with the King's famous organization Shop. Although escape, the hero is abducted. It ends up with your friends knowing that they have to save the store. End. The last episode. In the video: His wife does not die, but flees from him with fire. Just when he had to sneak into the store, he shared the strange moment of his wife, and then they gradually existed. Sudden, foolish and inexpensive to the extreme. They just wanted to put this video out and decided to mark at the end that didn't care about how bad it was. They may also be showing some of the first atomic bomb burns. Almost Pythonesque. <br /> <br /> The show had a cool opening title with the same name as David Bowie's songs
