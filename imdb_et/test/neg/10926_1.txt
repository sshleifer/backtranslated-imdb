One of the comments about Lil 'Pimp (Glen Cove's dbborroughs) was right when he noted that the movie was really bad, but I take an exception when he commented on the animation. <br /> <br /> Animation was not bad for Macromedia Flash. It was a bad animation because it was wrong. Flash is just a tool. With the right hand, an artist can create animations as full and fluid as any Disney movie, and it may seem as bad as the internet things where Lil 'Pimp comes from and should have been there <br /> <br /> Studios like Cartoon Network , Nickelodeon, Disney, and Warner Bros., create great animation with Flash (ie Puffy Ami Yumi, Foster Imaginary Friends Home, Mucha Lucha, etc.). <br /> <br /> Lil 'Pimp was an uneven piece that was made because Revolution Studios bought Media Trip and Lil' Pimp. Roth and the company thought they would make a quick stroke using Lil 'Pimp, and its fraud was sustained by its manufacturer, Amy Pell. The reason for the third trimester of the animated film's abortion is that none of the Revolution Studios leaders had the pragmatic brain left behind by Mark Brooks and Peter Gilstrap (they really tried their best, but were above their heads) and hired real writers and at least a semi-competent producer. However, they did one thing right, they hired the best storyboarders, designers and animators in LA, but as Lil 'Pimp shows, it is possible to buy the best sports car on the floor, but if you're a moor, then the wreck will surely.
