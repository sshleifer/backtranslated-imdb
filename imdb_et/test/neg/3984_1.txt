"You're in the navy right now" is painful bad: most likely the worst movie is Gary Cooper. It is based on a supposedly real story, but this film, which inspired this movie, does not seem to have enough plot to maintain a functional-length script. - Sitting on my mother's shoulder in New Island, Long Island. It was a stormy snow storm, and I was literally snow. If I had gotten out of the door, I would definitely have finished watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The supported pain has some interesting names, especially Charles Bronson (under his original name), Lee Marvin, Harvey Lembeck, Jack Webb and Jack Warden. Forget it. Everyone stinks in this movie. Even the generally trusted Millard Mitchell is terrible. Lee Marvin and Jack Warden are so brief on the screen that watching them doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper plays an embedded naval officer assigned to lead a new experimental steam. turbine: basically the whole ship is a huge tea maker. Cooper realizes that the assignment is not prestigious: if it had been, he would have gone to a better officer. <br /> <br /> Cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles, but he didn't just have comedy. He did a lot of bad comedies and this is his worst. Jane Greer is always boring for me, and she missed me more than usual. This ship went down all the hands and sank in the traces. Did I mention that this movie smells like? I appreciate 'You're in the navy now' one point out of 10. Product! Product!
