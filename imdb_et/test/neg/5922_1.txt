I mistakenly thought that the neo-noir efforts in the Buffalo - Niagara Falls area could be something else. Unfortunately, I was wrong. There are many problems with "The Falls" that really have nothing to do with this low budget video production. Immediately ask immediately why all the continuous narration? My feeling is that if you have a decent script, the audience will follow it so that it cannot be offended by storytelling. Operation is very amateurish, which is not unexpected, but simply adds to the problems. Finally, the whole thing is bothering like an MTV music video that was found to be totally unacceptable. Narration, poor performance and annoying video effects are all good reasons why you should avoid it. - MERK
