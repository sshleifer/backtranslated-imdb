I would not have given this film a low rating (2) if its average was not ridiculously high, but no one had to make it more sensible. I sat most of this movie watching the scene after tagging and shopping. There is no dialogue, just tagging and grocery shopping. Finally, the two taggers kissed. Something happened. But then back to tagging and shopping. I left the screening. I recommend this movie only to those who are impressed by thoughtful filmmaking. I did not like the previous film of the leaders (human-boy love for self-defense), but at least this film had a story, interesting signs, a dialogue. Graffiti's artist had only a scene after tagging and shopping. I want more movie than that.
