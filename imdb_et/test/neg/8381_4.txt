Culture begins 20 years ago in Quinling Mountain, South China, as the man named Owen Quinlin (Robert Berson) finds that the ancient amulet is magical, cut into California, where Quinlin has created a cult and members sacrifice themselves as one of them (Cazzy Golomb) fixes its evil scheme. Michaely) & Morgan (Victoria Venegas) are studying twenty years ago events that have come to know the Quinling Massacre project. Unfortunately, Morgan decides to kill himself, which triggers Owen Quinlin's evil spirit for quite weak reasons, he completes what he started all these years, demanding the soul to eventually inherit the magical abilities of the amulet for his own evil Use ... <br / > <br /> Joe Knee edited, produced and staged is not a good movie and it's kind. Benjamin Oren's script, which seems to be very serious, is such a supernatural story of a cult leader who has returned from the dead to end what he started a few years before, as you think the character is now related to what happened all those years ago and it's as dull as it sounds. The characters are blissful and unforgettable, dialogue is the same, there is no good horror or exploitation, slow goes from time to time, it is predictable, it's a clich√©, it ends up on track and doesn't make much sense if you mean it. The story doesn't grab or grab you, it's never exciting or interesting, and I'd like to even call this middle. There's very little here that I could recommend culture, don't worry about it. <br /> <br /> Director Knee does it well, but the film has such an impressive movie made for the TV. it's completely forgotten and flat stuff. There are no fears, no atmosphere and no tension. There is also no gore, definite amount of blood splatter, but no real special make-up effects gore scenes. <br /> <br /> Estimated budget around $ 950,000 Cult looks cheap, though it's not as badly done as some of the low budget horror movies I've recently seen. The actors are not even worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> Kult is a bad film that didn't do anything to me, I'd like to call this average. There are many better horror films.
