I'm ready to endure almost everything in a sci-fi movie, but it was almost unbearable. Although some special effects are very cool (landscapes), it is not a "battlefield", but rather a divorced odd mother / daughter relationship with sci-fi concepts that have been introduced. The actor (wood), framing and shooting (kindergarten film school) and the "movie" hand "fighting" against the "hand-to-hand" scene, if it is any Hong Kong chopsocky film, this film is boring. The plot line is twisted and the equipment used to move the plot (narrator), unexplained scene jumps and much deus ex machina, reinforce the idea that the writer cum director is not a good idea. Save your love for Sci-Fi for something other than losing a bit of it.
