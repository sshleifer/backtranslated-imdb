I liked all Lilo and Stitch movies. TV series were not so big, but I put my opinion out of the series when I watched this movie. And I have to say ... It was bad. <br /> <br /> One thing that was disappointing was animation. Yes, you heard it. Animation. I found this quality after the first movie very badly. Its quality was only higher than the TV series, which I didn't expect at all. If you are looking for eye candy, don't expect anything here. Also, the animation did not show any serious moods. Even in supposedly sad scenes, I didn't feel like this kind of humiliation of the second first movie. <br /> <br /> The next was an absolutely terrible voice. I found it very, very convincing and wondering why Disney, who had all his wealth and honor, couldn't afford the people who had the voice who had real talent. The voice actors' skills were as annoying as the series. I promised it in the series because hey, who wouldn't be tired of dealing with the voice, so many episodes? Heck, I don't even know how many episodes there are (Theoretically, there are 624, but I just can't believe it). But I thought the sound that works in the movie would improve, and I had put it down by the truth that what they could do in the series was already their best. <br /> <br /> A terrible script. It was cheese without redemption, and the writers just tried too hard. They're trying to joke, but I just found them annoying. Maybe it wasn't the voice but the cheeses that destroyed the sound. (The soundtrack was not too bad in the back and was pretty good with the mood.) <br /> <br /> Fourth, there was a problem with the story. I predicted everything, and the story was what made the characters so sudden and unlikely. You have new premises and responsibilities for foreigners. After the first hype, they realize that they didn't really like and leave their old life. In the meantime, the evil villain will leave prison after a very "action packed" stage of action and will break into Jumbaa's laboratory to steal her attempt. Then, the experiment was cloned into 100 and the hamster wants to conquer Earth. When the main characters become aware, they try to stop the evil hamster, but face some cheeses with the final display of the experiment and have an extremely flat apology to try to cool the series. The characters then give up their new privileges and return to Earth to continue their lives. Seriously, how many other films have you already used for this end? This story was extremely short and shapely, so don't wait too much for it. <br /> <br /> So Disney hasn't had the sound, the graphics, and the story. The only magic of the series was the original characters and how they managed to preserve the characters, but even the one that couldn't save the movie. I tried to like it, I really did, but I give it a rating of 4/10. Another Disney failure.
