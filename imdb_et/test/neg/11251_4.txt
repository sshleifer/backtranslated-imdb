The plot includes a new hyper-franchise that moves across the street from the Calvin Hairdresser. So, she feels she has to change and repair her shop by getting newer things and things like that. It looks really exciting. As far as the rest of the film is concerned, it includes a lot of the first film. People working at Calvin speak out loud and mouth to each other and to their clients. Cedric's entertainer was again a little funny, but it is more like doing a stand-up routine than doing something with the film. And Calvin faces another moral issue involving a large sum of money. He has already shown that he is finally doing the right things. <br /> <br /> FINAL PROVISIONS: something new. I wouldn't recommend it if you thought the first hairdresser was the best sliced ​​bread.
