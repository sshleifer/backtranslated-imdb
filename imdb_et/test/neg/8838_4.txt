I looked at the start twice, NOT understanding it, and it bothered me for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> So, do it with me: Wayne (HEA man) jumps stagecoach drivers (!), steals money (?!) and pulls. <br /> <br /> Driving, one driver is killed and another wounded by bad guys. Thanks to Wayne, who disarmed them, and then I watched it happen. <br /> <br /> Then Wayne's money falls into the dirt, saves the girl, rides the city, hits Yak (too bad for the dead) I think ... ... and then she says she found the money back to the scene . And everyone is doing it well. <br /> <br /> And he's a good man? And I'm pretty sure that there were no small hand held flashlights at that time. And Bell made his first phone demo in 1876 ... were they in the houses? Do I think too much about it? Usually I am happy to stop the judgment to enjoy the movie, but it disturbed me. And this is a sign that movement didn't really work for me.
