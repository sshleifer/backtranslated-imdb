One of the scariest films I've ever seen was Carrie (first!). Now, as with other films, they have completely destroyed Carrie's franchise with The Rage: Carrie 2. From the beginning, the film is like a geranium racing car. There is hardly any fear and this film is full of all kinds of high school sterotypes (i.e. football jock, bitchy cheer leader, followers and of course black candles). Another sad thing about this show is that you know what happens when you see the opening credit. Of course, the girl gets humiliated and then becomes a crazy psychic murderer ... awake ... <br /> <br /> I've been there. It's done. <br /> <br /> Even the actors look like they were forced to make this movie. Emily Bergl is just as scary as the Cabbage Patch Jack at Jack London ... just say I didn't pay to see woodwork. In addition to the actors, flasbacks offer more irritation than combining the first movie. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, when you get around objects like Carrie, is the light for God's love ......
