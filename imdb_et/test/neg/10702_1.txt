Everything I have ever raised was gender equality and here we have a film that not only supports imbalances but continues with the whole concept that one sex is better. Looking at all the time, I was hoping that the redemption of quality so that the viewer would feel like there was hope for the future. I testify that the film will not finish, I had to turn it off when the old man whore told the genetic person Adam that it was ok to be a whore and get, and quote: "More tail than any man in recent times." I know it is not a finish, it is a bad overview for me, but it is up to the writer and the team to develop a story that keeps the viewer interested and failed. This movie puts all the mother figure in a real feminine qualities and balance need. Instead, this is an example of what would be a lesbian Nazi in America, and I am not against lesbians. Thank you, Mr President. Someone please give me a redeeming quality ... wait, I have it! There is no sequel!
