My mom forced me to watch this movie. Obviously, he is monitoring something with vampire advice. I was bored bored. <br /> <br /> Underworld resembles at various points: the Lycans rise from Spartacus, the struggle for monkeys, Christ's passion and Mandingo! It reminds me most of those Italian swords and 19th century sandals (not good) who spend unreasonably many Greek or Roman speaking clothes and draw incessantly when you are eagerly awaiting a muscle man. a hero and his lover, usually a despotic daughter, to do something. <br /> <br /> This movie was in dire need of color and tension. The characters were pretty two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Sets looked like they were made entirely of tin! I don't know how much the civil war kits are fused to make this movie. <br /> <br /> All those who wear mesh stockings on your hand and black lipstick can freely click on NO.
