In my opinion, this film is not good. I hardly can say anything about this, but I would still like to explain before I conclude that this is another bad film. <br /> <br /> I decided to watch it because Costas Mandylor is starring at this. and that was the main reason I looked at it until the end. I like action films and I understand that such films are based on activity rather than on stage. I know they don't go into the details of the story and the credibility of the events, but even that doesn't explain why some scenes, just because they don't have a sense of reality, look ridiculous. <br /> <br /> At first, the film looks pretty promising: a harsh, good-looking specialist and not so harsh, but a smart and funny partner must do a job that turns out to be a little different than they expected. The story goes on a cruise ship. The catastrophe happens, the ship is reversed and only a few of them are alive. During their survival, they must flee from shark, professional killer and rising water. <br /> <br /> The movie is also very violent. The main weapon (besides the disaster that had taken most of the passengers) is a weapon that is successfully used in many cases. I personally left a person (or a woman's wife, if you wish) to fight. Family fun? I don't think this is the case. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think this movie has rushed, without the real vision it wants to say. These are the tricks of traditional films, which have a little something called love, and without real meaning it just causes a bad movie.
