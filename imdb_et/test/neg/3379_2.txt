This episode was potential. The prerequisite for a woman next to an empty apartment (but a constantly ringing phone) is somewhat interesting. And when he investigates the noise, there is real tension and fear. But writing a stupid script destroys all the promises that the episode had. closed even when there is no wind; "" This door has serious damage that wasn't here in a minute; "" The door was opened by itself without touching it; Considering these supernatural phenomena and the fact that the woman committed suicide in the room, would she not take precautionary measures before entering it? Maybe she could study during the day. Or maybe she could study the apartment with someone else. Or maybe she could turn around !!! Also, he decides to make a lot of phone calls to the operator in the haunted apartment and enters the argument about who is able to disconnect the phone, and then they start discussing the details of suicide .. DO NOT need to be involved in the telephone company. Finally, when the phone has hit the floor like it's alive, it was just comic. If the director wanted the woman to map with the map card, she would have done it so that it wouldn't look like a cartoon Brave Little Toaster Anyone?
