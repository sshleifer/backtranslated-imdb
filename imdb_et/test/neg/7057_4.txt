One of the most pleasant surprises of this early 3-band Technicolor was that the ballet dancer appeared here named Maria Gambarelli! I was wondering if Blake Edwards called it Elke Sommer, now a forgotten performer in A Shot in the Dark (although the spelling of the Sommer character was actually Gambrelli). I watched it on YouTube mainly to see the appearance of Judy Garland early when we look at her two older sisters who sang "La Cucarachat". It was the highlight that was highlighted to me, which otherwise showed some dances (like Mrs Gambarelli) that were pleasant and some stumbling comedies between Andy Devine as a big bullfighter (yes, right!) And Buster Keaton as the owner of the bull who gives it , which is apparently an animal costume. Only the funny part of these two is when they cry together with Buster, offering the sad part of "La Cucaracha" to the handkerchief. The flat also saw Ted Healy without his stories dealing with a crash that keeps heart against other movie stars. (Healy herself did not know that Zeppo had left Marx's brothers because she put "four" between "The" and "Marx"!) When talking about Marx, it was interesting to see Harpo without his wig, even though he was wearing a hat to hide his bald head . It was also interesting to see East Lupino seeing the cowgirls at first, although I also recognized Van Wick (at least when scientist Pete Smith discovered) last year. Oh, and Smith himself wasn't funny with his wise talk. Other famous stars you may or may not know are in the smithy and not all are M-G-M contract players! So all that has been said is that La fiesta de Santa Barbara is worth looking for someone who is curious about Judy Garland's early film performance or the early use of the 3-band Technicolor.
