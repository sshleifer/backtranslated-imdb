For years I have been a big fan of Park's work and "Old Boy" is one of my all-time favorite. <br /> <br /> Lots of expectation that I rented this movie to find the worst movie I've been watching for a while. It's not the right horror movie; it has no tension and even the "light" part is so flat that I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> I introduced my younger brother Chan-Wook to the park and was disappointed by it. For me, the idol has fallen. <br /> <br /> If you loved movies like "Old Boy", Mr & Lady "Vengeance" or even his short films "Three Extremes", don't waste your time, the film isn't worth it.
