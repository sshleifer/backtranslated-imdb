Sad ... really sad. This film has nothing (hmmm, maybe also Sybil Danning) to keep you looking. Also hurt my eyes to see Linda Blair in this exploitation. He certainly deserves a better one. <br /> <br /> What is this story? Let's see ... Warden John Vernon captures prisoners in quite inspiring places, while prisoner Sybil actually runs from jail and little Linda has to fight to survive ... It seems like a B movie, ah? It is.
