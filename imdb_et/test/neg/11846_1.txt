First of all, I would like to explain that I consider it one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. I was looking at it almost ten times just because I wanted to spread the tasty tastes of this movie to other unsuspecting victims. It has a captivating brother's seventh birthday hand-recorded camera recording. It has all the writing of the WWE game. And most importantly, the sidewalk scratched face is consistent. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The film starts almost almost in the eyes of an almost three-time teenage teenager. This scene convinced me that I was in a big position in the selection of this movie on a DVD (a box was drawn because the words "RAPTOR" were shouting on its front panel). The scene includes treasures such as tomato sauce, spaghetti intestines, unnecessary humor, and rubber dinosaur dolls that recur in the film. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The film contains irregular wallpapers and prop uses that cause your mind to melt for the reason that someone may just be ashamed of creating a movie. For example, a truck that is in the middle of the night is parked next to a rock wall. The next day they find it on the open grass. The driver could not drive it there, because he bitten his face with an unnamed bipedal predator (I explain why this second name is not mentioned). So, my only guess is that the rider was driving, the cattle that the carrier did, or Jim Wynorski didn't think much about his viewers. Hell, on the one hand, they expect me to believe that they will walk the main street at night if there are no gutters on the road, the fire hydrant is next to the phone cab and there is only one street light. But I still feel compelled to watch and watch this movie so I can find more things that will make me look the next time. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Managing this movie is terrible. Long long break. Strange cuts that were not even in the general vicinity of the conversation. People are randomly discussing things in front of the camera (and in turn they do it towards the wall). They can't even give the dinosaur the same kind by moving it to the child's dinosaur and using a rubber velor chapper (different in intensity, fat and disproportionate nails). This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Editing this movie is outstanding. It's not good. I am well aware that film is a set of scenes from other films that are masterfully crafted into one piece of crap, but there must be a limit! Sub-plots end as sharply as they started. Explanations that the sudden disappearance of characters is not limited well have not been explained at all! And the end that felt like driving a car with a brick without a belt. You never know what will happen because the film does not follow a unified structure. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Now I just have to mention one scene (the biggest one) that is near the end. It's a spoiler, but not really. The final scene includes shows between Tyrannosaurus rex and Sheriff Tanner. It is similar to the display of the aliens Sigourney Weaver and the Queen of the Alien, except without any emotional power / budget / epic struggle. It consists of a real construction machine from Danner's dinosaur. White bobcat. For several minutes, the director, with his slippery sliding series, can turn this white bobcat into a yellow forklift / crane. Now, as I said, I know this film is made from scenes from other films, but which two films require a t-rex to be displayed in a construction machine? This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 1/10 of film quality, but it is just how much it makes me laugh and enjoy.
