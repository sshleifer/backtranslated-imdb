I just saw it at the Castro Theater in San Francisco, and I had trouble waking up with this incredibly repetitive, unexposed small film. It is a 75-minute film that seemed to be 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly related material. It is not bad in any offensive way, but repeats things that have been said a lot, many times and more interestingly and provocatively. Only a few exceptions drone and continue, with little emotional contact or context for the whole subject. It is rather "how" to guide something that can no longer be done. I was alive in the age, but I knew little or no nostalgia about what was being presented.
