Where I start, this is one of the most frustrating films I've seen since it makes a lot of sense, but it gets so stupid. A movie of a ghost-inhabited bed? The first 2 minutes of the film show a black and white backlash from the strange views of the winner of the Pulp Fiction competition, Fabienne. It should create a way for bed factors to take into account the story. However, if you wanted to open up to keep people interesting or send them out early, you can strangle it. Moving to the present day, the couple moves to the apartment with a friendly landlord and starts unpacking their belongings. Then one night, when you make a hippie with a mattress, they realize they need a bed frame. This is where things become fish, why didn't they bring or buy a g * d fucking bed before they got there? We know that the door leading to the attic, where the first 2 minutes took place, does not open, but when the couple realizes that they need a bed frame, the door opens magically. They go to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it to the lower floor and their love days are saved ... or they thought. The rest of the movie centers around both are haunted by the bed frame. A woman is an artist, so she starts to make ghoulish images she dreams of, and a man is a photographer so she starts to behave as if she was tortured or tied. 50 years old, yuck) The woman is growing scared and she discovers that the house she lives on was once a shelter for serial battles and murders that led to the end of the film. They find a friendly landlord murdered (which makes no sense because ghosts have to kill the human form) and decide to crowd hell. Offering her husband morally up in the attic, where she has a crazy fat guy and a bitch basking her skull before the police show up and take her to the mental palace, where she kills some guys trying to tear her in. <br /> > Well, if you've read this far, you need to think about one thing ....... WHY HELL IS NOT A TYPE OF TURNED FUTURE? Seriously, they never said anything about the ghost of the real house, just the bed .... so why not get rid of the fucking thing and move on? That is why the film is so depressing because it is actually a good plot and the actors follow this example, but there are more holes than Sonny Corleone. The couple tried to leave the city against every other film that had the "oh chance to give that place a honey" scheme so it needed it. However, I and my friend who watched the movie said every 5 minutes ... why do they just not throw a bed? Especially after they learned, this haunted time was a good time to burn it or something. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an almost traceable film with a lot of pornography like bed scenes and a credible plot (to some extent), but the solution is so easy that you scratch your head at the end of the movie, thinking how stupid the married couple to be? The highlight of the film is when the husband tells the 50-year-old model to spread his legs and his assistant tells him he can't let him go. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10 (Low Budget) Porn Show Men Love)
