Not only did it affect and act in this movie bite, but the story was terrible. <br /> <br /> The scientist discovers that the comet fragment hits the moon ... world leaders ignore him ... he builds a shelter ... then everything is upset that he "plays God". <br /> <br /> How flat! He built the thing, why are everyone "entitled" to gain access? Totally flat, don't waste your time!
