Chances are that one of the best, terrible b movies ever, as it is so bad and casual, it's a definite fun and I don't know how to feel it. off the porch by making karate and yelling "pancakes" that are interesting. Since many people have already sketched the plot and everything, I have summed up the quality of the movie with a single quote: "I'm a park ranger who's going to get you f * ck. Yes, enough to say? If you are looking for quality or really scary movie, I don't recommend it but if you like such movies then i think you will enjoy it .I don't know how, but i think some people.
