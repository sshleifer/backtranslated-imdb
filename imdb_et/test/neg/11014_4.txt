It's one of those movies I remember when I was a kid, and I recently managed to buy it out of eBay - 20 years later, it's not nearly as good as I remember. <br /> <br /> The "Cosmic Event" ("Crazy Story Development" credits) is another member of the extraordinary film crew that makes the collective ants super intelligent. Antique warriors have stopped rivalry and are now cooperating. The thing I wanted to know was what to do exactly? You will never know what they want. Nigel Davenport and his sidekick travel to the desert, where strange activities have been observed and begin exploring ants in an irrelevant igloo-shaped lab. Probably the most cool scene in my mind was when two scientists visited a giant square of crops (like a square version of a crop), due to the ants being caught. <br /> <br /> This movie was not very frightening just because you don't know if there are ants' fear or they like it. All you know is that the ants want people to leave the area so they can move on with their hinkies, but you don't know if they're really bad. It is not a sci-fi, because the explanation of the "cosmic event" is too vague to be properly taken into account. It's more of a cooler. TBH flames, big hairstyles, tight shirts with big collars and Nigel Davenports unnaturally big facial hair - were scared more than ants! Did you notice that there are only six participants in credit points? Yes, that's right - SIX, and you don't see any other people in this movie at all. Not even at a distance! This is obviously a film with a very low budget, which is a bit traceable because it probably doesn't see that. I can't think anyway. Filming ants is pretty good, they have to have filmed months and months before they needed to catch the movies. You can say, "How do they do the ants in hell?" over and over again, but it's all pretty simple. You will also notice that the filmmakers also sacrificed millions of innocent lickle ants to make a film so that the rights of the animals fall! For good news, but you may not see it more than once.
