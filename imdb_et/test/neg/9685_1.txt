Although I'm very interested in biblical films, I was dead every minute of every movie. Everything is bad. The movie is too long to act as a joke and the script is terrible. I didn't get a point to mix Abraham and Noah's common story. So if you appreciate your time and peace of mind, stay away from this fear.
