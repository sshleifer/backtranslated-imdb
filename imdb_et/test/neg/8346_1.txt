Hahahahah Probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Apparently, it is not intentional. The main characters take about half of the movie to understand what the big mountainous thing is in the middle of the city, the heap of hot red stuff, and the other half spent the flow through the city using fire trucks (better). It certainly made me laugh. The actor makes Arn like RSC. It is amazing that such films are being ordered. An interesting version would be someone who would go into an active volcano and film it and would probably cost around Â£ 20. ($ 40) I see a guy who is filming a movie company "well there is this big VOLCANO and it breaks down the city .... pretty radical hey" good.
