Diane Lane, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson and Thomas Jane ..... I don't think I have a bad majority, but they were completely wasted in this movie. <br /> <br /> There was no real direction, unusual The whole movie was very predictable from start to finish. Mickey Rourke had a really annoying sidekick who did nothing but irritated you from the start. Rosario Dawson was completely wasted and hardly had any idea even to have his character in the movie. <br /> <br /> I really believe that this is one of those direct DVD movies that everyone will forget very quickly, which is a shame, because the film could have been so much better.
