Lightly entertaining and self-conscious - but what else could it be? Grinding one of his poorest roles and often sounds dubbed. McClure is just too Cheezy to believe, but who can blame him for this movie graveyard, whose plot of old dinosaur birds dominating people is the 19th century throwback "period of charm," but not enough and unfortunately the script bears the racist meanings of literary genre films. The effort of nice actors but poorly designed production.
