This unfortunate training in satire or commenting on a person's condition easily served as one of the 10 worst films I've ever seen. I'm seriously considering buying a copy when I find one dirt, an unwanted business tracing. It is so badly honest. I regard it as some anti-personnel mines. If you are a person who just has to see a robber to see a carnage, this film is a pearl. Just to be fair, the Kelsey Grammar character has one line that works almost, but not quite. Other than that, everything in this movie tries to be insightful, but leaves a mark about the distance between the earth and the nearest pair of collision galaxies. I usually appreciate a book or a movie where the protagonist suffers from some sort of existential anger, but the angst presented here is so incredible and upright, and the film does not even deal with the meaninglessness it presents in a valuable way. If you are familiar with the term "vomit word", you may get some picture of cinematography. Oh and the narrative structure is poorly prepared, pretentious and amateur. It has failed in both style and content. If you really hate someone, call them a double feature of this movie and "Tiny City Terror", all of the 1930s dwarf west coasts and put them in their eyes, forcing the "Clockwork Orange" style to open. However, this is likely to violate some of the provisions of the Geneva Conventions.
