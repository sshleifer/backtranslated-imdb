It's a pretty bad movie, but it's not as flat as the third Ghoulies movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a bad movie about its writing, leadership, action and basically everything. It has such a weak, simple and ridiculous story that, in addition, it has nothing to do with previous Ghoulies movie records. It tries to connect the movie to the first movie "Ghoulies", since 1985, but then, if they really wanted to connect this movie to their predecessors, was this movie Ghoulies? Instead, we have some small people played by Tony Cox and Arturo Gil. Not that Ghoulies from the earlier films were classic characters, but they were still the heart and soul of the film and also offered films with some fun. It's like Gremlins movie without Gremlin. <br /> <br /> The film is not really interesting to watch because it lacks any tension, good humor, intriguing characters and basically anything else you mean, because it's a group of people who obviously aren't the most talented of their business . Just like with director Jim Wynorski, continue with movies like "Breastwick Witches" and its sequel, "Alabama Jones and Busty Crusade", "House on Hooter Hill", "Scream Queen Hot Tub Party", "The Bare Wench" Project and "Bare Wench Project 2: Scared Topless" and "Bare Wench Project 3: Mystery Mountain Nymphs" and "Da Vinci Coed". <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie is pretty stupid and campy, but it's not is really enough to enlarge this movie and give it more entertaining value. You know, it's a kind of inexpensive look that has some flat special effects, costumes, makeup and actresses no one has ever heard of since. <br /> <br /> The worst movie in the series is that "Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go to College" is a much worse movie because it had some terrible experiments on humor - this movie is still looking at serious and professional events, though the end result is far from perfect. <br /> <br /> Making bad movies and perhaps only traceable to those who have seen previous Ghoulies entries. <br /> <br /> 3/10
