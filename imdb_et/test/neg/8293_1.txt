This film spends most of the time preaching that it is a script that makes a movie, but apparently there was no script when they were wasting time. The trailer makes it a comedy, but the film can't decide if it wants to be a comedy, drama, romance or action movie. The press releases showed that Shatner and Hamlin made this film because they loved the script (what did they mean?). If you like William Shatner (see), look at "Free Business" instead.
