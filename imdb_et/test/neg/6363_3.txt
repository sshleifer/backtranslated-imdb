I didn't particularly like sliding doors or twice yesterday, so I didn't know that for these films it was a bad secondary excuse. The idea of ​​what has been done to death (what would happen if ...?) And the script is dirty and failed, not to mention the obvious attempt to add sex / nudity just to get R-rating and certain scenes that just were not needed but were there to raise the boundaries (I don't really have to look at straying or fighting with a diaphragm. Especially if they have no connection with the film or are not used). <br /> <br /> The actor was also very bad, the only actor I was the least satisfied with was his daughter; the rest were two-dimensional and quite unbelievable. The people I looked at left about half the room; I managed to finish it, but not without a quick transmission through this part. <br /> <br /> Generally, here's nothing new, it's a general and boring movie. Few rather funny moments weigh fools or fools. It would be boring even if it wasn't done before. If it wasn't such a transformation, I'd appreciate it for five, but even for Indie, it was very inadequate and again lost its originality: 3/10.
