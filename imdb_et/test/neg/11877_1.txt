I've seen some bad action movies in my days, but it's just terrible. I think it's a waste of time even to write it, but I'll make it short. Why this movie sucks? here are 10 reasons: 1. Very hobby and cut. 2. The whole cast of bad bad bad behavior. 3. Foolish dialogues and too many clich√©s. 4. Too much plot holes, lots of scenes don't add. 5. Poor imaging (and lots of consistency issues). 6. Leading female actor with ridiculously bad performance. 7. Unreliable Action Plans (and not too good). 8. Even in the case of snips, he shows that he has no working materials. 9. Overweight Accents (Whole Cast). 10. Last but not least - too many unreliable facts, such as a football tournament in the US, a CIA who needs background checks to get new information about their employees, an explosion-proof mattress, and so on. Essentially - it's a waste of time, it's not funny, not entertaining, not even a joke - DON 'T WATCH IT !!! Seriously, just away.
