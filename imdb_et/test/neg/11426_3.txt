Because I would never have seen that movie ever before. Although there are some, but not many, funny moments in this film, I couldn't understand what people were talking about more than 15% (including the fictional English couple of the third story). Three short stories, no one with a real point, but some of the most unhappy and inanimate people I could have imagined, and the burden of a flawless language. Did not find it funny, did not find this amusing, did not find any sense in it. 4/10
