It is hard to believe that the movie that this bad could actually release. Dialogue was unnatural. The depiction of the relationship between the boy and his future father was particularly poor. I think you can say that they managed to create an uncomfortable dialogue, but what was said seemed wrong and artificial. The thrill was just not there. The music was about as bad as it could. The only reason I watched this movie was because I live in a dead valley area and I was curious about what places appear on the screen. Fortunately, the movie was on television and so I didn't waste money to apologize for the film! I honestly believe that most of the amateurs could put together a more fascinating plot than the one presented here. It's too bad that the entire film crew's time was wasted in such a trash! I think the only positive thing you can say about the film is that some landscapes were good.
