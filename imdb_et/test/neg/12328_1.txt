Critics of the world, sorry. It is up to you to advise members to choose wisely what to spend. But I ignored your advice and I hurt you deeply. However, my decision to see "The Cat's Box" was not accidental. You see, three years ago, all your critics said we should all avoid the "accident" known as "How Grinch Stole Christmas". Then some of my friends took a look at it and it turned out to be colorful, funny and almost hypnotic. So, when the critics fired their rage with the "Cat in the Hat", another big budget Seuss update with a big name star, I thought it should be the same old song. How wrong I was. <br /> <br /> Within five minutes I thought I was clear. Opening credits are smart, kids are charming and product values ​​are top-notch. Then a cat appeared. There are many problems from that point on, but the biggest one was the stigmatization of Mike Myers. When Grinch saved Jim Carrey's inspired casting, Myers "Cat" was destroyed. He can be very funny when his energy is used where they belong, comics. Every movie he made was really funny, really was just a comedy sketch of the length of the qualities from "Wayne's World" to "Austin Powers." So he's trying to do the same thing, it's just that these comedy sketches are more like things they end up with at the end of the SNL, not funny, just painful. Not that the writers helped him out. After a charming prologue, the film becomes a sensitive physical humor, poorly timed workouts and an unheard-haunted experiment with hip humor. This movie was the most unpleasant movie experience I've ever had. Period. So many talents and jobs went so vile. I know that the adult stars of this film are quite effortless with this confusion, I just hope that the wonderful Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning will get more opportunities to show off their charms in much better films. If you are a parent, beware of this as a plague. Films such as "Elf" and "Brother Bear" now have much better choices in theaters.
