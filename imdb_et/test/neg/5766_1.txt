I am shocked that some people have received more than two stars for this movie. They have to be funny or be totally blind for the show, staging and other movie mistakes. Too bad. <br /> <br /> The first three characters that do not contain the miners were just terrible actors and I mean ONLY! Maybe the director doesn't care, or he may be a worse director. It was like playing bad school. The film was naturally filmed with a camcorder (low-budget - not the actual movie) and the light settings were not very good either. In addition, the sound man (if they had one) must be either a beginner or a drunk, because the sound was amateurish. Even in one of the first kitchen scenes (AWFUL works btw), the sounds of the dialogue were pretty bad. For example, when a woman spoke to her head, she heard her voice disappear and come back. It sounded like they had tried to correct it during post-production, turning a little bit when it turned its head. In addition, you were constantly annoyed by the sound of the camera or other kitchen sources. <br /> <br /> All these gutter for the first 5 minutes or so. Need I say more? IMPORTANT RIP OFF if you do not have a very low standard for the movie or just a bad taste. You are WARNING! SB.
