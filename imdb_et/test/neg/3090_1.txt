what a waste of time! i expect better cameron diaz! I think it wasn't really his fault to be a terrible movie. the film did not capture the beauty of europe ..... and failed to steer the audience or wonder. weak test for storytelling and storytelling - dialogue is boring and unable to pass what sometimes I think simplicity is beauty. love, energy, electricity on the screen. too bad !!!!!!!! 1
