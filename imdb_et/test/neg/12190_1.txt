This film is just frightening how the involved talent did it outside of people's faith. It is understandable that they had to think about this idea, I feel that 2 hours of my life has been taken from me. Harvey Kietel is struggling far from this garbage, it should have been a big criminal film, but it will become vampires. I would recommend this movie to people who like to sleep through the movie, you don't want to miss anything. the lowest prevalence prevails, movies can raise us and remind us that life is worth living, this film just pushes you. As DeNiro said in one movie, the saddest thing about life-wasted talent in this film is the perfect example of this statement.
