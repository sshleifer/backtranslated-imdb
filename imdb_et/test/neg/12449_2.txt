Back to sender, a.k.a. Convicted, is almost imperfect. One good thing about this movie was that I was never bored. Nonetheless, this film, which is a success with the low budget of this movie, may not look the same movie I saw. <br /> <br /> Instead of writing a review and saying what happens and what works and what doesn't work, I just comment that nothing works. In this film, there are holes in the plot that can be driven halfway through. Acting in a movie is not very good, although it may be the result of a poorly worded script that could have been written by George Lucas. No extra sets or costumes were needed for this movie, and everything seemed right. Did I mention some plot holes? At the end of the movie, you wondered how a blind boy could be so good with a shotgun, why Kelly Preston trusts Aidani Quin, why sleep at night before his client's killing, how Aidan Quinn can drive 400 miles in such a short time with a car that breaks down during the rest of the movie, why Aidan Quinn was not a fifth of nipples, etc. <br /> <br /> It's all said, it's definitely a B-movie and terrible. Unfortunately, it is not good to be good. If you appreciate your time, please give it a public service message to stay away from it.
