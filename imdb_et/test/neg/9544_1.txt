I would not recommend it to anyone except cinema visitors who want to laugh at the movie, not with it. <br /> <br /> Pretty promising and the participants are getting more and more worse about the film, which may end up with the worst end ever seen on film. I do not break it, but basically the most used set of film clips has been done in the last five minutes of the most disappointing and half-hearted disappointment of every film. <br /> <br /> The film also includes most of the disgraceful emerging scenes, an attempt between screen chemistry between two front roles, when Angela Jolie is presented to us, worshiping Denzel Washington's finger lovingly. It may be the only thing he could move, but quite precisely that the viewer is treated with the zoom of Washington's finger, moving in the middle of intermittent light and music suitable for the sex world. I laughed out loud and shook my head. <br /> <br /> The style direction borrows strongly from Se7en, but here it is done much easier and too obviously. To call it a poor man would be underestimated by Se7en, it is actually nothing more than a TV movie, and even Jolie's and Washington's best efforts cannot convince him that this is a box movie.
