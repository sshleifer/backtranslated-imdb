I will introduce my review, noting that I am not a fan of the independent "direct video" genre, which owes great debt to the films of the 60s. I do not own it, I have never rented it, so I may not have enough of these linguistic, low-budget stinkers that many other people feel. <br /> <br /> I caught this movie on Cinemax late Saturday night with a lady. Please do not ask why I saw Cinemax one Saturday night with a lady. We had boring World Cup poker. Misty Mundae (somehow I wish he wouldn't come from Illinois because we really see some very bright people) bad behavior. Usually, some good soft core porni would be yours and your partner's mood. Some good sex, language is exciting humor and who knows what could happen? After about 15 minutes, and the scene where the title characters attract the sacrificial sacrifice, my friend said that if you wanted to review this fine, I'd go to bed so I don't have to do it. Please turn off the volume. 'Here's what I gather on the terrain: Misty's character is a sexless nerd who bites a horse and becomes a super-sex kitten with superpower birds not coming from his wrist. Some evil villaines involved, who didn't seem particularly evil or sexy. Spiderbabe saves the day, gets sex, MJ (who is the man of this movie) always gets a stereotypical suggestion of bad horse riders, but somehow it breaks out of the evil building. <br /> <br /> What was good about this movie? It ended. <br /> <br /> What was that bad about? Organizing a third-class contest looks like an Oscar winner, a script that was shown by people I photograph, drunk, college-age sex exchange, who doesn't know what sex is when they took Dr. effect that was about as special as someone jumping from a trampoline, humor about as funny as ??? Well, I haven't met anything with the camera yet. Sex Scenes? When we watch the video, the only thing the scenes would have turned on is a fast back and forth button. And action scenes? Some of my old Atari VCS games were better choreographies. <br /> <br /> Now I know that this type of movie should be enjoyed for its inherent malice. Businesses like NO do not intend to make good films: they have a niche and they direct it. My experience as a marketer tells me they have the right to serve their audience. But after a short contact with "Spiderbabe", I can say that I will not wrestle this world again. Perhaps the problem of filmmakers in this genre is this: they spend so much on film making badly that if they try to focus on the things they do very well, they would be very pleasant in the "Le bad" cinema, in the 80s la Troma movies . Sorry people; the spirit exists but there is no effort. <br /> <br /> While I have to admit that "Alice in Acidland" intrigues me?
