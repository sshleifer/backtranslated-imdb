It must be one of the worst films coming out of the Sci-Fi channel. The way the film starts is the only women on this planet, because in the not too distant future the chemical war is not OK if it is only for soldiers (if you were thinking, men). fires (big shock) and all men on the earth are slowly dying. Then all the male persons die when the president's president is shot down and killed. now we have about 60-70 years, two female scientists are working on female baby cloning and one of them says, "Hey, why don't we bring men back?" The other says that the world is not ready for that, but ignores it immediately and so the man goes back to Eathi. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film assumes that all men who are not genetically modified are blood thirsty monsters. Secondly, the forgetful forgotten to mention that today's soldiers are a good mix of male and female officials, so there is no real reason to have such a virus. This is the biggest time you can find. This film was able to insult my intellect not only with a bad story, but also with a lifetime style. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I give it to 1 out of 10, but only because I can't downgrade.
