USA AZN TV bought the rights to this movie and the network shows it in English with the title "PICKPOCKET". <br /> <br /> 1997 PICKPOCKET takes an amazing home-to-movie-style movie to an amazing unpleasant level. The film depicts the journey of a long-lived series of boring enthusiasts and confused guys. This guideline, Xiao Wu, is not simply targeted. Unfortunately, observers will soon realize that Xiao Wu has an unrivaled talent to look for and stay close to the most unpleasant noise in China. Spreading empty tin buckets that are beaten with a stick - he's there. Every old Chinese engine grabs the torment - he's there. Nutt? Yeah, you guessed it, he's there! According to THE PICKPOCKET, China is the most irritating unpleasant sound on Earth. <br /> <br /> The only element worse than PICKPOCKET's sound is photography. The camera shakes, shakes and shakes something else. Finally, camera photos, but then it falls on the actor's knees and just stays there until someone in the team understands the mistake and starts shaking the camera again. Most shaky movies are framed by distant, long, long and long frames. A couple of times when the camera goes somewhat close, there are no compelling considerations between the viewer and its occurrence. <br /> <br /> Photography is dark, faded and often cloudy. The use of color is - well, there is no intelligence controlling the use of color. Most of each picture is 20 times too long. Few movies are so painful to sit. This movie hurts to look and hurt to hear. And then it just ends. <br /> <br /> John Woo fans can enjoy listening to some of the soundtrack from the DIE XUE SHUANG XIONG (KILLER) as the wiring is hanging from the video store for many minutes. Anyway, be warned - PICKPOCKET steals your good time.
