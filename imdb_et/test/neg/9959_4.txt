OK, I've recently seen George Zucco in at least four separate horror / staging films because I was working my way through different 50-pack collections and I have to say that the boy was limited but he was good, did. He wasn't Karloff, but China managed to get him. <br /> <br /> But the poor man was stuck in a ghetto on the back of some horror movies and he wasn't good enough to bring them to the next level of interest ... not with thread - scarce scenarios and direction and budgets he worked for. That's right. <br /> <br /> This movie is good, slow, stagne and mostly challenging. The "heroine" seems to be a version of Judy Garland's rental center, the "hero" is a white rice, a nice friend, and an enemy playing a monster doesn't even get a good transformation. deal. The effects that make up her are not at all intimidating - she looks like a slightly hairy version of the farm. <br /> <br /> It's not all waste. Zucco looks good on the camera, looks at the landscape, but can deliver some terribly influenced and generated calls without flowing or losing. Here and there are some moody B & W shots that don't suck completely. <br /> <br /> So all this movie helped some "C" level Z players pay rent for another month and never hit a certain hacked quality level. See it once if you like George Zucco, or just feel the need to see every wolf-themed movie ever made.
