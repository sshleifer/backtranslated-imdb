After seeing Carlo Lizzan's documentary about Luchino Visconti, I was ahead of a higher expectation before watching this film made three years later by Adam Low. But my similar viewer was not happy ... I needed a critical opinion that I generally dislike because there are no documentaries that satisfy every viewer. There is also no documentary that will fully explore the subject. But when I read the comments on this title, I also felt a little confused. Sometimes people do not know what to criticize. So, to be clear, I share this movie into two major parts that differ significantly: former Visconti before his director's career and the last director of Visconti. <br /> <br /> The aristocratic background, all the hobbies, the wealth that the young Luchino experienced and enjoyed is clearly presented. His horse racing has been mentioned as well as his relationship with his mother so much disturbed after the parents divorce. We also get a very precise idea of ​​where Luchino rose to the real number of Milan: rich wealth, babysitters, chefs who have access to everything, TRUE ARISTOCRACY. For example, this father proves a wonderful villa in Grazzano and other wonderful villas. Visconti's important visit to Paris was also highlighted in the 1930s, when he met eminent people ("left-wing") who later influenced his style and message in art. This clearly explains the idea of ​​the communists with aristocratic education (contrast at first glance). <br /> <br /> However, some of his director's career, which began with OSSESSIONE during World War II and ended with INNOCENTE just before his director's death in 1976, has been badly done. His films are not being discussed well. Why? Because there are very few people who really have something to say. Director Franco Zeffirelli remembers the works of LA TERRA TREMA and that's fine. There are also some interviews with Franco Rosos. But later, films such as IL GATTOPARDO, LA CADUTA DEI REI, LA MORTE A VENEZIA or LUDWIG are mostly discussed by Helmut Berger. Although I liked the role of Ludwig as a participant, I didn't like his interviews. What's more, some of the thoughts he publishes are not accurate in such a documentary ... Visconti, like the CONVERSATION PIECE, is not mentioned, interviewed by Burt Lancaster. Silvana Manganot and Romy Schneider should also be mentioned. There is one interview with Maria Callas, which seems interesting, but it is only short. Franco Zeffirelli, although I appreciate her as a director, makes it all fun when she says something very valuable. For example, he mentions the event that Visconti has been separated from him after years of service. I therefore say: simplified and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> What I find is visual interviews with Visconti himself. As a result, we can get an opinion on our work. For example, I appreciate the many words he says about death that it is a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth. He also talks about his health problems after striking LUDWIG. I believe it is better to see Carlo Lizzani's LUCHINO VISCONTI (1999) as this document. Although it is shorter and shortened in its entirety, you will get a better overview of the director. Visconti would be furious about it and his rage turned to people's emotions and perspectives on the stone ... 4/10
