This film had so much potential to be fun, but it was moving, but it didn't. It was a great story, it just didn't get as good as it could have been. The strange "hallucinations" did not make any sense of sleep during the scenes and were certainly not needed, they did not affect or improve or give any idea of ​​what came or was happening. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder's character was OK, but it could have been expanded. He played his best embarrassing part. The character was funny, but again it wasn't as it could. <br /> <br /> Mila's character was perfect and her performance was on the spot. <br /> <br /> Finally, writing was terrible and more often than not, there was no point in it and its hallucinations didn't fit the movie at all. This film, which has better scripting and management, could have been a candidate for the National Lampoon Vacation, if it's a funny, bad thing that happens to a person traveling across America. <br /> <br /> Instead, it was just another flush. If I had seen it in the theater, I would have demanded my money back and boycotted the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing this film was about was an hour and a half of its life. Also, all the participants in the film were able to see badly, just because the film was smelly. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie to anyone! Never!
