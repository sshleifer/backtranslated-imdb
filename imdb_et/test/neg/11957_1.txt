This is an extremely horrible movie. And if your thought has seen another terrible movie, just like before, it probably is. You probably saw a scarecrow made in 2003 2. Yes, what I said, Brian (director) stole the idea of ​​the movie. And not only did he steal, but he could have made it worse. I bet even the actors were afraid to tell people they were in the movie. I must also mention that the director tried to make up for the cheese, showing as many tits as possible. Also kissing scenes were put together like a porn movie. In fact, it is probably all that the director has ever seen and tried to put together a decent film that never works.
