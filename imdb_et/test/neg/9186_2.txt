"Wagons East" was a big disappointment for me. But the saddest thing about this movie is that it turned out to be John Candy's last film role (he just died before he finished shooting). For this western spoof and ridiculous comedy, only a few laugh. If you want to see noisy western movies, the answer is obvious. Watch Mel Brooks' classic "Blazing Saddles". Or, if you want to see Candy in much better material, see "Summer Vacation", "Spaceballs" or "Uncle Buck" (just to name a name). These three films (as well as others) show us what a great comic actor he was. Unfortunately, there are no "Wagons East". What a shame! <br /> <br /> * (Four)
