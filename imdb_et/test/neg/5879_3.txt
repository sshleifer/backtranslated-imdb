I took this film because it hit my eye as a Jewish comedy film - something I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> I approached this film with open mind and wondered how it started. Opening is well assembled and the first half of the film gave me a lot of laugh, and that's good. <br /> <br /> But humor quickly became repetitive, confusing and tense, and I realized that I no longer enjoyed the movie. I have tried not to say this, but the movie was rather "cheap" - it wasn't bad for comedy when humor sticks, but it wasn't. I admit that I can stay with some humor, not myself with the little experience of Jewish and Jewish culture. However, given how much the telegraph was a big part of humor, it was a film, it is unlikely that I did not miss much. <br /> <br /> The idea is good and maybe, if I thought about this movie somewhat more, it would have been watched all the time. I wish I could get a movie with a higher rating, but to put it strictly, it would have been better as a series of TV series or sketches. There was not enough valuable material for a full movie. <br /> <br /> One thing to say about casting - the leading role looked like Ben Stiller had in mind, but I don't think the film would have been more useful than it would have been.
