In many cases, the description is "full of sound and rage that does not mean anything" and is correct. Unfortunately, code 46 has no sound or rage. A little bit of rage would have been very welcome. Tim Robbins' character (William) is not so passionate that his idea of ​​falling in love with Mary (Samantha Morton) seems almost absurd. These people are so passionate that they start thinking about whether the water supply of this future world has been given to torazine. The film is characterized by "Brave New World", which contributes to every scene that is about 2-3 stops in overexposure. Unfortunately, this technique is tedious and quite difficult for the eyes. Languages ​​of cishy mishmash also grow annoying if it seems that its existence is not obvious. Many futuristic, sci-fi movies have been criticized for being all flashes and not having content. This film has no flash or substance. Its code 6 is all the time.
