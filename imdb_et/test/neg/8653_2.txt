I had some expectations of this movie because 1. It was the production of Yash Raj 2. When the songs were first on television, they seemed memorable. 3. Cast a Star (??!) Was New. Well, I have to say that I just couldn't sit through this movie. Uday, (red lips - what are the artists who think?) Try to watch hard but fail. I won't even start with my behavior (if you call it). "The Queen of Cleavage" Tanisha, with all her screaming and fluttering wounds, makes your hair frustrated. I think Uday was more tolerant to him! She must take her sister exhibitions seriously. The story is pathetic ... the same old-tried formula. Definitely no originality. There's nothing worth in this movie. Makes me wonder why this is done first!
