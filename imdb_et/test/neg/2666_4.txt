Michael Myers, a dirty, not-so-young-more psycho, who seems to be much sharper in every appearance, has been raised by his druid brothers to destroy more threats to his family members and others who are on their way. The logic gaps seem to have been ignored for the benefit of the whole body census. Michael, who preferred strangulation and kitchen knives, learns to ax the spin and use whatever tools are needed to remove his victims, and the result is a terrible, patchwork, dollar store movie that some really horrible events practically don't help. Donald Pleasance, who died shortly after production, seems to have a story in this story simply that * someone * could be an asterisk. You don't want to cover your eyes during this, but you shake your head down with John Carpenter's classic work.
