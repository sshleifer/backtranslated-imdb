This highly anticipated classical music class and the bitter pill that he had to take was necessary. Very hard to swallow ... it's all. It was not a credibility anywhere. And if you don't have a rose, you don't have an example. <br /> <br /> Bette Midler seemed to be born to play this part. But everything she was able to produce was cute, funny, brilliant, the trademark Bette Midler ... with all the familiar Midleryms. Roz Russell has nothing to worry about. She can rest in her grave, knowing she's still the final Mama Rose (for the movie). <br /> <br /> I thought Midler was going all the time ... to throw himself into one of the biggest musical tasks all the time ... as he did "The Rose". But no, he played it safely. He played himself. He made Rose the whole dinner cinema. Even his songs were forced. It was a crazy look, knowing that Midler's talent was able to rise above his money-earning schtick. He showed promise only once in this "gypsy" and it was "Rose's Turn". But then it was too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Sincere Cynthia Gibb as the title hero gave the film the only real spark and when the role of the Roma goes beyond the role of Rose, you know there are problems along the river. <br /> <br /> Big, huge fall.
