This movie was recommended to me so we went to see it together. I wouldn't call it a movie, it's a combination of 10 different unfinished, illogical songs that aren't all funny. There are several characters in the movie that initially seemed important and they just disappeared. He just tries to fit everything in 2 1/2 hours. I left the show without thinking about what happened to this and that man. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is just an extended version of "Hitch", which is polished with much more characters and dance. <br /> If this is the best movie that this couple has ever done, I'm pretty sure I don't like any of his previous ones.
