I have the pain to see that the fantastic movie turns into a flat, repetitive and lazy one. It is filled with holes in the plot and the plot is confused by BAD. Anyone who was a spy writer decided to turn such a big movie into such a rubbish, should have done some research, instead of filling it with one liner and hollow new letters, and the classic first jokes from OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER. Of course, they get a little creative, but the same episode looks like a little twist. Listening to Creed or Nickleback is pretty much like it. Kuzco has to fail, Yzmal has a complicated plan, but decides to go easy to save time and just use drinking water, no one doubts the monkey and the bug, Bucky appears in the background, Kuzco flirts with Malina, disrupts him without sounding like a slut, Yzma hides himself "the main Amz" and he calls Kronk and forgets he is Yzma. I admit that there are moments in this exhibition. Another problem is that Yzma looks younger and Pacha looks ... weird. Also, no one can replace David Spad and John Goodman! Those who made Kuzco and Pacha Kuzco and Pacha! Sorry, but I'll give it two thumbs down.
