This movie does not know what it wants to be: is it usually fun movies? Is it satirical? Should this be a black comedy? It's really one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Lori Petty is annoying. There I said what everyone else was thinking. It's bad enough that he's such a terrible actor (Route 666, Bates Motel), but he's not even a central b-movie actor. Her voice-like voice, strange ways, and bad comic timing give this movie all the way to the end, until you want to get your head up and stop the pain. movie at all costs. You're glad you did.
