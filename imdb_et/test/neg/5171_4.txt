First of all, I'll give this movie to the low point 4 out of 10! It was more than a wannabe movie. I felt this movie despite it. I led people to make it more dramatic and more facts about a true story based on. Instead, I spent more than an hour watching the Middle Ages, which means breaking the law and taking drugs. <br /> <br /> It's like a football factory, but there's no real story and no good ending. After watching the movie, I thought, "What was that movie?" If you like movies that don't have a real story and a lot of drugs and swearing, it's a movie for you. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of mobiles and gangsters, but this movie didn't live a leap. I can see where the writer was trying to go to the movie, but it never reached the destination. One of the worst British films I've ever seen. If only the film had more story, it would have a very good film.
