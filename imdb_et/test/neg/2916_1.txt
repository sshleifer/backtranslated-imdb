Possible spoiler warning, although there is not much damage to this movie. I saw Part A of Project A did not see the first movie. I don't think I missed much. The second part of the project is not only the worst film of Jackie Chan I've ever seen (yes, worse than the Fantasy Mission Force), this movie is one of the most invisible films the world has ever seen. It's right where the sleep inducing scale is "Plan 9 From Space Space". The plot is twisted and knotted like a 50-foot yarn ball that the cat has played and eventually died. "Humor", if you call it, seems to have been written by a tedious high school gate who, despite how many people tell him that he is not funny, has decided to get his flat humor no matter how painful the film is made. And this movie is painfully bad. The plot includes Jackie Chan as a naval officer recruited by the police to round off "all known criminals". He rounded them in the first half of the film and I prayed for a quick stop that I didn't get. Why the film tends to move from this point, I have no idea. The film pulls on and on, and without any purpose, plot and humorous experiments that fail so unhappy, they make Carrot Topi like a comedy genius. Kung Fu in this movie is flat and forgotten. In this movie, 3 Ninja children are better Kung Fu. Part II of the project is neither a feature film nor a kung fu film, but it is a complete waste of Jackie Chan's and Maggie Cheung's talents who have made it a better film world. As Jackie Chan repeatedly flees from certain death, I enter Blair's witchcraft by asking (and I wish) `Will he die right away so that the film may end? An example of how this film is ridiculous: Jackie Chan is a handcuff for another man. Pirates (not seeing any pirates) throw an ax at Jack. Does Jackie grab one of the tricky axes and break the chain of handcuffs? If you have a friend who laughs at everything, then I encourage you to watch this movie with him and see that even if they do not go out of the movie. Do not use a heavy machine while looking at Part A of Plan A. Possible side effects are headache, retinal strain, and death boredom.
