The use of "astral projection" (wandering soul) outside the body, which results in a terrible death (.. breaking the internal victims that lead to intermittent vertebrae and broken organs), near those who have this ability, is a threat to ETERNAL EVIL by providing Karen Black (... as Janus) has another "unique" character to fool a woman who affects the commercial director, Paul Sharpe (Winston Rekert), who is tired of marriage and a boring career. In reality, he is dying and needs his body, his spirit can be harmful to his wife and son (.. his son has a "special friend" who tells him about things, even poisoning himself at one point). Detective, Kauffman (John Novak), investigating unusual killings associated with the death of a benevolent spirit, binds Paul to death and finds Janus through him. Soon, both will realize that Janus must be stopped or he just moves to another person's host. Paul does not know that his new secretary is Janus lover, both were actually older intellectuals who were in their documentary Astral projection called WANDERING SOUL. the strange atmosphere of this film, which contains a rather strange assumption. It seems that Paul's boy sees the movement of the spirit in the form of a "blue man", manipulating the boy for malpractice. Black, in spite of stellar care, rarely captures, using her face, which can cause malignant evil. Instead, he shot it far away, his voice duplicated, and he's never quite sure it's a dangerous chance. For some reason, despite the intriguing (..and oddball) idea that astral projection causes the spirit to kill people from within, the film just never lets. The soundtrack is very "Yanni-ish" and lighting (.. and sound), but sometimes moody and effective, is often quite dim. Stimulation is also a problem as the story goes along. The cast is rather limp, especially in the lead position of Rekert, at best its inconsistency. It doesn't help to have little signs (... except Paul's husband), we could care less and what really hurts is that Paul himself is not the most lovable person in the world. Moody, his outstanding career is the cause of this behavior. Black should be the most prominent figure in the film, but it is mostly in the background, talking in a dialogue between Paul and Kauffman, but rarely does he get the chance to entertain his histrionics, which is a shame.
