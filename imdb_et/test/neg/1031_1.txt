Here's a typical Rachael Ray show: <br /> <br /> 1. The amazing theme song begins to play and Rachael goes down on her Snapcrotch outfit in this strange cargo lift. 2. He starts running around yelling and / or listening to the audience, then screams while sitting. 3. Uncomfortable monologue. <br /> <br /> (Next in every order) 4. Rachael's own horn-producing segment (ie "I lost 500 pounds with Rach's recipes", Rachael Ray saved my life, "" Rachael's Fashion Tips. ") 5. Absolutely useless DIY tip (ie how to put words in casseroles, how to use your washing machine as a salad attachment, how to build a light jewel tube on it). Rachael Crowns (ie I say to every woman yes, I have nothing but a lady combined and I can't find the time to make a makeup housewife) .What they would do without you Rachael. Reasons why this show should be avoided like plague: 1. Fakeness: Rachael Ray argues that the whole show is unpublished. Who has participated in the show has claimed that the whole performance has been written. that is, people have mentioned that there is even a very strict dress for the exhibition. <br /> <br /> 2. His show jumps too much: Where Oprah, the tallest man of all time, has a solid theme for his show, then Rachael jumps like an ADHD soda child. On average, his show may be 10, a short, worthless segment. The second time you get Kojo fashion tips and the next Rachael makes a gross package of "Spanish" paprika with manchego cheese and the next is a gigantic anakonda on stage and next, well, you get the picture. . <br /> <br /> 3. Rachael is a bad idea with bad ideas: Rachael's hosting ability is at best terrible. His questions about his celebrity guests are bad and often not important for the interview, and his segments are unpleasant and offer little educational or humorous value. <br /> <br /> All in all, you don't have to waste your time with this schlock. It will be canceled soon.
