So we should find it funny that this woman is driving all the way to the jungle - to Warzone - to find out why her groom did not travel to Switzerland? Or should we take it seriously? It's not even funny, smart or fun - it's stupid - and so is the movie. The leading actor is one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in the movie - even worse than Jar-Jar Binks. The dialogue is trying to be very funny (almost all the time), but it is never. The number of funny jokes is nothing from scratch. And as in the case of the plot - did they even bother to explain to us what the insurgents are in the fight (other than anti-government)? I think it's not important to anyone - not to the insurgents or the characters who just flew into the battlefield. Don't waste your time. "Coronado" is not funny or fun.
