very frustrating and inconsistent - every time and then the germ of the idea develops and it is thrown to the next line - it was the feeling of a movie that was cut and cut again to do the job - i was bored and confused, and i'm talking big fan. Many jokes were original and tired, the medieval section went too long and the quality of the action was very bad - some small guest sites like Simon Peg and Liam Cunningham did more than 30 seconds more than the headache in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's really shameful. <br /> <br /> The only really interesting thing was to look at the Soho Square in a small barn - that's all who ever wondered about London.
