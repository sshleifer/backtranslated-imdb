The only reason I know this movie is because I wanted to see what Nancy McKeon had been, because the facts of life ended. When I was looking for her name, it came up with a relatively new TV movie. After a lot of research, I managed to find a copy and I was deeply disappointed with what I was looking at. D Grade Action, Bad Script, Dreadful FX - It was like watching toned, amazed day after day tomorrow, which went 3 hours. Despite the long working hours, the signs remain rather underdeveloped, we don't care about them at all and in most cases they want to die. Combine this with terrible lighting and cinematography, and you have a real catastrophe. How they appeared in so many "name" actors (i.e., Dianne Weist, Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy) in such a trash can be a holiday. All in all - I want these 3 hours back from my life!
