Ego. This film seems to be the only reason. This movie is so wrong in so many ways that it is a lot to write down about its dignity about it. Every character was good for self-prayer and for the leading actors (I use this term liberally as well as the director) in the resemblance of the stone. a little story, if it is, will fail in key aspects such as logic, feeling and drama. The direction leaves much to be desired. everywhere there are rough mistakes (character motives are not defined, potential spouses are found overnight, broken car windows are changing among others) <br /> <br /> Let's face it, Himesh can't act. neither can Hansika Motwani. In her defense, she is still a plump child who looks older than thanks to a ton of make-up. Raj Babbar transcends and makes him an insignificant counterfeit. Darshan Jariwala laughs a little too much. The actor who plays Himeshi's friend is the only natural one. Some questions come to mind: how does such a movie cost 5,000,000 Rs? where did the money go? gave one of the chasing order a moderately well-off and Mallika Sherawat was rewarded with a 15-minute look and 2 songs of Rs.15 million. but the movie fool tells the mind. (including 3 Mumbai car rickshaws that show up and jump in a police car) <br /> <br /> Good: Himesh shows courage by letting the movie sound its nose and brand "Top". Let's give Devil a fee for her: Himesh, as usual, gives good music. <br /> <br /> Bad: Direction, story, Himeshi song is still hard to ignore <br /> <br /> Ugly: Dialogues and everything else !!! <br /> <br /> Final Word: Pain in every sense! watch this movie only if you loved Subhash Ghai "Yaadein"
