Okay, it's really very bad compared to the first movie, very much so critically acclaimed with the Rosemary baby. In fact, it is generally a poor film. Yes, there are some redeeming qualities, but I'll go for it later. <br /> <br /> Well, the last movie has been going on for a while ... actually it's pretty much eight years I believe. Rosemary is still trying to escape with her child and influence her in a good way, rather than letting her go to the evil future of the tribe (or "tribe") assigned to her. When he leaves with him and the empty bus reaches him and leaves his child with the whore, the whore pulls him before he is at the age where Satan tries to conquer him, because he seems to push his evil inheritance out of course. and then it is over that I have felt a serious shame if I haven't seen it because I heard "Rosemary's Baby"! Okay, when I was about 11 years old, I saw a Rosemary baby masterpiece and then read the sequel of the book. Thinking that this movie was an adaptation, I watched this movie and got it ... was I doing it right? Well, somehow, yes ... I'm a real fan of this franchise and I can say I've seen a sequel, and I have an idea what happens after the first movie events (both of which are talking about) this movie AND "Rosemary's son", Ira Levin's own a sequel to a book that is not yet adapted to the film. <br /> <br /> Ruth Gordon, who played Minnie's first movie, has been shown in this movie a few times, but why-oh-why is it so different? The Rosemary knife had fallen on the first film and seized from the ground, but Minnie pulled it out! Currently, the tribal is called the tribe (as I said earlier). Now they go with hoods that sing "Hail Satan ... Hail Adrian ... Hail Satan ... Hail Adrian ..." and so on and so on. The Gothic building is now like a two-storey house in the middle of a lawn somewhere, it looks like a little nice suburb or something! And the child itself is quite normal because his eyes are all crazy when he gets angry and kills someone or something in vain. <br /> <br /> As far as the actor goes, it's pretty bad in all parts except Stephen McHattie, who is played by a very grown-up Adrian. Pattie Duke Astin, replacing Mia Farrow's Rosemaryna, must be one of the definite WORST performances ever captured! It's so bad that it's almost not even funny ... when he screams, "OH MY GOD!" and crying like a movie for the fifteenth time, you're like "Okay, it's not funny anymore" and when she's gone and the movie has only been twenty minutes, you're like TODAY Lord, I don't have to hear she says, " OH MY GOD! " SHEESH! Finally, this film has very little redemption qualities that are sufficient to receive at least four stars. But if you look at it as a serious sequel to the first movie, it's pretty much non-existent.
