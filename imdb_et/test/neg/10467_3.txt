Now, before I tell you, it's a non-spoiler. Bone Eater hits her mark to be the worst film of the year. I don't know how these movies even get on DVD. If I saw it in theaters, I would be very upset. Bone Eater talks about people digging an ancient burial site and finding some bones. This is "Bone eater" and the more bones he eats, the more powerful he will be. <br /> <br /> First of all, I thought the DVD-work was horrible and it sounds creepy. When I rented it and watched it on a DVD, it seemed scary. But when I played it, I can agree on one thing - the title "Bone Eater" is better than the film itself. Tell me, what's more stupid? Bone eater who just attacked bones, ate you and disappear? Don't worry that this is not a spoiler you see in the first 5 minutes. Or is it even more stupid that "bone-eaters" is a horse? You know what I think is stupid? The whole movie. <br /> <br /> CGI is terrible. Yeah, I thought the idea of ​​"Bone Eater" was horrible, but if you see the real thing you think is an action movie or just a cruel, insane joke. The film seemed longer than Titanic and it was half an hour. When a movie has its breaks, it stops easily. I admit that the actor was not the best, but actually decent, and that the violence was not universal, but everything else is smelly. <br /> <br /> In general, the beater is a movie that you can skip. If you like interesting movies with big creatures, a big CGI and a temporary "Bone Eater" is a movie to skip. If you like bad movies, no matter if they are Jews, "Bone Eater" will satisfy.
