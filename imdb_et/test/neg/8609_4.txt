I watched this world premiere on the Starz Action Channel. They call it vampires. The plot was a little confusing. There is a voice in the introduction to the 800-year-old war, and I did not understand quite well. The film is about a young couple somewhere in Asia (maybe in China, I don't think the film will specify). The couple has an argument, and Meredith Monroe runs down and robs the Vampire biker gang. The bachelor finds a group of vampires that don't kill people, and battles with bikers. The killers of the human group are involved somehow and the final combat sequence takes place during the solar eclipse. This movie is not about vampires or vampires: Los Muertos. Confusing but decent action. Four out of ten stars.
