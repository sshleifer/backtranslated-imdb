Reading the comments from other users, A666333 reviewed the review by most of what I felt about all the predictable lines of the film, the lesbian / heterosexual cliché versions (i.e., the straight woman becomes lesbian, concluding that her husband is abusive and aggressive). <br /> <br /> The score was also very disappointing. It was a gentle, soft, sentimental elevator music - another common cliché in lesbian movies. There would have been some interesting dramatic moments in the film if music hadn't destroyed them. <br /> <br /> Some of the sex and erotic scenes also struck me as an attempt to shock and raise the value of the shock, including some of this end result scene. Ordinary "hot and steamy" moments were as boring as too sentimental. For example, during the pool scene, women can kiss, and then the cameras are laid off by abandoned wine glass, flowing water, their strong breathing sound, which is a soft crash on the wave. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the costumes and the arobat. They are well choreographic and the development of the two-character attractiveness felt very natural during training scenes. I smiled at them, and at the last scene with a police officer. But they weren't enough to counter the negative or make me enjoy this movie.
