This film had the potential to be a decent thriller, but it was hampered by just about twenty minutes of good scripting, mostly used in the beginning. After that, the story began to appear that the car could be driven. The film was followed by a downward curve of good ordinary bad laughs at the time of its conclusion. This is not recommended.
