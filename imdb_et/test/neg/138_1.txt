I am IT (1997) <br /> <br /> No Limit Films Developed and Published <br /> <br /> Pros: Absolutely Not <br /> <br /> >> Cons: I don't even know where to start! <br /> <br /> Plot Summary: Master P plays a drug dealer who looks, speaks, and acts more than a live-action-cartoon. This is all the movie I got out of this movie. <br /> <br /> See: I remember when I was in the ninth grade at the time of this release and all in my class was praised by a clown called Master P. This movie is so bad, it's not even funny. All the characters in this movie are extremely tired stereotypes, the sound is only heard when the music plays and the film looks like it is video-clipped from public channels. Luckily, I didn't buy this movie like all the other degenerate classmates in my city. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 <br /> <br /> My decision: Avoid video like this sexually transmitted disease.
