<br /> <br /> I liked some of the 80's Hollywood competitions. They had icons like Arnie and Sly, but I think the 90's action film has fallen into new depths. The worst of them, in my opinion, was Armageddon. <br /> <br /> The plot is shamelessly animated and pulls the worst clich√©s as it tries to excite the viewers. Melodram is so tempting to saccharin and terrible that you can't really wait until Bruce Willis disappears from the screen. Liv Tyler, who had acted impressively in a number of fines with independent qualities led by masters such as Bernardo Bertolucci and Robert Altman, unfortunately decided to jump into a commercial vehicle. This film symbolizes new Hollywood aesthetics and valuable little good dialogue or authentic melodrama. This is the norm these days and I'm starting to wonder if Hollywood has the role of screenwriters. They just seem to use cages and committees to write light scripts. The rest they leave on technology. There is no great, heartfelt human emotion in Armageddon. It just looks empty and empty. I can only think of one good aspect of this movie, and this includes Liv Tyler's father, who doesn't even appear in the movie. The Steven Tyler ensemble Aerosmith offers a movie theme song - ballad that really rises and at least pulls the hearts a little when the final credits come up. predictable, cumbersome movie. It means lower, lethargy and a decrease in human intellect. I would even prefer to see the eighth Friday the 13th.
