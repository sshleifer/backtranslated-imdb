A great book, a badly made movie. Cheesy's performances and evolved situations make this film sentimental. For most of the actors, flat and unsolicited work is left in the special class after school. There is no doubt that there is a lot of talent in this casting and team, but something went horribly wrong The very talented Gretchen Mol is trying to pull it out of the flame of the film, but even he doesn't seem to be in the ascending dialogue. It seems that everyone just called it. Even makeup (Mulrooney aged 20 years in the film) sees amateur and crude oil. Don't waste your time with this clunker .... read the book.
