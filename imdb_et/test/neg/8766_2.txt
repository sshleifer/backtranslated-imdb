At the back of this movie, "Chey is the Quentin Tarantino of Christian films." This is not so much an insult to Quentin as Christian films. This film has been poorly written, rigidly acted and edited intently. Scenes play confused and unrealistic and are confused by some nice outdated photography. Returns, deterioration, fix frames to tell time (story insignificant) are all made for a visible reason, beyond enhancing film credibility. The camera is random, some nice crane shots are cut with ridiculous assemblies that don't matter. Bad blocking and lighting leave the viewer wondering who speaks in many scenes. Oh and the sound is terrible. Special effects were decent and fortunately limited. But it's just technical. Film does not participate in emotional level. The dialogue is so fake and the participants seem to have read it just for a moment before the camera rolls. The story ... things that happen in succession are not behind them. The characters try to hold one dimension. And the characters have to treat Christianity and faith in every scene. Turn the order of M. Night, the inclusion of Christian films does not have to bear the symbols of Jesus Christ in every film where the film is Christian. Goodness! Please do not try to show it to your unsaved friends except laughter.
