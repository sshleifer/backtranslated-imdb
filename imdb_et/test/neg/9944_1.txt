This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It should be a remake or update of Che Cheh's "one armed sword game". Ham-fisted direction and crappy fight choreography means that fighting scenes aren't even worth watching. The script is desperately trying to feel serious, but is full of clich√©s like "And I knew then that nothing would ever be the same ..." or "If I only knew what a hard price I would have to pay." Ugh! And who is this girl who plays Sing? Someone finds him and loses! He's terrible. If you like Chinese martial arts movies, it would be better for Lau Gar Leung. It stinks.
