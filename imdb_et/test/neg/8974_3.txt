Before getting out of work, I watched my "50 Movie Pack Comedy Classics" collection and chose the most confusing title in the package: Zis Boom Bah celebrated the forgotten Grace Hayes. "Classic" is obviously an operative word here, as most of the titles I've never heard of and suspect they are all in the public domain. Anyway, this movie celebrates his son Peter Lindi and his wife Mary Healy (who I just discovered I am in New Orleans, where I live, Louisiana) with Benny Rubin as the owner of the town house and in the Huntz hall of East Side Kids like Peter friend. On the plot where Vaudeville's mother is trying to make her rich negligent son responsible, without knowing who she is, for the birds, and she doesn't have many funny scenes, though I liked Peter's fame and her dance with Hall. And songs and dances are fun. Rubin, however, is the place where his confusion about the era of America and almost everything related to him makes no sense (although I liked his funny dance). Since it was only 61 minutes that I was sure I was playing on the lower half of the double fixture list, I am charitable and give it a few fun bits that I mentioned.
