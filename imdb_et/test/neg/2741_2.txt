I'm a pretty tolerant man when it comes to movies, even B-movies. I keep watching B movies on a regular basis and they can go astonishingly good, just awful. I usually set my expectations very low before watching these types of movies, and even after the Descent was just awful. I really don't mind hanging out of Core to some extent, but they didn't do anything interesting about the material. Some scientists are concerned about the seismic activity of the country and must move into the depths of the earth to stabilize the coat. So what we get is a monotonous long-term structure, where two Luke Perry and Rick Roberts duel scientists have to work with the ultimate secret mission, Project DEEP. Responsible man, General Fielding, played Michael Dorn, secretly leaves Marsha Crawford important information from Mimi Kuzyk. Rounding the pain is Natalie Brown, who plays Jen, a missionary who created a "Mole" cage that is used deeper into the depths of the Earth. <br /> <br /> Other than some pretty good special effects and designs, nothing in Descent is worth it. The film starts with a lot of fun, but it quickly catches the tiring story of the uncontrollable seismic activity that has been fatal in other films, such as Core. Descent also has a bad script that has a useless, forgotten dialogue between characters. There is literally no action, no real danger or danger, to worsen the situation. The comic defense tests are painfully wrong. The plot has opening holes and some sub-blocks remain at the end, leaving a bad taste in the mouth. <br /> <br /> When this movie was closed, it was just an inexpensive way for everyone to pay. There was no point behind this film, innovation, it's just there. Other than some beautiful special effects and designs, this movie fails on every other level. The story comes from the Hollywood trash and the characters are uninteresting. The descent will just let you into boredom and disappointment. Avoid at all costs.
