I've never done anything like that before, but this movie was literally so bad that I have to say something about it. <br /> <br /> I am all independent of film making, as seen last year in the worst (in my opinion) Hollywood exhibitions, it seems that the mainstream has just lost contact with what's good for making movies. This means that such films give the independent film a bad reputation. <br /> <br /> The characters are boring and too stupid to understand. The direction is terrible, drawing is terrible, the plot itself is terrible, away, far away. Only one short scene with a woman's naked breasts, and even one that was not worth the second sight. <br /> <br /> The most frightening thing in this movie is the idea of ​​ever seeing it again. I gave him 2 and not 1 just because the actors were visible and the sound was audible - it earns one point for every point.
