Among the many awards here, one individual whose comments asked if he was the only one (who wasn't surprised) - that is, this movie gave 3 stars. However, the comment continued the overall appeal of the story and the same output. Well, this person is not "the only one" who did not like this kind of production (add me!), But I even participate in the company with him. If you put the gun in your head and asked me to make a choice between taking a picture of me or watching it again, I'd definitely look at it - but I would probably think for 10 seconds. I'd rather stick alone or dry on the wall. In addition, I would not want to see this story again, anytime, anywhere or in an alternative presentation. Sometimes you feel like a comedian George Gobel's "brown pair of shoes when the rest of the world is tuxedo," and that's one for me. I liked Angela Lansbury in my favorite movie "Long Hot Summer" and although it wasn't a big fan, she enjoyed "Murder, She Wrote." But HERE - I was not only interested in the story or other aspects, but I found Angela breaking, dragging, singing, and just about her ultimate result, maybe MOST ANNOYING presence in any movie (or any other media) I've ever experienced. It was like Audrey Hepburn's endless continuation of "up" at Cockney chortling in Rex Harrison - "My Fair Lady" in earlier parts. But it happened on a plot that was presented for light, comic, and (gracefully) short. It was nothing, not short, and it seemed to me that it would have been about ten hours (Einstein's ignorant explanation of "relativity" at work.) If I had not been with my friends, I would stay, My viewing would have been short. However, I laughed at the "Seinfeld" episode, where Elaine complains all because she tells them how much she didn't like "English patient". My friends kept me somewhat the same way as I interrupted the ecstatic affliction of this movie. Give me some dragging nails loud over the chalkboard.
