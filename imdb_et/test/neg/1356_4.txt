A little crazy. Even if you haven't seen George Cork's Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine and a thousand other stars, you can leave this forced politically correct, depressing comedy. Depressing for several reasons. Meg Ryan one. What has he done? His face can hardly move. This alone puts its miles away from Norma Shearer. Annette Bening should appeal to DP and Debra Messing what the hell did she do here? Actors who have no connection with the public's subconscious are trying to convey friends completely convincingly. Eva Mendes Joan Crawford has a terrible failure. What a terrible idea! His character is like a sex-sex performer without any taste or subtlety. We believe that a woman has adapted and directed women. The only positive thing I mention is the brief but very funny appearance of Bette Midler and Cloris Leachman as a housekeeper.
