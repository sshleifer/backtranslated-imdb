Rare and favorable are the moments of film making when greatness is a decisive monument to the rest of the industry to measure itself and to dive into this glorious moment. <br /> <br /> Some stories tell about their time and strive for high classical and legendary things. Throw the ensemble's established skills at the top of their games. <br /> <br /> "Where's all originality gone?" It's here because of this story and it's cast through a plot and story that not only promotes, but also entertains even the most experienced Shakespeare / action / love story. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine where the writers dreamed this extraordinary story. Where do geniuses get such inspiration? I now have hope for mankind, knowing that such a talent is still there, I hope that we will do it for the stars and beyond, perhaps for the gates of the heavens. <br /> <br /> Like others, I have dreamed of size. Although I did not write this film, I saw it and because of the supremacy of this film, I feel like I was elevated to a higher level, to a higher spiritual integrity. <br /> <br /> It is no wonder that such honor in the lives of most of us. What will happen to our world if we could all achieve this magnificence? We would probably consume the white light of super-nova glory if we were to become over-dimensional spiritual beings capable of all-powerful creative power. <br /> <br /> The most important thing to know is with your whole heart and the essence of your being is that "Tomcats" is not something I have talked about. "Tomcats" is the opposite of all. It can destroy our world. Because some reviewers appreciate the movie in the star system, ie 1 to 5 stars or even zero stars, I appreciate "Tomcats" in the black hole. <br /> <br /> I am ready to donate money to the reasons that stop the fear factors that seem to be running out of the box in offices. I'm not even unfavorable to the use of nuclear weapons. It must stop. How much more can we do about it before foreigners come here from space and blow up our planet because we have so many stupid, hard, vulgar, unimaginable and humiliating films that fly out of Hollywood? I'm not even going to make this movie worthy of mentioning someone's name that marked it or produced it. I don't even waste my time to describe this story because we've seen this ba-zillion and all previous versions were at least ga-zillion times better. <br /> <br /> By the way, my head almost worshiped during this movie, but with the ultimate self-conscious effort and good luck I lived to warn the public. You have been warned.
