In 1913, Carlton Mine, Addytown, Pennsylvania, a cruel owner of the mine uses poor children for investigation and after the explosion, a group of children are buried alive. At this time, Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) has just lost her husband after her long-term illness when her family's savings have been spent on treatment. Without any money, he and his daughter Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) move to the old countryside of his wife. Her neighbors recommend Karen to stay home at night and Sarah hears there are zombies in the area. When Emma becomes a friend of Mary, she believes she is an imaginary friend. But when the children of Zahie attack and live Sarah's friends, Emma disappears, Karen and Sarah pursuing her near the mine. ; make-up is horrible; cinema and music scores are great. Nevertheless, the story, and consequently the scenario, is very weak, indeed a bad cluster of clichés. The beginning is sensible if the widow moves to a distant house, because the family spent all her resources with the patriarch's disease. But when he arrives, small zombies accidentally attack people without consequences, for example, families are not looking for missing people. Then the evil Mr Carlton comes up with the most disgusting attitudes, typical clichés he finally dies. There is no explanation why the children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after Carlton's killing. When Sarah escapes with her mother and says she is tired and unable to drive, this is one of the most stupid things I've ever seen in a horror movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Zombies"
