Very durable, but ultimately harmless, children's literary classic, featuring an animated part in the style of MARY POPPINS (1964) and BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS (1971). The majority of the person is very special - James Mason, Billie Whitelaw, David Tomlinson, Joan Greenwood, Bernard Cribbins - but their roles range from a messy (69-year-old Mason as a stealing chimney sweeper) to an insignificant (Greenwood as aristocrat) is odd (Whitelaw plays several " exotic signs - including circus performer, old action, maid and fairy - for no apparent reason). <br /> <br /> The film, headed by a group of East European animators, is hardly inspired, but somewhat enjoyable in itself, and as usual, with this type of thing, there is a choice of songs that one must adhere to. too often for their own good. The film was directed by the character character Jeffries, who had previously directed (much more successfully) other children's films, namely RAILS (1970) and THE AMAZING MR.
