In Moscow, priest Owen (Vincent Gallo) hires a team to lead him in the underworld to find his friend Sergei (Rade Serbedzija), who has disappeared when exploring legends concerning the existence of demons and the entrance to hell in the city. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD based on Val Kilmer's name and interesting pictures. I'm completely disappointed because this movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I do not understand how Val Kilmer started to participate in this production. There are two disgraceful reviews of the film in IMDbis and they are usually counterfeit, written by users only with one review on this site. This boring and terrible movie can be seen in two ways: my husband and I used it a few times because of the monotony of the meaningless story and we used the DVD rewind button to repeat every missing scene. The right way should have been to use a speed delay or stop button to quit this quicker. My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cidade Sombria" ("Dark City")
