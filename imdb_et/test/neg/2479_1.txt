Really, really ... What the audience like (American!) In such a so-called show is completely out of me. What you can learn from these series: <br /> <br /> 1. Each casino spends around $ 2-3 billion a year to rent a satellite and a huge number of high-tech high definition cameras for their security team. Let the FBI bite their dust. <br /> <br /> 2. Every security worker must have natural natural breasts. Tits must be shown all the time, otherwise they will lose their job. <br /> <br /> 3. When the worker is a man, he must implant the breasts, then go to step 2. <br /> <br /> 4. Only in Hollywood can the idea of ​​other exhibitions be bluntly cut off, then applied under your own name and called "original" and "art". <br /> <br /> 5. Every security with more than 39D tits is considered immortal and cannot die. <br /> <br /> I really would like to have a chance to vote with minus values. -10/10 for that!
