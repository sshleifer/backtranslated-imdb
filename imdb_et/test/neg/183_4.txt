One who fights with monsters can take care not to become a monster. And if you look at the abyss for a long time, you will see the abyss inside you. <br /> <br /> Yes, it comes from Nietzsche's Aphorism 146 "Beyond Good and Evil". And that's what you'll find at the beginning of this movie. <br /> <br /> When you watch the whole movie, you doubt whether it was the message Ram Gopal Varma Production wanted to pass on. As the scenes grow one after another, rather violent and at times towering, the viewer should forget about Nietzsche's quotation and think differently. To deal with few people, you need dedicated people, such as Sadhu Agashe, who has the permission to kill someone, not just to write FIR (something the police do not do as we believe). <br /> <br /> When TADA was declared void and the government wanted to go to newer and even tougher laws, RGV "Satya" made the required brain surgery without blood transfusions with multiple-minded urban people whose views are important in a democratic country like India. During the year, MCOCA went over. <br /> <br /> When Daya Nayak, a specialist in real life, became a combat monster, MCOCA booked it for himself, "Aab tak Chhappan" was released. "wrong" impression among people about it. That means "you must be a monster of salvation". <br /> <br /> And people used it. No questions raised. It only praises and hopes that they will receive Sadhu Agashe in their local police station, who will solve all the problems and therefore only let milk and butter. Blood? You can ignore it. <br /> <br /> Every time Israel attacks Palestine or Lebanon, we hear voices like "India must attack Pakistan in a similar way". This movie was created for such psychopaths. If you don't give them this, they will probably die of boredom and LSD and not. <br /> <br /> So this is a passion for hatred.
