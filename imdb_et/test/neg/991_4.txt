Since all of their careers were the sparse recognition of The Beatles, it is not surprising that the monkeys will watch their film called "peculiar and creative morass" shortly after the great fiasco of the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour. Head. "Both movies are not a real story for the plot (although MMT tried to define the plot) because they are the hodge-podge of skits and fragments mixed with music and songs and extracts." Head has no no plot except for the pre-fab-4, who are trying to get rid of the "box" they have (ie "Monkees" and the type of surrounding trade), and always, always finding themselves in the box. Filled with other Vietnamese-war messages and a group of attempts to show their other talents, the film collides randomly - as well as being accused of several directors. <br /> <br /> Film, like magic, is now some fans have apologized as "a wonderful misunderstanding of symbolism and artistic opinions." Phooey: Like MMT, there are too many men who have access to too many drugs, trying to do something artistic and nasty. <br /> <br /> Na on MMT, "Good" has some clever moments and offers some relatively unknown Monkees songs that are pretty decent. It develops a bit more magic than MMT, and it's a little easier to sit down, but it's not ironic that everything, like all the Monkeys, was just something Beatles did first ... even when it comes to egg installation.
