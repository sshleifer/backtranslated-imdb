There are too many things in this movie. The second reviewer comments on the inseparable, episodic nature of the film, which reflects the director's memories - it is good if it is written and executed. Instead of what we get, the straightforward narrative - part of that time - that jumps over, down and over, leaves us in some cases hanging, stopping the flow with unnecessary digressions in other cases, and otherwise just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> There are also some details that just don't work. For example, why drag a body to a city beach with daylight, not night time? Why leave your flat leaves on your body? Why did an artist who knew Joe's character for a short time decide to leave him "everything" (even if it wasn't much)? This sub-block was poorly developed to work on this point. Why is it even a man who is faulty or an artist, except for the depiction of money and free nude? Could he just be a photographer or an opera composer? How does someone rate an apartment in the Opera House - especially without a clear link to Opera? Coincidences are also both obvious and unclear and inexplicable. Why should boys take everything in store and "disappear". When Tim was a 10-year-old schoolmate in a small town like Bangor, how would Joe lose him for eight years, especially if they knew each other well enough to recommend another job. <br /> <br /> Some other sub-blocks (like Mom and her boyfriend (s) and sister who want to escape felt like padding. There are some good ideas that might have been fully developed or could have been interesting shorts, as it is done, this movie didn't make sense and offers even less.
