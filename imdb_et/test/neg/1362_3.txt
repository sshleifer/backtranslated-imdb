This movie is full of pseudo deep thought and it is amazing in its literary sense, which includes dental canned fish and some incredible dialogue. A dialogue that is skinny and deaf, how Spike is sometimes (not always) writing "certain" characters. For those of you who love jamafilms such as April and April, this is another one for you. <br /> <br /> This comment is not against Ryan Gosling, who has shown his incredible coats. The film, which proves that films are the director's medium, and when the film is rotten, it is fair to say that guilt is there and not the actors.
