I totally love the first three movies, they were great! I got the 5th part of VHS 10 years ago and I was disappointed. But maybe it was because I never saw the fourth because they were fired back. but after looking at the copy today, I have to say that it was no better than number 5. My expectations were not high at first, but it is cheap direct-video material, not even horror film, it's PG -13. The action was not convincing, the story was quite exciting and there were not many effects. But the main problem is not killing the killers or somewhat (it was a tedious boy who was killed in his car, should be highlighted, but come on.) It is surprising that both parts 4 and 5 directed by Sequel-director Jeff Burr, who gave us excellent stepfather II and Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. I liked Puppet Master: The Legacy, even if it was nothing more than respect for the best scenes of all movies. <br /> <br /> Generally, the Puppy is very similar to the Hellraiser series: a great trilogy, but forget the rest.
