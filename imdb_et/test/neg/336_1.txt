I'm proud to be able to sit around. I think if I had paid the rent I would look at it at least. I found the exception to this rule - The Planet. I don't know what the exchange rate is, but reading other comments I can only guess that the Â£ 8,000 must be around $ 150. I'll let you know, but this movie reminds me of the 50's old Steve Reeves films. He was a bodybuilder who was an actor. He was in those very horrible Italian, dubbed films that celebrated Reeves as Hercules or some other muscle-bound hero. As a child who watches them, you couldn't quite tell me why these movies were beaten - you knew they did. Mike Mitchell is the new Steve Reeves. That's it ... that was what really was the new Italian "Spaghetti sand and sandals" movie. And I'm not a boy, where was Reeves born? Glasgow, Montana. This movie is not so bad that it is fun to watch - it's just bad.
