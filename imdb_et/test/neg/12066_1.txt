WARNING! POSSIBLE POSSIBLE REFRIGERATION REQUIREMENTS IF POSSIBLE! <br /> <br /> Okay, if you haven't found the plot yet, I'll give it to you. Two pairs are driving to the campsite, but the clown's hidden killer appears and causes all kinds of chaos. Now it's time to give these couples advice. <br /> <br /> 1. Never, ever to local camps at Camp Blood. 2. Do not have sex or do it before the killer. 3. Don't go again for the killer when he runs away. 4. Do not bow to fear at the killer. 5. Make sure your mobile phone works before camping. 6. Everyone must bring a sharp or dangerous weapon and always wear it. 7. Wear loose and comfortable clothes and bring a good pair of running shoes. There are no tight and binding clothes and high heels and sandals. 8. Wear eyeglasses or contact lenses if you need them so you don't miss the lie. 9. Always carry your car keys. 10. Put the camp fire on the bed. 11. Look at your step. If you travel something, the bone breaks. 12. Check the uninvited invoice. 13. If the killer is at your corner, try at least fighting. <br /> <br /> And what do you think? At least one, but usually all four main characters interrupt all these common sense rules. They are everyday signs of the film. <br /> <br /> Now some short comments. This movie was a very tight budget. So four of the seven or eight participants play more than one role. Action, writing, direction, sound, lighting, camera operation, drawing, editing, etc. are all at the bottom of the line. But like the classic movie JACK O, it works so long, so it's fun and fun. So rent it and have fun and laugh. My rating: 5 out of 10.
