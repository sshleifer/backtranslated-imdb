This film was annoying, not because of this topic, but because of the way it was handled. An extremely overweight mother (Angela) did not even do it for videos, as most of the rest pain. It is not fair, but is a statement in itself. I also note that his picture is missing from IMDb (maybe his own choice) and it looks like it's his only movie ever? The language of this film was imperative. I looked at my 10-year-old son because it was rated PG in Canada and their language was disgraceful and disgusting. Never was Shirley Maclain rated by so many others. <br /> <br /> LOVE Kathy Bates and always. The Chinese people were annoying. <br /> <br /> Alex is a very small actor. I have to look at what else he has been lately.
