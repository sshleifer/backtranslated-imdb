Being the first to watch the scene, I realized that it was so bad that I couldn't capture it later. Superficial and artificial, frequent attempts to professionally look at a five-year-old parent who tries to sound like he knows what he's talking about. The second / second story is completely unrealistic, and almost every decision-maker made by the screenwriter was what you expect from a lower-than-average student. The overall story was equivalent and predictable as a sausage pack. Few attempts to make dialogues intelligent, limited to neurotic, excusing behavior. Ten years old may like it. But it would take five years to accept the lack of realism; How does an advanced cell function allow someone to unlock a code by touching it as if it were a magic wand, choose out of 100 voices through the ventilation system (thereby spraying Superman) and repair the home computer simply by looking for the wrong, not fault-finding? In fact, this scene is a pure example. The mistake was that one CPU was cut off by the cooling pipes (aluminum tapes) as it would be when the V8 engine exhaust pipe exploded. This is something that cannot happen and if it did, it would not prevent the computer from working. This tape has no electric current, but if it (without doing it, the autopilot's hands worked because the cells in its body were very effective), put the rip, drag it to the desktop with icons on the desktop. on-screen immediately without startup. <br /> <br /> And that's how it all goes. As if he escaped from the NSA headquarters interrogation room, illuminating a lighter result under the fire detector, resulting in open doors for the entire building. Of course, the NSA did not predict this sudden approach to escape, nor did they put any guards outside their room (or anywhere else) to protect a living and walking breakthrough in military nanotechnology. So she went out and got a cab. Such examples are not only numerous but actually there are no scenes that would make sense. <br /> <br /> The so-called "big effects" were also terrible. He kicked the basketball back in the basket and the boy was thrown horizontally 20 feet in the tree. There is no acceleration or deceleration, but constant speed and height, like a motor trolley. I am sure that when I stopped and looked for cables that held this child's position just like the cables, they probably didn't know how to completely erase them. If someone was thrown into that far tree, they would say at least (or rather, with broken fractures), but the boy was just confused and amazed. <br /> <br /> Moronic. This is the word about the entire creative decision made throughout the production. I put the director's name on my personal black list, someone who is poorly qualified cannot fix it. I feel like I would like to demand compensation for the loss of a 45-minute life to see and write about it. Although it seemed to be therapeutic, it was traumatic to understand how little it takes to approve a pilot. The only excuse that a lightly intelligent person would have had to watch on a voluntary basis would be imprisonment or lobotomy.
