**** It probably includes a spoiler **** <br /> <br /> After a successful attempt to get attention (I'm not calling you to get help before the "dead suicide attempt"), Joey discovers that she is pregnant and starts see pictures of spirits. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie was a bit slow but fun enough to watch the whole thing. There were only a few small slippers and excitement for the horror film. But halfway through it was a really scary scene (I still don't give it) :) I watched this movie because I really liked the previous movie The Eye. <br /> <br /> I was a little confused, however, to decide that, apart from the "supernatural" of "similar creators", "The Eye 2" had nothing to do with the eye, * any *; different cast, different story. Eye2 doesn't even have anything to do with the eyes: <br /> <br /> There were some questionable scenes in the movie: Joey attempts suicide 3 times (4 times when you read the time witnesses saw Joey's attempt) to jump on the train) He is involved with the brutal attacker, he speaks in the restaurant and the witnesses say he "attacks" people and he is still allowed to move his business freely, without even as much as a psychic evaluation or hospitalization (for reasons other than pregnancy). <br /> <br /> The film wasn't the biggest horror movie, this story was pretty far removed (even for a fancy movie: P), the horrors were little and / or something we haven't seen before. But it was an "interesting" story, and if you know what the "truth" behind the ghosts was, it was an interesting story about the "ghost" story. <br /> <br /> I rate movie 3 out of 10.
