I have really enjoyed many of GÃ©rard Depardieu's films and have been waiting for this movie much more than I do. The biggest reason was that I just couldn't find the movie very interesting or funny - so it wasn't in my interest. Although she did not sleep with her daughter, she thought she was lying, telling everyone she was her much older lover, is just icky! Yes, I know it's not incredible and I know someone around them doesn't know he's really his father, but I found that every child who leaves his father if his sexual parameter is too happy and prevents the movie really funny. In addition, I didn't really like this little brat. In addition to his lies, he seemed very dirty and involved. I would have preferred if she wanted her "coming" and somewhat punished, as I just didn't like her.
