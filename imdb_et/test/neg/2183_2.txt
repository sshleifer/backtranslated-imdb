"Go Fish" gave Rose Troche the right or wrong impression of a film maker with much promise. <br /> <br /> That's why it's hard to see how he can bring out a stereotypical movie related to worse sitcoms. The whole film rings. I tore the way. <br /> <br /> This should be a look at the sexuality of the nineties. Well here's not much more to learn than "In and Out". By now, most of us have actually known that there are men who are sexually minded by women and men who are sexually minded with men and even have men who are sexually minded in both sexes. <br /> <br /> This revelation has been displayed on the screen with so little spirit and style. <br /> <br /> Pathetic.
