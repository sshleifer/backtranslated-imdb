The only reason I appreciated the film as 2 is because Channing Tatum is beautiful, but the whole film has no emotions and it was boring to look at. Usually I adore good romance, but it was just a waste of time, I did not leave a tear despite the fact that it contained sad content that he simply didn't do at all. I'm not a film critic, but I just recommend that girls really avoid it, if the only reason you look at it is Channing Tatum lol seeing that the rest of the movie is garbage and if he wasn't there (not that he was acting) I was something good) I would have looked much faster. It is a disgrace because if the right actors were chosen for this film, it could have been a real teardrop. .. If you are looking for a good cry or movie girly for the night ... let this one!
