Junki, I would have given it to 0 if I had. Animation is good, but not good enough. Storyline is absolutely the most ridiculous thing I've ever met, and it says a lot! This "film" tried so hard to be interesting but failed. It is almost as if the writer had started one story, then I got another idea and tried to connect the two. Don't waste your time with it; Believe me, you're like I was labeled with myself. The only actor of the actor was James Woods and his part was at best peripheral. I want to do things that are nervous, pushing envelopes, but it just didn't cut it.
