PREY <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Mono <br /> <br /> Lesbian couple (Sally Faulkner and Glory Annan) living in a distant country The house is led by a young man (Barry Stokes), who turns out to be a stranger to the flesh, at the forefront of a massive invasion ... <br /> <br /> Despite being pushed from budget and leading by Norman J. Warren's follow-up to SATAN'S SLAVE (1976) ) goes far beyond its scarce sums, thanks to the surprisingly complex Max Cuff manuscript (probably his only writing credit): Faulkner and Annan's obsessive relationship, living in isolated glory in an English countryside (alternating with beautiful and ominous cinematography by Derek V. Browne), although Annan discovered lined clothing in an upstairs room denotes one (or both) of those around the eye love as psychologically disturbed, which may explain the absence of families who feel they have lived in the house at one time or another and "left" in mysterious circumstances. The unexpected arrival of Stokes casts doubt on the relationship, partly because Faulkner has a pathological hatred against men and partly because Annan has attracted him, creating tensions that cause a violent climate belt. There is an extraordinary multilayered queue, where Faulkner tries to helplessly "emulate" the visitor, dressing her in women's clothing, although Stokes' alien's way of thinking allows her to rise above the mockery. <br /> <br /> At least between the previous scenes, the relationship between Faulkner and Annan is depicted with rare grace and dignity, but this cordial bell-shaped contact quickly goes into popular episodes of sex and pulchrites culminating in an explosion of fear when Annan allows himself to be destroyed by Stokes after violent argument with Faulkner. Closing sequences are (quite literally) intestinal struggle, especially Annan's last scene, which seems to have been detained for censorship in 1977, and which has never been fully restored (what is still quite vivid, so!). The excellent achievements of the three leaders, backed by Warren's unobtrusive directions that take advantage of the stunning places of stunning, thus compensating for the film's budget deficits. Originally it appeared in the US as ALIEN PREY.
