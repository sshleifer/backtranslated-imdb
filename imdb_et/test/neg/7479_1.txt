He seems to be a control party. I've heard that he commented on "loss of exposure" and tell another guest who brought live animals that he had one rule - "no snakes." He has to hire a comedy writer because his jokes are flat. The only reason I look at him is that he's some big guests and bands. <br /> <br /> I looked at Craig Ferguson's exhibition for a while, but her show is even worse. She loves a bull, including ** burn time. I don't think either person has a lot of future in late night talks. <br /> <br /> Everyday, it is a tedious habit to grab your tongue with his lips. He must do it at least 10 times. I like Joe Firstman's band. Carson Daily must lighten up before it's too late.
