The first toxic film was dark, gory and Hillarious. This movie is a fun jazz battles, real gore at all and the worst poison mask I've ever seen! His deep voice is now a light, happy voice, the characters from Part 1 appear again to actors who see them like NO (Claire, mother Junko), characters change (Claire or Sara?). There is no brutal violence, dark humor and political injustice in the first film. If it were not nudity, this film would have been rated PG. Really flat. However, I'm a big fan of Part 1, but it can't be.
