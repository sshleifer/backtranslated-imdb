It turned out well and seems interesting. However, as it is going to try to create emotions between the characters it is so inept that it really gets horror off and is an insult to serious viewers. The story, based on "I walked with a zombie," is probably much better, although unfortunately it hasn't been seen yet. "Ritual" seems so exciting and can be a great film about zombies and voodoo, but in fact it has turned out to be very bad, which is a shame. It's hard to say what's wrong with it. I think there are too many intuitive scenes and it's hard to believe, for example, of Alice (named Alice Dodgson as a girl who allegedly inspired Lewis Carol to invite her heroine Alice) and her younger brother in love. There is nothing built between them and eventually they get married. Anyway, it looks good and it was worth the picture - but the film has just been so badly done. 3/10.
